40|$|A {{technique}} for {{the determination of}} the electric field at arbitrary points in the space surrounding an antenna is described. The cylindrical modal expansion formulation of the electric field can be evaluated using A. C. Ludwig's (1968) algorithm after the factorization of the integrands into slowly and rapidly changing factors. The latter is achieved by factorizing the Hankel functions in the integrands using an asymptotic approximation. The modal coefficients of an <b>E-plane</b> <b>sectoral</b> <b>horn</b> were computed from cylindrical near-field measurements at 3 GHz. Using the method described, the copolarized electric field was computed in the E-plane at distances of 1 and 10 m from the antenna. It is concluded that the method can be used successfully to compute the electric field in the radiating near field and further. Conference Pape...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{observes the}} field pattern, {{radiation}} pattern, directivity of horn antenna. In <b>E-plane</b> <b>sectoral</b> <b>horn,</b> the E-plane pattern {{is found to}} be much narrower than the H-plane because of the flaring and larger dimensions of the horn in that direction. In H-plane sectoral horn, the H-plane pattern is much narrower than the E-plane because of the flaring and larger dimensions of the horn in that direction. The pattern of a pyramidal horn is very narrow in both planes. In this case,the maximum does not occur on axis because the phase error taper at the aperture is such that the rays emanating from the different parts of the aperture toward the axis are not in phase and do not add constructively. For small aperture dimension (vertical length b 1 & horizontal length a 1) & larger horn length (ρ 1), the pattern becomes narrower & beam width also increases for increasing aperture dimension and for decreasing horn length...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 18) A 2 D Finite-Difference Time-Domain grid {{is generated}} using a MATLAB code. The absorbing {{boundary of the}} grid is modeled using a Berenger PML. An <b>E-Plane</b> <b>sectoral</b> <b>horn,</b> designed to transmit a 1 GHz signal, {{is placed in the}} grid. The fields along the aperture of the horn are computed in the time domain and transformed to the far-field. Additionally, the time domain near-fields are also computed at distances from the aperture ranging from 0. 75 D 2 /?? to 10 D 2 /??. The overall goals were two fold. The first was to characterize far-field performance of the horn using near-field analysis by transforming the near-field results to the far-field using an FFT. The second objective was to observe the local aperture fields and correlate these directly with the far-field results. Only the first goal was accomplished, and the second goal will require further investigation. This report describes several methods including how to setup up the FDTD analysis, {{as well as some of}} its shortcomings, and solutions to these shortcomings. Lastly, computed nearfield results of on-axis fields as a function of distance from the horn aperture are presented...|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} is described for creating linear array antennas that {{conform to the}} natural stacking sequence of the woodpile electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) material. Each element in the linear array consists of a woodpile EBG <b>sectoral</b> <b>horn</b> antenna. The electromagnetic confinement mechanism within each horn antenna relies wholly on the 3 -D EBG of the woodpile material. The array element has a typical <b>sectoral</b> <b>horn</b> pattern with a directional beam in one principal plane and a broader beam in the other. The bandwidth of the <b>sectoral</b> <b>horn</b> is almost {{equal to that of}} the defect EBG waveguide. Measured and theoretical results for radiation patterns, impedance bandwidth and gain of a <b>sectoral</b> <b>horn</b> antenna made from alumina are described, and theoretical results for a design made from silicon are presented. It is shown that the layer-by-layer nature of the woodpile EBG material enables <b>sectoral</b> <b>horn</b> antennas to be easily stacked together in the E-plane to create linear arrays. Analysis of the mutual coupling as a function of element separation and its effect on reflection coefficient are presented for a two-element linear array in silicon. Theoretical analyses for fixed and scanned beam linear arrays of silicon woodpile EBG <b>sectoral</b> <b>horns</b> are described and finite-difference time-domain results are compared with array theory. The fixed beam arrays are designed for high directivity while the scanned beam array enables wide angle beam steering through the use of parasitic array elements. 12 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Performance {{evaluation}} {{is an important}} aspect {{in the study of}} microwave-absorbing material coatings. The reflectivity of the incident wave is usually taken as the performance indicator. There have been various methods to directly or indirectly measure the reflectivity, but existing methods are mostly cumbersome and require a strict testing environment. What is more, they cannot be applied to field measurement. In this paper, we propose a scheme to achieve field performance evaluation of microwave-absorbing materials, which adopts a small H-plane <b>sectoral</b> <b>horn</b> antenna as the testing probe and a small microwave reflectometer as the indicator. When the size of the H-plane <b>sectoral</b> <b>horn</b> antenna is specially designed, the field distribution at the antenna aperture can be approximated as a plane wave similar to the far field of the microwave emitted by a radar unit. Therefore, the reflectivity can be obtained by a near-field measurement. We conducted experiments on a kind of ferrite-based microwave-absorbing material at X band (8. 2 – 12. 4 GHz) to validate the scheme. The experimental results show that the reflectivity is in agreement with the reference data measured by the conventional method as a whole...|$|R

From numerical results, obtained with a home-made Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) code, it is shown that the structures with defects present a directive beam in the stop-bands of the corresponding structures without defects.
