The principal tool of financial analysis is the financial ratio analysis. Financial ratios reflect company's ability to raise external financing {{and the cost of}} external financing. In the present work detailed System Dynamics (SD) modeling and {{analysis of}} the financial performance of a local <b>integrated</b> <b>steel</b> plant is <b>undertaken.</b> The key financial ratios taken up for simulation and analysis are (i) Liquidity ratios (ii) Turnover ratios and (iii) Profitability ratios over a period of 20 years from 1994. SD model has been successfully applied to portray the dynamic behaviour of the financial system of the plant...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. <b>integrated</b> <b>steel</b> {{industry}} has been very successful in securing import protection over the last 20 years. Critical to that success has been a cohesive coalition of steel producers, the steelworkers' union and 'steel-town' congressional representatives. The political strength of this coalition has diminished substantially {{over the last decade}} as the <b>integrated</b> <b>steel</b> {{industry has}} restructured and as domestic minimills have played an increasingly important role in the U. S. steel sector. In addition, an effective domestic coalition of steel-using industries acted as a critical counterweight beginning with the fight over a VRA extension in 1989. After 1989, quotas on steel were non-binding and the industry was largely unsuccessful in obtaining antidumping duties in its 1993 unfair trade petitions.

Bhutto sought to develop and alleviate the Soviet-Pak Relations, as the Soviet Union established Pakistan Steel Mills in 1972. The foundation stone for this gigantic project was laid on 30 December 1973 by the then Prime minister Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Facing inexperience for the erection work of the <b>integrated</b> <b>steel</b> mill, Bhutto requested Soviet Union to send its experts.
