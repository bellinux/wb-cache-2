5|$|To {{appeal to}} Degrassi's {{established}} audience, {{a number of}} references to events which occurred in Degrassi Junior High, Degrassi High and School's Out were written into the episode. Throughout those two series, Joey would frequently wear a fedora which became that character's trademark prop. The fedora made a reappearance in this episode, and was worn by Manny, Spike, Snake, Caitlin and Lucy, but not Joey, and it appeared in every scene which featured a character from the old series. The accident in School's Out when Wheels hit Lucy while <b>drink-driving</b> was discussed twice, first at the bar when the characters were discussing their lives, and a second time when Wheels came to the reunion to apologize to Lucy. Finally, Joey and Caitlin made amends; their relationship had ended when he cheated on her with Tessa in School's Out.|$|E
5|$|Gui {{returned}} to China in 1999 {{and started a}} daughter company in Ningbo for a Swedish company known in Chinese as Tangyou (唐友), offering air purification products. Gui {{was involved in a}} <b>drink-driving</b> incident in Ningbo in December 2003 in which a 23-year-old girl was killed while crossing the road. The victim's mother disagreed with the police investigation report that her daughter should bear secondary responsibility for not paying attention to traffic, since she had heard from witnesses that the car had been speeding, so she risked her life to experiment on herself {{with the help of her}} son and a driver for 10 days, demonstrating that the driving speed had to exceed 110 km/h for the accident to occur. She appealed to the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, which upon reexamination concluded that Gui should bear full responsibility for the incident in May 2004. Her experiment was widely reported in the Chinese media. The victim's parents later filed a civil lawsuit against Gui for compensation. The Ningbo Municipal Intermediate People's Court ruled the following August that Gui had committed a crime, for which Gui received a two-year suspended jail term. He then departed for Germany, thus violated his probation terms. In 2004, after leaving China, he worked for a German affiliate of Nordpool Consulting.|$|E

On Monday 29 March, former Broncos player and recruitment agent Allan Langer was caught <b>drink-driving</b> in Brisbane's northside.|$|E
25|$|For 2006, he {{returned}} to play for Gloucestershire in the County Championship and Victoria in the Pura Cup. He signed to play for Derbyshire in 2007, but did not play a full season as his clearance to play as an English-qualified player was not received from the Home Office. Approval was delayed {{as a result of}} a <b>drink-driving</b> conviction, a decision which upset Derbyshire chief executive John Sears. Derbyshire allowed Harvey to play for Middleton Cricket Club for a weekend as a temporary replacement for their professional.|$|E
25|$|As Minister of Transport (23 December 1965 – 6 April 1968), she {{introduced}} the breathalyser {{to combat the}} then recently acknowledged crisis of <b>drink-driving,</b> and also made permanent the 70mph speed limit. She presided over the closure of approximately 2,050 miles of railways as she enacted her part of the Beeching cuts—a betrayal of pre-election commitments by the Labour party to halt the proposals. Nevertheless, she refused closure of several lines, one example being the Looe Valley Line in Cornwall, and introduced the first Government rail subsidies for socially necessary but unprofitable railways in the Transport Act 1968.|$|E
25|$|Best was {{diagnosed}} with severe liver damage in March 2000. His liver {{was said to be}} functioning at only 20%. In 2001, he was admitted to hospital with pneumonia. In August 2002, he had a successful liver transplant at King's College Hospital in London. He haemorrhaged so badly during the operation that he nearly died. The transplant was performed at public expense on the NHS, a decision which was controversial due to Best's alcoholism. The controversy was reignited in 2003 when he was spotted openly drinking white wine spritzers. On 2 February 2004, Best was convicted of another <b>drink-driving</b> offence and banned from driving for 20 months.|$|E
25|$|Although Angie {{tries to}} stop drinking, her {{attempts}} always fail dismally {{and by the}} end of the year she is arrested for <b>drink-driving</b> when she crashes Den's car on the way home from a darts match. In episodes broadcast in 1986, Den's mistress, Jan, starts to frequent The Queen Vic. The physical arrival of Jan sends Angie's marriage into further decline as she is unable to contain her jealousy and anger. Angie becomes so depressed that she takes a near lethal cocktail of booze and pills in an attempted suicide. By chance, Den returns home early following an argument with Jan, discovers Angie and rushes her to the hospital where she has her stomach pumped. Angie recovers, but is left shaken when she discovers how close to death she actually came. Upon recovering, Angie decides to play Den at his own game and so she begins another affair with Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson). Den is furious when he discovers them in bed together, but his rage is short-lived as he has more pressing things on his mind, such as the birth of his illegitimate daughter, Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry). Angie's affair with Andy only lasts a month, ending when Andy reunites with his ex-girlfriend Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton). Andy dies in a road accident shortly afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey {{received}} extensive negative {{media coverage}} since its inception. The BBC were heavily criticized for hiring Lohan despite her then recent widely publicized <b>drink-driving</b> conviction and [...] "party lifestyle". BBC said they chose Lohan to attract {{an audience that}} might otherwise not watch. Indian non-governmental organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, criticized Lohan for a Twitter post where she appeared {{to take credit for}} one of their raids, something BBC said was a misinterpretation. The media coverage did not translate to high ratings. In its original broadcast on BBC Three on 1 April 2010, it was viewed by 224,000 households, a 0.9% share of the audience. Critics complimented the documentary for being well researched and compelling, but found Lohan's presence to be odd and distracting.|$|E
500|$|Bei Ling, a {{personal}} friend of Gui and president of Independent Chinese PEN, said that Gui had not given himself up voluntarily but had in fact been abducted. He confirmed that there had indeed been a <b>drink-driving</b> case involving Gui in which a young woman was killed but that the accident and his disappearance were unrelated. Bei asserted {{that there was no}} official record of Gui's departure from Thailand, and that international law had been violated by Gui's kidnapping. He speculated that the abductors had returned to Gui's apartment to retrieve his passport, and that Gui may have been sent to China from Cambodia on a plane loaded with Chinese deportees. Gui's daughter Angela had been notified of her father's disappearance in an email from Lee Bo dated 10 November in which Lee said he feared Gui had been taken to China [...] "for political reasons". Angela dismissed the assertion that her father had returned to the mainland voluntarily.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 22 December 2014, Carlisle {{was hit by a}} lorry on the A64 near Bishopthorpe, North Yorkshire, and was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary having {{suffered}} cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee. He had surgery soon after and his wife reported that he was [...] "very poorly" [...] but [...] "alive and stable". Burnley and Liverpool supporters performed a minute's applause in support of Carlisle starting in the fifth minute of their match on 26 December 2014, in reference to Carlisle wearing the number five shirt for Burnley. On 30 December 2014, it was announced that Carlisle was charged with a <b>drink-driving</b> offence on 20 December 2014. He appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on 20 January 2015. In February 2015, after leaving hospital, Carlisle said that he had been trying to kill himself when he was hit by the lorry in December 2014.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2004, Noll {{was caught}} <b>drink-driving</b> {{in his home}} town of Condobolin. He {{promptly}} admitted {{that it was a}} [...] "stupid mistake." [...] On 5 April 2005, Noll pleaded guilty in court to driving with a blood alcohol reading of 0.11. The magistrate disqualified him from driving for nine months, fined him $1,000 and ordered him to pay court costs.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1980, {{the trend}} has been toward greater {{restrictions}} on alcohol and drug use. The focus this time, however, has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol, rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright. New York was {{the first state to}} enact tough <b>drink-driving</b> laws in 1980; since then all other states have followed suit. [...] A [...] "Just Say No to Drugs" [...] movement replaced the more libertine ethos of the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, the BBC apologised unreservedly {{and paid}} £250 in {{compensation}} to a Somerset parish council, after Clarkson damaged a 30-year-old horse-chestnut tree by driving into it {{to test the}} strength of a Toyota Hilux. In December 2006, the BBC complaints department upheld the complaint of four Top Gear viewers that Clarkson had used the phrase [...] "ginger beer" [...] (rhyming slang for [...] "queer") in a derogatory manner, when Clarkson picked up on and agreed with an audience member's description of the Daihatsu Copen as being a bit [...] "gay". The [...] was criticised by the BBC Trust for glamorising drink driving in a scene showing Clarkson and James May in a vehicle, despite Clarkson saying to the camera [...] "And please do not write to us about drinking and driving, because I am not driving I am sailing" [...] (as they were on top of international, frozen waters). They stated the scene [...] "was not editorially justified" [...] despite occurring outside the jurisdiction of any <b>drink-driving</b> laws.|$|E
