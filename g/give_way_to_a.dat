25|$|Some days in {{the winter}} and spring can be warm and {{extremely}} dry, with Chinook winds often raising temperatures to near 70°F (21°C) in January and February, and sometimes to near 90°F (32°C) in April. Windsor's elevation and low year-round humidity means that nighttime low temperatures are practically never above 68°F (20°C), even in the very hottest part of the summer. The diurnal temperature range is usually rather wide, with a 50-degree (Fahrenheit) difference between daytime high and nighttime low not uncommon, especially in the spring and fall months. Rapid fluctuation in temperature is also common – a sunny 80°F (27°C) October afternoon can easily <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 28°F (-2°C) blizzard within 12 hours.|$|E
25|$|Planning and {{architecture}} {{went through a}} paradigm shift {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. The industrialised cities of the 19th century had grown at a tremendous rate, with the pace and style of building largely dictated by private business concerns. The evils of urban life for the working poor were becoming increasingly evident as a matter for public concern. The laissez-faire style of government management of the economy, in fashion for most of the Victorian era, was starting to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> New Liberalism that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged. Around 1900, theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the industrial age, by providing citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects on}} the Interior of British Columbia when a Chinook is in effect are the reverse. In a rainy spell, most of the heavy {{moisture}} will be soaked out by the ramparts of mountains before the air mass reaches the Fraser Canyon and the Thompson River-Okanagan area. The effects {{are similar to those}} of an Alberta Chinook, though not to the same extreme, in part because the Okanagan is relatively warmer than the Prairies, and because of the additional number of precipitation-catching mountain ranges between Kelowna and Calgary. When the Chinook brings snow to the coast during a period of coastal cold, bright but chilly weather in the interior will <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slushy melting of snow, more due to the warm spell than because of rain.|$|E

25|$|Family {{folklore}} is {{the branch}} of folkloristics concerned with the study and use of folklore and traditional culture transmitted within a family group. This includes items of material culture, crafts produced by family members or memorabilia saved as reminders or remainders of significant family events. It also includes family photos and photo albums in paper and electronic format, along with bundles of other pages held for posterity: certificates, letters, journals, notes and shopping lists. Family stories and sayings, originally recounting actual events, are told and retold until the historical facts <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> distilled expression of common identity. Family customs are performed, modified, forgotten, created or resurrected with alarming frequency; each time {{with the goal of}} defining and solidifying the perception of this family as unique, distinct and different from other families.|$|E
25|$|The Gothic {{style of}} figure {{painting}} began to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more naturalistic style {{in which the}} figures seem more three-dimensional and portrait-like. An important source at this time was German wood engravings and etchings. These were available {{in a number of}} forms. Bibles and Bible picture books were available with several different series of such engravings. The works of Albrecht Dürer were much admired. One of the advantages of using engravings as a source was that the essentially linear techniques that were employed by the engraver to define forms could be easily interpreted in lead and the fine linear treatment of shadows was likewise easy for the stained glass artist to achieve using the monochrome paint technique. There were also windows imported into England at this time from the studios of Mayer of Munich which influenced English designers towards this style.|$|E
25|$|As {{red wine}} ages, the harsh tannins of its youth {{gradually}} <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> softer mouthfeel. An inky dark color will eventually lose its depth {{of color and}} begin to appear orange at the edges, and then later eventually turning brown. These changes occur due to the complex chemical reactions of the phenolic compounds of the wine. In processes that begin during fermentation and continue after bottling, these compounds bind together and aggregate. Eventually these particles reach a certain size where they are too large to stay suspended in the solution and precipitate out. The presence of visible sediment in a bottle will usually indicate a mature wine. The resulting wine, with this loss of tannins and pigment, will have a paler color and taste softer, less astringent. The sediment, while harmless, can have an unpleasant taste and is often separated from the wine by decanting.|$|E

25|$|In early February 2013, former Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon {{launched}} an Independent Task Force on Human Rights {{in order to}} firm up on the protection of individual rights. The 13-member committee of volunteers was formed after extensive consultations with civil society groups and the Speaker of Parliament, Mohamed Osman Jawari. Chaired by prominent human rights attorney Maryam Yusuf Sheikh Ali, one of four women on the panel, the Task Force includes an educator, a peace activist, leaders of Somali women's organizations, senior police officers, a humanitarian campaigner, a religious leader, and a media representative. It is tasked with investigating allegations {{of human rights abuses}} and journalist intimidation. At the end of its three-month mandate, the committee is scheduled to publish a report on its findings and recommended courses of action. The Task Force will eventually <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> permanent parliamentary Human Rights Commission, which will have the capacity to investigate allegations over a longer period.|$|E
25|$|Traditional cycle lanes {{increase}} vehicle/bicycle collisions. When exiting, a motorist {{must look}} ahead to avoid colliding with another vehicle or with pedestrians on a crosswalk. As the intersection curves away from the exit, the path of an exiting vehicle is relatively straight, and so the motorist may often not slow substantially. To <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cyclist on the outside, requires the exiting motorist to look toward the rear, to the perimeter. Other vehicles can obstruct the driver's view in this direction, complicating the motorist's task. The more frequent requirements for motorists to slow or stop reduce traffic flow. A 1992 {{study found that the}} risk to cyclists is high in all such intersections, but much higher when the junction has a marked bicycle lane or sidepath around its perimeter. Cycle lanes were installed at St. John's roundabout in Newbury, Berkshire, England and at Museum Road, Portsmouth, England. The cycle lanes at Museum Road were replaced by a narrowed carriageway to encourage lane sharing, while the St. John's roundabout retains perimeter cycle lanes.|$|E
25|$|Just as revenge {{gives way}} to a desire for power, so too does {{national}} political conflict <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> petty interfamily feud. For example, the play opens {{in the aftermath of}} the First Battle of St Albans (1455), and immediately dramatises the agreement between Henry and York that the House of Lancaster will cede the throne to the House of York upon Henry's death. However, in reality, this agreement was brought about not by the First Battle of St Albans but by the Battle of Northampton in 1460, which Shakespeare chose not to dramatise. Furthermore, the legal settlement whereby Henry agreed to relinquish the crown to the House of York upon his death came about due to lengthy parliamentary debate, not a personal agreement between Henry and York, as it is depicted in the play. As such, a wide-ranging political debate spanning five years, and involving virtually every peer in the country is telescoped in the play to an immediate agreement between two men, thus illustrating the personal nature of the conflict.|$|E
