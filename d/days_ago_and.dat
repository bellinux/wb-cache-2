5|$|As {{they reach}} the lobby, Denham and Shaw return, {{revealing}} the Thanksgiving court date as a ruse. Denham notes the missing car and Shaw's safe and, for violating his bail by not declaring the latter, has him remanded back into federal custody until his real court date. Denham and the FBI arrest Josh and the crew (except Slide) as they walk outside the Tower. Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three <b>days</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> is acting as Josh's attorney. She shows them Shaw's ledger and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyone's freedom. The FBI accepts {{on the condition that}} Josh, being the primary conspirator, must serve a minimal two-year sentence, but Denham lowers it to 16 months to make sure Josh gets out for good behavior. Shaw is convicted and sentenced to prison {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

The crew also installed the control and power assemblies in the hatch leading into the MPLM. On the next day, the controllers were used to drive the bolts to release the MPLM from Node 2.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARYIsolated {{pancreatic}} injury due {{to blunt}} abdominal trauma is rare {{and may be}} clinically difficult to diagnose. Parenchymal injuries may not be recognized during initial evaluation. We report {{the case of a}} 30 -year-old male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with the complaint of persistent abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. His medical history revealed that he fell from a height of approximately 1. 5 meters 1 <b>day</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> hit an iron block. He was presented and discharged from another hospital ED. Contrast enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) of the abdomen was ordered during his second presentation and revealed pancreatic parenchymal contusion, laceration, and transection at the tail of pancreas. Our findings suggest that, when there is high index of suspicion for pancreatic injury, a CECT should always be ordered...|$|R
