50|$|The {{plastic and}} metal coffee {{capsules}} typically {{are used in}} a non-removable receptacle on the brewing device. The capsules have an outer ring or rim that stays dry during use, allowing for removal and disposal after use without getting the user's hands wet or sticky. Handling of a used moist coffee pod is not necessary if the brewing device has a removable <b>filter</b> <b>tray.</b> This tray is removed after brewing and inverted to eject the used coffee pod.|$|E
5000|$|The 200 mm 1.8 USM lens, {{introduced}} in November 1988, {{is the fastest}} 200mm ever produced. It is a large off-white lens with rear drop-in <b>filter</b> <b>tray.</b> Production was discontinued in 2004. Its total production run was 8,000 with serial numbers from 11,000 to 17,999 inclusive. (Math or data error). It featured an unusual [...] "focus by wire" [...] system where the focus ring drove the motor when focusing in manual mode. This functionality was shared with only one other lens, the 1200 mm 5.6 USM lens from Canon. The lens {{was used in the}} SuperWASP extrasolar planet search.|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for detecting}} multiple spectral bands, individually or concurrently, using linear detector arrays is described. The system employs a beamsplitter {{to divide the}} optical source into two or more optical beams which are directed at the linear detector arrays. <b>Filter</b> <b>trays</b> are positioned in the focal planes of the optical beams so that the beams pass through the <b>filter</b> <b>trays</b> prior to impinging upon the detector arrays. Multiple filters are placed on the <b>filter</b> <b>trays.</b> Linear actuators positioned adjacent the <b>filter</b> <b>trays</b> translate the trays across the focal planes of the optical beams so that individual filters are positioned {{in the path of}} beams such that those frequencies of the beams that fall within the spectral ranges of the individual bandpass filter through which it passes may be detected by the detector arrays for further examination and analysis...|$|R
50|$|If {{condensate}} {{water is}} handled automatically, most dehumidifiers require very little maintenance. Because {{of the volume}} of airflow through the appliance, dust buildup needs to be removed so it does not impede airflow; many designs feature removable and washable air <b>filters.</b> Condensate collection <b>trays</b> and containers may need occasional cleaning to remove debris buildup and prevent clogging of drainage passages, which can cause water leakage and overflow.|$|R
30|$|Commercial {{variety of}} maize (Zea mays L., Huidan No. 4) {{was used in}} the present experiments. Like {{numerous}} previous researchers, NaHS was used as a donor for H 2 S, when NaHS is dissolved in water, HS- is released and forms H 2 S with H+ (Wang, 2012). The seeds were sterilized in 0.1 % HgCl 2 for 10  min, and pre-soaked in distilled water for 12  h for imbibition. The soaked seeds were sowed on six layers of wetted <b>filter</b> papers in <b>trays</b> (24  cm[*]×[*] 16  cm, approximately 300 seeds per tray) with covers and germinated at 26 °C in the dark for 2.5 d. After germination, the seedlings with unanimous growth were irrigated with 100  ml of 0 (control), 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2  mM sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) (the pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.0 with 1  M HCl), a hydrogen sulfide donor (Lisjak et al., 2013; Wang, 2012; García-Mata and Lamattina, 2013) for 6  h (pretreatment with NaHS had no significant effect on the growth of seedlings). Afterward, NaHS-treated seedlings in trays with covers were exposed to high temperature at 47 °C in the dark (70 % RH) for 15  h for heat stress. At the end of heat stress, electrolyte leakage of roots, MDA content in coleoptiles and survival percentage (%) were assayed, respectively, according to our previous methods (Li et al., 2012 b). One cm root tips of seedlings were cut off and the percentage of electrolyte leakage from the tips was measured with a conductometer. In addition, the level of lipid peroxidation in coleoptiles of the seedlings was measured in terms of MDA content determined by thiobarbituric acid reaction. Electrolyte leakage and MDA content were expressed as %, and nmol g- 1 FW, respectively.|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} study is first presented then the practical experiments are described. The theoretical chapter {{provides an overview}} of filtration mechanisms and available gas cleaning technologies, with an emphasis on hot gas and cake filtration. The experimental chapters describe the setup and testing of the <b>filter</b> <b>tray</b> test rig and the L 10 - 56 test rig. 				The <b>filter</b> <b>tray</b> test rig was built, instrumentation was installed and programming performed. Puff-back calibration and heating tests were performed. The puff-back calibration showed that a significantly lower delta p minimum was obtained with this design compared to previous designs. Filtration tests were conducted at an elevated temperature (120 C) with different dust concentrations (1 and 3 g/m 3) and filtration velocities (10 - 20 cm/s). The results showed that the rig was working in accordance with the design criteria, with a filtration efficiency above 99, 5 %. 		A previously used filter test rig, the L 10 - 56 test rig, was installed at the slipstream of the exhaust of a oil sand extraction pilot plant at 350 &# 8304;C. A horizontal bed unit (HBU) was also developed to investigate the impacts of the exhaust gas on the granular filter media. Once completed, the rig was re-tested and the puff-back calibration and heating tests that were performed achieved results corresponding with the previous testis performed on this test rig. The test rig was ready to start filtration tests but they were not initiated due to time limitations and unpredicted halt of the oil sand extraction pilot plant...|$|E
40|$|The panel {{bed filter}} (PBF) is a {{granular}} filter patented by A. M. Squires {{in the late}} sixties. PBFs consist of louvers with stationary, granular beds. Dust is deposited in the top layers and on the bed surface when gas flows through. PBFs are resistant to high temperatures, variations in the gas flow and hot particles. The filter is cleaned by releasing a pressure pulse {{in the opposite direction}} of the bulk flow (a puff back pulse). A new louver geometry patented by A. M. Squires is the <b>filter</b> <b>tray</b> louvers. The new design is believed to reduce the pressure drop and the number of louvers, and to make the filter more compact. We have designed and built a laboratory scale PBF with <b>filter</b> <b>tray</b> louvers based on the patent. Experiments with the prototype show that the new louver can be cleaned with a puff back pulse. A PBF system for a hypothetical biomass combustion plant has been designed. The heat from the flue gas will be used for district heating. The proposed PBF system design consists of double-sided modules with 46 <b>filter</b> <b>tray</b> louvers on top of each other. Five modules are mounted together in module columns, sharing the same clean gas duct and puff back pipe. The granular medium chosen is Sintered Bauxite 20 / 40 (SB). The module columns are placed in an enveloping house. SB and dust fall into bins {{in the bottom of the}} enveloping house during puff back cleaning. A vacuum pneumatic conveying system brings the dust and SB to the top of the filter. Dust and SB are separated in a sieve. Dust is deposited, and SB is transported back to the modules. NTNU is currently involved in the BioSOFC project. The objective of this project is to increase efficiency in energy production from biomass by using producer gas from a biomass gasification plant in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell. Field tests will be performed at a plant in Güssing, Austria. A PBF will be used for gas filtration. The operating temperature will be 500 °C to avoid tar condensation. We have performed heating experiments on the BioSOFC filter system. The results were not satisfactory, as the temperature in the filter ranged from 384 to 625 °C. The filter system was due to be shipped, and new tests could not be performed. This work proposes that modifications to the heating cable circuits are made, and new heating tests are performed before the field testing. </p...|$|E
40|$|Particulate matter removal at high {{temperatures}} {{has gained a}} great attention {{in the last years}} due to the vast growing of power production plants around the world. A reliable and robust gas cleaning method is inherently necessary to facilitate efficient fuel to energy conversion while protecting all the downstream equipments in a plant. In accordance with the current demand, a detail study has been conducted on panel bed filter which exhibits the suitable characteristic for high temperature applications. The thesis focuses on four main parts related to the  design evaluation, experimental verification and development of new apparatus and method for regeneration  in a panel bed filter. The four main parts are as following; 1. Testing of an advanced new louver design, “ <b>filter</b> <b>tray</b> ” at room and elevated temperature 2. Development of a new apparatus and method  for puff-back cleaning 3. Testing of “filter tray” with the new puff-back apparatus and 4. Industrial scale panel bed filter testing in a commercial combustion plant. A very first laboratory scale panel bed filter with <b>filter</b> <b>tray</b> louvers was built and tested at room temperature. Tests were performed mainly at higher filtration velocities (7 – 31 cm/s) with sintered bauxite spherical particles (mean diameter of 710 m) as filtration medium with standardized test dust (mean diameter of 9 m). The filter demonstrated excellent results at filtration velocity of 30 cm/s however unstable residual pressure drop profile and high dust penetration were recorded, suggesting the depth of the granular beds are too shallow. A second laboratory scale panel-bed filter with <b>filter</b> <b>tray</b> louvers with deeper granular beds, i. e. 40 mm was built. The gas-entry surfaces are much larger than the first test rig. Tests were performed from low to high filtration velocities with sintered bauxite spherical particles (mean diameter of 470 & 710 m) and olivine sand particles (mean diameter of 545 m) as filtration medium and standardized test dust (mean diameter of 4 & 9 m) as test dust at room temperature and at 120 °C. The filter illustrated excellent results however failure in the conventional puff-back method to supply sufficient sharp pressure pulse led to improper removal of filter cake. Accordingly, {{there is a need for}} an improved means of supplying puff-back gas to the tall wide panel beds. A novel high speed valve, a new method and apparatus for creating a longitudinally disposed sharp puff of gas for renewal of gas-entry surfaces was built and tested independently. The quick opening valve consists of a standard cylinder with air outlet holes, a rod with nylon plugs and an actuator. The valve was built in the laboratory; several adjustments were made along the test until the time for emptying of the pressure in the tank was less than 50 ms. It was then integrated with the second test rig, referred to as third  test rig. Tests were performed at room temperature with the aid of high-speed camera to obtain visualization of the movement of the granular beds during puff-back with and without the presence of filter cake. Filtration test were performed at elevated temperature of 120 °C. Tests were performed from low to high filtration velocities with sintered bauxite spherical particles (mean diameter of 470 µm) and olivine sand particles (mean diameter of 545 m) as filtration medium and standardized test dust (mean diameter of 4 m). The results and video file analysis revealed that the new puff-back method is capable of removing the entire filter cake, resulting in stable residual pressure profile and very low dust penetration compared to the conventional puff-back. An industrial scale panel bed filter testing is the fourth test rig. The field test was performed with a single filter module of louver design L 10 - 56 at a 450 -kW biomass combustion plant at Bjertnæs Sag AS in Jevnaker in Norway. The test was performed with a slip stream from the main stream of exhaust gas before emitting to the chimney. The test was performed at superficial velocity between 5. 4 - 6. 9 cm/s with total flow rate of 290 - 370 m 3 /h at 120 °C with inlet dust concentration between 1. 4 to 1. 8 g/m 3. Olivine sand particles with mean diameter of 545 m were used as filtration medium. The results showed filter cakes are being formed on the gas-entry surfaces and the penetration was lower than the allowed limit during the beginning of the test. Nonetheless, due to some instability caused probably by some slight variation in the louver geometry led to higher emission towards the end of the test and hence further testing was interrupted.

40|$|Galactosemia, {{caused by}} an {{hereditary}} deficiency (1) of galactose- 1 -phosphate uridyltransferase (EC 2. 7. 7. 12), can be treated easily and successfully if the condition is discovered in the newborn. Blood tests tailored to mass screening include microbiological (2, 3) and en 2 ymatic (4) assays of galactose {{as well as a}} simple spot test for {{the presence or absence of}} transferase (5). Principle of the method The latter test, originally described by BEUTLER & BALUDA (5) for liquid blood samples, has since been adapted to blood collected and dried on filter paper and is now widely used for large-scale screening. Individual tests are set up in the wells of hemagglu-tination <b>trays.</b> <b>Filter</b> paper discs of appropriate size containing dried blood are incubated with galactose- 1 -phosphate and uridine diphosphoglucose as the substrates, in the presence of EDTA, a hemolyzing agent and NADP, in buffer. When transferase is present, a sequence of secondary reactions is initiated. They are catalyzed by auxiliary enzymes also present in the blood spots: phosphoglucomutase (EC 2. 7. 5. 1), aldose 1 -epimerase (EC 5. 1. 3. 3), glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 49), and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 44); In the last two steps, NADP is reduced to NADPH. When activated with long wave ultraviolet light (365 nm) the reduced nucleotide will emit blue fluorescence. In the test, it is detected by spotting a drop of the reaction mixture on filter paper which is air dried and then inspected under UV light. Thus, lack of fluorescence will indicate absence of transferase.
