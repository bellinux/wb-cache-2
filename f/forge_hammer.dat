50|$|Historically {{the area}} was {{dominated}} by heavy industry, revolving around the local coal and iron industries. Today the industrial landscape has completely changed, and consists entirely of light industry, represented around the village in neighbouring industrial estates: Avondale Park, <b>Forge</b> <b>Hammer</b> and Springvale.|$|E
40|$|For {{production}} of components, {{which are made}} by open die forging, are used <b>forging</b> <b>hammers</b> and hydraulic presses. The project contains a dividing of machines, short description, advantages and disadvantages and using of concrete types of <b>forging</b> <b>hammers</b> and hydraulic presses in practice. Advantages of <b>forging</b> <b>hammers</b> are simple construction, high range of choice from many types and simple maintenance. Disadvantages are big shakes and danger of accident. <b>Forging</b> <b>hammers</b> can be chosen from spring, pneumatic, hydraulic and steam air types with or without acceleration. Hydraulic presses are divided into push -down presses (two and four - column presses) and pull - down presses (two and four - column presses). Advantages consist in simple operating and controlling via computer. Disadvantages are complicated construction and difficult maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{method to}} precise control {{the motion of}} basic virtual {{prototyping}} technology (VPT) is put forward in this paper. The hydraulic die <b>forging</b> <b>hammer</b> structure, work principle, and the VPT design idea are introduced. The parametric solid parts model and entire assembly model are all designed based on solidworks software. The dynamic state simulation process of hammer is carried on. The result indicated that the dynamic process parameter of hammer was gained. The dynamic state working process of hydraulic die <b>forging</b> <b>hammer</b> is precisely controlled, which provides the foundation to further realize the numerical controlled and flexible of hydraulic die <b>forging</b> <b>hammer...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{area around}} the museum {{received}} £35,000 of funding from a local property developer and the Welsh Assembly Government through the Department for Enterprise, Innovation and Networks. This money was used to improve the general landscape around the museum and provide better car parking for visitors. Although the plaque on the <b>forging</b> <b>hammer</b> {{in front of the}} museum states that it is a 'Steam Hammer', it is in fact a self-contained MASSEY 7cwt pneumatic <b>forging</b> <b>hammer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The most {{well-known}} and noticeable {{feature of the}} area is the Monmouthshire & Brecon Canal. It splits the district roughly in half: it enters the district at the Five Locks Estate, divides the Lowlands and South Pontnewydd areas into two and continues down through <b>Forge</b> <b>Hammer,</b> towards Old Cwmbran.|$|E
50|$|The process {{involved}} the melting of pig iron in an oxidising atmosphere. The metal was then allowed to cool, broken up by stamping, and washed. The granulated iron was then heated in pots in a reverberatory furnace. The resultant bloom was then drawn out under a <b>forge</b> <b>hammer</b> {{in the usual}} way.|$|E
50|$|Competing for {{firewood}} with glassmakers {{were the}} ironmasters, using continental {{technology in the}} Tudor and Stuart periods, to smelt iron from locally dug ironstone in water powered blast furnaces. The streams fed by springs on Blackdown were dammed to drive waterwheels which worked large twin bellows. Other waterwheels drove large forge hammers which converted the pig iron into wrought iron. There was a furnace north of Frith Wood and a <b>forge</b> <b>hammer</b> by Hammer Bridge at Mitchell Park.|$|E

50|$|The valley got {{its name}} in the 19th century by the <b>forging</b> <b>hammers,</b> which got {{actuated}} by danaides. At {{the same time the}} coal mining started in the Hammertal, so the valley is one of the earliest places of Ruhr mining.|$|R
50|$|The corn mill {{bought by}} Agnes Bordley in 1747 {{continued}} to grind corn, {{but at some}} stage a large brick extension was built {{on top of the}} stone building. There was some speculation that the corn mill had been moved to the new extension and a forge built on the ground floor. Evidence for this was found in 2008 when the building was converted to a private house. The head of a <b>forge</b> <b>hammer</b> was found built into the wall.|$|E

5000|$|The former <b>Forge</b> <b>Hammer</b> Inn {{adjacent}} {{to the house and}} ironworks was used by smugglers in the eighteenth century to hide contraband. The goods were landed at nearby Pitts Deep Hard and hidden in the cellars of the inn. During one raid by the coastguard the landlady was despatched to divert the coastguards while the tubs of illicit brandy were moved from their hiding place in the chimney to the safety of a nearby copse of trees. [...] "The landlady advanced upon them. Singling out one of the officers who owed her a score for...liquid refreshment, she abused him roundly for not paying his debts..." [...] When the contraband was safe, the landlady admitted the coastguard, who found nothing, and were once more abused for interfering with the business of honest citizens.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to answer the {{question}} of whether earplugs provide sufficient protection in the exposure to impulse noise generated during metalworking processes. Material and Methods: The noise generated by die <b>forging</b> <b>hammer</b> and punching machine was characterized. Using an acoustic test fixture, noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax) under 24 earplugs, foam, winged and no-roll, were measured. Octave band method was used to calculate values of LAeq under earplugs. Results: It was found that in the case of punching machine the exposure limit value of A-weighted noise exposure level, normalized to an 8 -h working day (LEX, 8 h = 94. 8 dB) of noise present at the workstation, was exceeded, while in the case of die <b>forging</b> <b>hammer</b> both the exposure limit value of this parameter (LEX, 8 h = 108. 3 dB) and the exposure limit value of peak sound pressure level (LCpeak = 148. 9 dB) were exceeded. The assessment of noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax, LAeq) under earplugs revealed that the noise attenuation can be insufficient, sufficient, or too high. Conclusions: Earplugs can be suitable hearing protection devices in metalworking processes. Of the 24 earplugs included in this study, 9 provided appropriate noise attenuation in the case of tested die <b>forging</b> <b>hammer</b> and 10 in the case of tested punching machine.

50|$|Lydbrook has a {{shop and}} Post Office, a fish and chip shop, many local {{businesses}} and pubs which include; The Jovial Colliers Inn and Bunkhouse (recently rebranded in house as The Colliers Inn), The Royal Spring Inn, The <b>Forge</b> <b>Hammer</b> Inn, Waterloo Business Park and Lydbrook Valley Garage/Autospray {{as well as}} the River Wye Lodge which replaced former The Courtfield Arms. In 2012 Lydbrook was featured on ITV and BBC news {{due to the fact that}} the centre of Lydbrook was flooded and under up to 4 ft of water. This was despite being nearly 1/2 mi away from the local River Wye which is situated at the bottom of Lydbrook. This was due to a blockage of an old culvert under the road which contains a stream and the surface drainage for the entire village.|$|E
50|$|The furnace was {{situated}} in a bend of Cedar Creek, from which it gets its name. The furnace was 15 feet (4.5 meters) high, 25-30 feet (7.5-9 m) in diameter at the base tapering to an 8 feet (2.5 m) diameter chimney at the top. It was built of limestone quarried nearby and lined with refractory brick made on site. It was fired with charcoal made from the surrounding forests. A bellows which supplied the furnace with air was powered by a 12-foot (3.5-m) wide mill race which was diverted from the creek. The mill race also powered a <b>forge</b> <b>hammer,</b> grist mill, and saw mill. A warehouse {{was built on the}} river bank, only the foundation of which remains. The overseer's house was located northeast of the furnace. A small cemetery near the site contains about a dozen graves, mostly unmarked.|$|E
50|$|Bladesmithing {{is the art}} {{of making}} knives, swords, daggers and other blades using a <b>forge,</b> <b>hammer,</b> anvil, and other smithing tools. Bladesmiths employ a variety of {{metalworking}} techniques similar to those used by blacksmiths, as well as woodworking for knife and sword handles, and often leatherworking for sheaths. Bladesmithing is an art that is thousands of years old and found in cultures as diverse as China, Japan, India, Germany, Korea, the Middle East, Spain and the British Isles. As with any art shrouded in history, there are myths and misconceptions about the process. While traditionally bladesmithing referred to the manufacture of any blade by any means, the majority of contemporary craftsmen referred to as bladesmiths are those who primarily manufacture blades by means of using a forge to shape the blade as opposed to knifemakers who form blades by use of the stock removal method, although there is some overlap between both crafts.|$|E
5000|$|Power <b>hammers</b> are {{mechanical}} <b>forging</b> <b>hammers</b> {{that use}} a non-muscular power source {{to raise the}} hammer preparatory to striking, and accelerate it onto the work being hammered.

50|$|The Tillingbourne was impounded in the 16th century into {{a hammer}} pond, {{providing}} water power for Abinger Hammer Mill, also called Abinger <b>Forge,</b> the <b>Hammer</b> <b>forge</b> or Shere forge, which worked Sussex-sourced iron. It {{has long since}} been adapted to grow watercress.|$|R
50|$|Part of the {{difference}} may be that most polygonal rifling is produced by <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> the barrel around a mandrel containing a reverse impression of the rifling. <b>Hammer</b> <b>forging</b> machines are tremendously expensive, far {{out of the reach}} of custom gunsmiths (unless they buy pre-rifled blanks), and so are generally only used for production barrels by large companies. The main advantage of a <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> process is that it can rifle, chamber, and contour a bored barrel blank in one step. First applied to rifling in Germany in 1939, <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> has remained popular in Europe, but was only later used by gunmakers in the United States. The <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> process produces large amounts of stress in the barrel that must be relieved by careful heat treatment, a process that is less necessary in a traditionally cut or button rifled barrel. Due to the potential for residual stress causing accuracy problems, precision shooters tend to avoid <b>hammer</b> <b>forged</b> barrels, and this limits them in the type of available rifling. From a practical standpoint, any accuracy issues resulting from the residual stresses of <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> are extremely unlikely to be an issue in a defense or service pistol, or a typical hunting rifle.|$|R
