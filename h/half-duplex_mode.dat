The self-interference or loop interference of the relay is unavoidably investigated for full-duplex mode.

Several relaying strategies, such as decode-forward, compress-forward and amplify-forward, have been proposed for relay channels and networks. However, the capacity for the general relay channel and network is still unknown. In this thesis, we propose several relay schemes for different relay models. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we propose novel partial decode-forward (PDF) schemes for the two-way relay channel with direct link. Different from pure decode-forward, each user divides its message into two parts and the relay decodes only one part of each. The relay then generates its codeword as a function of the two decoded parts and forwards to the two users. We propose PDF schemes for both the full- and <b>half-duplex</b> <b>modes.</b> Analysis and simulation show that if for one user, the direct link is stronger than the user-to-relay link, while for the other, the direct link is weaker, then PDF can achieve a rate region strictly larger than the time-shared region of pure decode-forward and direct transmission for both full- and <b>half-duplex</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R

50|$|Citizens' Band radio (also {{known as}} CB radio) {{is a system}} of short-distance radio {{communications}} between individuals on a selection of channels within the 27-MHz (11 m) band. In India, this frequency band extends from 26.957 MHz to 27.283 MHz. There are several different channel plans in use. Citizens' Band is distinct from the Family Radio Service, GMRS, Multi-Use Radio Service and amateur radio (Ham). In many countries CB operation {{does not require a}} license, and (unlike amateur radio) it may be used for business or personal communications. Like many other two-way radio services, any Citizens' Band channel is shared by many users. Only one station may transmit in a channel at a time; other stations must listen and wait for the shared channel to be available.

50|$|IrDA {{transceivers}} {{communicate with}} infrared pulses (samples) in a cone that extends at least 15 degrees half angle off center. The IrDA physical specifications require the lower and upper limits of irradiance such that a signal is visible {{up to one}} meter away, but a receiver is not overwhelmed with brightness when a device comes close. In practice, there are some devices on the market that do not reach one meter, while other devices may reach up to several meters. There are also devices that do not tolerate extreme closeness. The typical sweet spot for IrDA communications is from 5 to 60 cm away from a transceiver, {{in the center of}} the cone. IrDA data communications operate in <b>half-duplex</b> <b>mode</b> because while transmitting, a device’s receiver is blinded by the light of its own transmitter, and thus full-duplex communication is not feasible. The two devices that communicate simulate full-duplex communication by quickly turning the link around. The primary device controls the timing of the link, but both sides are bound to certain hard constraints and are encouraged to turn the link around as fast as possible.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We design novel partial decode-forward (PDF) {{schemes for}} the Gaussian two-way relay channel with direct link. Different from pure decode-forward, each user divides its message {{into two parts}} and the relay decodes {{only one part of}} each. The relay then generates its {{codeword}} {{as a function of the}} two decoded parts and forwards to the two users. We propose PDF schemes for both the full- and <b>half-duplex</b> <b>modes.</b> In full duplex, the scheme is based on block Markov encoding and forward joint decoding over 2 consecutive blocks. In half duplex, the transmission is divided into 4 phases, in which one user transmits during the first phase, the other during the second phase, both users transmit during the third phase and the relay transmits during the last phase. The relay decodes a part of the messages from both users at the end of phase 3 and each user decodes only at the end of phase 4. Analysis and simulation show that if for one user, the direct link is stronger than the user-to-relay link, while for the other, the direct link is weaker, then PDF can achieve a rate region strictly larger than the timeshared region of pure decode-forward and direct transmission for both full- and <b>half-duplex</b> <b>modes.</b> I...|$|R

Two different decode-and-forward protocols with three and four phases, which have a better performance than MABC under some constraints on the asymmetric model, are considered in [3].

50|$|When {{a device}} is {{operating}} in full duplex {{while the other}} one operates in half duplex, the connection works only with at a very low throughput when both devices attempt to send frames {{at the same time}}. This is because data can be sent in both directions {{at the same time in}} full-duplex mode, but only in one direction at a time in <b>half-duplex</b> <b>mode.</b> As a result, a full-duplex device may transmit data while it is receiving. However, if the other device is working in half duplex, it does not expect to receive data (because it is currently sending); therefore, it senses a collision and attempts to resend the frame it was sending. Depending on timing, the half-duplex device may sense a late collision, which it will interpret as a hard error rather than a normal consequence of CSMA/CD and may not attempt to resend the frame. On the other hand, the full-duplex device does not detect any collision and does not resend the frame, even if the other device has discarded it as corrupted by collision. Still, the full-duplex device, not expecting incoming frames to be truncated by collision detection, will report frame check sequence errors from the aborted frames the half-duplex device attempted to send. This combination of (late) collisions reported at the half-duplex end and FCS errors reported by the full-duplex end can be used as an indication that a duplex mismatch is present.|$|E

40|$|The causal {{cognitive}} interference channel (CCIC) has two sender-receiver pairs, {{in which}} the second sender obtains information from the first sender causally and assists the transmission of both senders. In this thesis, we study both the full- and <b>half-duplex</b> <b>modes.</b> In each mode, we propose two new coding schemes built successively upon one another to illustrate the impact of different coding techniques.

The second scheme, called Han-Kobayashi partial decode-forward binning (HK-PDF-binning), combines PDF-binning with Han-Kobayashi coding by further splitting rates and applying superposition coding, conditional binning and relaxed joint decoding. In both schemes, the second sender decodes {{a part of the}} message from the first sender, then uses the Gelfand-Pinsker binning technique to bin against the decoded codeword, {{in such a way that}} allows both state nullifying and forwarding.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of practical in-band full-duplex radios {{has recently been}} demonstrated experimentally. One way to leverage full-duplex in a network setting is to enable three-node full-duplex, where a full- duplex access point (AP) transmits data to one node yet simultaneously receives data from another node. Such three-node full-duplex communication however introduces inter-client interference, directly impacting the full-duplex gain. It hence {{may not always be}} beneficial to enable three-node full-duplex transmissions. In this paper, we present a distributed full-duplex medium access control (MAC) protocol that allows an AP to adaptively switch between full-duplex and <b>half-duplex</b> <b>modes.</b> We formulate a model that determines the probabilities of full-duplex and half-duplex access so as to maximize the expected network throughput. A MAC protocol is further proposed to enable the AP and clients to contend for either full-duplex or half-duplex transmissions based on their assigned probabilities in a distributed way. Our evaluation shows that, by combining the advantages of centralized probabilistic scheduling and distributed random access, our design improves the overall throughput by 2. 70 x and 1. 53 x, on average, as compared to half-duplex 802. 11 and greedy downlink-uplink client pairing...|$|R
