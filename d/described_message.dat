40|$|In Chapter 4 we brie y {{outlined}} {{some of the}} compile-time {{features of}} objectoriented programming languages. That is, we described how to create new types, new classes, and new methods. In this chapter, we continue our exploration of the mechanics of object-oriented programming by examining the dynamic features. These include how values are instantiated (or created), how they are initialized, and how they {{communicate with each other}} by means of message passing. In the rst section, we will explore the mechanics of message passing. Then we will investigate creation and initialization. By creation we mean the allocation of memory space for a new object and the binding of that space to a name. By initialization we mean not only the setting of initial values in the data area for the object, similar to the initialization of elds in a record, but also the more general process of establishing the initial conditions necessary for the manipulation of an object. The degree to which this latter task can be hidden from clients who use an object in most object-oriented languages is an important aspect of encapsulation, which we identi ed as one of the principle advantages of objectoriented techniques over other programming styles. 5. 1 Message-Passing Syntax We are using the term message passing (sometimes also called method lookup) to mean the dynamic process of asking an object to perform a speci c action. In Chapter 1 we informally <b>described</b> <b>message</b> passing and noted how a message di ers from an ordinary procedure call. In particular: A message is always given to some object, called the receiver. The action performed in response to the message is not xed, but may di er depending upon the class of the receiver. That is, di erent object...|$|E
40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study of}} the national message exchange system is aimed {{to serve as a}} partial evaluation within a local context, based on user experiences. A qualitative method based on semi-structured, open-ended interviews with clinical system users at the University Hospital of Northern-Norway and in the healthcare service of the Municipality of Tromsø, combined with informal meetings with project members and a literature review, serves as basis for the data collection. Hospital users <b>described</b> <b>message</b> use as additional work tasks, and as a rule had to rely on several methods of communication to ensure a safe and robust transfer of clinical information across health levels. The reasons for this appeared to be the need for more synchronous communication and a divide between administrative and clinical information handling in the municipalities. Message structure was in many cases conceived as confusing, and {{there seemed to be a}} lack of a proper training strategy for system use. In communication between municipal healthcare and GPs, the system was experienced as time saving and convenient due to the way it supported the asynchronous work practices. We argue that an on-going, thorough evaluation during the implementation process could have supported the work of mapping unintended consequences and dealing with them. We have identified specific aspects that we believe could have contributed to this, such as closer follow-up and monitoring of smaller municipalities, a more thorough strategy for user education and message notification in the hospital’s EPR. However, the gap between intended use and existing work practices seems too wide to be bridged by these measures. We argue that the EME system matches poorly with existing local practices in the hospital especially, and that local practices should have been taken into consideration before implementing a system on such a large scale. It is obvious that there has been a lack of user perspectives in the evaluation of the EME system up to this point, and our thesis must be seen as a contribution towards a more comprehensive system evaluation...|$|E

Provision is made for noncontiguous messages. Context control provides a convenient means of avoiding message selectivity conflicts between different phases of an application. The ability to form and manipulate process groups permits task parallelism to be exploited, and is a useful abstraction in controlling certain types of collective communication. - iii - 1.
