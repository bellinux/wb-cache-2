5|$|England reached 3/106 by stumps on {{the fourth}} day, but the final day started poorly when Compton edged the second ball of the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling {{on his back and}} {{completing}} the catch as the ball went down. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated a collapse, and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.|$|E
5|$|From its inception, the Virginia Lottery {{has sold}} instant ({{scratcher}}) games. Originally, all scratch tickets were $1 each; in the mid-1990s, the first Bingo scratcher was introduced; each Bingo ticket cost $2. Eventually, higher-priced scratchers (including $3, $5, and $10) with larger prizes were introduced. Currently, {{the most expensive}} scratchers in common circulation are $30 each. All $20 and up games currently in circulation and most $10 games offer a top prize of at least $1 million (annuitized). Winners of scratcher annuity prizes of at least $1 million can choose cash (<b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top prizes in Powerball, Mega Millions, or Cash4Life).|$|E

5|$|In {{choosing}} the SEC opponent, the Chick-fil-A Bowl selection committee {{had the right}} to select the first SEC school after the Bowl Championship Series, Cotton Bowl Classic, Capital One Bowl, and Outback Bowl made their selections. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACC, the selection committee could not select an SEC team with two fewer losses than the highest available team. After the 2009 regular season ended, SEC champion Alabama was selected for the national championship game, and SEC runner-up Florida was picked by the Sugar Bowl to fill the SEC's BCS tie-in. The Cotton Bowl selected Ole Miss, the Capital One Bowl picked LSU, and the Outback Bowl took Auburn. For its pick, the Chick-fil-A Bowl bypassed local team Georgia (No.2 in the SEC's eastern division) for Tennessee (No.3 in the division) in order to set up a game against two geographic rivals and because Tennessee had defeated Georgia in a head-to-head matchup.|$|E

5|$|In {{choosing}} the SEC opponent, the Chick-fil-A Bowl selection committee {{had the right}} to select the first SEC school after the Bowl Championship Series, Cotton Bowl Classic, Capital One Bowl, and Outback Bowl made their selections. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACC, the selection committee could not select an SEC team with two more losses than the highest available team. The bowl earned the right to select these teams via its multimillion-dollar payout system, which guarantees {{a certain amount of money}} to the participating conferences. Prior to 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No.5 team in the SEC versus the No.3 team in the ACC. After the bowl increased its payout to $2.8million per squad, it then was given the second pick from the ACC, with the Gator Bowl dropping to third.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two {{consecutive}} FA Cup finals, losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating Portsmouth in 1934.

The club won the First Division title {{for the first time in}} 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division. Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s, they lost the first one, to Newcastle United, and won the second.
