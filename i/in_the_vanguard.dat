5|$|The Duke {{eventually}} led his untrained and ill-equipped {{troops out of}} Bridgwater at around 10:00pm to undertake a night-time attack on the King's army. They were guided by Richard Godfrey, the servant of a local farmer, along the old Bristol road towards Bawdrip. With their limited cavalry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vanguard,</b> they turned south along Bradney Lane and Marsh Lane {{and came to the}} open moor with its deep and dangerous rhynes (drainage ditches).|$|E
5|$|At dinner, Lord Tywin {{tells his}} son Tyrion that Tyrion and his barbarian allies will fight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> of the army. Tyrion {{suspects}} {{his father is}} trying to get him killed. Tyrion returns to his camp and finds the prostitute Shae whom Bronn found for him at Tyrion's request. As the three of them swap stories, Tyrion reveals that, when he was 16, he married a woman named Tysha whom Jaime and he had rescued. When his father Tywin learned of this, he made Jaime confess that Tysha was actually a hired prostitute. Tywin then made Tyrion watch as Lannister guardsmen all had sex with her, each paying her one silver coin provided by Lord Tywin.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the German Army invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. The LSSAH and Das Reich were {{attached}} to separate army Panzer corps. Fritz Klingenberg, a company commander in the Das Reich, led his men across Yugoslavia to the capital, Belgrade, where a small group <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> accepted the surrender of the city on 13 April. A few days later Yugoslavia surrendered. SS police units immediately began taking hostages and carrying out reprisals, a practice that became common. In some cases, {{they were joined by}} the Wehrmacht. Similar to Poland, the war policies of the Nazis in the Balkans resulted in brutal occupation and racist mass murder. Serbia became the second country (after Estonia) declared Judenfrei (free of Jews).|$|E
50|$|Beckley {{was born}} to an American father and an English mother. He began playing the piano {{at the age of}} three and the guitar a few years later. By 1962, Beckley was playing guitar <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Vanguards,</b> an {{instrumental}} surf music band in Virginia. He spent every summer in England and soon discovered 'British invasion' music.|$|R
50|$|Established <b>in</b> 1946, <b>the</b> <b>Vanguard</b> was {{originally}} <b>the</b> newspaper of the Vanport College Extension in Vanport, Oregon, from which <b>the</b> <b>Vanguard</b> name is derived.

50|$|After Guan Yu {{was given}} orders to invade Fancheng, he {{appointed}} Shi Ren and Mi Fang as leaders of <b>the</b> <b>vanguard.</b> That night, a {{fire broke out}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vanguard's</b> camp. However, Shi and Mi were too busy feasting to notice and the fire engulfed and destroyed much of the camp. Guan condemned the two generals for lack of care and sentenced them to death, but was stopped by Fei Shi who advised Guan against executing a general before the army had truly begun to march. Guan took the advice and instead flogged them forty times each. He then called upon Guan Ping and Liao Hua to replace them as van leaders and sent the two generals away, Shi Ren to Gongnan and Mi Fang to Nanjun.|$|R
5|$|The wartime Manhattan Project left {{a legacy}} {{in the form}} of the network of {{national}} laboratories: the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory and Ames Laboratory. Two more were established by Groves soon after the war, the Brookhaven National Laboratory at Upton, New York, and the Sandia National Laboratories at Albuquerque, New Mexico. Groves allocated $72million to them for research activities in fiscal year 1946â€“1947. They would be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> of the kind of large-scale research that Alvin Weinberg, the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, would call Big Science.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significant}} examples {{of fine arts}} in Bengal from earlier times, including the terracotta art of Hindu temples and the Kalighat paintings. Bengal has been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> of modernism in fine arts. Abanindranath Tagore, called the father of modern Indian art, started the Bengal School of Art, one of whose goals was to promote the development of styles of art outside the European realist tradition that had been taught in art colleges under the British colonial administration. The movement had many adherents, including Gaganendranath Tagore, Ramkinkar Baij, Jamini Roy, and Rabindranath Tagore. After Indian Independence, important groups such as the Calcutta Group and the Society of Contemporary Artists were formed in Bengal and came to dominate the art scene in India.|$|E
5|$|In 1681, King Charles II gave Penn a {{large piece}} of his newly {{acquired}} American land holdings to repay a debt the king owed to Admiral Sir William Penn, Penn's father. This land included present-day Pennsylvania and Delaware, though the claim as written would create a bloody conflict with Maryland (dubbed Cresap's War) over the land grant already owned by Lord Baltimore. Penn put together a colonial expedition and fleet, which set out for America {{in the middle of the}} following summer. Penn, sailing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vanguard,</b> first set foot on American soil at the colony at New Castle, Delaware. An orderly change of government ensued, as was normal in an age used to the privileges and prerogatives of aristocracy and which antedated nationalism: the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new Proprietor. The first Pennsylvania General Assembly was soon held in the colony.|$|E

5|$|In October 1942 the {{battalion}} {{was sent to}} North Africa and re-designated 156th Parachute Battalion, where it became the central unit of the new 4th Parachute Brigade, formed in December. Waddy was briefly made adjutant of {{the battalion}}, but quickly moved up to the post of the 4th Brigade's Intelligence Officer. The brigade moved from Egypt to Palestine in February 1943, and to Tunisia in June where it joined the 1st Airborne Division, then commanded by Major General George Hopkinson. Waddy recalled that {{the introduction of the}} now famous maroon beret was particularly unpopular with the 156th Battalion, who had previously worn bush hats. The 4th Brigade did not take part in the Allied invasion of Sicily but on 5 September the whole Division sailed to Taranto in Italy (Operation Slapstick), successfully capturing the port with 156th Battalion and brigade HQ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vanguard.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 30 May 1916, Engadine was {{attached}} to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Trevylyan Napier, and carried two Short Type 184 and two Sopwith Baby floatplanes aboard. The two-seat Type 184s were intended for observation and were fitted with a low-power wireless while the Babys were intended to shoot down Zeppelins. Engadine accompanied the cruisers when the Battlecruiser Fleet sortied from Rosyth that evening to intercept the German High Seas Fleet. For a time on 31 May she was actually leading the BCF and may {{have been one of the}} first ships to spot the oncoming Germans. Her position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> was dictated by the requirement for smooth water to successfully launch her aircraft; turbulent water from ships' wakes was enough to ruin a take off attempt. She would also have to come to a complete stop to hoist her aircraft over the side and prepare it for launch, a process that took at least 20 minutes at anchor. Thus she could launch her floatplane in unruffled water and then fall back among the main body of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|After this, the 2/14th was {{committed}} to the advance into the Markham Valley and Finisterre Range, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> of the 21st Brigade's advance from Kaiapit to Dumpu in late September and early October. Moving through the 2/16th Battalion's position and advancing on to Marawasa, the 2/14th left the Markham Valley and proceeded into the Ramu Valley. The 2/14th then moved on the 2/16th's right flank, protecting it from any Japanese attacks that might have eventuated from the north. On 4 October 1943, the battalion reached Wampun village. It was there that the battalion's commanding officer, Honner, was seriously wounded when he moved beyond the main defensive position in order to personally carry out a reconnaissance of the surrounding area. A platoon was sent in to extricate Honner as the Japanese began advancing on his position, and after directing a company-level attack against the Japanese, Honner handed over command to Captain Ian Hamilton, commander of 'C' Company, who served as acting commander briefly until Major Mert Lee arrived from brigade headquarters. Lee remained in acting command until the battalion second-in-command, Major Philip Rhoden, returned from a staff course to officially take over command of the battalion as a lieutenant colonel in December.|$|E

5|$|Formby went to Normandy in July 1944 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> {{of a wave}} of ENSA performers. He and Beryl {{travelled}} over on a rough {{crossing to}} Arromanches giving a series of impromptu concerts to troops in improvised conditions, including {{on the backs of}} farm carts and army lorries, or in bomb-cratered fields. In one location the German front line was too close for him to perform, so he crawled into the trenches and told jokes with the troops there. He then boarded HMS Ambitious for his first scheduled concert before returning to France to continue his tour. During dinner with General Bernard Montgomery, whom he had met in North Africa, Formby was invited to visit the glider crews of 6th Airborne Division, who had been holding a series of bridges without relief for 56 days. He did so on 17 August in a one-day visit to the front line bridges, where he gave nine shows, all standing beside a sandbag wall, ready to jump into a slit trench in case of problems; much of the time his audience were in foxholes. After the four-week tour of France, Formby returned home to start work on I Didn't Do It (released in 1945), although he continued to work on ENSA concerts and tours in Britain. Between January and March 1945, shortly after the release of He Snoops to Conquer, he left on an ENSA tour that took in Burma, India and Ceylon (the latter is now Sri Lanka). The concerts in the Far East were his last for ENSA, {{and by the end of}} the war it was estimated that he had performed in front of three million service personnel.|$|E
