(parent {{companies}} Viacom and Time Warner, respectively, jointly owned Comedy Central until Time Warner {{exited the}} venture in 2003) {{to release the}} film in the United States, with Warner Bros. getting the international rights. Viacom bought all of Comedy Central in 2004, but Warner Bros. continued to distribute the film internationally.|$|E
5|$|Three first-half {{possessions}} deep in Detroit Lions territory led to zero Buccaneer points {{en route}} to another blowout loss. Lions receiver Jeff Chadwick took a 73-yard reception to the Buccaneers' 1-yard line when Rod Jones fell down while covering him. Jones also got beaten by Leonard Thompson on a <b>jump</b> <b>ball</b> in the end zone. Vito McKeever was outrun by Chadwick on the Lions' third score. James Wilder had 130 yards rushing and 71 yards receiving for the Buccaneers.|$|E
5|$|Overtime {{began with}} a <b>jump</b> <b>ball</b> that was won by Kansas' Chamberlain, who quickly passed the ball to King. King took a jump shot that missed and Carolina's Cunningham grabbed the rebound. The Tar Heels traversed the court and Bob Young managed to score a basket to give Carolina the edge. However, North Carolina was unable to stop Kansas during the ensuing drive as Chamberlain scored a basket to bring the score to 4848. After Kansas score the tying basket, North Carolina {{proceeded}} to hold the ball for one final shot before time ran out. Carolina's Kearns drove and put up a shot that was blocked by Chamberlain as time ran out.|$|E

50|$|James Naismith took {{aspects of}} many sports {{including}} rugby to invent basketball. The most obvious contribution is the <b>jump</b> <b>ball's</b> similarity to the line-out {{as well as}} the underhand shooting style that dominated {{the early years of the}} sport. Naismith played rugby at McGill University.|$|R
5|$|After a one-minute {{break between}} periods, the third {{overtime}} began with another <b>jump</b> <b>ball</b> that was won by Chamberlain. After King missed the opening {{shot of the}} period, Carolina's Kearns made a right handed layup to bring the score to 50–48. Kansas failed to score again, and this time Kearns missed his shot after being fouled, but then made both free throws. Off of a pass from Loneski, Chamberlain made a shot, was fouled, and made the ensuing free throw to complete the three-point play and bring the Jayhawks within one point. Cunningham was fouled after being trapped in a double team and then missed the first shot of the one-and-one. The Jayhawks' Loneski missed a contested, close layup, but King got the offensive rebound and was fouled on a put back shot. King made one of the free throws and tied the score at 5252.|$|E
5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense {{a chance for a}} game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the only chance for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside kick. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball high into the air to create a <b>jump</b> <b>ball</b> situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the nineteenth century, the game of {{baseball}} began to evolve from a sport played by amateurs for recreation into a more serious game played by professionals. One of the most dramatic changes was the transition of the pitcher's delivery from an underhand motion to an overhanded throw. Before the American Civil War, the pitcher's role was to initiate the action by offering an underhanded throw to the batter, in much the same way that a basketball referee offers up a <b>jump</b> <b>ball</b> to begin play. Since this type of pitching often caused the batter to hit lazy, foul pop-ups, catchers played their position approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, and wore no protective equipment.|$|E

25|$|Coin tossing is {{a simple}} and {{unbiased}} way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as {{which side of the}} field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions may tend to favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the <b>jump</b> <b>ball</b> is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, February 23, 1985 {{during a}} game at Bloomington between Purdue and Indiana, just five minutes into the game, a {{scramble}} for a loose ball resulted in a foul call on Indiana's Marty Simmons. Immediately after the resumption of play, a foul was called on Indiana's Daryl Thomas. Knight, irate, insisted {{the first of the}} two calls should have been for a <b>jump</b> <b>ball</b> and ultimately received a technical foul. Purdue's Steve Reid stepped to the free throw line to shoot the resulting free throws, but before he could, Knight grabbed a red plastic chair from Indiana's bench and threw it across the floor toward the basket in front of Reid. Knight was charged with second and third technical fouls and was ejected from the game. He apologized for his actions the next day and was given a one-game suspension and two years probation from the Big Ten. Since the incident, Knight has occasionally joked about throwing the chair by saying that he saw an old lady standing on the opposite sideline and threw her the chair so she could sit down.|$|E
500|$|The {{second half}} began with another <b>jump</b> <b>ball</b> {{between the two}} {{competing}} teams. Chamberlain won the tip as Carolina sent out Quigg to contest the jump rather than Kearns like in the first tipoff. Both teams failed to score on their first possession, but after Carolina missed their opening shot, Kansas scored on a fast-break pull-up shot. Kansas scored once more [...] from a lob to Chamberlain [...] before the Tar Heels were able to score with a baseline jump shot from Quigg to bring the score 3126. Kansas closed the lead to 31–30 with a basket {{and a pair of}} free throws from Chamberlain. Carolina's Kearns returned with an acrobatic layup to extend the lead to three points.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{measurement of}} a putting golf <b>ball</b> <b>jump</b> motion using a vision sensor. After putting, {{a golf ball}} experiences bouncing, sliding and rolling sequentially. In particular, <b>ball</b> <b>jump</b> motion contains lots of important information related to impact such as jump number, height and length. Putting is simulated as a simple pendulum and golf <b>ball</b> <b>jumps</b> are measured using a vision sensor. The golf <b>ball</b> <b>jump</b> changes significantly according to impact errors such as impact timings. If an IMU sensor is attached on the putter head and relationship between variations of golf ball trajectory and IMU sensor signal is characterized, coaching information of golf putting to correct various impact errors can be provided only using IMU sensor...|$|R
50|$|The players {{started the}} next {{practice}} with <b>jump</b> <b>balls</b> in the endzone, simulating a common Red Zone offensive play. Michael Irvin is assisted in his demonstrations and coaching by All-Pro Darren Woodson, {{who works with}} the DBs while Michael works with the WRs. The DBs dominated {{for most of the}} drills. Because of this, Michael Irvin awarded phone calls to whomever the players wanted, based on performance during the drill in an attempt to get the receivers to play harder.|$|R
50|$|The {{alternating}} possession arrow rule {{went into}} effect in college basketball in 1981. Ever since, it has been controversial. Supporters of the possession arrow believe that <b>jump</b> <b>balls</b> give the team with taller players and better leapers an unfair advantage over the other, plus the possession arrow (especially in the NCAA Tournament) gives another element of strategy. But those who oppose the possession arrow believe that it has frequently undone a trailing team's defensive effort because it is the other team's turn to get the ball.|$|R
500|$|Note that in FIBA play, if {{the shooter}} commits the violation, {{it is an}} {{automatic}} turnover. If the shot is successful and the shooter does not commit a violation, but other players do commit a violation, all violations are discarded. [...] If players from the opposing teams enter the key prior {{to the release of}} the ball, a <b>jump</b> <b>ball</b> would be done to determine who gets the possession of the ball (NBA) or the possession arrow rule (for all other levels); in FIBA play, that only applies if the shooter misses, since a successful attempt negates all other penalties. In all situations, lane violation penalties cannot occur if there are further free throws to be awarded.|$|E
500|$|Howard matriculated to the University of Michigan {{and joined}} his fellow freshmen for the 1991–92 Michigan Wolverines in forming {{a group that}} {{became known as the}} Fab Five. He also joined future NBA personalities Eric Riley and Rob Pelinka. As Michigan celebrated Midnight Madness on October 15, 1991, there was already talk that at least four of the five freshmen would be {{starting}} before the season ended. (The five eventually started in a combined 304 of a possible 350 man-games among them during their first two seasons.) Early in his freshman season, Howard started in some games and came off the bench in others for the highly rated Wolverines. Over time, he won a starting role from Riley. In Michigan's first matchup against Illinois, Howard scored 13points and denied Thomas the ball consistently enough to hold him to 8shots. His biggest contribution in the game was getting his hand on a loose ball to force a <b>jump</b> <b>ball</b> with 16seconds left and Michigan leading by only three points. [...] In the Elite Eight round of the 1992 NCAA Men's DivisionI Basketball Tournament, Michigan faced a Jimmy Jackson-led Ohio State Buckeyes team that had beaten them twice during the regular season by double-digit margins. [...] Michigan won the rematch, during which the Fab Five scored all but two of the Wolverines' points.|$|E
500|$|The {{first game}} of [...] "Basket Ball" [...] was played in December 1891. In a {{handwritten}} report, Naismith described {{the circumstances of the}} inaugural match; in contrast to modern basketball, the players played nine versus nine, handled a soccer ball, not a basketball, and instead of shooting at two hoops, the goals were a pair of peach baskets: [...] "When Mr. Stubbins brot [...] up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them {{on the inside of the}} railing of the gallery. This was about 10 feet from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put the 13 rules on the bulletin board just behind the instructor's platform, secured a soccer ball and awaited the arrival of the class... The class did not show much enthusiasm but followed my lead... I then explained what they had to do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men & tried to keep them somewhat near the rules. Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball, though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon." [...] In contrast to modern basketball, the original rules did not include what is known today as the dribble. Since the ball could only be moved up the court via a pass early players tossed the ball over their heads as they ran up court. Also following each [...] "goal" [...] a <b>jump</b> <b>ball</b> was taken in the middle of the court. Both practices are obsolete in the rules of modern basketball.|$|E

2500|$|Earlier, Cowles {{had been}} an outspoken {{opponent}} of a 1950 rule limiting a fouled player to one free-throw {{if he was not}} fouled in the act of shooting.

2500|$|In 2010, sportswriter Joe Posnanski, {{writing for}} Sports Illustrated, named Paige as the hardest thrower {{in the history}} of baseball. He based this, in part, on the fact that: [...] "Joe DiMaggio would say that Paige was the best he ever faced. Bob Feller would say that Paige was the best he ever saw. Hack Wilson would say that the ball looked like a marble when it crossed the plate. Dizzy Dean would say that Paige's fastball made his own look like a changeup." [...] Posnanski further noted that: for most of his career Satchel Paige threw nothing but fastballs. Nothing. Oh, he named them {{different}} names—Bat Dodger, Midnight Rider, Midnight Creeper, <b>Jump</b> <b>Ball,</b> Trouble Ball—but essentially they were all fastballs. And he was still unhittable {{for the better part of}} 15 years. One pitch. It's a lot like Mariano Rivera, except he wasn't doing it for one inning at a time. He was pitching complete games day after day. That had to be some kind of incredible fastball.... perhaps the most precise pitcher in baseball history—he threw ludicrously hard. And he also threw hundreds and hundreds of innings.|$|E
2500|$|The extra {{period was}} {{described}} as [...] "a cautious game of cat-and-mouse" [...] by Mal Florence of the Los Angeles Times. The opening tip of overtime was won by Rouse and controlled by Hunter. Harkness received a pass from Hunter and scored on a layup, giving the Ramblers the lead. Wilson responded with a basket for the Bearcats, before a long-distance shot by Miller restored a two-point lead for the Ramblers. Loyola later {{had an opportunity to}} extend their advantage, but missed a field goal attempt; after coming down with the rebound, Thacker made a long pass to Shingleton, and a resulting layup evened the score at 58–58. The game remained tied with under two minutes on the clock, as the Ramblers called a timeout with possession of the ball and subsequently went into a slow-paced offense themselves. Play was stopped with 1:21 remaining, as a <b>jump</b> <b>ball</b> was required to determine possession; Egan and Shingleton jumped against each other. Egan earned possession for Loyola, and the Ramblers held the ball to attempt the last shot of the overtime period. Harkness drove to the basket with about seven seconds on the clock, but elected to pass to Hunter, who attempted a shot. Hunter's effort bounced off the rim, but Rouse rebounded the ball and scored. One second was left on the clock. It expired before Cincinnati could inbound the ball, as the Ramblers won their first national championship in men's basketball, 60–58.|$|E
