5|$|A test {{session was}} held on May 17 and 18 at the Paul Ricard circuit in France, with the track {{configured}} to replicate {{the characteristics of the}} Circuit Gilles Villeneuve for the final two days after <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the style of the Monaco for the first two. Despite the fact that the McLaren team had dominated on the Monaco set up of the circuit, Ferrari were better on the Canadian set up.|$|E
5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that the detention scheme in the Migration Act did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive. The Act did not make being in Australia without a visa an offence (although <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the past), and in reality he considered the mandatory detention scheme to be not that different from {{a system in which}} all people were prevented from entering Australia without permission at all.|$|E

5|$|One {{account of}} the executions states {{that some of the}} {{condemned}} were still alive when their bodies were burned, and that the executioners borrowed a walking stick from an onlooker with which to push their victims' moving limbs back into the fire; its owner refused to take it back after <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> contact with witches.|$|E
5|$|The only ships on {{the lake}} {{following}} the American retreat from Quebec were those of a small fleet of lightly armed ships that Benedict Arnold had assembled following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. This fleet, even if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> British hands, {{was too small to}} transport the large British army to Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|While both {{hunting and}} fishing were common, the peasants mostly hunted to protect their herds and crops. Apiculture, the keeping of bees, was as highly {{developed}} in Byzantium as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Ancient Greece. Aside from agriculture, the peasants also laboured in the crafts, fiscal inventories mentioning smiths (Greek: χαλκεύς, chalkeus), tailors (Greek: ράπτης, rhaptes), and cobblers (Greek: τζαγγάριος, tzangarios).|$|E

5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} {{moved into the}} southern celestial hemisphere. The comet was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the northern hemisphere, but southerners {{were able to see}} the comet gradually fade from view {{during the second half of}} 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the comet had remained visible without aid for 569days, or about 18 and a half months. The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.|$|E
5|$|Between 1859 and 1860, Frewin Hall {{housed the}} future Edward VII whilst he {{attended}} Christ Church. The chapel and old kitchen were planned to {{form part of}} a new, third, quadrangle for Brasenose. The valuable rents that the shops {{on the south side}} of Brasenose earned the college provided the most significant reason for the delay in further expansion, which only began in 1886 when work on the west side was started. It was finally completed in 1911, the last work having been done to the High Street frontage. Frewin Hall was reconstructed between 1887 and 1896, as were the chapel and antechapel. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> 1886 that Cradock had died and was replaced by Albert Watson.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{explored}} coaching possibilities, {{but he was}} mindful not to {{put himself}} {{in a position where}} his control might be challenged as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Cleveland. In the mid-1960s, the American Football League (AFL), which had formed to compete against the NFL, put a new franchise in Cincinnati. Brown was the third-largest investor in the team and was given the title of coach and general manager. He was also given the right to represent the team in all league matters, a key element of control for Brown.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} old wool {{industry}} in Frome declined, although the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did not close until 1965. As a result, the population fell {{and in the}} 1930s it was slightly smaller than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the mid 19th century. Other industries such as printing, light engineering, metal casting, carpeting and dairying continued, many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after World War II, including the construction of council houses.|$|E
5|$|Guest {{was born}} in Grahamstown, Cape Colony. His {{grandfather}} had moved the family there, leaving Kidderminster, England, where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the printing business for three generations. He saw active service in the Second Boer War, enlisting despite being underage, {{and again in the}} First World War, when he was injured in France. His legal career began while back in Southern Rhodesia between those two wars. He won a case against Sir Charles Coghlan, at the time Premier of Southern Rhodesia, and Coghlan invited him to become a partner in his firm, which became known as Coghlan, Welsh & Guest. On his return from the First World War, Guest took responsibility for the Salisbury practice.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} election, the Referendum Party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith had been {{suffering}} from pancreatic cancer, and had been warned that competing the election would shorten his life. Goldsmith died in Benahavis, Spain on 18 July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members transformed into the Democracy Movement, a pressure group {{closely associated with the}} former Conservative supporter and multi-millionaire businessman Paul Sykes. The Eurosceptic cause was weakened, however; with Blair's firmly pro-EU government in power, by 1998 the possibility of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU was considered as distant as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> 1995.|$|E

5|$|In September 1945, {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities, the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway. Although the main line from Waterloo to Brookwood had remained in use throughout the war and was in good condition, the branch line from Brookwood into the cemetery had been almost unused since the destruction of the London terminus. With the soil of the cemetery causing the branch to deteriorate even when <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> use and regularly maintained, the branch line was in extremely poor condition.|$|E
5|$|Matches {{were played}} at the Namboole Stadium, with a {{capacity}} of 45,202. They were also to be {{played at the}} Nakivubo Stadium, which can hold 15,000 people. However, CECAFA Secretary General Nicholas Musonye decided to move the remaining group games from the Namboole Stadium since <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> bad shape due to heavy rains. It was confirmed that on Saturday, 1 December, Somalia would play Tanzania at the Lugogo Stadium at 14:00 UTC+3 while Eritrea would take on Rwanda at the same venue two hours later. On the same day, Sudan were to play Burundi at the Wankulukuku Stadium at 14:00 UTC+3, and finally Malawi to play Zanzibar at the same stadium two hours later.|$|E
5|$|The site {{reverted to}} private {{ownership}} after the war. As the quarry {{had long since}} been worked out, it was abandoned. The tunnels were not destroyed but were sealed off, though at some point they were reopened by local people and could be entered; the octagon remained sealed off with a ceiling-to-floor barricade. The quarry itself remained in almost the same condition as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> 1944, with sections of railway track still in place on the quarry floor. The hospital section remained relatively intact and {{was used by the}} local gendarmes as a shooting range.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{defense was}} less {{statistically}} successful in 2010 than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> previous years, but the Hokies still {{led the nation}} in turnover margin, forcing 16 more turnovers than they gave away. Sophomore cornerback Jayron Hosley, a first-team All-ACC selection, {{led the nation in}} interceptions with eight, while Davon Morgan and Rashad Carmichael each had four. Tech's defense ranked 10th in the red zone, seven spots ahead of the Seminoles' defense in that respect. In total defense, the Hokies were 42nd, permitting an average of 349 yards per game. In scoring defense, Tech was third in the ACC, permitting 17.9points per game.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt to}} move the 25th Infantry Division's {{division}} trains through the valley became mired in the mud through the night of August 10–11 and was attacked in the morning by North Koreans who had driven American forces from the high ground. In the confusion, North Korean armor was able to penetrate roadblocks and assault the supporting US artillery positions. The surprise attack was successful in wiping {{out most of the}} 555th and 90th Field Artillery battalions, with much of their equipment. Both North Korean and American armor swarmed to the scene and US Marines aircraft continued to provide cover, but neither side was able to make appreciable gains despite inflicting massive numbers of casualties on one another. Upon later inspection, the bodies of 75 men, 55 from the 555th Field Artillery and 20 from the 90th Field Artillery, were found executed when the area again came under American control. Task Force Kean was forced to withdraw back to Masan, unable to hold its gains, and by August 14 it was in approximately the same position <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> when it started the offensive.|$|E
