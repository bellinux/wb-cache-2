500|$|The {{musical score}} for Girl with a Pearl Earring {{was written by}} the French {{composer}} Alexandre Desplat. Webber decided to hire Desplat after hearing a score he had composed for a Jacques Audiard film. Webber explained, [...] "He {{had a sense of}} restraint and a sense of lyricism that I liked. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time I saw the cue where Griet opens the shutters. He was really describing what the light was doing, articulating that in a musical sphere." [...] Desplat was then known primarily for scoring films in his native language.|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Al Jean {{noted in}} an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly that it was easy to cast Lynch, since [...] "she can do edge, sweetness, and a mix of both". He further noted that the crew was happy when she agreed to take the role, and that he was [...] "embarrassed [...] didn’t ask her before she was so successful because she’s funny in everything she does." [...] Lynch recorded her scenes together with cast member Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer. In an interview with the website Hollywood Outbreak, she commented that [...] "It was pretty amazing to {{every once in a while}} look up at his face and go 'Oh my God, it's that guy that does that voice.'" [...] Lynch added that she [...] "had the best time. I would do it again and again. This is kind of very much a milestone in my career. I will point to this as a big deal." [...] In an interview with Fox All Access, Lynch revealed that she is a longtime fan: [...] "Indeed I am a fan of The Simpsons. I started watching twenty years ago. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> season. I remember clearly moments from the episodes and I thought it was revolutionary, the comedy of it. I really loved it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the film, Emin {{describes}} leaving {{school at}} age 13 and spending her time on Margate's Golden Mile, dreaming and having sex. Sex [...] "was {{something you could}} just do and it was for free". She was [...] "13, 14" [...] and having sex with men of [...] "19, 20, 25, 26". In the film, the narration states: “It could be good, really something. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time someone asked me to grab their balls, I remember the power it gave me. But it wasn’t always like that; sometimes they’d just cum, and then they’d leave me there, wherever I was, half naked.” In the final scenes, the artist performs at a local dance competition and people begin to clap. A gang of men, “most of whom [...] had sex with {{at one time or}} another" [...] began to chant [...] "slag, slag, slag".|$|E

5000|$|Lead singer Jaren Johnston, {{who wrote}} the song, told Billboard: [...] "I wanted {{something}} for our live set that mirrored 'Kashmir' by Led Zeppelin - maybe a southern version of that. I got into writing it, and started with <b>the</b> lyrics, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time <b>I</b> heard 'Sweet Home Alabama,' and I was just mesmerized with it. I thought 'We need something like that.'" [...] The song features guest vocals from Dierks Bentley, Florida Georgia Line, and Eli Young Band lead singer Mike Eli.|$|R

2500|$|In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge {{decided to}} {{reintroduce}} the character 8 {{years after she}} had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, {{the second stage of}} the audition process was an interview with EastEnders Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue {{in front of a camera}} and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: [...] "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" [...] Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: [...] "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!" [...] The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house.|$|E

At least, I could keep clear of the hateful image of Major Chevenix. Accordingly I burst at once on the narrative of my adventures. It was the same as you have read, but briefer, and told with a very different purpose. Now every incident had a particular bearing, every by-way branched off to Rome—and that was Flora.|$|R
