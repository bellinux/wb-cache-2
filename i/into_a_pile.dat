5|$|A {{southbound}} {{passenger train}} and a pilot engine left Arthington station on 19 September 1854 heading for Leeds. A pilot engine had travelled northbound {{through the tunnel}} earlier the same day with no problems {{but this time the}} train ran <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of stone debris and was derailed when it was three-quarters of the way into the tunnel. The debris was from a roof fall that affected both tracks. The train engine collided with the pilot engine tender causing considerable damage.|$|E
5|$|An Italian Canadian butcher named Lupo is {{complaining}} {{about his job}} one day, while cutting meat in his shop. As each new slice falls to the ground, Lupo grows increasingly angry and swears at the meat. He then accidentally cuts off his own thumb, which inexplicably causes his entire body to fall apart. Blood gushes out onto the ground, and the various pieces of Lupo's body collapse <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile.</b> The screen darkens and closes in on Lupo's severed head, but before the scene can disappear entirely, Lupo's head jumps forward, still alive. It remains on the screen, shouting insults during the credits, and then falls asleep.|$|E
5|$|The Match of 10,000 Tacks was up next, pitting Abyss and Raven against Black Reign and Rellik. Rhino was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} a part of the match, but was removed due to a neck injury he sustained in a previous match; he was replaced with Raven. The encounter lasted fourteen minutes and forty-one seconds. Raven forced Reign through a table covered with thumbtacks during the contest. The team of Abyss and Raven won the bout, after Abyss slammed Rellik <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of thumbtacks and then gained the pinfall victory. Abyss required stitches as a result of this match.|$|E

5|$|The fifth {{match of}} the show saw Abyss face Sabu in a No Disqualification match. Abyss was {{accompanied}} by James Mitchell. In a No Disqualification match, weapons are legal, as well as outside interference, with a victor determined only by pinfall or submission.

Near the end, Sabu tried to hit Abyss with a steal chair wrapped in barbed-wire, but Abyss countered the maneuver. This led to Abyss slamming Sabu back-first onto the barbed-wire wrapped steal chair with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver to win the encounter at 10 minutes and 48 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Drawing {{continues}} {{until everyone}} has drawn 25 cards and {{a pool of}} reserve cards (usually consisting of about eight cards), remains. The dealer then picks up all the cards, integrates them into his hand, and then discards {{the same number of}} cards <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> in the center, known as the kitty. These cards are kept unopened throughout the duration of that round and {{may or may not be}} turned over thereafter, depending on the result of the last trick in the round.|$|E
25|$|Oysters are {{harvested}} by simply gathering {{them from their}} beds. In very shallow waters, they can be gathered by hand or with small rakes. In somewhat deeper water, long-handled rakes or oyster tongs are used to reach the beds. Patent tongs can be lowered on a line to reach beds that are too deep to reach directly. In all cases, the task is the same: the oysterman scrapes oysters <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile,</b> and then scoops them up with the rake or tongs.|$|E

25|$|Back in Arendelle, the Duke sees Ingrid {{sitting in}} a gazebo, but instead of waiting on Helga, he tries to seduce Ingrid, who then uses her power to push him away. When Helga arrives, he lies to her about what happened, but Helga knows that he lied and turns down his {{marriage}} proposal. As the Duke tells the two {{that he plans to}} expose Ingrid to all of Arendelle, Ingrid attempts to freeze the Duke, but he pulls Helga in front of him, causing Ingrid to freeze her instead. As a stunned Ingrid kneels by her frozen sister, Helga's body crumbles <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of ice shards. As Gerda shows up, she is stunned by what Ingrid did to Helga. Refusing to believe her and fearing that Ingrid has become a danger to everyone around her, Gerda takes the urn and traps a sobbing Ingrid inside.

He warns her that magic comes at a price but agrees to make the memory potion.|$|E

Knight) in Grey's house, much to the displeasure of his roommates. A teenager patient with a large branch protruding through his abdomen is admitted into the hospital, and is revealed to have been thrown <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of tree clippings while street luging unprotected. The boy's distressed father Jeffrey Hernandez (Javier Grajeda) uses violence {{in order to make}} his son realize the danger he has gotten himself into. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) is assigned to the patient and unwillingly becomes emotionally involved in the case, banning further interaction between the two. Shepherd, Bailey and Yang treat a patient admitted in the neurosugical service, who has a tumor pressing against his frontal lobe. His condition forces him to verbally express each thought passing his mind, without being able to control it in any way.

At the conclusion of the episode, Shepherd visits Montgomery in her hotel room, in order to share his final thoughts on their upcoming divorce, but is shocked at the revelation that she had sex with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane).|$|E
500|$|The third {{match was}} a Serengeti Survival match between Monty Brown and Abyss. In this match, {{there were no}} {{disqualifications}} {{and the only way}} to win was by pinfall, submission, or by slamming the opponent <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of thumbtacks. Mid-way through the match, Brown grabbed a bag of tacks and poured them on the ring-mat. Afterwards, Brown and Abyss fought to slam each other into the tacks until Brown lifted Abyss up onto his shoulders and threw him forward down to the ring-mat. [...] Brown's throw caused Abyss to fall on the tacks with his head and back, giving the win to Brown.|$|E

500|$|Homer {{sings the}} end of the theme song to Family Ties while talking to an {{administrator}} at the annex center. Smithers's recollection of his marriage parodies the two plays Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire, both written by American playwright Tennessee Williams. Homer's bedroom rant to Marge is a parody mishmash of four popular films: ...And Justice for All (1979), A Few Good Men (1992), Patton (1970), and Chinatown (1974). He says: [...] "Look Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one out there every day putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order. The whole freaking system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do! Forget it, Marge, it's Chinatown," [...] all of which are lines from those films.|$|E
500|$|Several people, telling amazing {{stories to}} those who would listen, passed {{themselves}} off as the [...] "sole survivor" [...] in the years following the slide. The most common such tale is that of an infant girl said to have been the only survivor of the slide. Her real name unknown, the girl was called [...] "Frankie Slide". Several stories were told of her miraculous escape: she was found in a bale of hay, lying on rocks, under the collapsed roof of her house or in the arms of her dead mother. The legend was based primarily on the story of Marion Leitch, who was thrown from her home <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of hay when the slide enveloped her home. [...] Her sisters also survived; they were found unharmed under a collapsed ceiling joist. Her parents and four brothers died. Influencing the story was the survival of two-year-old Gladys Ennis, who was found outside her home in the mud. [...] The last survivor of the slide, she died in 1995. In total, 23 people {{in the path of the}} slide survived, in addition to the 17 miners who escaped from the tunnels under Turtle Mountain.|$|E

500|$|Nearly a {{year after}} the events of the first film, Elsa tries to make Anna's 19th {{birthday}} as perfect as possible a way of making up for the years they spent apart. To do so, she works heavily with Kristoff, Sven and Olaf to make this a reality. Upon making sure that her surprise party in the palace courtyard is ready, she leaves Kristoff in charge while she goes to get Anna. However, Elsa starts to come down with a cold as she leads Anna on a treasure hunt to find all the gifts that have been made for her. Without realizing it, each sneeze she makes creates small snowmen called [...] "snowgies", which create trouble for Kristoff, Sven and Olaf. As Anna notices Elsa's cold getting worse, she tries in vain to get Elsa to stop exerting herself, even taking medicine from Oaken in case Elsa gets sicker. Unfortunately, Elsa's cold cause her to become very tired and behave in a seemingly intoxicated-like manner, and she nearly falls from Arendelle's clock tower only for Anna to save her. Upon finally admitting to Anna that she is indeed sick after the previous incident, she allows Anna to escort her home feeling she has ruined everything, and finds that the party has gone off successfully for Anna (as well as discovering her snowgie creations), and still slightly intoxicated, she ends the party by accidentally sneezing into the birthday bugle horn, which inadvertently sends a gigantic snowball {{all the way to the}} Southern Isles and hits the now-demoted Hans, causing him to fall <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of horse manure. Afterwards, Anna tells a now bed-ridden Elsa that she has given her the best birthday ever by letting her take care of her.|$|E
