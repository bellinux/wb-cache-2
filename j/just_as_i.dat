25|$|I am {{honestly}} {{against the}} social intermingling of Negroes and Whites but I hold nothing personal against the Negroes as a race. They {{should be proud}} of their God-given heritage <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am proud of mine. I believe Negroes should have the right , and in Mississippi too—when their main purpose is not to put me out of office and when they won't try to besmirch the reputation of my state.|$|E
25|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{was pushing}} {{one of our}} men back into the ranks I saw him fall at my feet from a sabre slash. I turned round instantly– to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into {{infantry}} who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so {{it is true that}} once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. This what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English. And so we found ourselves defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred even our drummers and fifers without mercy.|$|E

500|$|Sebastian's debut single [...] "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] and album <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> Am both reached {{number one}} on the ARIA charts. [...] "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] was the highest selling song in Australia last decade. The first week sales of 163,711 for <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> Am were at the time the highest one-week sales ever {{achieved}} in Australia, and have since only been surpassed by Susan Boyle's debut album in 2009. With eventual sales of 480,000, just short of 7× platinum, <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> Am is the highest selling album ever released by an Australian Idol contestant. The second single [...] "All I Need Is You" [...] also reached number one. Sebastian's next two albums were certified platinum. Beautiful Life showcased a stronger contemporary R sound and reached number two with a number-one lead single, [...] "Out with My Baby", and two other top twenty singles. Closer to the Sun was a mix of genres, including pop rock, soul, and jazz. It peaked at number four and produced a top ten and top twenty single.|$|E
500|$|All {{the donkey}} handler did was laugh. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> turned round, the donkey's face was right {{by me and}} it shook its head and I stuck a punch in among it somewhere, and the donkey went down like it was shot ... much to my amazement. But not to as much amazement as the donkey handler's– [...] I've never seen a bloke sober up so quick. It was a hole in one: the donkey {{struggled}} to its feet and looked really willing to go {{up the hill and}} the donkey handler lost his laugh.|$|E
500|$|... "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] (aka [...] "Faith Has Brought Me Here") is a pop song {{performed}} by Australian singer Guy Sebastian. It {{was released in}} Australia on 24 November 2003 as the lead single from his debut album <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> Am (2003). The song was written by Jörgen Elofsson and John Reid for Network Ten's TV talent competition, Australian Idols inaugural season. Recorded versions were made for both grand finalists, Sebastian and Shannon Noll, with only Sebastian's version officially released by BMG. On 22 November the promotional video had premiered on the same network's Video Hits – produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by its musical director, John Foreman.|$|E

500|$|Warren retains fond {{memories}} of Beacham's [...] "very professional" [...] performance, and remarks that, [...] "with tongue firmly in cheek, she would often wind me up by asking what her motivation was for a particular action, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> about to call 'Action!', {{knowing full well that}} my answer would be, 'Because it's in the script'." [...] Beacham, a mother of two infant children, agreed to appear in the film to support her family: [...] "I had to choose between a play that I really, really wanted to do, which would have paid me £65 a week, and this script for a film called Inseminoid. Hey! No choice. Two pink babies asleep upstairs! No choice!" ...|$|E
500|$|On Bataan, the {{reaction}} to MacArthur's escape was mixed, with many American and Filipino troops feeling bitter and betrayed. When Wainwright broke the news to his generals [...] "they were all at first depressed by the news … But I soon saw that they understood <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> understood." [...] Some people with family members in the Philippines were dismayed. One wrote to Roosevelt that [...] "Nothing {{you could have done}} would have broken their morale and that of their parents at home so thoroughly". Wainwright held out on Corregidor until 6 May. To Joseph Goebbels, MacArthur was a [...] "fleeing general", while Benito Mussolini labeled him a coward. Marshall decided {{that the best way to}} counter this was to award MacArthur the Medal of Honor.|$|E
500|$|Hańska {{lived with}} Balzac's mother {{for a time}} after his death, in the house he had {{spent so much time}} and expense furnishing. The elder Mme. Balzac moved in with a friend after several months, and Hańska {{approached}} the remains of her late husband's writing. Several works had been left incomplete, and publishers inquired about releasing a final edition of his grand collection La Comédie humaine. Hańska sponsored new editions of his works and was involved in editing some of them, even adding occasional content. Balzac's debt, meanwhile, still exceeded 200,000 francs, which Hańska paid while also providing for his mother's living expenses. One of her letters at the time gives voice to her frustrations: [...] "In nursing my husband's incurable malady I ruined my health, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have ruined my private fortune in accepting the inheritance of debts and embarrassments which he left me." [...] Anna and Jerzy moved into a nearby house in Paris.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't mean it that way." [...] She sat up, {{touched his}} shoulder, and sank back. He blushed with bliss, {{and the fear}} that some one had seen, as she continued: [...] "I always think of you <b>as</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> old <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am. We always will be, won't we?" ...|$|R

500|$|At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004, Sebastian {{earned the}} award for 'Highest Selling Single', and was also {{nominated}} for 'Highest Selling Album' for <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> Am. In January 2010 ARIA announced that [...] "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] was the highest selling single of the previous decade, with Anthony Callea's [...] "The Prayer" [...] ranked second. It was certified fourtimes platinum and sold in excess of 303,000 copies. [...] At the time this was the highest sales ever recorded for an Australian artist single, a record Sebastian held until 2011. In 2011 the sales of [...] "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] were surpassed by Gotye's [...] "Somebody That I Used to Know" [...] which has now been certified 11× platinum. Since then several other Australian artist songs have also reached higher sales than [...] "Angels Brought Me Here", including Sebastian's own song [...] "Battle Scars" [...] which has been certified 9× platinum.|$|E
500|$|At the Dyad Institute, Rachel {{appoints}} Delphine Cormier (Évelyne Brochu) {{the interim}} {{director of the}} cloning program {{following the death of}} Dr. Aldous Leekie. Delphine meets with Sarah to ask if her young daughter, Kira, will donate her bone marrow to help cure Cosima's illness, and Kira agrees. Meanwhile, Cosima works with her lab assistant Scott (Josh Vokey) and Rachel's adoptive father Ethan (Andrew Gillies), a founder scientist of the cloning program, to find the genetic sequence that has caused her illness. Rachel, who is usually stoic, laughs and sobs whilst watching home videos of her childhood, lamenting her own infertility. Disguised as Sarah, she tricks her way into the pediatric clinic where Kira is recovering and sedates Sarah's foster brother Felix (Jordan Gavaris). She abducts Kira and takes her to a young girl's bedroom in the Dyad Institute, telling Kira that she [...] "may even grow to like it here, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> did".|$|E
500|$|Badu {{composed}} {{more than}} 75 songs {{within the year}} and intended on splitting them among her planned series of New Amerykah albums. She said of her productivity with her laptop, [...] "I could be here, in my own space, with headphones on, and the kids could be doing what they doing, and I’m cooking dinner still, I’m making juices still, and it’s so easy just to sing. You got an idea — boom! Idea, boom!" [...] Badu's iChat contacts, including hip hop producers Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, and J Dilla, instant messaged her {{to get back into}} the studio and sent her tracks. Such exchanges inspired a creative spark for Badu, which she explained in an interview for the Dallas Observer, [...] "I started to accept that maybe it's OK for me to put out music, and it doesn't have to be something dynamic or world-changing. But <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was accepting that, here comes this burst of light and energy and creativity. And that's the process, I guess, of life—the detachment and the release of something gives you even more room to grow or be creative." ...|$|E
5000|$|Being {{the star}} of his own program was a {{departure}} from Day's previous experience as a regular on Benny's show. [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>as</b> scared <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was in 1939 he joined Benny's show," [...] he said. [...] "You know, {{you get used to}} being a stooge. This one I'll have to carry myself." ...|$|R

500|$|Bannon {{followed}} Odd Girl Out with I Am a Woman (In Love With a Woman — Must Society Reject Me?) in 1959. I Am a Woman (the {{working and}} common title) featured Laura after her affair with Beth, as {{she finds herself}} in New York City's Greenwich Village, and meets a wisecracking gay man named Jack, and becomes his best friend. Laura has to choose between a straight woman with a wild and curious streak, and a fascinating new character {{that proved to be}} her most popular of the series, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the description of a thoroughly butch lesbian. Beebo was smart, handsome, chivalrous, and virile. Once again based on what Bannon knew, Beebo was nearly [...] tall with a husky voice and a formidable physique. The personality however, Bannon says, was drawn out of her sheer need for Beebo to exist. After spending time in Greenwich Village and not finding anyone like her, Bannon instead created her. She remembered, [...] "I put Beebo together <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> wanted her, in my heart and mind... She was just, quite literally, the butch of my dreams." [...] The resolution to I Am a Woman completely flouted the trends of miserable lesbian fiction endings, which made Ann Bannon a hero to many lesbians.|$|E

2500|$|As Rather {{approached}} the delegate {{to question the}} apparent strong-arm tactics of the Chicago political machine under Mayor Daley, he was punched in the stomach {{by one of the}} men, knocking him to the ground.

In the CBS control room, they had switched the camera onto me <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was slugged." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his studio}} he mounted a bicycle wheel upside down onto a stool, {{spinning}} it occasionally just to watch it. Although {{it is often}} assumed that the Bicycle Wheel represents the first of Duchamp's [...] "Readymades", this particular installation was never submitted for any art exhibition, and it was eventually lost. However, initially, the wheel was simply placed in the studio to create atmosphere: [...] "I enjoyed looking at it <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> enjoy looking at the flames dancing in a fireplace." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{setting is}} wonderful, Ms. Carl {{describes}} {{the village of}} Somerstowe and the English climate so well that this reader {{felt as if she}} were viewing a film. The characters, both major as well as minor, come to life clearly with all their traits, quirks, and foibles helping the reader understand some of their actions. The mystery kept me guessing until the last few chapters where I had an [...] "AHA! moment" [...] <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> suspect the author intended.|$|E
2500|$|A {{class in}} which Ludlow always got the highest marks was one taught by famed Union College {{president}} Eliphalet Nott based on Lord Kames’ seminal 1762 literary work, Elements of Criticism – although it essentially became {{a course on}} Nott's own philosophy. The eccentric polymath Nott would have an influence on Ludlow, but perhaps more immediately his assertion that “f I had it {{in my power to}} direct the making of songs in any country, I could do <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> pleased with the people.” ...|$|E
