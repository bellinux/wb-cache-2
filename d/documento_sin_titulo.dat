Stewert did the writing, illustrations, lettering, and coloring {{for the work}} all on his own. The webcomic started as an [...] "exercise in improvisation", its ambiguous title <b>Sin</b> <b>Titulo</b> literally meaning [...] "Without Title" [...] in Spanish. Many ideas for the story coalesced halfway through, when Stewert got a stronger grasp of what the webcomic was about. In 2011, <b>Sin</b> <b>Titulo</b> went on hiatus for almost a full year, keeping its readers in suspense.|$|R

5000|$|Lauren Davis praised <b>Sin</b> <b>Titulo</b> in 2012 for how it weaved {{its story}} threads {{together}} {{at the end and}} for its [...] "slightly disorienting" [...] style, allowing its readers to experience Alex' trials alongside him. Hillary Brown of Paste Magazine noted that the webcomic's atmosphere and moments of fear provoke stronger emotions than the mechanics of its plot. Brown praised Stewart for his ability to capture the feeling of being unsure whether you're awake or asleep, but criticized the manner in which he set up and eventually resolves the mysteries in <b>Sin</b> <b>Titulo,</b> stating that [...] "doesn’t quite do them justice." ...|$|R

50|$|Stewert told Davis of Comics Alliance at the New England Webcomics Weekend in 2009, when <b>Sin</b> <b>Titulo</b> {{was still}} fairly young, that the webcomic is {{inspired}} by a disquieting experience he had as a child; one he's {{never been able to}} explain. He told Davis {{that he did not want}} <b>Sin</b> <b>Titulo</b> to turn out like the television series Lost, which was still airing at the time and which disappointed him for not answering all of the questions it set up. Though Stewert did not intend for it to be an autobiographical work, many aspects of the webcomic are based on his own experiences, including the sudden death of a neglected grandfather.|$|R

5000|$|A strong {{influence}} of <b>Sin</b> <b>Titulo</b> {{is the work}} of David Lynch. In an interview with Newsarama, Stewert stated that he admires Lynch for his ability to provoke a sense of horror through surrealistic imagery that, to him, feels deeply honest. Stewert said that [...] "I find his work so terrifying because on some primal level I feel like its revealing some dark and indescribable truth with complete sincerity." [...] This is a quality he attempted to emulate in his webcomic.|$|R

50|$|Play Without a Title, or Untitled Play (Comedia <b>sin</b> <b>título),</b> is an {{unfinished}} experimental {{play by the}} Spanish twentieth-century modernist playwright Federico García Lorca. Lorca conceived the work as a three-act drama and had referred to it by the title The Dream of Life (echoing, perhaps, Calderón's classic Golden-Age comedy Life is a Dream), but he completed only the first act. Lorca's play was probably written in 1935, but remained unpublished until 1978; it received its Spanish-language première in 1989 at the Teatro María Guerrero in Madrid, in a production directed by Lluís Pasqual.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s he was {{interested}} in all of the then current movements in art, especially abstractionism, as he felt that figurative work carried too much risk of propagandizing. In 1959 he wrote that he had left realism little by little to express more of vibration, color, space, time and speed. In the early 1960s he went to New York and worked more with the spatula than the brush using rich colors such as <b>Sin</b> <b>Titulo</b> (Cabeza) from 1961. It was a type of still life but the focus was more on light, shadow, solidness and color than on form.|$|R
5000|$|The webcomic <b>Sin</b> <b>Titulo</b> follows protagonist Alex Mackay, who, at {{the start}} of the story, discovers a {{photograph}} of an unfamiliar woman in his grandfather's possessions and feels compelled to hunt her down. This leads him to an underworld populated by mysterious and strange concepts, such as an eerie laboratory and a femme fatale. Lauren Davis of Comics Alliance described Sin Tutilo as a [...] "noir fantasy": though it suggests the existence of science fiction concepts such as interdimentional travel and [...] "shared cognitive space", many of its visuals are akin to those of a detective novel.|$|R

[...] Similarly, Gareth Harris, writing in The Art Newspaper in January 2014, notes: [...] "With his vast range of dynamic assemblage sculptures meticulously built from found objects, the Mexican artist Abraham Cruzvillegas has been dubbed the 21st-century equivalent of Marcel Duchamp." ...|$|R
50|$|An {{exhibition}} composed exclusively {{of drawings}} {{by the group}} in 1962, titled Esto at Galeria Lirolay in Buenos Aires {{had a significant impact}} on autonomous, experimental drawing in Latin American art. Otra Figuración emphasized process over technique. They influenced contemporaries Alberto Heredia, Cildo Meireles, Rubens Gerchman and Antonio Dias among others. The exhibit emerged from the political climate in 1962, one Noé likened to “social dislocation” and then linked to the “structural dislocation” apparent in the drawings. With the president of Argentina deposed by the military, Buenos Aires was once again in chaos and facing civil war. Emblematic of the exhibit, Noé’s <b>Sin</b> <b>titulo</b> (Untitled) uses black India ink on pulp to create an artwork defaced with random slashes and blots, featuring rotund, distorted figures gathered around a black exploding center. Although the work appears to contain surreal elements, it’s a true, psychological and emotional expression of Argentina’s then current and seemingly perpetual social and political disorder.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{figures of}} economy in museum fictions appearing in Latin American novels, performance art, and theater {{from the late}} 1970 s to the 2000 s in order to describe the cultural transformation in the region after the neo-liberal turn. In particular, it analyses how these museum fictions reflect upon the circulation of fantasies and ideas about museums in Latin America through a comparative study of Chile, Argentina, and Peru, focusing on two significant moments: the introduction of neo-liberalism {{in the region and}} its consolidation. The works examined here signal towards a particular articulation of neo-liberal assumptions in Latin American culture: museums appear as circuits of production, circulation, and exchange of cultural value where subjects test their freedom to consume and, therefore, to produce value. Thus, the first goal {{of this study is to}} characterize transformations of museum practices that take place under conflicting relations with authority and consumerism. The second is to understand how these museum fictions make explicit that cultural consumption translates as cultural production within a political economic model that acknowledges free consumption as a form of investment and as a sign of citizenry. The individual chapters discuss museum economies through the figures of waste, accountability and inflation, as significant of different instances of the establishment and consolidation of neo-liberal ideology and policies in the region. Expenditure appears in "Para no morir de hambre en el arte" (1979) by CADA and Museo de cera (1981) by Jorge Edwards, museum fictions that respond to Pinochet's shock economy. Accountability emerges as a compensation to an assumed lack of civic responsibility as the common feature to the photographic book Yuyanapaq: para recordar (2003), by the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission and <b>Sin</b> <b>titulo.</b> Tecnica mixta (2004), a theater piece by collective Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani. Finally, inflation is the mode of chosen as a strategy for the generation of value in narratives that recall the Dirty War in El pasado (2003) by Alan Pauls and Museo de la Revolucion (2007) by Martin Kohan...|$|R
