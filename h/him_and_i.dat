5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can attest to that.|$|E
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
25|$|He {{laid down}} the laws for me. It was a good chat. I knew exactly where I stood with <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> went away with a new belief, {{in terms of where}} I wanted to head. It gave me a lot of {{confidence}} to know that if I went back and scored runs in grade cricket and 2nd XI, I could get back into the team straight away.|$|E

25|$|Mr. Ament left us {{this morning}} after a delay here of five days. The Mark Twain article in the North American Review cut him like a knife and weighs deeply on him, but he takes it in a most {{beautiful}} spirit. The sympathy of all the Peking missionaries, and their absolute confidence in his integrity and the uprightness of his course {{has been a great}} help to <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think he goes back well prepared to set things right so far as he can in person. He plans to write a series of articles telling exactly what he has done. It will be a story worth telling, even if there were no occasion for it as a vindication of his character. I have been with him all this first week since he heard about the Sun and the Review articles. The calm and sweet spirit in which he has taken it and his brave resolution to set the matter right so far as in him lies, is answer enough for those who know of it.|$|E

I was {{speechless}} and I just feared that I would lose <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't be there." ...|$|E
500|$|Further {{incidents}} came {{in subsequent}} years. During the 2006 World Championship, Maguire said [...] "I don't {{want to be}} a fat world champion", a reference to Murphy. After beating Murphy in the 2007 Welsh Open, Maguire said of the chalk incident, [...] "That put the icing on the cake, but we've always had a rivalry. I dislike <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think he dislikes me. I try hard to beat everyone, but it would have hurt more if I'd lost to him." [...] Murphy currently leads the head-to-head 12–10.|$|E

500|$|According to Canham, he {{met with}} Elliott in December 1968 and offered him the job of {{associate}} athletic director. [...] Canham told Elliott he could stay on as coach if he wanted, but Canham could not promise him that the job of associate athletic director would still be open in another couple of years. [...] Canham said: [...] "Bump smiled at me and said, ‘I don’t {{have to think about}} it.’ [...] He was ready to get out. [...] I did not force <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> mean that in all honesty. [...] But the job had ceased to be fun for him." ...|$|E

500|$|Asked {{about his}} pass on Räikkönen {{in the closing}} laps, Massa said that [...] "it was {{the best time for}} me in the race, I was quite strong and then I caught <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> passed him." [...] Since the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, where Barrichello ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, team orders have been banned in Formula One. Räikkönen {{appeared}} unbothered when asked about Massa's pass: [...] "I mean we know what we want as a team and that's what we did it. It is normal in these situations." [...] No investigation was undertaken by the stewards at the race. GrandPrix.com played down the incident, saying [...] "Anyone who understands racing understood {{what was going on and}} only the silly people objected." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had never}} yet altered his old manner. <b>I</b> loved it <b>and</b> <b>him</b> {{so much that}} when I now went up to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> took my usual chair, which was always put at his side--for {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> read to <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes <b>I</b> talked to <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes <b>I</b> silently worked by him--I hardly liked to disturb it by laying my hand on his breast. But I found I did not disturb it at all.|$|R
60|$|He 'adn't {{been gone}} five seconds afore she missed <b>'im,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never see anybody so upset {{in all my}} life.

500|$|In Moonwalk (1988), Jackson {{said his}} {{relationship}} with Shields was [...] "romantically serious for a while." [...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt {{such a move would}} have [...] "divided [...] life too much". She recalled: [...] "There were times when he would ask me to marry <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would say, 'You have {{me for the rest of}} your life, you don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on...have my own marriage and my own kids, and you’ll always have me.' I think it made him relax. He didn’t want to lose things that meant something to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Holly's {{pregnant}} wife, María Elena, {{learned of}} his death from the reports on television. A widow after only six months of marriage, she suffered a miscarriage shortly after, reportedly due to [...] "psychological trauma". Holly's mother, on hearing the news on the radio at home in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. María Elena Holly {{did not attend the}} funeral and has never visited the gravesite. She later said in an interview: [...] "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the race, which {{experienced}} a record 16cautions and 74 lead changes, among 22 different drivers, Edwards commented, [...] "A new winner, up-and-coming guy that's tied {{to so much}} history. This {{is as good as}} it gets. If people aren't watching, that's their problem, because we got some great stuff going on here." [...] In the post-race press conference, the third-place finisher, Gilliland, said, [...] "It's a credit to NASCAR and their new rules, trying to get the (cars) closer, to let teams like us have a chance to be competitive. A lot of the rules (are) making these races more competitive." [...] Jeff Gordon also commented about Bayne, [...] "I think it's very cool. Trevor's a good kid, and I love the Wood Brothers. I'm really happy for <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think it's great for the sport. To have a young talent like that– he's got that spark, you know?" ...|$|E

500|$|Aden {{forms an}} {{unlikely}} friendship with Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances). In the storyline, Morag {{wants to know}} why he has problems because she had [...] "taken a bit of a shine to him". Aden initially doesn't want her help. Whilst interviewed by Digital Spy Frances stated: [...] "There's lots of lovely dialogue that goes on between <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> - I take him under my wing and I find out what's wrong with him." [...] He eventually looks up to her and moves in with her. Frances said: [...] "So I sort of adopt him in a way." [...] Morag is known for her feisty persona, Lasance said Frances was one of his favourite colleagues to work with because she is the complete opposite of Morag. As a pairing they have [...] "collision chemistry" [...] because [...] "they don't really get along, but they do have respect for each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton {{personalized}} {{the film}} with several cameos. While filming in Alabama, the crew tracked down Billy Redden, {{one of the}} original banjo players from Deliverance (1972). Redden was working as a part-owner of a restaurant in Clayton, Georgia, and he agreed to reprise his role in the Spectre vignette. As Edward Bloom first enters the town, Redden can be seen on a porch plucking a few notes from [...] "Dueling Banjos". Burton was pleased with the result: [...] "If you're watching the film and don't recognise the solitary, enigmatic figure on the porch, that's fine. But if you do – well, it just makes me so happy to see <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think other people will feel the same way." [...] Original Big Fish author Daniel Wallace makes a brief appearance as Sandra's economics teacher in the [...] "Courtship of Sandra Templeton" [...] scene.|$|E
500|$|The {{biological}} father of Superman. Sean Penn and Clive Owen were also {{considered for the}} role. Crowe incorporates how his own fatherhood informed his reading of the script to portray Jor-El, stating that [...] "...it {{was one of those}} things where that's how it was connecting me. That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in." [...] Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: [...] "When I signed on... well, one, I didn't realize that I would be wearing Spandex—'cause you know that's Superman's costume—I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well," [...] Crowe said. [...] "But, I also didn't realize the type of organizer that Zack Snyder is, 'cause this was really old school prep. This is sort of David Lean-level preparation, and I really appreciated <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> was on the movie for three-and-a-half or four months before I even got in front of the camera." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 24, {{the band}} {{mentioned}} {{that they had}} nearly finishing recording the album and would start the mixing process shortly afterwards. On November 6, the band announced they were [...] "still putting the finshing [...] touches on the album". The recordings were mixed by Tom Lord-Alge with Fernio Hernandez at South Beach Studios in Miami, Florida. Ted Jensen mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound in New York City. In retrospect, Lazzara called Kahne [...] "a good producer," [...] but didn't think he was [...] "the right fit" [...] for the group. He added that what the group aimed to accomplish was [...] "just different than what he had envisioned both sonically and {{with all of that}} stuff". Reyes said he was [...] "pre-warned about working with <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't listen to that. ... It was kind of very blank. I think I put my guitar tracks on and then I flew back home and that was it." ...|$|E

He criticized the president, arguing, [...] "This president has no plan – how to win and/or how to leave". During the September 11 testimony by the General, Biden stated that the question to be asked to determine progress was [...] "Are we any closer to a lasting political settlement in Iraq at the national level today than we were when the surge began eight months ago?" [...] He answered his own question by stating [...] "In my judgment, I must tell you, based on my experience and my observation here, as well as in-country, the answer to... questions is no." [...] After the testimony concluded, Biden and other Democrats were criticized for their conduct during the deliberations. In the following weeks Biden would continue with these arguments while campaigning.|$|E

[...] Following the first season, Atwell noted that Carter did not [...] "win everyone’s respect", with Jack Thompson taking credit for her actions, for example, but [...] "she knows her value so she doesn’t need that praise". For the second season, executive producer Michele Fazekas explained that after Carter [...] "put a lot of things emotionally to bed", such as letting go of Captain America, she is now [...] "more open to looking at her life and figuring out, does she want a relationship?" [...] Fazekas added that Carter would start to realize that [...] "not everybody has her ideals", even in the SSR.|$|E
