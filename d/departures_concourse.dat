25|$|Until {{the summer}} of 2017 Terminal 1 was used for flight check-in, {{security}} screening and passport-control for international flights for passengers of certain low-cost airlines, but following passport control passengers were bussed to the <b>departures</b> <b>concourse</b> of Terminal 3 from which they boarded their flights. All incoming flights for airlines operating out of Terminal 1 were handled in Terminal 3. However, beginning on 19 June 2017 and following several months of renovations, Terminal 1 passengers began being bussed directly to their flights from Terminal 1, although incoming passengers continue to be handled in Terminal 3. The renovations to Terminal 1's boarding area included adding duty-free shops, restaurants and cafes. The terminal was also equipped with advanced checked-baggage handling and screening systems, {{similar to those in}} Terminal 3.|$|E

Situated {{to the west of the}} station behind the Great Northern Hotel, it was designed by John McAslan and built by Vinci. It caters for much-increased passenger flows and provides greater integration between the intercity, suburban and underground sections of the station. The architect claimed that the roof is the longest single-span station structure in Europe and the semi-circular structure has a radius of [...] and more than 2,000 triangular roof panels, half of which are glass.|$|E

This phase comprises a new departures building at {{the eastern end of}} the present terminal to accommodate expansion to the present <b>departure</b> <b>concourse,</b> security screening station with space to accommodate explosives detection equipment, out-going immigration, retail concessions and departure lounge.|$|R
30|$|The “Gare Lille Europe” {{railway station}} counts 4 {{platforms}} and 2 central railway lines for Eurostar trains coming from Paris and {{going directly to}} London. It has a daily traffic of 8500 passengers. It connects Lille to Paris by TGV (1  h), and to Brussels (38  min) and London (1  h 20  min) with the Eurostar trains. Since 2014 works have been undertaken on the <b>departure</b> <b>concourse</b> for the cross-Channel trains (Eurostar): it will provide new control desks, and a bigger boarding area.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} {{was initially}} {{designed as a}} facility for short-haul 'point-to-point' traffic, to compensate for its relatively long distance from the airport's central terminal area (CTA). The layout of the terminal, with passenger boarding gates {{very close to the}} check-in and security halls, was designed to facilitate rapid movement of passengers through the building (a requirement for short-haul, business-focused flights). Upon opening, it boasted other innovations including the complete segregation of arriving and departing passengers and a <b>departure</b> <b>concourse</b> over 1/3 mi long.|$|R

5000|$|Sky marshals were {{introduced}} in 1970, but there were insufficient numbers to protect every flight and hijackings continued to take place. On November 10, 1972 a trio of hijackers threatened to fly Southern Airways Flight 49 into a nuclear reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. As a direct response to this incident, the Federal Aviation Administration required that all airlines begin screening passengers and their carry-on baggage by January 5, 1973. [...] This screening was generally contracted to private security companies. Private companies would bid on these contracts. The airline that had operational control of the <b>departure</b> <b>concourse</b> controlled by a given checkpoint would hold that contract. Although an airline would control the operation of a checkpoint, oversight authority was held by the FAA. C.F.R. Title 14 restrictions did not permit a relevant airport authority to exercise any oversight over checkpoint operations. The 1974 film, The Parallax View, shows an early airport security checkpoint in operation.|$|R
50|$|For {{domestic}} flights, three gates (65, 66, and 67) in {{the main}} building are connected to both the main <b>departures</b> <b>concourse</b> and to a separate domestic check-in facility. Passengers connecting between domestic and international flights must exit the gate area, walk to the other check-in area, and then check in for their connecting flight.|$|E
50|$|Departing {{passengers}} {{enter the}} departures level {{on the third}} floor by lift or escalator from the interchange plaza. Upon entering the <b>departures</b> <b>concourse,</b> passengers see views across Heathrow and the surrounding area, and are in a space that is unobstructed to the rising roof above. After check-in and security screening, the airside departure lounge also provides views across the airport, its runways and beyond.|$|E
50|$|On the {{elevated}} <b>departures</b> <b>concourse,</b> there are designated waiting areas and VIP lounges (with better seating and, in the lounges, free food and snacks) for passengers travelling in CRH Business Class, {{and a number}} of restaurants and corner shops. There are also a number of ticket counters (where nationwide ticketing services are available) and an increasing number of retail stores and fast food stalls. Ticket machines are available to holders of the PRC ID card and sell tickets for trains departing from this station. 23 sets of ticket gates despatch passengers onto trains.|$|E
50|$|The three-story {{terminal}} building is divided operationally, with departures and arrivals {{on the same}} floor (street-level), cafe and lounge {{on the first floor}} and runway-level departures lounge and logistics. The street-level <b>departures</b> and arrivals <b>concourses</b> are situated on opposite ends of the terminal; flight checkins, baggage check and oversize security in the western wing, while in the east is the enclosed arrivals lounge with one baggage carousal, and car rental services. The runway-level departures lounge and arrivals is connected directly to the street-level by staircase and escalators respectively.|$|R
2500|$|The Davey Terminal {{was built}} in 1966 and was first known as [...] "Terminal 2" [...] or the [...] "North Terminal". Designed by the firm of Smith, Hinchman and Grylls, it {{was said to be}} the largest post {{tensioned}} building in the world. Tapering cruciform columns around the perimeter and curved beams supported five large concrete roof panels. The lack of columns allowed maximum flexibility in the interior space. The spaces between the roof panels and exterior columns were filled with glass to allow abundant natural light into the building. It was renamed the [...] "J. M. Davey Terminal" [...] in 1975 in honor of former airport manager James M. Davey. It originally contained three concourses labeled D to F, as well as a Host Hotel which later was rebranded Marriott. In the early 1980s, a separate ticketing area was constructed {{to the north of the}} Davey Terminal for international <b>departures,</b> along with <b>Concourse</b> G to accommodate Northwest Airlink's regional fleet. Concourse C, originally part of the Smith Terminal, became to be considered part of the Davey Terminal once Northwest Airlines began to use it in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The Cosmopolitan, both {{mysterious and}} {{inevitable}} like all truly great writing, is both oasis and mirage for the reader. It takes some presumption {{to assume the}} role of the cosmopolitan, to pass gorgeously through the swabbed-for-Semtex-and-C4 jetways. The cosmopolitan upholds both a system and a dream. The system offers a lingua franca for all airline pilots, a worldwide striving for on-time arrivals and <b>departures</b> via gleaming <b>concourses.</b> In the dream the cosmopolitan is aloft, gazing down at local color, a consumer of nationalities enacting the privilege of appreciating the various arts, beauties and flavors. This is, we often say, one small globe. But the reader, enticed to travel in Stonecipher’s precisely observed world, becomes the character below in part one of “Inlay 16 (Thomas Bernhard)”:“He wanted to be a citizen of the world and was crushed to discover that the world fields no citizens as such. So he settled for drifting with the voluptés of the clouds. And that is how he met her on a ship from Spain to Morocco, eating clementines and throwing the perfectly spiraled peels into the sea.”The cosmopolitan is the one who knows the difference between the Hutus and the Tutsis.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the study of {{passenger}} experiences and how passengers interact with services, technology and processes at an airport. As part of our research, we have followed people through the airport from check-in to security and from security to boarding. Data was collected by approaching passengers in the <b>departures</b> <b>concourse</b> of the airport and asking for their consent to be videotaped. Data was collected and coded and the analysis focused on both discretionary and process related passenger activities. Our findings show the interdependence between activities and passenger experiences. Within all activities, passengers interact with processes, domain dependent technology, services, personnel and artifacts. These levels of interaction impact on passenger experiences and are interdependent. The emerging taxonomy of activities consists of (i) ownership related activities, (ii) group activities, (iii) individual activities (such as activities at the domain interfaces) and (iv) concurrent activities. This classification is contributing to the development of descriptive models of passenger experiences and how these activities affect the facilitation and design of future airports...|$|E
