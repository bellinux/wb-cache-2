25|$|Murakami is {{a serious}} {{marathon}} runner and triathlon enthusiast, {{though he did not}} start running until he was 33 years old. On 23 June 1996, he completed his first ultramarathon, a 100km race around Lake Saroma in Hokkaido, Japan. He discusses his relationship with running in his 2008 memoir What <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> When <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> Running.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} the Gunzo Award for his 1979 literary work Hear the Wind Sing, Murakami did not aspire {{to meet other}} writers. Aside from Sarah Lawrence's Mary Morris, whom he briefly mentions in his memoir What <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> When <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> Running alongside Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Morrison, Murakami was never {{a part of a}} community of writers, his reason being that he was a loner and was never fond of groups, schools, and literary circles. When working on a book, Murakami states that he relies on his wife, who is always his first reader. While he never acquainted himself with many writers, Murakami enjoys the works of Ryu Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Murakami {{published}} the anthology Birthday Stories, which collects short {{stories on the}} theme of birthdays. The collection includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. What <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> When <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> Running, containing tales about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the U.K. and the U.S. in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver's short story collection, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.|$|E

[...] She has noted the difficulty of getting attention to some of the topics she feels most strongly about; at a Futures Without Violence summit in 2012, she said, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> rape in Congo, people turn their backs and run, especially the men." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoffman rarely {{mentioned}} {{his personal life}} in interviews, stating in 2012 that he would [...] "rather not because my family doesn't have any choice. If <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> them in the press, I'm giving them no choice. So I choose not to." [...] For the last 14 years of his life, {{he was in a}} relationship with costume designer Mimi O'Donnell, whom he had met in 1999 when they were both working on the play In Arabia We'd All Be Kings, which Hoffman directed. They lived in New York City and had a son, Cooper (2003), and two daughters, Tallulah (2006) and Willa (2008). Hoffman and O'Donnell separated in the fall of 2013, some months before his death.|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{has also}} {{stressed}} the importance of establishing a clear point of view in his films, and makes frequent use of [...] "the shot that walks into a room behind a character, because... that takes [...] inside the way that the character enters". He has also used cinéma-vérité techniques (such as hand-held camera work) to convey realism. In an interview at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, he explained his emphasis on realism in The Dark Knight trilogy: [...] "You try and get the audience to invest in cinematic reality. When <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> reality in these films, it's often misconstrued as a direct reality, but it's really about a cinematic reality." ...|$|E

500|$|Dubbing [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] {{one of the}} {{highlights}} of her career, singer Heidi Mollenhauer described the experience in an interview with South Pasadena High School as [...] "very exciting, a little terrifying, and sometimes overwhelming". On recording the song, Mollenhauer said, [...] "The challenge really was to be able to release all that this song made me feel. I get choked up every time <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it because I think it's such a beautiful moment." [...] Because Esmeralda is voiced by two different actresses, it was mandatory that Mollenhauer's singing voice blend with actress Demi Moore's husky speaking voice [...] "seamlessly." [...] Mollenhauer's performance of [...] "Someday" [...] is featured on the re-release of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.|$|E
500|$|Achebe's {{criticism}} {{has become a}} mainstream perspective on Conrad's work. The essay {{was included in the}} 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of [...] "the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book..." [...] Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism [...] "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." [...] Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: [...] "It's not in my nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it– with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> And read it beside African works." [...] Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled [...] "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": [...] "Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And {{if it were not for}} what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction." ...|$|E
500|$|After Hershiser reached 49 {{consecutive}} innings {{because of}} what some sources describe as an umpire's favorable interference ruling on a double play, the sports media compared him to Drysdale, who had a similar incident occur during his streak. The Houston Chronicle noted that both beneficial calls were in Dodgers–Giants games. However, the press also noted that Hershiser needed another complete game shutout to tie Drysdale and pass Johnson on the all-time consecutive scoreless innings list. In addition to covering the record pursuit, some sportswriters perceived that Hershiser had taken a commanding lead in the Cy Young Award race. Despite the official ruling by MLB statistician Seymour Siwoff that only full innings of starting pitchers count toward the record, some of the press continued {{to refer to the}} record as [...] innings. The pennant race also continued to draw attention as the Dodgers closed in on the NL West division title. An Associated Press article noted that it was Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout. As Hershiser's last remaining start approached, the media mentioned that he needed one more complete game shutout to tie the all-time record. When the total reached 49, Hershiser first began to feel that the record was within reach. Not only were his teammates too superstitious {{to talk to him about}} the streak, Dodgers announcer Drysdale also avoided the subject when talking to Hershiser for fear of jinxing him. Hershiser was not superstitious about the record, saying, [...] "I'm pretty loosey-goosey about it... <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it all the time. I'm not superstitious." ...|$|E

500|$|Themes in Lavigne's music include {{messages}} of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. Lavigne believes her [...] "songs are about being yourself {{no matter what}} and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true." [...] On her debut album, Let Go, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as [...] "Losing Grip", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as [...] "Complicated", saying that [...] "the songs I did with the Matrix... were good for my first record, but I don't {{want to be that}} pop anymore." [...] Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin, had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that [...] "I've gone through so much, so that's what <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about...</b> Like boys, like dating or relationships". Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nü-metal style. [...] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. [...] "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through." [...] Her objective in writing the album was simply to [...] "make it fun". The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs. Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, with Lavigne describing the album as [...] "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional". Ian McKellen defined her as [...] "a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian" [...] on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.|$|E

MTV reported that T.I. confirmed collaborations from Lady Gaga, Kid Rock, Young Dro, Mac Boney and Eminem. T.I. told Rolling Stone about the content he had recorded, [...] "some songs talk about my time in prison — how I was affected by that, the way I've grown from that, things I see now that I may have not seen then, sometimes <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> love, some songs <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> life, some songs <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> me being the shit on every level." [...] Kanye West recorded six songs for the album at Avex Honolulu Studios in Honolulu, Hawaii. T.I. told MTV's Jayson Rodriguez that the song [...] "Castle Walls" [...] (featuring Christina Aguilera) originally belonged to Diddy who had commissioned the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money. But Diddy told T.I. [...] "Yeah, this is my record, but you know what, I think this is a better fit for you. I think you should rock out on this one.

[...] However, on April 15, 2013, Ciara confirmed the album's track listing and simultaneously revealed that her fifth album was now eponymously titled.

2500|$|WASPs do have {{a culture}} — traditions, idiosyncrasies, quirks, {{particular}} signals and totems we pass on to one another. [...] But the WASP culture, {{or at least that}} aspect of the culture <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> is enough in the past so that we can now look at it with some objectivity, smile at it, and even appreciate some of its values. There was a closeness of family, a commitment to duty, to stoic responsibility, which I think we have to say weren’t entirely bad.” In [...] "The Cocktail Hour" [...] (1988) a lead character tells her playwright son that theater critics [...] "don't like us....
