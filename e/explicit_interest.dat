6000|$|I may say at {{once that}} this had seemed to me, under the first flush of recognition, the good mark for the pretty notion of the [...] "free circle" [...] put about by having, of a sudden, an ingenuous mind {{and a pair of}} limpid searching eyes to count with. Half the {{attraction}} was in the current actuality of the thing: repeatedly, right and left, as I have said, one had seen such a drama constituted, and always to the effect of proposing to the interested view one of those questions that are of the essence of drama: what will happen, who suffer, who not suffer, what turn be determined, what crisis created, what issue found? There had of course to be, as a basis, the free circle, but this was material of that admirable order with which the good London never leaves its true lover and believer long unprovided. One could count them on one's fingers (an abundant allowance), the liberal firesides beyond the wide glow of which, in a comparative dimness, female adolescence hovered and waited. The wide glow was bright, was favourable to [...] "real" [...] talk, to play of mind, to an <b>explicit</b> <b>interest</b> in life, a due demonstration of the interest by persons I qualified to feel it: all of which meant frankness and ease, the perfection, almost, as it were, of intercourse, and a tone as far as possible removed from that of the nursery and the schoolroom--as far as possible removed even, no doubt, in its appealing [...] "modernity," [...] from that of supposedly privileged scenes of conversation twenty years ago. The charm was, with a hundred other things, in the freedom--the freedom menaced by the inevitable irruption of the ingenuous mind; whereby, if the freedom should be sacrificed, what would truly BECOME of the charm? The charm might be figured as dear to members of the circle consciously contributing to it, but it was none the less true that some sacrifice in some quarter would have to be made, and what meditator worth his salt could fail to hold his breath while waiting on the event? The ingenuous mind might, it was true, be suppressed altogether, the general disconcertment averted either by some master-stroke of diplomacy or some rude simplification; yet these were ugly matters, and in the examples before one's eyes nothing ugly, nothing harsh or crude, had flourished. A girl might be married off the day after her irruption, or better still the day before it, to remove her from the sphere of the play of mind; but these were exactly not crudities, and even then, at the worst, an interval had to be bridged. [...] "The Awkward Age" [...] is precisely a study of one of these curtailed or extended periods of tension and apprehension, an account of {{the manner in which the}} resented interference with ancient liberties came to be in a particular instance dealt with.|$|E

40|$|Motion {{pictures}} portray childhood sexuality {{by pushing}} the elusive and controversial line between free expression and exploitation. While child pornography laws protect real children as subjects in overtly sexually exploitative motion pictures (kiddy porn), in practice, due {{to issues of}} interpretation, application, and accessibility, free expression in mainstream motion pictures is supported more fully than child protection. Recent Supreme and Circuit Court decisions allow the motion picture industry to more freely portray childhood sexuality without fear of expression becoming illegal. Thus, as our social history illustrates, the societal awareness of the sexuality of children {{is all the more}} satisfied. Legally through what it consumes and where it places its implicit and <b>explicit</b> <b>interests,</b> society supports the sexualization of children. Concomitantly, filmmakers respond with motion pictures that feed society’s desires and push, if not exceed, the bounds of legitimate free expression. The perverse and unintended consequence is that crimes against children continue because child protection efforts forever languish in this history...|$|R

5000|$|The Adequate Information Management in Europe (AIM) Project, a {{multinational}} European social science project conducting several studies on journalism structures and processes of daily reporting about the European Union between 2004 and 2007, found that impulses for European professional journalism are {{not found in}} an <b>explicit</b> <b>interest</b> in European topics or special knowledge concerning European matters, as assumed. Rather, they are determined by [...] "day to day operations and subsequent media performance"13, structural on-site factors, or [...] "on-the-job and trial-and-error" [...] practices. Furthermore, reporting about Europe is determined by national views and national and individual journalistic practices and thus lacking coherence and proper context. The AIM study concludes that these daily deficiencies, neglects and misapprehensions lead to myopic reporting about European matters. The theory of a common European culture on reporting about European matters thus cannot be supported.|$|E
50|$|In the General Possibility Theorem, Kenneth Arrow {{argues that}} if a {{legislative}} consensus can be reached through a simple majority, then minimum conditions must be satisfied, and these conditions must provide a superior ranking to any subset of alternative votes (Arrow 1963).

A vote, by the pure nature of the voting process, demonstrates <b>explicit</b> <b>interest</b> in whatever is voted upon. In logrolling, a superior ranking means that the marginal benefit of the vote is greater than any alternatives, so exchanging votes is worthwhile. The General Possibility Theorem necessitates that allocating one vote for another must constitute true utility and a sincere vote.

40|$|Abstract. The growing {{available}} implicit {{knowledge about}} people in social networks is fostering {{a new generation of}} advanced services centered on the actual needs of persons. Precondition to them is to provide an explicit formal specification of what is known about people taking part in the social network. This specification should be in the terms of a shared conceptualization of one or more domains of interest related to the social network scope. Here we propose a method to provide semantic profiles of people taking part in a social network concerning a specific domain of interest. Our method is an inference process based on the topological structure of the relationships between people, on existing <b>explicit</b> <b>interests,</b> and on the assumption that each person has own beliefs and is partly influenced by friends. In particular, the introduced approach allows estimating a semantic profile of a newcomer, i. e., a new person joining a social network, and how it will evolve over time...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{variables}} that {{might contribute to}} the objectification of masculinity and femininity in politics. Scholar Charlotte Hooper argued that [...] "gender intersects with other social divisions such as class, race and sexuality to produce complex hierarchies of (gendered) identities". [...] Hooper argues that institutional practices, such as military combat in war, have greatly defined {{what it means to}} be a man. Furthermore, the symbolic dimension, which includes sports, media, current affairs, etc. has [...] "disseminated a wealth of popular iconography which links Western masculinities to the wider world beyond the borders of the state". This is where the ideology of lookism is firmly entrenched according to Hooper. Similarly, Laura Shepherd suggests that men are required to fit into the [...] "matrix of intelligibility" [...] by acting a certain way, dressing a certain way, and have a mentality that is devoid of emotion or anything effeminate; if they are successful in becoming the ultimate [...] "man's man" [...] then they are virtually untouchable. However, others have suggested that there is only an <b>explicit</b> <b>interest</b> in the analysis of masculinity within this political sphere, it will be impossible to develop a reliable analysis of femininity within this same sphere.|$|E
5000|$|Child Identity is {{not only}} a {{psychological}} structure, but also a complex subject of contemporary humanitarian science. Identity formation is a complex process that is never completed. When we research the problems of identity we want to answer questions 'Who we are?', 'Do we choose our identity?', 'Is identity given to us or do we create our own?', etc. In a world of change, children are faced with many questions and struggles as they sort out their multiple identities. Children begin to ask identity questions at an early age. Who am I? Who is my family? Where do I belong? Why does my family celebrate some holidays and not others? These are all standard questions children ask to determine how they fit into their world. [...] Erik Erikson (1902-1994) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an <b>explicit</b> <b>interest</b> in problem of child identity. The child identity is a complex socio-cultural phenomenon, which includes a variety of representations of a child about themselves, about the world, about his place in this world. The Child Identity is a dynamic construct that is rapidly changing {{under the influence of the}} environment, education and family. In childhood, identity is a dependent phenomenon, there are a lot of the unconscious factors are affecting to behavior patterns, relationships child with world. Child Identity formed under influence of various factors and stereotypes.|$|E
5000|$|Erik Erikson (1902-1994) {{became one}} of the {{earliest}} psychologists to take an <b>explicit</b> <b>interest</b> in identity. The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity, known as the ego identity (sometimes identified simply as [...] "the self"); the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next, known as the personal identity; and the collection of social roles that a person might play, known as either the social identity or the cultural identity. Erikson's work, in the psychodynamic tradition, aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan. Progressive strength in the ego identity, for example, can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges. The process of forming a viable sense of identity for the culture is conceptualized as an adolescent task, {{and those who do not}} manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of 'identity diffusion' whereas those who retain their initially given identities unquestioned have 'foreclosed' identities (Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 p7-8). On some readings of Erikson, the development of a strong ego identity, along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture, lead to a stronger sense of identity in general. Accordingly, a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion [...]|$|E

To address this problem, researchers have adopted personalized services and filtering systems that rely on user preferences. In this thesis, we present a novel method to model user interests automatically and generate a ranked list of preferences for each user in real time.   The proposed framework here consists of three main steps to automatically model user preferences and generate a ranked list of the user's interests in real time. 1) Through the use of WordNet, a list of keywords which represent <b>explicit</b> <b>interests</b> is extracted from a text document and then implicit user preferences are determined by employing domain ontology. 2) A hierarchical data structure for each user stores interests and is updated for each new document read by that user. Additionally, there is a queue of recently accessed interests for each user that maintains these preferences based upon arrival time. 3) The final step includes generating a ranked list of top K interests for each user in real time. This ranking system employs the user model to create a combined list of both short-term and long-term interests. The results show significant improvement over some widely used methods.   M. S...|$|R

[...] While most of the influence was from figures such as Baudelaire and Verlaine, there was also very strong influence at times from more purely decadent members of the French movement, such as the influence that Huysmans and Rachilde had on Wilde, as seen explicitly in The Picture of Dorian Gray.
