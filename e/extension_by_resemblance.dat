40|$|It’s a platitude – {{which only}} a philosopher would dream of denying – that whereas words are {{connected}} to what they represent merely by arbitrary conventions, pictures {{are connected to}} what they represent <b>by</b> <b>resemblance.</b> The most important difference between my portrait and my name, for example, is that whereas my portrait and I are connected <b>by</b> my portrait’s <b>resemblance</b> to me, my name and I are connected merely by an arbitrary convention. The first aim of this book is to defend this platitude from the apparently compelling objections raised against it, by analysing depiction {{in a way which}} reveals how it is mediated <b>by</b> <b>resemblance.</b> It’s natural to contrast the platitude that depiction is mediated <b>by</b> <b>resemblance,</b> which emphasises the differences between depictive and descriptive representation, with an extremely close analogy between depiction and description, which emphasises the similarities between depictive and descriptive representation. Whereas the platitude emphasises that the connection between my portrait and me is natural in a way the connection between my name and me is not, the analogy emphasises the contingency of the connection between my portrait and me. Nevertheless, the second aim of this book is to defend an extremely close analogy between depiction and description. The strategy of the book is to argue that the apparently compelling objections raised against the platitude that depiction is mediated <b>by</b> <b>resemblance</b> are manifestations of more general problems, which are familiar from the philosophy of language. These problems, it argues, can be resolved by answers analogous to their counterparts in the philosophy of language, without rejecting the platitude. So the combination of the platitude that depiction is mediated <b>by</b> <b>resemblance</b> with a close analogy between depiction and description {{turns out to be a}} compelling theory of depiction, which combines the virtues of common sense with the insights of its detractors...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibilities}} of depicting non-existents, depicting non-particulars and depictive misrepresentation are frequently cited as grounds for denying the platitude that depiction is mediated <b>by</b> <b>resemblance.</b> I first {{argue that these}} problems are really {{a manifestation of the}} more general problem of intentionality. I then show how there is a plausible solution to the general problem of intentionality which is consonant with the platitude. I It is a platitude that whereas words are connected to what they represent merely by arbitrary conventions, depictions are connected to what they represent <b>by</b> <b>resemblance.</b> The important difference between my portrait and my name, for example, is that whereas my portrait is connected to me <b>by</b> my portrait’s <b>resemblance</b> to me, my name is connected to me merely by an arbitrary convention. The objective {{of this paper is to}} reconcile the platitude that depiction is mediated <b>by</b> <b>resemblance</b> with the intentionality of depiction or, in other words, with the problematic {{possibilities of}} depicting non-existents, depicting non-particulars and depictive misrepresentation. The problem of the depiction of non-existents can be appreciated by considering the following trilemma, which consists of three theses which are individually plausible, but jointly inconsistent: (1) All depictions resemble what they represent (2) Resemblance is a relation between existents (3) Some depictions represent non-existent...|$|R
