40|$|Light {{emitting}} diodes (LED) are a {{new source}} for replacing traditional light sources including under water illumination. As traditional underwater light sources operate under a radiative transfer model, the luminous intensity is dispersed evenly at each emission angle, with the scattering factors included in the attenuation coefficient. By contrast, LED light sources are characterized by being highly directional, causing underwater luminous energy to vary with different emission angles. Thus, the traditional theory of underwater optical transfer becomes inapplicable when an underwater LED lighting module is designed. Therefore, to construct an underwater transfer model for LED light sources, this study employed the average cosine of the underwater light field, the method for light scattering probability, the LED luminous <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> (LIDC) and axial luminous intensity. Afterwards, an underwater LED fish-attracting lamp was designed. Experimental results showed that, compared with the simulation values, the luminous intensity of the underwater LED lighting module at all emission angles had a percentage error of less than 10 %...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} an attempt to survey the {{benefits}} of a well-designed photoreactor containing just 6 ultraviolet (UV) high power light emitting diodes (HPLEDs); the power and wavelength of each UV HPLED are 1 W and 365  nm, respectively, the latter being an efficient source for photocatalytic studies. Although the experiment with the 365 -nm LEDs is reported here, other LEDs were predicted for conducting similar experiments including green photocatalytic ones. We installed diodes with respect to the luminescence <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> (LIDCs) or <b>intensity</b> patterns. Then, in order to compare the efficiency of the UV-HPLEDs of the HP-LED photoreactor (HPLED-PhR) with that of traditional UV lamps which are extensively used in photocatalytic processes, a set of UV HPLEDs was designed and made up. Next, the performance of HPLED-PhR was compared with that of a traditional fluorescent lamp photoreactor (FL-PhR). As a typical photocatalytic experiment, Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were synthesized via co-precipitation method and used as photocatalyst for purification of water polluted with the reactive blue dye (RB), under UV irradiation in two photoreactors. The results showed that the rate of photocatalytic reaction under the UV-LEDs was two times greater than the rate under the traditional fluorescent UV lamps, while both electrical power consumption and manufacturing cost of the HPLED-PhR were {{less than a quarter of}} them for the FL-PhR...|$|R

According to the theory that laster emitting from the semiconductor laser has property of partial coherence and double-beam partial coherence principle, employing the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction formula, a novel theoretical model that can describe the far-field distribution of semiconductor laser is proposed and obtained. Compared with some of the existing theoretical models, the new model is not only reliable on reasoning arguments, but also can adjust the parameters such as * ect to describe the far-field intensity distribution of different laser diode.

40|$|Goniophotometry {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{photometric}} measurements in lighting engineering. Aim is to measure spatial characteristics of luminous parts of the luminaires and light sources represented by luminous <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> which is needed for lighting computation at level of the preparation of lighting design. Near-field goniophotometry is still a forthcoming technology widely used in photometric laboratories all over the world. Due to compact design of these systems the laboratory space can be saved and they can be installed in a room of usual dimensions because they do not obey the inverse square law from {{point of view of the}} whole dimension of the luminaire. The principle of these goniophotometers of the luminance distribution is measurement of luminous part of the luminaires and light sources. By integration over solid angle from this fundamental photometric quantity luminous intensity in particular direction in the space represented by two angles depending on measurement planes is derived. Although theoretical principle and physical model is well-known and defined, in practical realisation of this system some problems occur. One of the problems is traceability to SI units. This fact disqualifies near-field goniophotometer in standards relating to goniophotometry. The methods to prove that near-field goniophotometer works are mostly based on computer simulations compared with practical measurements. But in the practice, appropriate calibration method with traceability to the SI units is still not available, unlike it is clearly used for farfield goniophotometers. The paper describes possibility of the calibration of near-field goniophotometers to SI units by standards which should provide fully traceable calibration to the base. Also method of validation of near-field goniophotometric systems is still opened question for future work. At the present, further works continue on the method of validation in the framework of that CIE Division 2 but this topic is out of scope of this Paper...|$|E

Considerable increments of integral reflectivities for different Bragg reflections of such samples in comparison with those calculated for a perfect crystal were detected. Broadening of the spatial <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> for the Bragg-diffracted beams taken by a single crystal spectrometer {{as well as the}} maps of the diffuse isointensity distribution near a reciprocal lattice point, registered by the Philips high-resolution diffractometer, are shown. All of these diffraction effects related to creation of the SiOx precipitates formed on structural damages caused by implantation of oxygen or neon ions and subsequent annealing. Contrary to FZSi, where the appearence of SiOx precipitates was discovered due to intensive diffuse scattering near the layer contained the implanted oxygen ions only, in the case of CZSi samples with larger concentration of oxygen (up to 1 * 10 ¹⁸ at/cm³) such defects were formed not only near the burried layer, created by ions of oxygen or neon (with energy E = 4 MeV, dose 10 ¹⁴cm⁻²) but in a bulk of a crystal.

40|$|Abstract Background: Mammography is {{the primary}} imaging {{technique}} for detection and diagnosis of breast cancer; however, the contrast of a mammogram image is often poor, especially for dense and glandular tissues. In these cases the radiologist may miss some diagnostically important microcalcifications. In order to improve diagnosis of cancer correctly, image enhancement technology {{is often used to}} enhance the image and help radiologists. Methods: This paper presents a comparative study in digital mammography image enhancement based on four different algorithms: wavelet-based enhancement (Asymmetric Daubechies of order 8), Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), morphological operators and unsharp masking. These algorithms have been tested on 114 clinical digital mammography images. The comparison for all the proposed image enhancement techniques was carried out to find out the best technique in enhancement of the mammogram images to detect microcalcifications. Results: For evaluation of performance of image enhancement algorithms, the Contrast Improvement Index (CII) and profile <b>intensity</b> surface area <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> quality assessment have been used after any enhancement. The results of this study have shown that the average of CII is about 2. 61 for wavelet and for CLAHE, unsharp masking and morphology operation are about 2. 047, 1. 63 and 1. 315 respectively. Conclusion: Experimental results strongly suggest that the wavelet transformation can be more effective and improve significantly overall detection of the Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system especially for dense breast.

Due to the modulation of the aperture, many intensity peaks emerge in the <b>intensity</b> <b>distributions</b> of the chirped pulse in the near field.

In the proposed scheme, multiple terminals simultaneously transmit their optical signals to access point (AP) using on-off-keying (OOK) modulation, and the combined optical signals are received by a photodetectors array (PD-array), where multiple PDs are disposed to observe the spatial intensity distri-bution of received signals.
