5|$|Dayton {{has been}} the home for many patents and inventions since the 1870s. According to the National Park Service, citing {{information}} from the U.S. Patent Office, Dayton had granted more patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870. The Wright brothers, inventors of the airplane, and Charles F. Kettering, world-renowned for his numerous inventions, hailed from Dayton. The city was also home to James Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier, the first mechanical cash register, and Arthur E. Morgan's <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump,</b> a flood prevention mechanism that helped pioneer hydraulic engineering. Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African-American poet and novelist, penned his most famous works in the late 19th century and became {{an integral part of}} the city's history.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} engineering applications of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> is to dissipate energy in channels, dam spillways, and similar structures so that the excess kinetic energy does not damage these structures. The rate of energy dissipation or head loss across a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> {{is a function of the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> inflow Froude number and the height of the jump.|$|E

40|$|For {{almost half}} a century, it has been {{suspected}} that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps,</b> which consist of a sudden decrease in downstream velocity and increase in flow thickness, are an important feature of submarine density currents such as turbidity currents and debris flows. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> are implicated in major seafloor processes, including changes from channel erosion to fan deposition, flow transformations from debris flow to turbidity current, and large-scale seafloor scouring. We provide the first direct evidence of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> in a submarine density current and show that the observed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> are in phase with seafloor scours. Our measurements reveal strong vertical velocities across the jumps and smaller than predicted decreases in downstream velocity. Thus, we demonstrate that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> need not cause instantaneous and catastrophic deposition from the flow as previously suspected. Furthermore, our unique data set highlights problems in using depth-averaged velocities to calculate densimetric Froude numbers for gravity currents...|$|R

25|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used choice of design engineers for energy dissipation below spillways and outlets. A properly designed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> can provide for 60-70% energy dissipation of the energy in the basin itself, limiting the damage to structures and the streambed. Even with such efficient energy dissipation, stilling basins must be carefully designed to avoid serious damage due to uplift, vibration, cavitation, and abrasion. An extensive literature has been developed for this type of engineering.|$|E
25|$|In {{the design}} of a dam the energy of the fast-flowing stream over a {{spillway}} must be partially dissipated to prevent erosion of the streambed downstream of the spillway, which could ultimately lead to failure of the dam. This can be done by arranging for the formation of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> to dissipate energy. To limit damage, this <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> normally occurs on an apron engineered to withstand hydraulic forces and to prevent local cavitation and other phenomena which accelerate erosion.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{studies and}} {{modeling}} of type IIb <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> The {{aim of this}} project is to study a so far overlooked possible correlation between a physical model describing type IIa <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> presented by Ellegaard et al. [1999] and observations of type IIb <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps,</b> also known as jumps in the cloverregime, presented by Bush et al. [2006]. The inspiration to do this investigation came from a mathematical study, presented in Hansen et al. [2002] of the model created by Ellegaard et al. [1999], in which solutions resembling structures found in the cloverre- gime are presented. Combining this with the later publication of Bush et al. [2006], we saw an interesting opportunity to study, whether the- se new solutions are able to describe the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> found in the cloverregime. In order to study this we have recreated type IIb <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> experimentally and produced the two-leaf clover and three-leaf clover. From these observations we have gathered both quantitative and qualita- tive data, which are compared with an implementation of the model in Matlab. We conclude that the model reproduces certain characteristics found in type IIb <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps.</b> It corresponds well to an amount of new observations, but it needs further improvements, before {{it is able to}} give more than just qualitative descriptions of the phenomenon...|$|R

25|$|In {{the design}} of a {{spillway}} and apron, the engineers select the point at which a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> will occur. Obstructions or slope changes are routinely designed into the apron to force a jump at a specific location. Obstructions are unnecessary, as the slope change alone is normally sufficient. To trigger the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> without obstacles, an apron is designed such that the flat slope of the apron retards the rapidly flowing water from the spillway. If the apron slope is insufficient to maintain the original high velocity, a jump will occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{height of}} the jump {{is derived from the}} {{application}} of the equations of conservation of mass and momentum. There are several methods of predicting the height of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump.</b>|$|E
40|$|Standard {{analytical}} and empirical results of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> are reanalyzed. The assumption that momentum but not energy is conserved across a jump is abandoned. The limiting case when energy dissipation is maximum is explicitly considered, {{which could be}} useful when <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> are used to dissipate energy. Chow’s empirical results and some recent experimental observations are compared to the present predictions...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that an analogy exists between the flow of a liquid with a free surface and the flow of a {{compressible}} gas. A less accurate analogy has been shown to obtain between <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> and compression shocks. The interaction of shocks can occur in two forms; the regular or two-shock configuration and the Mach or three-shock configuration. The latter configuration is not yet completely understood, either in the case of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> in a free-surface liquid {{or in the case of}} shocks in a compressible gas. This experimental study was primarily concerned with the Mach interactions of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps.</b> The conclusions of this study are: (a) there is a definite disagreement between experiment and existing theory; (b) a depth discontinuity, or wave, rather than a velocity discontinuity separates the region behind the Mach wave from the region behind the reflected wave; (c) there is evidence that, for interactions of weak <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps,</b> there is a deviation from constant depth between waves; (d) the Mach wave is convex for the interaction of the stronger <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps,</b> but is concave for the interaction of weak hydraulic jumps; (e) measurements should not be made so as to allow for curvature of the Mach without considering the curvature of the incident and reflected waves in the neighborhood of the triple point...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{analytical}} framework for internal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps.</b> Density <b>jumps</b> or internal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> occur when a supper critical {{flow of water}} discharges into a stagnant layer of water with slightly different density. The approach used here is control volume method which {{is also used to}} analyze ordinary <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps.</b> The important difference here is that entrainment is taken into account. Using conservation equations with the aid of some simplifying assumptions we come to an equation that gives jump downstream height as function of jump upstream characteristics and the entrainment. To determine the magnitude of downstream height we use an experimental equation for calculating the entrainment. Finally we verify our framework by comparing the height that we gain from the derived equation with some experimental data. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
25|$|Another {{variation}} of the moving <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> is the cascade. In the cascade, a series of roll waves or undulating waves of water moves downstream overtaking a shallower downstream flow of water.|$|E
25|$|The other {{stationary}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> {{occurs when}} a rapid flow encounters a submerged object which throws the water upwards. The mathematics behind this form is more complex and will need {{to take into account}} the shape of the object and the flow characteristics of the fluid around it.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{negotiate}} waterfalls and rapids by leaping or jumping. They {{have been}} recorded making vertical jumps as high as 3.65 metres (12ft). The height {{that can be achieved}} by a salmon depends on the position of the standing wave or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> {{at the base of the}} fall, as well as how deep the water is.|$|E

25|$|The {{stationary}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> is {{most frequently}} seen on rivers and on engineered {{features such as}} outfalls of dams and irrigation works. They occur when a flow of liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of the river or engineered structure which can only sustain a lower velocity. When this occurs, the water slows in a rather abrupt rise (a step or standing wave) on the liquid surface.|$|E
25|$|Turbidity {{currents}} {{can result}} in internal hydraulic jumps (i.e., hydraulic jumps as internal waves in fluids of different density) in abyssal fan formation. The internal hydraulic jumps {{have been associated with}} salinity or temperature induced stratification as well as with density differences due to suspended materials. When the slope of the bed (over which the turbidity current flows) flattens, the slower rate of flow is mirrored by increased sediment deposition below the flow, producing a gradual backward slope. Where a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> occurs, the signature is an abrupt backward slope, corresponding to the rapid reduction in the flow rate at the point of the jump.|$|E
25|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> is a {{phenomenon}} in the science of hydraulics which is frequently observed in open channel flow such as rivers and spillways. When liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of lower velocity, a rather abrupt rise occurs in the liquid surface. The rapidly flowing liquid is abruptly slowed and increases in height, converting some of the flow's initial kinetic energy into an increase in potential energy, with some energy irreversibly lost through turbulence to heat. In an open channel flow, this manifests as the fast flow rapidly slowing and piling {{up on top of}} itself similar to how a shockwave forms.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} {{document}} free surface elevations and free surface length scales in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> with Froude numbers between 1. 98 and 4. 82. Although information on bubble size, frequency, and velocities in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> is available in the literature, there is not much data on the features of the free surface, or on mixing layer thickness. In the present case, measurements at the free surface have been realized with two "homemade" miniature resistive wire gauges made of two parallel 50 mu m diameter wires 1 mm apart. These instruments were calibrated dynamically over a range of frequencies up to 20 Hz. The present results extend the range of Froude numbers for which two-phase measurements in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> are available. In most respects, it confirms earlier results obtained with different experimental techniques. Length scales at the free surface are deduced front a cross-correlation analysis of wire gauge measurements, and are compared with similar data obtained from images of the surface...|$|R
40|$|Movable weirs {{have been}} {{developed}} to address the weaknesses of conventional fixed weirs. However, the structures for riverbed protection downstream of movable weirs are designed using the criteria of fixed weirs in most cases, and these applications cause problems, such as scour and deformation of structures, due to misunderstanding the difference between different types of structures. In this study, a hydraulic experiment was conducted to examine weir type-specific hydraulic phenomena, compare <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> and downstream flow characteristics according to different weir types, and analyze hydraulic characteristics, such as changes in water levels, velocities and energy. Additionally, to control the flow generated by a sluice gate, energy dissipators were examined herein for their effectiveness in relation to different installation locations and heights. As a result, it was found that although sluice gates generated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> similar to those of fixed weirs, their downstream supercritical flow increased to eventually elongate the overall <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps.</b> In energy dissipator installation, installation heights were found to be sensitive to energy dissipation. The most effective energy dissipator height was 10 % of the downstream free surface water depth in this experiment. Based on these findings, it seems desirable to use energy dissipators to reduce energy, as such dissipators were found to be effective in reducing <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> and protecting the riverbed under sluice gates...|$|R
25|$|Using Figure 3 and {{knowledge}} of the upstream and downstream conditions and the depth values {{on either side of the}} gate, a general estimate of the profiles upstream and downstream of the gate can be generated. Upstream, the water surface must rise from a normal depth of 0.97 m to 9.21 m at the gate. The only way to do this on a mild reach is to follow an M1 profile. The same logic applies downstream to determine that the water surface follows an M3 profile from the gate until the depth reaches the conjugate depth of the normal depth at which point a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> forms to raise the water surface to the normal depth.|$|E
25|$|A {{tidal bore}} is a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> which {{occurs when the}} {{incoming}} tide forms a wave (or waves) of water that travel up a river or narrow bay against {{the direction of the}} current. As is true for hydraulic jumps in general, bores take on various forms depending upon the difference in the waterlevel upstream and down, ranging from an undular wavefront to a shock-wave-like wall of water. Figure 3 shows a tidal bore with the characteristics common to shallow upstream water – a large elevation difference is observed. Figure 4 shows a tidal bore with the characteristics common to deep upstream water – a small elevation difference is observed and the wavefront undulates. In both cases the tidal wave moves at the speed characteristic of waves in water of the depth found immediately behind the wave front. A key feature of tidal bores and positive surges is the intense turbulent mixing induced by the passage of the bore front and by the following wave motion.|$|E

40|$|Presence {{of steps}} in radial stilling basins affect {{positively}} or negatively {{the characteristics of}} the free <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> (A and B jumps) depending upon the type of the step (positive or negative), the height of the step, the position of the step in the basin and the dominant flow conditions. The effects of all these factors on {{the characteristics of the}} free radial <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> are addressed through the present experimental investigation. The results indicated that the negative A jump is more compact than the negative B jump at the same flow conditions. The B jump produces higher depth ratio than A jump and in turn the A jump dissipates more energy than the B jump. The optimal position of the step that produces the minimum length of jump begins at or beyond 50 % of the basin length downstream from the gate. The results are compared with the previously developed theoretical models. Statistical models are proposed for predicting the characteristics of the free radial <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> formed at negative step.
