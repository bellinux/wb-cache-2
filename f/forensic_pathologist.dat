5|$|Carre's has {{produced}} a number of notable alumni {{in a range of}} fields and professions. In politics, this includes Sir Robert Pattinson (1872–1954), Member of Parliament and Chairman of Kesteven County Council, and his brother Samuel (1870–1942), also a Member of Parliament and businessman. The diplomat Peter Bateman (b. 1955), who served as the British Ambassador to Bolivia, Luxembourg and Azerbaijan, was also a pupil at the school. Carrensians in the military include Air Marshal Barry North (b. 1959) and Captain George Baldwin CBE DSO (1921–2005), who served in World War II and as Director of Naval Air Warfare in the mid-1960s. The lawyer and controversialist John Austin (1613–1669) was educated at Carre's, along with the Royalist poet Thomas Shipman (1632–1680) and the non-conformist clergyman Andrew Kippis FRS (1725–1795). Science is represented by the chemist Kenneth Wade FRS (1932–2014), a professor at Durham University and the <b>forensic</b> <b>pathologist</b> Iain West (1944–2001). In sports, the school {{has produced}} at least two professional footballers: Paul Holland (b. 1973), who played for Mansfield Town, Sheffield United, Chesterfield and Bristol City, and Mark Wallington (b. 1952), who played for England under 23s and Leicester City.|$|E

25|$|<b>Forensic</b> <b>pathologist</b> Professor David Ransom, who {{compared}} wounds {{suffered by}} Halvagis to the wounds suffered by Patterson and Maher, told the inquest there was insufficient {{evidence to suggest}} the wounds suffered by Halvagis were inflicted using the same knife or by the same person who had murdered Dupas' other victims.|$|E
30|$|The diverse {{presentation}} of syphilis led William Osler {{to refer to}} syphilis as “a great imitator” of other diseases (Nyatsanza and Tipple 2016; Sabre et al. 2016; Dourmishev and Dourmishev 2005). As such, <b>forensic</b> <b>pathologists</b> should pay attention to its myriad of manifestations. This case highlights the need for <b>forensic</b> <b>pathologists</b> to perform a complete autopsy to {{determine the cause of}} death in cases of acute thromboembolism with neurosyphilis, including detailed histopathological examination, serological assessment, and genetic testing with PCR techniques, paying attention to the trend of infectious diseases.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{explores the}} efforts of <b>forensic</b> <b>pathologists</b> in the United States to {{establish}} the intellectual and social territory of their specialty, {{both inside and outside}} of medicine, and to control the institutional context of its practice. This process pitted <b>forensic</b> <b>pathologists</b> againstpowerful political machines for control of the coroner’s office, where the application of medical knowledge legitimized social policy; against the legal profes-sion for control of the application of forensic science in the courts; and against fellow members of the American medical profession for control of entry to the specialty...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to stand-up comedy, Newhart became a dedicated character actor.

25|$|In October 2012, {{the final}} post mortem report was {{submitted}} to police by the <b>forensic</b> <b>pathologist.</b> It {{concluded that the}} precise cause of death could not be determined, nor the exact time of death. It could, however, establish several facts, for example, that Giskegjerde Schjetne had suffered massive blunt force trauma to the head, chest and abdominal region, and that many of Giskegjerde Schjetne's injuries were inflicted after her death.|$|E

25|$|In 1997 {{doctor and}} <b>forensic</b> <b>pathologist</b> Robert Bucklin {{constructed}} a scenario {{of how a}} systematic autopsy on {{the man of the}} shroud would have been conducted. He noted the series of traumatic injuries which extend from the shoulder areas to the lower portion of the back, which he considered consistent with whipping; and marks on the right shoulder blade which he concluded were signs of carrying a heavy object. Bucklin concluded that the image was of a real person, subject to crucifixion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Forensic</b> <b>pathologist</b> Martin Sage {{performed}} the autopsy the next day, and found Elliott died from blood loss. Two wounds pierced {{her heart and}} one lung, with other wounds to her neck and throat severing the main artery and the major vein. In total she received 216 separate injuries, mostly stab wounds from a knife blade, with some inflicted by scissors. Additionally there were seven blunt force injuries. The pathologist found some defensive wounds, and that the attack targeted aspects of beauty and was intended to disfigure.|$|E

25|$|In {{his book}} The Crucifixion of Jesus, {{physician}} and <b>forensic</b> <b>pathologist</b> Frederick Zugibe studied the likely {{circumstances of the}} death of Jesus in great detail. Zugibe carried out a number of experiments over several years to test his theories while he was a medical examiner. These studies included experiments in which volunteers with specific weights were hanging at specific angles and the amount of pull on each hand was measured, in cases where the feet were also secured or not. In these cases the amount of pull and the corresponding pain was found to be significant.|$|E
25|$|An inquest {{into his}} death was held at Westminster Coroner's Court on 26 February 2013. The jury {{returned}} a verdict of accidental death. Those who gave evidence included his Surrey teammates Jade Dernbach and Rory Hamilton-Brown, {{who had been with}} him earlier in the evening of his death. The post-mortem on Maynard revealed that he was nearly four times over the legal drink-drive limit and had also taken cocaine and ecstasy in the form of MDMA. A <b>forensic</b> <b>pathologist</b> said that {{it was not possible to}} say whether electrocution or being hit by the train was the cause of death.|$|E
25|$|Six {{forensic}} experts {{hired by}} Mrs. Duggan examined Shove's autopsy report and photographs taken by accident investigators in Wiesbaden. A <b>forensic</b> <b>pathologist</b> suggested that bruises on Duggan's {{hands and arms}} were defensive injuries. Paul Canning, a forensic photographer formerly with the Metropolitan police, and Alan Bayle, a forensic scientist, suggested that Duggan may have died elsewhere and been placed at the scene. Bayle argued that the Peugeot windscreen had been hit with a crowbar or similar, while Canning wrote that he found nothing {{to suggest that the}} cars had made contact with Duggan. Two other forensic experts expressed similar views.|$|E

50|$|In the United Kingdom, Membership of the Royal College of Pathologists {{is not a}} {{prerequisite}} of appointment as a Coroner's Medical Expert, i.e. doctors in the UK that are not <b>forensic</b> <b>pathologists</b> or pathologists are allowed to perform medicolegal autopsies, {{simply because of the}} vague wording of 'The Coroners Act', which merely stipulates a 'suitably qualified medical practitioner', i.e. anyone on the GMC Register.|$|R
