40|$|This {{article is}} focused on the <b>helicopter</b> <b>approach</b> to landing on {{offshore}} objects. It describes <b>helicopter</b> <b>approaches</b> and specially designed approaches for the sea. The evaluation of safety in aviation is shown with applications to SOAP approach as well. The <b>helicopter</b> <b>approach</b> to the landing can be considered as part of aviation, which has long been neglected because helicopters are represented only by a minuscule percentage in the overall volume of civil aviation. Because of this, the approach procedures were not designed especially for helicopters, but this type of aircraft with a vertical take-off and landing has irreplaceable role in certain operating situations...|$|R

5000|$|October 19, 2001, Dalbandin, Pakistan — U.S. Army Rangers, Task Force 3/75 MH-60K Black Hawk — As {{the search}} and rescue <b>helicopter</b> <b>approached</b> to land at night, it caused a brownout, {{obscuring}} the landing area.

40|$|Morphology of the <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> {{through the}} facial recess for {{cochlear}} implant surgery is classified into five types {{based on the}} topographical relationships between the facial nerve, chorda tympani nerve, round window niche and the posterior meatal wall. These five types and/or an absolute value of {{the width of the}} <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> are closely related to the difficulty in surgery. Some radiological parameters seem to be useful for presurgical estimation of this difficulty. The partial removal of the posterior meatal wall, rather than to sacrifice the chorda tympani nerve, is strongly recommended for providing wider <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> in difficult cases. (Received March 2, 2001 and accepted March 23, 2001),人工内耳手術における顔面神経窩アプローチ経路の形態は、顔面神経・鼓索神経・正円窓窩・外耳道後壁の解剖学的位置関係によって 5 つの型に分類される。これらの 5 つの型及びアプローチ経路の幅の絶対値は、手術の難易と密接に関連している。画像診断のパラメーターのなかには、この難易度を術前に検討するために有用と思われるものもある。困難例においては、より広いアプローチ幅を確保するためには、鼓索神経を損傷するおそれのある術式は避け、外耳道後壁を部分的に除去すべきであ経を損傷するおそれのある術式は避け、外耳道後壁を部分的に除去すべきである...|$|R

50|$|Soon, the <b>helicopter</b> <b>approaches</b> Agon, {{which remains}} unusually {{motionless}} as the rescue crew {{make their way}} down to the boat still held within its mouth.

50|$|Further <b>approach</b> <b>routes</b> to {{the airport}} {{were built in the}} first decade of the 21st Century. The Northern Airport Line (机场北线), {{completed}} between 2005 and 2006, connected the Jingcheng Expressway with the northern part of the airport, to form a northern <b>approach</b> <b>route.</b> The route commences at Lutong, just over halfway between the 5th Ring Road and the 6th Ring Road, on the Jingcheng Expressway. In 2008, another route, the 2nd Airport Expressway, was built between the eastern 5th Ring Road and the airport in time for the Beijing Olympics. Both routes have significantly alleviated traffic {{to the airport}} from the city proper.|$|R

50|$|Helicopter In-Flight Refueling (HIFR) is a {{variation}} of aerial refueling when a naval <b>helicopter</b> <b>approaches</b> a warship (not necessarily suited for landing operations) and receives fuel through the cabin while hovering.

[...] This helicopter WAAS criteria offers as low as 250 foot minimums and decreased visibility requirements to enable missions previously not possible. [...] On April 1, 2009, FAA AFS-400 approved the first three <b>helicopter</b> WAAS GPS <b>approach</b> procedures for Hickok & Associates' customer California Shock/Trauma Air Rescue (CALSTAR).
