We argue that vertical social transmission in different habitats has led to significant geographical <b>genetic</b> <b>structure</b> of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes. Dolphins with mtDNA haplotypes E or F are found predominantly in deep (more than 10 m) channel habitat, while dolphins with a third haplotype (H) are found predominantly in shallow habitat (less than 10 m), indicating a strong haplotype–habitat correlation. Some dolphins in the deep habitat engage in a foraging strategy using tools. These ‘sponging’ dolphins are members of one matriline, carrying haplotype E. This pattern is consistent with what had been demonstrated previously at another research site in Shark Bay, where vertical social transmission of sponging had been shown using multiple lines of evidence.

Such studies help understand the bases of crop evolution and conservation in relation to farmers' practices. In this study, we assessed the <b>genetic</b> <b>structure</b> underlying landrace diversity of dry-season sorghum. This crop constitutes a historical model of innovation developed by farmers to extend sorghum cultivation to the dry season. Two types of dry-season sorghum are cultivated. We aimed to assess the link between farmers' taxonomy and molecular <b>genetic</b> <b>structure.</b> We collected both types of dry-season sorghum in two villages of northern Cameroon which represented 20 landraces. These landraces were genotyped using eight polymorphic microsatellite markers. This study compared two clustering methods: a Bayesian method (STRUCTURE) {{which is based on}} explicit genetic assumptions and the discriminant analysis of principal component method. The latter, more recently proposed, is based on the combination of principal component analysis and discriminant analysis. We noticed a general congruence between these two methods. We also used both methods to infer the <b>genetic</b> <b>structure</b> of our sample. Our results showed strong <b>genetic</b> <b>structuring</b> of the landraces, with K ¼ 14 genetic clusters. We then analysed the fit between farmers' taxonomy and <b>genetic</b> <b>structure.</b> The data suggested that each type and each landrace corresponds to a given genetic entity. This pattern was robust across both villages, despite differences in cultural practices. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Study of the <b>genetic</b> <b>structure</b> specificity, intra- and interpopulation genetic {{variation}} of the brood stocks of Ukrainian scaled carp from different fish farms of Ukraine using DNA markers (ISSR-PCR). Methodology. A PCR (ISSR-PCR) method with appropriately selected primers {{has been used to}} investigate the <b>genetic</b> <b>structure</b> specificity. Findings. The <b>genetic</b> <b>structure</b> analysis of Ukrainian scaled carp has been carried out using three microsatellite DNA loci: (AGC) 6 G, (AСC) 6 G, (AGC) 6 С. In total, 55 amplicons were detected for all primers. Fifteen primers were detected when using (AGC) 6 G primer, 17 for (AСC) 6 G primer and 23 for (AGC) 6 С primer. The molecular weight on electropherograms had maximum values when using (AСC) 6 G primer (500 n. p. – 3500 n. p.) in Nyvky carp. The detected specific differences between the examined populations of scaled carp depend on their genetic origin. Variations of the detected amplicons are sufficient for separating individual fish or, if works are carried out with a group of broodfish, for selecting parental pairs for increasing genetic diversity. Originality. The use of ISSR-markers allowed detecting the peculiarities of the <b>genetic</b> <b>structure,</b> level of <b>genetic</b> variability of the brood stocks of Ukrainian scaled carp. For the first time, we obtained new data on the specificity of the <b>genetic</b> <b>structure</b> when using PCR techniques, which allow detecting specific mechanisms of the maintenance of the relative stability of the genetic material of Ukrainian scaled carps and allow controlling and preserving the specificity of their <b>genetic</b> <b>structure.</b> Practical value. Proposition of a method for the genetic control of Ukrainian scaled carp stocks based on the application of PCR techniques, which allows performing an analysis of the <b>genetic</b> <b>structure</b> of fish stocks and using the genetic information at early stages of breeding selection process...|$|R
