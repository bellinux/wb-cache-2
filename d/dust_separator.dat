40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to improve the}} productivity and lower the expense of existing vacuum blasting technology. This technology is used to remove radioactive contamination, PCBs, and lead-based paint and provides worker protection by continuously recycling the material and dust for the decontamination tasks. The proposed work would increase the cleaning rate and provide safe and cost-effective decontamination of the DOE sites. This work focuses on redesigning and improving existing vacuum blasting technology including blast head nozzles, ergonomic handling of the blast head by reducing its weight; brush-ring design, vacuum level regulator, efficiency of the <b>dust</b> <b>separator,</b> and operational control sensors. The redesign is expected to enhance the productivity and economy of the vacuum blasting system by at least 50 % over current vacuum blasting systems. There are three phases in the project. Phase I consists of developing and testing mathematical models. Phase II consists of pre-prototype design and fabrication and pre-prototype unit testing. Phase III consists of prototype design and field verification testing. In phase I, mathematical models are developed and analyzed for the nozzle, blast head, wind curtain, and <b>dust</b> <b>separator,</b> first as individual devices and then combined as an integrated model. This allows study of respective airflow and design parameters. The Contractor shall, {{based on the results of}} the mathematical modeling studies, design experimental models of the components and test these models. In addition, the Contractor shall develop sensors to detect the relationship of the blast head to the blast surfaces and controls to minimize the dependency on an operator's skill and judgment to obtain optimum positioning, as well as real-time characterization sensors to determine as the blast head is moving the depth to which coatings must be removed, thereby improving production and minimizing waste. In phase II, the Contractor shall design and construct a pre-prototype of the nozzle, blast head with wind curtain, sensors, and <b>dust</b> <b>separator</b> and test this system to assess the performance of the new design under controlled conditions at the contractor's facility. In phase III, the Contractor shall design and construct a prototype of the High Productivity Vacuum Blasting System, based on the results of the pre-prototype design and testing performed. This unit will be a full-scale prototype and will be tested at a designated Department of Energy (DOE) facility. Based on the results, the system performance, the productivity, and the economy of the improved vacuum blasting system will be evaluated...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCyclone <b>Dust</b> <b>Separators</b> are devices {{often used}} to filter solid {{particles}} from flue gas. Such cyclones are supposed to filter as much particulate matter from the gaseous stream as possible. At the same time, they should only introduce minimal pressure loss to the system. Hence, collection efficiency has to be maximized and pressure loss minimized. Both the collection efficiency and pressure loss are heavily influenced by cyclone geometry. In this paper, we optimize inner geometrical construction of multichannel cyclone to up cleaning efficiency parameter. This study shows how geometry involves cleaning efficiency. At air flow rates from 12 m/s to 18 m/s after researches the optimal cleaning efficiency achieved in the three level cyclone at 16 m/s average air flow rate in cyclone channels, when the treated air is polluted with 20 μm size granite particles and flow distribution ratio is 75 / 25.

40|$|Genetic Programming (GP) is an {{evolutionary}} algorithm for the automatic discovery of symbolic expressions, e. g. computer programs or mathematical formulae, that encode solutions to a user-defined task. Recent advances in GP systems and computer performance {{made it possible}} to successfully apply this algorithm to real-world applications. This work offers three main contributions to the state-of-the art in GP systems: (I) The documentation of RGP, a state-of-the art GP software implemented as an extension package to the popular R environment for statistical computation and graphics. GP and RPG are introduced both formally and with a series of tutorial examples. As R itself, RGP is available under an open source license. (II) A comprehensive empirical analysis of modern GP heuristics based on the methodology of Sequential Parameter Optimization. The effects and interactions of the most important GP algorithm parameters are analyzed and recommendations for good parameter settings are given. (III) Two extensive case studies based on real-world industrial applications. The first application involves process control models in steel production, while the second is about meta-model-based optimization of cyclone <b>dust</b> <b>separators.</b> A comparison with traditional and modern regression methods reveals that GP offers equal or superior performance in both applications, with the additional benefit of understandable and easy to deploy models.

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the NASA global tropospheric {{research}} program is understanding the chemical processes which influence the chemistry of the natural troposphere. An important element of this program is the study of the role of heterogenous chemistry in global tropospheric chemical cycles. Any study of the part which clouds play in the chemistry of tropospheric trace constituents requires a determination of cloud water chemical composition. There exists, therefore, a need for highly efficient collector devices which can obtain unbiased samples of cloud water in sufficient quantities aboard an aircraft platform. A promising concept which could meet the dual requirements of accurate sampling and efficient collection of cloud water droplets in the vortex generator. This concept involves an inertial separator which uses the centrifugal force of a rotating airstream.

40|$|The {{production}} {{of high quality}} hot metal in the steel-making industry with relatively low costs, {{is the most important}} prerequisite for an economically competitive quality/price ratio of the steel products. At a blast furnace the energy and mass balances are influenced by circulating materials like alkali, zinc and lead. Whereas the elements of the top gas are monitored by mass spectroscopy, the circulation materials that leave the blast furnace via the top gas dust, were not detectable so far. Up to now the metals in the dust are determined by taking samples at the <b>dust</b> <b>separator</b> and chemical analysis in the laboratory. In the scope of an European R&D project a measuring set-up based on LIBS was developed and evaluated in on-site tests at the top gas tube of two different blast furnaces to monitor continuously the circulation materials in order to assist the process control and optimise the blast furnace operation as well as to contribute to close the metallurgical mass balances...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of two filter media used in industrial air cleaning were studied {{both in the}} initial state (new filter) and {{after a number of}} collection and pulse pressure cleaning cycles. The main difference between them is that one has anti-clogging properties and the other does not. The test aerosol is composed of alumina particles with a median volumetric diameter of 2. 6 mm (MMAD= 4. 8 mm) generated at a concentration of 700 mg m 23. Filtration took place at a velocity of 2 cm s 21. Two parameters, namely pressure drop and efficiency, were monitored according to the collection and cleaning cycles. The comparison of the filtration efficiency of the two media and that of the corresponding industrial <b>dust</b> <b>separator</b> {{at the end of the}} cycles showed a close agreement. The separation efficiency calculated with a new medium (corresponding to initial switch-on of the installation) was low and increased very quickly during the cycles.

40|$|Biomass gasifiers {{of fixed}} bed, {{downdraft}} type are generally used for driving internal combustion engines. As part of research work, a versatile, throat type, biomass gasifier was developed. The gasifier had facilities for bed temperature measurements, pressure measurements, physical observation, sampling of bed particles, bed agitation, etc. The generated producer gas was cleaned and cooled in downstream components namely, cyclone <b>separator,</b> <b>dust</b> filter and gas cooler such that water had no {{direct contact with}} producer gas.

Bed temperatures and bed char properties viz., weight, volume, density and volatile matter content along the gasifier axis, wood feeding rate, gasification air and producer gas flow rates, etc. were observed and analyzed during the gasification of wood pieces. Temperature stratification was found to depend on biomass bed height, phase of operation, location of reaction zones and reactor pressure.

40|$|AbstractThe {{article is}} devoted to the {{improvement}} of environmental safety while reducing emissions of dust exhausting by decreasing dusting schemes of aspiration into atmosphere within the construction industry. The use of high- effective dust capturing devices, reducing leakage degree of dust particles thrown out from aspiration cutting dust schemes {{is one of the most}} promising and effective ways to decrease dust emissions at the cement producing enterprises. The article shows some summary results of the field power determination for dust emission, dust of sand and expanded clay, leak out of equipment, workplaces and aspiration schemes of expanded clay and cement manufacturing enterprises. The results of the analysis of dust particles with various dimensions and the experimental determination of the degree of dust separating apparatuses’ leaking out was used for design and development of the new wet dust cleaner -separator. The experiments were carried out to get the leakage's degree of dust particles thrown out from this new wet cleaner’ modification at the industrial plants. The statistical treatment of the experimental results allowed us to get dependence of the leakage of dust's particles in these wet <b>dust</b> cleaners - <b>separators</b> within the studied aerodynamic range of work regime.

40|$|The LTC 1073 Vacuum Blasting Machine uses a high capacity, direct {{pressure}} {{blasting system}} incorporating a continuous feed for the blast media. The blast media cleans the surface within the contained brush {{area of the}} blast head. A vacuum system removes dust and debris from the surfaces as it is blasted. After cleaning the surface, the abrasive, together with the rust or coating that {{was removed from the}} surface, is vacuumed into the machine through the suction hose. The <b>dust</b> <b>separator</b> contains angled steel collision pads, working with the force of gravity, to allow any reusable abrasive to fall back into the pressure vessel. The filters are manually back flushed to prevent clogging. After back flushing, dust is dumped from the dust chamber into the dust collection bag or drum by operation of the bellows valve. The safety and health evaluation during the testing demonstration focused on dust and noise exposure. Dust exposure was found to be minimal, but noise exposure was potentially significant. Further testing for each of these exposures is recommended because the outdoor environment where the testing demonstration took place may cause the results to be inapplicable to indoor settings. It is feasible that the dust and noise levels will be higher in an enclosed operating environment. Other safety and health issues found were ergonomics, heat stress, tripping hazards, lockout/tagout, and arm-hand vibration...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Numerical Model and {{analysis}} on {{performance of a}} straight-through swirl tube cyclone Soroush Saberi A numerical simulation for the rotational flow inside a special configuration of inertial gas-solid separators is performed. The inertial gas-solid separator of the present work can be fit in category of straight-through swirl tube cyclones. Using the results of parametric studies a modified geometry configuration for the inertial gas-solid separator is achieved which shows considerable performance improvement {{in comparison with the}} original model. In this approach, the CAD model for the original geometry of the <b>dust</b> <b>separator</b> was generated and the turbulent flow field was solved using time-independent solver and Reynolds stress turbulence model. The solution approach demonstrates consistency with the a vailable experimental data proving the accuracy of the solution method. The highly rotational flow pattern and its features are described by analyzing the different flow variables. The main contributors of the pressure loss production in the flow field are identified and the most effective geometry parameters are recognized in order to perform the parametric analysis. The modifications are implemented on the original geometry and flow simulation is performed for each new configuration with the same solution method as used for the original model. The flow field changes are evaluated by comparing the contours of flow variables and the generated pressure loss for each case are compared with original configuration. Considering the results of parametric studies, a final model was made and solved numerically. The results show that the final modifications will result in considerable improvements in the amount of pressure loss while preserves the same dust collection efficiency...|$|E

This technique has broadly spread in Campania Region and for it, it is not required a meadow around the trees. After having performed some tests for the considered harvest technique, the characteristic parameters of working capacity, working quality and energy costs have been evaluated. Further, it has been faced the problems due to the soil dusts. to identify a filtering system capable of reducing the great amounts of dusts introduced in the environment during the process of hazelnuts picking up by means turbo-aspirating machines. The main types of dust removers for medium-thin dusts have been studied and examined; a comparative exam proved the mechanical removal by cyclone (centrifugal <b>dust</b> <b>separator)</b> to be the most effective. Therefore, two prototype filters were examined, each consisting of four cyclones with a turning diameter of mm 350 and mm 250 respectively. Field tests showed the effectiveness of the system; the 350 mm multi-cyclone proved to have a dust removing capacity of 90 %, with no reduction in performance caused by the dust that goes through it, while the 250 mm removes 93. 75 %, with a reduction in performance of approximatevely 30 %. However, {{it would be a mistake}} to give preference to the former over the latter, as its better performance does not compensate, in terms of environment hygiene, the 3. 75 % difference which, though seemingly slight, represents a further reduction of 50 % of the thinner dust contained in the atmospher...|$|E
40|$|The term “technogenic particles” {{is used to}} {{describe}} airborne particulate matter (PM) produced during industrial processes. The most common of these is “fly ash” produced during combustion of solid and liquid fossil fuels. Coal fly ash {{is derived from the}} mineral and metal contaminants within coal in which particles (1) are distinctly spherical in shape, (2) are composed of 60 – 90 % glass, and (3) often contain a range of contaminant metals. In addition, particles may contain recrystallized minerals, mainly quartz, mullite, and hematite; both quartz and mullite are recognized respiratory hazards. Fly ash particles from both UK and Chinese coal-burning power stations were characterized by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (morphology and size), x-ray diffraction (crystallinity and minerals), and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectroscopy (elemental composition). PM 10 samples were separated from bulk fly ash by a dry <b>dust</b> <b>separator</b> system. The plasmid scission assay (PSA) was used to measure damage produced by fly ash to plasmid bacteriophage ΦX 174 RF DNA. The supercoiled DNA was either damaged or severely damaged by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the fly ash at different concentrations. Geochemical analyses confirmed that the fly ash particles are predominantly glass, with a minor component of the minerals quartz, hematite, and mullite. Fly ash particles also contained a range of metals contaminants; however, these were mostly bound into the glass with only a small proportion potentially bioaccessible. PSA data showed that fly ash exhibited significant oxidative capacity when compared to negative control (MB H 2 O), indicating that ROS are likely to be the driving force underlying fly ash bioreactivity...|$|E
