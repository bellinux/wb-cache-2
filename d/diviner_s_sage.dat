The Christopher Center Library has no dedicated employees who work solely with its IR, ValpoScholar, and instead relies on a mix of interns and other employees to create records and upload works in their spare time. VU has had some success in finding faculty works for ValpoScholar through self-submissions for an annual celebration of faculty research and by searching databases but {{wanted to see if}} there was still a better way. In Fall 2014, the library began to develop a new workflow with the goal of automating parts of record creation and copyright checks so that VU could sustain growth. Although a small number of university and research libraries have published their workflows, most of those deal with DSpace-based repositories, meaning it’s hard if not impossible to adapt them for repositories run through Digital Commons, which includes ValpoScholar.

40|$|The {{information}} {{required for the}} development and growth of an organism is encoded in its deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the genetic material. Mutations, or changes to the information content of a cell’s DNA, can result in developmental defects or genetic diseases that may occur {{at any point in}} one’s life. Cancers are genetic diseases resulting from mutations that disrupt the ability of cells and tissues to control their own growth and proliferation. Given the critical importance of maintaining the integrity of the information encoded by DNA, evolution has resulted in various means by which a cell can either avoid mutations resulting from DNA damage, or repair damage once it has occurred. Despite the fact that all cells suffer continuous DNA damage caused either by normal metabolic processes, e. g., DNA replication and cell division, or by exposure to various environmental carcinogens, e. g. sunlight, tobacco and car exhaust, cells have a remarkable ability to both minimize the rate of mutation and to repair DNA damage. Human cells have five distinct enzyme systems that repair DNA damage, and the importance of each of these “DNA repair pathways” is highlighted by the fact that defects in any of the five result in higher incidences of specific types of cancers. In this Chapter we describe how each of these pathways operates to protect cells from acquiring mutations. Additionally, we briefly discuss recent ideas supporting an important role for stem cells in limiting the cancer potential of cells and tissues that have accumulated DNA damage.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} master the field of {{scholarly}} discourse surrounding John Chrysostom 2 ̆ 7 s motivations and aims for his theology of wealth and poverty. The study takes care to situate Chrysostom in his social, political, and theological contexts. Then the paper sets out to examine ancient attitudes toward Chrysostom and his theology. Then a comprehensive description of modern Chrysostomic studies is attempted. These approaches are grouped into three broad categories. The first is the theistic factor category, which encompasses scholars who understand Chrysostom primarily from a theological standpoint. The second category is the social-scientific approach. Practitioners of this method seek to examine Chrysostom through the scrutiny of social history. The third and final category involves an approach that takes seriously {{the ways in which}} Chrysostom was shaped by desert monasticism. These divergent approaches combine to form a robust dialogue about a man of lasting influence in the area of wealth and poverty. The study does read each source critically by acknowledging strengths and weaknesses. The thesis also seeks to synthesize the approaches in order to construct a solid framework through which Chrysostom can be accurately read. Finally, the thesis seeks to interject Chrysostom 2 ̆ 7 s Late Ancient theology into the contemporary and emerging Christian conversation regarding the disparity between the wealth of North American Christians and the poverty of Majority World Christians. Chapter one introduces the reader to Chrysostom and the major proposals concerning his motivations and aims. The survey of these proposals reveals the three major categories within Chrysostomic studies: the theistic factor, social-scientific, and the influence of desert monasticism. The chapter also provides a brief biography and an introduction into the social and political mores of Late Antiquity. Chapter two offers a summary of the theology in question.

In the introduction I focused on examining parts of the communication which is based on verbal and non-verbal speech. The symbolic code belongs to the verbal speech which is analytical, conventional and arbitrary. The interpretation of the symbolic code depends also on the cultural unit. The iconic code on the other hand could be motivated or conventional depending on the way the message is brought up to the reader. The iconic code could need the accompaniment of the verbal code to make the message clearer to the interpreter. Seymour Chwast in his illustrations for example found necessary to use the help of the text to describe better his way of illustrating Dante 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Divine</b> Comedy.

40|$|The Saturnian {{radiation}} belts {{have not}} received {{as much attention as}} the Jovian radiation belts because they are not nearly as intense-the famous Saturnian particle rings tend to deplete the belts near where their peak would occur. As a result, {{there has not been a}} systematic development of engineering models of the Saturnian radiation environment for mission design. A primary exception is that of Divine (1990). That study used published data from several charged particle experiments aboard the Pioneer 1 1, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 spacecraft during their flybys at Saturn to generate numerical models for the electron and proton radiation belts between 2. 3 and 13 Saturn radii. The Divine Saturn radiation model described the electron distributions at energies between 0. 04 and 10 MeV and the proton distributions at energies between 0. 14 and 80 MeV. The model was intended to predict particle intensity, flux, and fluence for the Cassini orbiter. Divine carried out hand calculations using the model but never formally developed a computer program that could be used for general mission analyses. This report seeks to fill that void by formally developing a FORTRAN version of the model that can be used as a computer design tool for missions to Saturn that require estimates of the radiation environment around the planet. The results of that effort and the program listings are presented here along with comparisons with the original estimates carried out by Divine. In addition, Pioneer and Voyager data were scanned in from the original references and compared with the FORTRAN model s predictions. The results were statistically analyzed in a manner consistent with <b>Divine</b> <b>s</b> approach to provide estimates of the ability of the model to reproduce the original data. Results of a formal review of the model by a panel of experts are also presented. Their recommendations for further tests, analyses, and extensions to the model are discussed...|$|R
