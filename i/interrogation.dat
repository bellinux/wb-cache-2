40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} coordination of interrogator and suspects’ verbal behavior in <b>interrogations.</b> Sixty-four police <b>interrogations</b> were examined at the aggregate and utterance level using a measure of verbal mimicry known as Language Style Matching. Analyses revealed an interaction between confession and the direction of language matching. <b>Interrogations</b> containing a confession were characterized by higher rates of the suspect matching the interrogators’ language style than <b>interrogations</b> without a confession. A sequence analysis of utterance-level Language Style Matching revealed a divergence {{in the type of}} matching that occurred across outcome. There was a linear increase in interrogator-led matching for <b>interrogations</b> containing a confession and an increase in suspect-led matching for nonconfession <b>interrogations.</b> These findings suggest that police <b>interrogations</b> play out, in part, at the basic level of language coordinatio...|$|R

5|$|Nasser's {{return to}} Egypt coincided with Husni al-Za'im's Syrian coup d'état.

Abdel Hadi was also hesitant to take drastic measures against the army, especially in front of its chief of staff, who was present during the <b>interrogation,</b> and subsequently released Nasser.

40|$|<b>Interrogations</b> and {{elections}} were two branches of Arabic judicial astrology made available in Latin translation to readers in western Europe from the twelfth century. Through {{an analysis of}} the theory and practice of <b>interrogations</b> {{and elections}}, including the writing of the Jewish astrologer Sahl b. Bishr, this essay considers the extent to which judicial astrology was practiced in the medieval west. Consideration is given to historical examples of <b>interrogations</b> and elections mostly from late medieval English manuscripts. These include the work of John Dunstaple (ca. 1390 – 1453), the musician and astrologer who is known have served at the court of John, duke of Bedford. On the basis of the relatively small number of surviving historical horoscopes, it is argued that the practice of <b>interrogations</b> and elections lagged behind the theory...|$|R
