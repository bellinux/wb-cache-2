5000|$|The PCV valve is a {{variable}} orifice {{that controls the}} flow <b>of</b> <b>crankcase</b> fumes, admixed with fresh air admitted to the crankcase by the breather, into the intake tract. With no manifold vacuum, a restrictor—generally a cone or ball—is held by a light spring in a position exposing the full size of the valve's orifice to the intake manifold. With the engine running, the restrictor is drawn towards the orifice by manifold vacuum, restricting the opening proportionate {{to the level of}} engine vacuum vs. spring tension. At idle, manifold vacuum is high, but a large amount of extra air would amount to a vacuum leak, causing the engine to run too lean and/or too fast. So at high manifold vacuum, the PCV valve allows only a low flow rate. This is in accordance with the low volume <b>of</b> <b>crankcase</b> fumes generated at low engine speeds. At higher engine speeds, with less manifold vacuum, the PCV valve permits a greater flow rate {{to keep up with the}} greater volume <b>of</b> <b>crankcase</b> fumes; because <b>of</b> the higher engine speed, a greater amount of [...] "extra" [...] air via the PCV system can be tolerated without upsetting the engine's running. At full throttle, very little manifold vacuum is present, so there is little flow through the PCV valve. However, this is the condition under which the maximum volume <b>of</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>gas</b> is present. Most of it escapes under its own pressure via the crankcase breather, flowing into the engine's intake tract via the air cleaner.|$|R
50|$|Intake {{manifold}} vacuum {{is applied to}} the crankcase via the PCV valve, drawing fresh air into the crankcase via the breather. The airflow through the crankcase and engine interior sweeps away combustion byproduct gases, including a large amount of water vapour which includes dissolved chemical combustion byproducts. This mixture <b>of</b> air and <b>crankcase</b> <b>gases</b> then exits, often via another simple baffle, screen, or mesh to exclude oil droplets, through the PCV valve and into the intake manifold. On some PCV systems, this oil baffling takes place in a discrete replaceable part called the 'oil separator'.|$|R
50|$|Uniquely among flat engines a boxer twin {{suffers from}} {{differences}} in crankcase pressures as the pistons alternately compress {{and expand the}} <b>crankcase</b> <b>gases.</b> This issue is usually addressed by means <b>of</b> a <b>crankcase</b> breather, as in the BMW R90S. This crankcase pumping effect is also found on singles and 360° parallel twins. Crankcase pressure differentials have scope for providing a form of supercharging, but while such an innovation {{has yet to be}} used on a production engine, it has been used to aid lubrication.|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} is {{presented}} statistical analysis {{of the effect of}} compression-ignition engine working time on the phenomenon of exhaust gas maximum pressure increase in crankcase and cylinder liner, pistons and rings wear. Characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>crankcase</b> maximum pressure variations were made for the start-up speed and for selected rotational speeds of the 359 compression-ignition engine crankshaft as well as micrometric measurements of the cylinder liner and pistons and rings wear. The engine was operated under normal traction conditions while pressure analyses and cylinder liner micrometric measurements were made, respectively, after an operational run <b>of</b> 204864 km. <b>Crankcase</b> exhaust <b>gas</b> maximum pressure measurements were made both with air vent open and closed for a cold (lubricating oil temperature of 285 K) and a warm engine (333 K). Basing on the analysis of obtained examination results, it was showed that <b>crankcase</b> exhaust <b>gas</b> maximum pressure measurement (also during the start-up) may be used for determination of engine run and life. Average and maximum wear and tear of cylinder liners, maximum wear and tear of pistons in the perpendicular plane to the piston pin axis, dependency <b>of</b> maximum <b>crankcase</b> pressure in the function of operational mileage of a 359 engine for lubricating oil temperature of 333 K, dependency <b>of</b> maximum <b>crankcase</b> pressure in the function of operational mileage for lubricating oil temperature of 285 K are presented...|$|R

50|$|In {{automotive}} parlance, windage {{refers to}} parasitic {{drag on the}} crankshaft due to sump oil splashing on the cranktrain during rough driving, and/or dissipating energy in turbulence from the cranktrain moving the <b>crankcase</b> <b>gas</b> and oil mist at high RPM. Windage may also inhibit the migration of oil into the sump {{and back to the}} oil pump, creating lubrication problems. Some manufacturers and aftermarket vendors have developed special scrapers to remove excess oil from the counterweights and windage screens to create a barrier between the crankshaft and oil sump.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy <b>of</b> Loughborough University. <b>Crankcase</b> ventilation contributes significantly to diesel engine particulate emissions. Future regulations will not only limit the mass of particulate matter, but also the number of particles. Controlling the source <b>of</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> is critical to meeting the perennial legislation. Deficiency in the understanding <b>of</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> generation and the contribution of lubricating oil has been addressed in detail by the experimental study presented in this thesis. A plethora of high speed laser optical diagnostics techniques have been employed to deduce the main mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>crankcase</b> oil aerosol generation. Novel images have captured oil atomisation and passive oil distribution around the <b>crankcase</b> <b>of</b> an optically accessed, motored, four cylinder, off highway, heavy duty, diesel engine. Rayleigh type ligament breakup of oil films present {{on the surface of}} dynamic components, most notably the crankshaft, camshaft and valve rockers generated oil drops below 10 micrometers. Data illustrated not only crankcase oil aerosol generation at source, but it has provided valuable information on methods to control oil aerosol generation and improve oil circuit efficiency. The feasibility of utilising computational fluid dynamics to predict crankcase oil aerosol generation has been successfully assessed using the experimental data. Particle sampling has characterised the crankcase emissions from both a fired and motored diesel engine <b>crankcase.</b> The evolution <b>of</b> submicron <b>crankcase</b> particles down to 5 nm has been recorded from both engines, including the isolated contribution of engine oil, at a wide range of engine test points. Results have provided constructive insight into the generation and control <b>of</b> this complex <b>emission.</b> The main mechanism <b>of</b> <b>crankcase</b> oil aerosol generation was found to be crankshaft oil atomisation. This atomisation process has been analysed in detail, involving high speed imaging of primary and satellite drop generation and high speed digital particle image velocity of the crankshaft air flow. A promising mechanism of regulating and controlling crankcase oil aerosol emissions at source has been studied experimentally...|$|R

40|$|A {{crankcase}} is {{the lower}} part of engine which in single cylinder two-stroke engine the main function is to hold the crankshaft in parallel position and work as a vacuum medium to suck the combustion material.

50|$|The road draft tube, though simple, has shortcomings: it {{does not}} {{function}} when the vehicle is moving too slowly to create a draft, so postal and other slow-moving delivery vehicles tended to suffer rapid buildup of engine sludge due to poor crankcase ventilation. And non-road vehicles such as boats never generated a draft on the tube, no matter how fast they were going. The draft tube discharged the <b>crankcase</b> <b>gases,</b> composed largely <b>of</b> unburnt hydrocarbons, directly into the air. This created pollution as well as objectionable odors. Moreover, the draft tube could become clogged with snow or ice, in which case crankcase pressure would build and cause oil leaks and gasket failure.|$|R

50|$|Not all petrol engines have PCV valves. Dragsters {{sometimes}} use a scavenger {{system and}} venturi tube in the exhaust {{to draw out}} combustion gases and maintain {{a small amount of}} vacuum in the crankcase to prevent oil leaks on to the race track. Small two stroke engines use the crankcase to partially compress incoming air; all <b>crankcase</b> <b>gases</b> are thus burned in the regular flow of air and fuel through the engine. Many small four-stroke engines such as lawn mower engines and small gasoline generators, simply use a draft tube connected to the intake, between the air filter and carburetor, to route all blow by back into the intake mixture. The higher operating temperature of these small engines prevents large amounts of water vapor and light hydrocarbons from condensing in the engine oil.|$|R
