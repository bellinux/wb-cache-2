5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which she does. The sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> throne, the lid of which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City.|$|E
60|$|Patsy, {{standing}} before her, looked <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> worn {{face with a}} pitying expression.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> {{glass and}} was silent. He leaned a little towards her.|$|E
60|$|Something in her {{movement}} struck him. He came towards her, and bending <b>down</b> looked <b>into</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|R
60|$|Cecil {{assumed a}} most lugubrious {{expression}} and looked <b>down</b> sympathetically <b>into</b> <b>her</b> tear-stained face. She certainly was uncommonly pretty.|$|R
6000|$|Something in her {{movement}} struck him! He came towards her, and bending <b>down</b> looked <b>into</b> <b>her</b> face. [...] "Teresa! Good God!--look at me! What has happened?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mary {{took the}} little lady's hands in hers and looked affectionately <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|E
60|$|He took a {{step towards}} her and stood looking <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> face. Her eyes dropped.|$|E
60|$|He {{understood}} her. He {{took her}} hand in his and looked <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> upturned face.|$|E
60|$|The tall tunnelman, looking <b>down</b> <b>into</b> {{the depths}} of Peggy's sunbonnet, saw {{something}} in the round blue eyes and grave little mouth that made him think so too. But here Peggy's serious little face took a shade of darker concern as her arm went <b>down</b> deeper <b>into</b> <b>her</b> pocket, and her eyes got rounder.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} {{something}} in {{the attitude of the}} two struck her, something that her instincts told her was uncommon, and she stood irresolute. Isobel stepped to her as though to take the list, and, bending <b>down,</b> whispered <b>into</b> <b>her</b> ear.|$|R
6000|$|They heard footsteps. Miss Pinnegar {{was coming}} to look for her. Ciccio set <b>her</b> <b>down,</b> looked long <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes, inscrutably, smiling, and said: ...|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes. It was his {{instinct}} {{to say at}} once he would take her.|$|E
60|$|Lord Greystoke {{raised her}} head and looked <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes, his own smiling and filled with the light of happiness.|$|E
60|$|He {{advanced}} to meet her, and setting his hands upon her shoulders, {{he held her}} at arm's length, looking <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E
60|$|And here Wealth--although a bank {{director}} {{and chairman of}} several boards, and capable of making a neat, if weakly, speech on economic laws and the currency when occasion required--was dumb before Poverty. Indeed, though he had often theorised about that stricken creature, he had never before fairly hunted <b>her</b> <b>down,</b> run <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> den, and fairly looked her in the face.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is all, sir. Thank you, sir. Good day, sir." [...] And having {{once more}} slid <b>down</b> telescope-wise <b>into</b> <b>her</b> scanty petticoats, {{the old woman}} departed. At the same moment Madame de Cintre came in by an {{opposite}} door. She noticed {{the movement of the}} other portiere and asked Newman who had been entertaining him.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{few minutes}} {{afterwards}} {{a knock at}} the door was heard, and the monthly nurse entered. She held something in her embrace; but he could not see what. He looked <b>down</b> pryingly <b>into</b> <b>her</b> arms, and at the first glance thought that it was his umbrella. But then he heard a little pipe, and he knew that it was his child.|$|R
6000|$|... "Somebody {{has come}} in," [...] she whispered. Jasper, holding her clasped closely to his breast, and looking <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> face, {{suggested}} casually: ...|$|E
60|$|So easily had the Hawk swooped <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> life, {{coming by}} chance, but glad to remain. So easily {{had he been}} driven away.|$|E
60|$|The Baroness {{was talking}} to her husband in a low voice, as he looked <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> pale face, with its gentle blue eyes.|$|E
60|$|With some impatience she {{snatched}} the mirror {{from the young}} slave's hand, and then she {{put it on the}} pillow and looked straight <b>down</b> <b>into</b> it, whilst <b>her</b> hair fell like golden curtains down each side of her face.|$|R
6000|$|May {{looked up}} in his face as she asked the question. There was {{something}} in the look and in the tone which caused George Aspel's heart to beat like a sledge-hammer. He stooped <b>down,</b> and, looking <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes,--still in a brotherly way, said-- ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him. The ashiness {{had gone out of}} her face. Her eyes were bright, and as she lifted them towards him a golden {{softness}} and mistiness came into the centre of each of them, as though he might look <b>down</b> through them <b>into</b> <b>her</b> soul.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Mrs. Dobbs Broughton had gone <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own drawing-room, had tucked herself {{up on the}} sofa, and had fallen fast asleep.|$|E
60|$|As {{the door}} closed, his arms {{went out and}} around her. Then he stood with {{his hands on her}} {{shoulders}} and looking <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him, half-smiling, half doubtful. He {{put his arm}} round her and looking <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes, with his face very close to hers, said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three houahs {{and a half}} ago!" [...] she said. [...] "No! {{you most}} jost go. Ah'm tahed to death. Good-night. You can come in the mawning to see-papa." [...] She {{opened the door and}} pushed him out with enrapturing violence, and he ran {{laughing}} <b>down</b> the steps <b>into</b> <b>her</b> father's arms.|$|R
50|$|She {{pulled him}} <b>down</b> with <b>her</b> <b>into</b> the clear water,He gasped as death started the {{grip on his}} soul.His life ebbed away as she dragged him still further,And laughed when she saw she'd {{accomplished}} her goal."- Charlotte Lester.|$|R
60|$|Bo's scream rang in her ears; {{she felt}} the wet grass under her face and then the strong hands that lifted her. Dale loomed over her, bending <b>down</b> to look <b>into</b> <b>her</b> face; Bo was {{clutching}} her with frantic hands. And Helen could only gasp. Her breast seemed caved in. The need to breathe was torture.|$|R
60|$|Once {{he looked}} <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes and smiled, {{and the girl}} had to close her own to shut out the vision of that handsome, winning face.|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes later}} the launch lay lurching beneath the steamer's high, black side, while a man leaned out from her slanted bridge above, looking <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|Birkin looked <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes, {{which were}} blue, and {{watching}} heavily. He {{could not understand}} them. 'Am I my brother's keeper?' he said to himself, almost flippantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could be}} happy with her," [...] cried he, convulsively, [...] "in a hovel!--I could go <b>down</b> with <b>her</b> <b>into</b> poverty and the dust!--I could--I could--God bless her!--God bless her!" [...] cried he, {{bursting}} into a transport of grief and tenderness.|$|R
60|$|While he was singing, {{his voice}} began to break, and tears came rolling down his cheeks, and Margaret Rooney put <b>down</b> <b>her</b> face <b>into</b> <b>her</b> hands {{and began to}} cry along with him. Then a blind beggar by the fire shook his rags with a sob, and after that there was no one of them all but cried tears down.|$|R
60|$|Knight and Stephen had {{advanced}} {{to where they}} once stood beside Elfride on the day all three had met there, before she had herself gone <b>down</b> <b>into</b> silence like <b>her</b> ancestors, and shut her bright blue eyes for ever. Not until then did they see the kneeling figure in the dim light. Knight instantly recognized the mourner as Lord Luxellian, the bereaved husband of Elfride.|$|R
