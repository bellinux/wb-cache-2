5|$|On January 26, 1905, Jim Hogg {{suffered}} an injury in a train accident. For {{the next year}} Ima nursed him {{as he struggled to}} regain his health, but on March 3, 1906, she <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> father dead in his bed. Ima was devastated; to quell her grief, her brother William took her to New York City. During her stay she immersed herself in concerts and museums.|$|E
5|$|Although Dickinson's acquaintances {{were most}} likely aware of her writing, {{it was not until}} after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> cache of poems—that the breadth of her work became {{apparent}} to the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Daedalus– A {{brilliant}} architect, Daedalus {{constructed the}} labyrinth in which Pandora was imprisoned after Zeus <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> existence. Zeus also promised to reunite Daedelus {{with his son}} Icarus as a reward, but never revealed that Icarus was already dead. Kratos encountered Daedalus hanging {{in a part of}} the labyrinth and the architect revealed that the labyrinth must be united to free Pandora. Daedelus was killed when Kratos united the labyrinth and left a message in blood encouraging Kratos to get even with Zeus for him. The character was voiced by Malcolm McDowell in God of War III.|$|E

5|$|Detectives also {{investigated}} {{the death of}} a woman who had been a colleague of Smith at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had not treated the death as suspicious, but after they <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> connection to Smith, her body was exhumed for a second post mortem. This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing that the cause of her death could not be determined.|$|E
5|$|Larter {{said she}} was a tomboy until she turned 13. Suddenly she sprouted six inches, gained weight and {{significant}} curves. The next year she was signed by the Ford modeling agency. Larter began her modeling career at the age of 14 when a modeling scout <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> on the street and was asked to star in a Phillies commercial; this led to a modeling contract with the prestigious Ford Modeling Agency in New York. Larter subsequently skipped her senior year to model in Australia, Italy, and Japan, the latter a country she would temporarily settle in at the age of seventeen.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas Sander, a Catholic recusant born c. 1530, was {{committed}} to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England. In his De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, {{he was the first}} to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand. Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any. Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were <b>discovered.</b> <b>Her</b> frame was described as delicate, approximately 5'3", with finely formed, tapering fingers.|$|E

5|$|Sailing to {{intercept}} the Haitian ship, Yeo <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> in the Gulf of Léogane and ordered Gaspard to surrender. The Haitian refused, and the frigates exchanged shots at 06:30. The superior seamanship and discipline on Southampton prevented Gaspard from boarding the British ship with his greater numbers and within {{half an hour}} Heureuse Réunion was dismasted and battered. At 07:45 the Haitian ship surrendered, Yeo depositing the crew ashore and bringing Heureuse Réunion to Port Royal, Jamaica. At Jamaica, his actions were approved by his superiors and Heureuse Réunion, renamed Améthyste, was returned to Henri Christophe.|$|E
5|$|The McClintock {{family moved}} to Brooklyn in 1908 and McClintock {{completed}} her secondary education there at Erasmus Hall High School; she graduated early in 1919. She <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> love of science and reaffirmed her solitary personality during high school. She wanted to continue her studies at Cornell University's College of Agriculture. Her mother resisted sending McClintock to college, for fear {{that she would be}} unmarriageable. McClintock was almost prevented from starting college, but her father intervened just before registration began, and she matriculated at Cornell in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Adam Michael Goldstein {{was born}} on March 30, 1973, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents, Andrea and Herbert – {{both of whom were}} Jewish – had been unable to {{conceive}} children naturally, and they had adopted Goldstein's older sister Lana a year before his birth. Goldstein's mother left her husband temporarily after she caught him having extramarital sex with a man. During this time she had an affair herself, and she found out she was pregnant with Adam after returning to her husband. While heavily pregnant, she <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> husband had been adulterous a second time, and then she angrily disclosed to him that he was not the biological father of her baby.|$|E

5|$|Initially overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of marrying, Marguerite Louise's ebullience faded to dismay when she <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> half-sister, despite initially favouring the Tuscan match, then changed her mind. In reaction, Marguerite Louise's behaviour became erratic: she shocked the court by going out unaccompanied, a grievous offence in contemporary French society, with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her marriage by proxy, on 19 April 1661, did nothing to change her attitude, much to the annoyance of Louis XIV's ministers. On the day she was supposed to meet diplomats offering their congratulations on the wedding, she attempted to abscond and go hunting, only to be stopped by the Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E
5|$|In early 2003, The Walt Disney Company and Square Enix {{confirmed}} {{the sequel to}} their commercially and critically acclaimed video game, Kingdom Hearts (2002). That July, the games creator Tetsuya Nomura aimed to have the game in stores by 2004, but several legal issues regarding the approval of characters and aesthetics from the Disney franchise obscured this, such as the Tarzan world being denied due {{to a change in}} ownership. Regarding the games theme song, the producer only had Utada in mind as he felt she was part of the franchise's family, and believed her music could break both foreign and international markets. But scheduling time with Nomura proved to be impossible, as the singer started work on her debut English album in her hometown New York City; she had been signed to Island Def Jam the previous year as their headquarters <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> success in Japan. Though her debut Western release Exodus was a success in Japan, its commercial appeal was lacking in North America; after promoting it, she moved back to Tokyo to start recording her record Ultra Blue (2006).|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 2014, a {{day after}} the Twitter controversy, Sunanda was found dead in room number 345 of the Leela Palace hotel in Chanakyapuri, New Delhi, where the couple had shifted to, as their house was being renovated and painted. Shashi Tharoor <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> body, when she did not wake up from her sleep in the evening. He {{informed}} the Delhi Police, who recovered the body from the hotel and sent it for postmortem. According to initial reports, Sunanda was suspected to have committed suicide. Later reports stated that {{the cause of death was}} unnatural; the doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences gave a preliminary autopsy report that revealed injury marks on her body. They said that these injuries may or may not be the cause of death. The autopsy indicated that she died of drug overdose, most likely a combination of sedatives, other strong medicines and probably alcohol. An investigation has been ordered by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to examine the cause of poisoning and to ascertain if it was murder or suicide. Her body was cremated at Lodhi Crematorium in South Delhi.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt was {{a member}} of the {{prominent}} American Roosevelt and Livingston families and a niece of President Theodore Roosevelt. She had an unhappy childhood, having suffered the deaths of both parents and one of her brothers at a young age. At 15, she attended Allenwood Academy in London and was deeply influenced by its feminist headmistress Marie Souvestre. Returning to the U.S., she married her fifth cousin once removed, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in 1905. The Roosevelts' marriage was complicated from the beginning by Franklin's controlling mother, Sara, and after Eleanor <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> husband's affair with Lucy Mercer in 1918, she resolved to seek fulfillment in a public life of her own. She persuaded Franklin to stay in politics after he was stricken with debilitating polio in 1921, which cost him the normal use of his legs, and Roosevelt began giving speeches and appearing at campaign events in his place. Following Franklin's election as Governor of New York in 1928, and throughout the remainder of Franklin's public career in government, Roosevelt regularly made public appearances on his behalf, and as First Lady while her husband served as President, she significantly reshaped and redefined the role of that office during her own tenure and beyond, for future First Ladies.|$|E
5|$|Stephenie Meyer {{says that}} the idea for Twilight came {{to her in a}} dream on June 2, 2003. The dream was about a human girl, and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood. Based on this dream, Meyer wrote the {{transcript}} of what is now chapter 13 of the book. Despite having very little writing experience, in a matter of three months she had transformed that dream into a completed novel. After writing and editing the novel, she signed a three-book deal with Little, Brown and Company for $750,000, an unusually high amount for a first time author. Meyer's literary agent, Jodi Reamer of Writers House, <b>discovered</b> <b>her</b> only because the inexperienced assistant who received Meyer's original letter did not know that young adult books are supposed to be 40,000 to 60,000 words in length, not 130,000 words. Megan Tingley, the Little, Brown editor who signed Meyer, said that halfway through the reading of the Twilight manuscript, she realized that she had a future bestseller in her hands. The book was released in 2005.|$|E
