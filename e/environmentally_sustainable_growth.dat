40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{show that}} the {{commonly}} observed decline in primary (natural resource using) sector output and employment shares, often termed structural change, can be explained as an endogenous response {{to the presence of}} nature’s constraint. Structural change takes place even if consumer preferences are homothetic, and technological progress does not discriminate against the primary sector. Under certain conditions, structural change allows an open economy to grow with natural resource sustainability. Sustained and <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> economic <b>growth</b> is possible even if the natural resource is exploited under open access. Well-defined property rights are neither necessary, nor sufficient for <b>sustainable</b> <b>growth.</b> We show that there is no unique relationship between natural resource endowment and the rate of economic growth over the long run.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Today, Economic and {{environmental}} performance are tightly closed to each other. The natural environment {{plays an important}} role in supporting economic activity; directly, by providing resources and raw materials such as water, timber and minerals that are required as inputs for the production of goods and services; and indirectly, through services provided by ecosystems including carbon sequestration, water purification, managing flood risks, and nutrient cycling. Natural resources are, therefore, vital for securing economic growth and development, not just today but for future generations. Economic growth has also provided developing countries the opportunity to improve the quality of life of their citizens, and to balance the environmental challenges they face. Investment, aid and demand for imports from advanced economies all have an important role in supporting economic growth and development through the world. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the role of the natural environment in supporting and contributing to economic growth, and the role of environmental policy in achieving improved environmental outcomes in ways that are compatible with the long-term health and stability of the economy. It does not try to answer the question of what the sustainable level of economic growth might be, but instead reviews the evidence and sets out an approach for securing <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> economic <b>growth</b> for current and future generations...|$|R

At the same time, environmentally friendly innovation can foster economic development.

This study {{concentrated}} {{to examine}} ecological modernization process and sustainability of Chinese provinces. The examination {{focused on the}} differences between the westernmost and the easternmost China. Data of Chinese Statistical Yearbook was used during the years 2001 – 2010. Analyses were implemented with SPSS 20. and Excel 2010. Among general statistical analysis, Principal Component Analysis and a relatively new sustainability window analysis were carried out in this study. The new sustainability method was used to determine the minimum (socially <b>sustainable)</b> and maximum (<b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable)</b> economic <b>growth</b> level in certain sociotechno- economic production system. Among sustainability analysis of the provinces, other {{purpose of the study was}} to test the sustainability window assessment tool at provincial level (earlier applied at national comparisons). Sustainability assessment was done for 25 provinces, which were located in the westernmost and the easternmost China. The sustainability assessment concentrated to study changes in socio-techno-economic production systems of each provinces. The method can produce three different outputs of analysed regions: socially and <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> regions; only socially <b>sustainable,</b> but <b>environmentally</b> unsustainable regions; socially and environmentally unsustainable regions. The method aimed to examine ecological modernization process of provinces and this meant that three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, environmental, socio-cultural) were taken into account in the analyses. In practice, the analyses were implemented by using GDP as economic dimension, SO 2 emissions to illustrate environmental dimension, and composite indicator of social well-being (consisted of private owned vehicles, employment and literacy) reflecting socio-cultural dimension of sustainable development. The composite indicator was built based on the analysis of the Principal Component Analysis. Main results can be divided into three different categories: the easternmost provinces with sustainability window and actual economic growth in side of the window (totally sustainable regions), the easternmost provinces with sustainability window and economic growth outside of it (only socially sustainable regions), and the westernmost provinces without sustainability window (unsustainable regions). As a summary, the first group of division had relatively succeeded ecological modernization process and, their sociotechno- economic production systems were able to change into sustainable. In the second group, ecological modernization process succeeded to change tracks of socio-technoeconomic production systems towards sustainable direction, but efficiency the systems weren't enough for <b>sustainable</b> economic <b>growth.</b> The third group of provinces had very inefficient socio-techno-economic production systems, and the whole structure of the system wasn't proper for <b>sustainable</b> economic <b>growth...</b>|$|R

40|$|Chilean {{salmon farming}} has been {{considered}} as an outstanding example of success after growing at double digit rates {{for more than twenty}} years. While the expansion was indeed dramatic, it came at the expense of severe sanitary and environmental deterioration. The outbreak in 2008 of the infectious salmon anaemia, a viral disease that kills salmon, but does not affect humans, has made this utterly clear. The overexploitation of the ‘commons’ upon which the industry has grown and the lack of an adequate regulatory mechanism to monitor adverse environmental effects contributed to this disaster, which now threatens the future of the industry and the country benefiting from its natural comparative advantage for salmon farming. The paper shows that activities based on the exploitation of a common pool resource require quite a different analytical approach than the one conventional neoclassical theory offers us for the understanding of firm and industry behaviour.
