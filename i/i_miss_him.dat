It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E
2500|$|In the novels, Hastings's {{literary}} function changes with Poirot's method. In the earlier phase of his career, Hastings is valued for his imaginative approach to cases, inevitably {{giving rise to}} fanciful hypotheses that Poirot gently mocks. Poirot himself characterised Hastings thus in [...] "The Mystery of the Spanish Chest" [...] (1932): How my dear friend, Hastings, would have enjoyed this! What romantic flights of imagination he would have had. What ineptitudes he would have uttered! Ah ce cher Hastings, at this moment, today, <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him...</b> Later in her career, Christie's apparatus is less fanciful and the opportunity for wild speculation much diminished. When {{the need for a}} sidekick arises in the later novels and stories it is either as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Holden's first {{starring}} role was in Golden Boy (1939), costarring Barbara Stanwyck, {{in which he}} played a violinist-turned-boxer. He was still an unknown actor at the time, while Stanwyck was already a film star. She liked Holden and went {{out of her way}} to help him succeed, devoting her personal time to coaching and encouraging him, which made them into lifelong friends. When she received her Honorary Oscar at the 1982 Academy Award ceremony, Holden had died in an accident just a few months prior. At the end of her acceptance speech, she paid him a personal tribute: [...] "I loved him very much, and <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish".|$|E
60|$|Then I threw a cake of {{soap and}} a {{toothbrush}} at <b>him.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>him,</b> and he passed on.|$|R
60|$|I told you--it seems ages ago, now--how <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> at Melbourne, {{and then}} chased {{him all over}} Australasia for months on end.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is he alive? Is he here? I {{should be}} {{glad to see him}} again; and indeed, <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> sorely. <b>I</b> have been here for two years, having been {{appointed}} to a command among the troops here." ...|$|R
2500|$|William Holden and Stanwyck {{were friends}} of long standing. [...] When Stanwyck and Holden were {{presenting}} the Best Sound Oscar for 1977, Holden paused {{to pay a}} special tribute to her for saving his career when Holden was cast in the lead for Golden Boy (1939). After a series of unsteady daily performances, {{he was about to}} be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden's death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: [...] "A few years ago I stood on this stage with William Holden as a presenter. I loved him very much, and <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cantrell was a {{close friend}} of former Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, who he {{described}} as his best friend. Staley died in April 2002 at the same time of Cantrell's Degradation Trip tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, [...] "It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it [...] I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.". [...] "The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's {{one of those things where}} if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again." [...] Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said: [...] "Jerry really loved Layne. They had a bond I haven't seen before." [...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stageâ€”there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what can}} have become of him?" [...] thought Sammy. [...] "I've got no love for him, {{but just the}} same <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> I really must find out. Yes, Sir, I really must." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Every {{one down}} for luncheon!" [...] Jeanne declared. [...] "What energy! Where is Lord Ronald, by the by?" [...] she added, {{looking around the}} room. [...] "He promised to take me out sailing this morning. I wonder if <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> on the marshes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> at the cross-roads," [...] said Grace. [...] "I {{was going}} to Allerby, and my father asked me {{to give him a}} note when he stopped at Lawson's." [...] She hesitated, and then resumed impulsively: [...] "Perhaps I oughtn't to have come on; but I wanted to do so." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....I {{will always}} {{remember}} him with joy and <b>I</b> will <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> {{for a very long}} time.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dear, but {{speaking}} of Father reminded {{me how much}} <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him,</b> how much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him." ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Mainwaring! I {{need not}} tell you how much <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him,</b> how perpetually he is in my thoughts. I found a dismal letter from him on my arrival here, full of {{complaints}} of his wife and sister, and lamentations on the cruelty of his fate. I passed off the letter as his wife's, to the Vernons, and when I write to him it must be under cover to you.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a vaquero in yonder field," [...] said Christie's escort, who {{was riding}} {{with her a}} little {{in advance of the}} others, [...] "and those fellows know every trail that a horse can follow. I'll ride on, {{intercept}} him, and try my Spanish on him. If <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him,</b> as he's galloping on, you might try your hand on him yourself. He'll understand your eyes, Miss Carr, in any language." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mrs. Holl," [...] Frank said, rising, [...] "I am {{very much}} obliged {{to you for}} your story; but I must be going now, or else I shall be late for school. Tell Harry I am sorry <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>him,</b> and will look in again soon. Have you thought {{anything}} further of what I said about Evan?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wondered}} if he had been murdered somewhere down a back street, and if <b>I</b> should <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> very much.|$|R
60|$|And {{then for}} a moment <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> from the room. He had doubtless gone to relieve his {{tortured}} feet in the servants' hall, and {{as he did so}} was cursing my cruelty. But what mattered it? Let him curse. If he would only stay away and do that, I would appease his wrath when we were alone together with pecuniary satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{it was a}} heavy loss, that of {{our good}} marshal. None but myself can say how <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> He was not only, as a general, {{one of the best}} and most trustworthy; but as a friend he was always cheery, always hopeful, one to whom I could tell all my thoughts. Ah! If I had but taken his advice at Hochkirch, I should not have had to mourn his loss.|$|E
6000|$|Then the Sheriff leaned forward, looking keenly {{among the}} press of archers to find whether Robin Hood was among them; {{but no one was}} there clad in Lincoln green, such as was worn by Robin and his band. [...] "Nevertheless," [...] said the Sheriff to himself, [...] "he may still be there, and <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> among the crowd of other men. But let me see when but ten men shoot, for I wot he will be among the ten, or I know him not." ...|$|E
60|$|When the man {{discovered}} me {{he released}} his hold upon Dian and sprang to the ground, ready with his lance to meet me. My javelin {{was no match}} for his longer weapon, which was used more for stabbing than as a missile. Should <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> at my first cast, as was quite probable, since he was prepared for me, I would have to face his formidable lance with nothing more than a stone knife. The outlook was scarcely entrancing. Evidently I was soon to be absolutely at his mercy.|$|E
6000|$|... "He did {{not like}} leaving me in the Rue Fossette; he feared <b>I</b> should <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> there too much--I should feel desolate--I should grow sad--?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet <b>I</b> shall <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> sorely. He {{had given}} all the colour to my life which it possessed. It was not very bright, but still it was colour." ...|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the death}} of their son the Lords had lapsed in their faith until on January 1, 1975 Bob Lord felt moved to return. Previously he had felt a desire to return, [...] "I started to hunger for the Church that I had left. Willingly left it. But now did I do the right thing. I was really sorry about having left the Church. I am not trying to {{rationalize}} any of it, but <b>I</b> just <b>missed</b> Jesus. And mostly <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> in the Eucharist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And my son's. Strange to say, I do {{not miss}} {{her so much}} as <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> She offers to return at any moment; but I {{do not wish to}} deprive her of the {{advantages}} of a little foreign travel with her friend. Always, Mr. Somerset, give your spare time to foreign countries, especially those which contrast with your own in topography, language, and art. That's my advice to all young people of your age. Don't waste your money on expensive amusements at home. Practise the strictest economy at home, to have a margin for going abroad.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I reckon you {{remember}} when we were aboard the boat. You gave us a narrative {{of what happened in}} that Community of yours, which I can truly characterise as a combination of native eloquence and chastening good sense. I put the question to myself, sir, what has become of that well-informed and discreet young Christian, now he has changed the sphere to England and mixed with the Farnabys? It's not to be denied that I see him before me in the flesh when I look across the table here; but it's equally true that <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> altogether, in the spirit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Afraid! I {{was afraid}} scores of times--sick with fear--I {{who used to}} laugh at Walter when he was frightened. Do you know, Walter was never frightened after {{he got to the}} front. Realities never scared him--only his {{imagination}} could do that. His colonel told me that Walter was the bravest man in the regiment. Rilla, I never realized that Walter was dead till I came back home. You don't know how <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> now--you folks here have got used to it in a sense--but it's all fresh to me. Walter and I grew up together--we were chums as well as brothers--and now here, in this old valley we loved when we were children, it has come home to me that I'm not to see him again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear me,' {{said the}} host, 'I wonder <b>I</b> haven't <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> before. Why, <b>I</b> don't think I've {{heard his voice}} for two hours at least. Emily, my dear, ring the bell.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} of that," [...] Francis said. [...] "I wish that poor Giuseppi was also here {{to go with}} me. <b>I</b> shall <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> terribly. He was a most {{faithful}} and devoted follower." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay you here, Elvira," [...] said Leon, [...] "lest <b>I</b> should <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> by the way. If, when I return, I {{find you}} here no longer, I shall follow {{at once to}} the Black Head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Collie, I can {{get around}} first rate. Don't need my crutch any more. I {{can make a}} fire and cook a meal. Wade doesn't think so, but I do. He says if I want to hold your affection, not to let you eat {{anything}} I cook. I can rustle around, too. Haven't been far yet. My stock has wintered fairly well. This valley is sheltered, you know. Snow hasn't been too deep. Then I bought hay from Andrews. I'm hoping for spring now, and the good old sunshine on the gray sage hills. And summer, with its columbines! Wade {{has gone back to}} his own cabin to sleep. <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> But I'm glad to have the nights alone once more. I've got a future to plan! Read that over, Collie.|$|E
6000|$|Alas, no! {{my little}} friend was gone. There {{he lay on}} his back on the mantel-piece, his legs meekly folded, and his wings stiff and still. He had evidently gone to the warm place, and been {{surprised}} when the heat died out and left him to freeze. My poor little Buzz had sung his last song, danced his last dance, and gone where the good flies go. I was very sorry and buried him among the ivy roots, where the moss lay green above him, the sun shone warmly on him, and the bitter cold could never come. <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> very much; when I sit writing, I miss his cheerful voice and busy wings; at meals there is no tiny little body to drink up spilt drops and eat the crumbs: in the evenings, when I sit alone, I want him more than ever, and every day, as I water my plants, I say, softly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|It {{happens that}} of those very {{intimate}} with me I have lost only one, and that came slowly and elaborately, a long gradual separation {{wrought by the}} accumulation of years and mental decay, but many close friends and many whom I have counted upon for sympathy and fellowship have passed out of my world. I miss such a one as Bob Stevenson, that luminous, extravagant talker, that eager fantastic mind. <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> whenever I write. It is less pleasure now {{to write a story}} since he will never read it, much less give me a word of praise for it. And I miss York Powell's friendly laughter and Henley's exuberant welcome. They made a warmth that has gone, those men. I can understand why I, with my fumbling lucidities and explanations, have to finish up presently and go, expressing as I do the mood of a type and of a time; but not those radiant presences.|$|E
6000|$|On {{his return}} to the Straits I was away, and he was gone again before I got back. He was trying to achieve three trips before Freya's twenty-first birthday. At Nelson's Cove <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> again by only a couple of days. Freya and I talked of [...] "that lunatic" [...] and [...] "perfect idiot" [...] with great delight and {{infinite}} appreciation. She was very radiant, with a more pronounced gaiety, notwithstanding that she had just parted from Jasper. But this was to be their last separation.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>I</b> {{have heard}} a good many journalists say since then {{that he is a}} {{difficult}} man to hit. One who began by liking him and is now scornful, which is just the reverse process from mine, told me the reason why. He had some brochures to write on the Liberal leaders, and got on nicely till he reached Lord Rosebery, where he stuck. In vain he walked round his lordship, looking for an opening. The man was naturally indignant; he is the father of a family.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nary a sound, Dave. We {{went along}} as silently as ghosts {{and with our}} ears wide open. I know Henry was along when we moved up the lake, but <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> jest {{as soon as we}} turned to come back. He had been next to the lake front and I walked over to find out if he had seen {{anything}} of the Injuns. But he was gone--and {{that was the end of}} it--although I and the others hunted around until we simply had to give it up and come back to report." ...|$|R
