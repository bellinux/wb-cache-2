25|$|This amplified, {{new sound}} was {{different}} from the acoustic country blues played in the South. It was popularized by blues giants such as Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Bo Diddley and Howlin' Wolf and evolved into rock & roll. From the first, the blues signified a lament or elegy for hard times, though it outgrew that limitation. When economic decline in the American South after World War I caused many Delta Blues and Jazz musicians - notably Louis Armstrong – to migrate north to Chicago, the first economically secure class willing to help them was the mostly Jewish merchants of the area around Maxwell Street, who by that time were able to rent or own store buildings. These merchants encouraged blues players to set up near their storefronts and provided them with electric <b>extension</b> <b>cords</b> to run the new high-tech instruments. Shoppers lured by the chance to hear blues music could be grabbed and hauled into the store where they were sold a suit of clothes, shoes, etc. One of the regular performers was the self-styled Maxwell Street Jimmy Davis, who played in the area for over 40 years.|$|E
25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable power cord (mains flex lead) to allow connection of the appliance to the socket. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency. In addition to sockets permanently attached to building wiring, <b>extension</b> <b>cords</b> (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. Portable equipment such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip, which can also include switching, surge voltage and over-current protection; a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|E

500|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers {{believe that in}} 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was soundproofed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two homemade tents, and what {{has been described as}} a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a [...] high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by trees and a tarpaulin. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, and also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by <b>extension</b> <b>cords.</b> Law {{enforcement officers}} visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask to inspect the back yard, and did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect. Witnesses interviewed stated Dugard was seen in the house, and sometimes answered the front door to talk to people, but never stated there was a problem or attempted to leave. While the family kept to themselves, the girls were sometimes seen playing in the backyard or as passengers in Garrido's car.|$|E

2500|$|In stage {{lighting}} {{for film}} and theater, this connector is sometimes informally known as PBG (Parallel Blade with Ground), U-ground, Edison or Hubbell, {{the name of}} a common manufacturer. (The name [...] "Hubbell" [...] can be confusing as several different connectors share this name depending on the company, industry, and use.) In the motion picture and TV production industries, an extension cord that uses this type of connector (usually with 12 AWG or 10 AWG wire) is called a [...] "stinger". Generally, lighting technicians use these <b>extension</b> <b>cords</b> to deliver power to lights rated at 2000W or less.|$|E
2500|$|Table lamp wire is {{typically}} #18, while <b>extension</b> <b>cords</b> are #16, with #14 common on cords grounded for outdoor use, and #12 available. [...] Mini Christmas lights were mostly #24 through 1997, when that gauge was arbitrarily de-rated from 3 to 2.5 amps, preventing manufacturers from getting UL certification {{for the same}} products which had already been approved {{for more than two}} decades. [...] They were forced to use the formerly heavy-duty standard of #22 wire (itself de-rated from 5 to 4 amps), plus thicker insulation, which in turn caused them to shortchange customers by drastically shortening the light socket spacing and usable length of sets. [...] This change also made light strings stiff and unsightly. [...] Heavy-duty mini lights are now 20 AWG, with larger screw-in bulbs having sockets on 18 AWG lamp wire.|$|E

50|$|An {{extension}} reel {{can only}} carry full rated current when completely extended. This {{is because the}} portion of cord on the reel is not exposed to air causing the loss power, (the result of its series resistance), not to dissipate. An <b>extension</b> <b>cord</b> that is in use while coiled up or coiled in a reel can be a serious shock and fire hazard. The heat produced from the resistance cannot dissipate and is instead trapped between the tightly coiled cable, leading to the a fire or shock. Additionally, the ESFI recommends to never use an <b>extension</b> <b>cord</b> that is covered by a rug or blanket, or that is run through a ceiling or wall, since the heat {{may not be able}} to dissipate appropriately.|$|R
