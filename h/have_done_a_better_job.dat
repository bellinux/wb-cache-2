Comparing McCarthy to 'Dennis the Menace' of cartoon fame, the Vermonter {{delivered}} a scathing address in which he lambasted the Wisconsin man for dividing the nation. 'In every country in which communism has taken over,' he reminded the Senate, 'the beginning has been a successful campaign of division and confusion.' He marveled {{at the way the}} Soviet Union was winning military successes in Asia without risking its own resources or men, and said this nation was witnessing 'another example of economy of effort...in the conquest of this country for communism.' He added, 'One of the characteristic elements of communist and fascist tyranny is at hand as citizens are set to spy upon each other.' 'Were the junior Senator from Wisconsin in the pay of the communists, he could not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> for them.' 'This is a colossal innocence, indeed.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The entire freeway {{road was}} built with {{expansion}} in mind; almost all bridges were built {{wide enough for}} expansion to the ultimate stage which includes {{as many as six}} main travel lanes in one direction, depending on location. [...] Alberta plans to widen the southwest leg of the road, which is well over capacity, but the plans are currently unfunded until at least 2020. [...] They include widening both directions from two to three travel lanes in the congested southwest section between Highway 2 and Whitemud Drive, and the more extensive work required to widen the bridges over the North Saskatchewan River and Wedgewood Ravine which are currently two lanes of travel per bridge each way. [...] In 2015, city councillor Michael Oshry stated that he was unhappy with the way the road was initially constructed, and Alberta should <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> of anticipating the rapid growth in southwest Edmonton. Project manager Bill van der Meer disagreed, saying, [...] "If we built a six-lane divided road that was virtually empty for 10years, that wouldn’t be money well spent." ...|$|E
500|$|Hex Enduction Hour takes {{influence}} from the Velvet Underground's [...] "Sister Ray", Captain Beefheart {{and the early}} 1970s Krautrock band Can. Smith {{has said that the}} title was intended to invoke witchcraft, that he concocted the word [...] "Enduction" [...] to suggest the album could be a listener's induction into the Fall and that [...] "Hex" [...] was a reference to this being the band's sixth release. His vocals are higher in the mix than on previous Fall releases and were described in 1982 by Sounds as [...] "emerg like a loudhailer from a fog of guitar scratch". The songs were deliberately produced in a raw and low-fi approach by Smith, Grant Showbiz and Richard Mazda in a sound described at the time as a [...] "well produced noise" [...] that was acceptable by Fall standards. Critic Mark Storace claimed that he [...] "could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> on a 4-track if I was pissed out of my head". Smith responded by saying that [...] "nowadays people just can't just shut up if they don't know what they're talking about." [...] Elaborating on the purposely amateurish production values, Smith remarked that [...] "it was all recorded in deliberately bad places...deliberately simple sort of thing. Three songs were written at rehearsal and done the next time." ...|$|E

2500|$|The war {{records of}} the {{submarine}} chaser PC-1264 and the destroyer escort USS Mason considerably contributed to opening up billets for African Americans in the post-war navy.

2500|$|Cramer {{disagreed}} with Stewart {{on a few}} points, but mostly acknowledged that he could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> foreseeing the economic collapse: [...] "We all should have seen it more." [...] Not content with his explanation, Stewart showed videos in which Cramer recommended ways to drive down stock prices by spreading false rumors, deceiving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and deliberately misleading journalists. Cramer admitted {{that he can do}} better, and that he can change. He also pointed out the mass illusion on Wall Street and the finance industry in general that, in the words of former Merrill Lynch CEO Stanley O'Neal, [...] "fixed income and credit (i.e. the economy) were no longer cyclical in nature", and that this illusion had permeated Wall Street and all other industries connected to it, including the finance networks.|$|E

She too was coppered and new. de Courcy remarked that Audacieuz was so fast that if her captain <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job of steering she would have escaped.

50|$|Times of India was perplexed {{as to why}} {{director}} Pradeep Raj recycled an old film theme {{with only}} cosmetic touches.

They also felt that Subhiksha could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> in her role of Geetha. The music of D Imam was given good marks.|$|E

40|$|More {{than anyone}} else in the decade of the 1990 s, John Taylor spurred {{research}} into the nature of the monetary policy pursued by the Federal Reserve System. Taylor has advanced a simple and intuitive reason for why the Fed <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job of controlling inflation since the early 1980 s: It has raised the funds rate more aggressively in response to inflation. This article suggests a different perspective. The question should be how the Fed prevents inflation from arising in the first place, not how vigorously it responds to observed inflation...|$|R
