50|$|The {{working method}} {{adopted by the}} Commission when {{providing}} opinions is to appoint a working <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>rapporteurs</b> (primarily from amongst its members) which advises national authorities {{in the preparation of}} the relevant law. After discussions with the national authorities and stakeholders in the country, the working group prepares a draft opinion on whether the legislative text meets the democratic standards in its field and on how to improve it on the basis of common experience. The draft opinion is discussed and adopted by the Venice Commission during a plenary session, usually in the presence of representatives from that country. After adoption, the opinion becomes public and is forwarded to the requesting body.|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} a central {{aspect of the}} micromanage-ment of the European Parliament, the determinants of rapporteurship allocation. Focusing on the period from 1995 to 1999, I match rapporteurship assignments in the commit-tee on environment with occupational, group membership, ideological and national data. The study asks {{which of the two}} distinct features of committees, distributional concern or informational provision, determines rapporteurship selec-tion. My analysis shows that the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>rapporteurs</b> does not mirror the composition of the full plenary. Moreover, the results are consistent with the view that a multifaceted combination of the two concepts of ‘demanding ’ and ‘informative ’ committees promises a richer explanation of rapporteur assignment than any one of those theories alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{method used}} by the working group was an {{iterative}} process based upon literature reviews of relevant publications by a working <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>rapporteurs.</b> The review papers were written and circulated before the conference and served as basis of discussion. Each paper was subject to a detailed collective analysis and modified and amended {{on the basis of}} the work group's discussions and referenced to additional relevant literature where appropriate. The group assessed the levels of evidence for the statements made in the supporting documentation and recognised that it was necessary to adopt a compromise between acceptance of the lowest level of evidence, resulting in the largest body of material, and the highest level which produced valuable but limited evidence. Where the objectives were not concerning an intervention, an RCT study design was not applicable and no focussed question could be formulated. Rather cross-sectional and repeated cross-sectional, as well as longitudinal cohort studies, were usually the evidence available. © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The group assessed the levels of evidence for the statements made in the supporting documentation and recognized that it was necessary to adopt a compromise between acceptance of the lowest level, resulting in the largest body of material, and the highest level, which, in some cases, produced little evidence. While this approach does not represent endorsement of lower evidence levels per se, it was designed to provide conclusions of clinical utility within the existing knowledge base. The consensus statements were prepared after a detailed consideration of the papers submitted to the workshop by the working group. The papers were scrutinized, amended and approved by the group. The basis of each paper is described in the section on 'search strategy' and defines the parameters within which the consensus statements were prepared. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|This article investigates which factors {{shape the}} European Parliament’s (EP) {{bargaining}} success under the codecision procedure, focusing on {{three sets of}} predictors that operate at the levels <b>of</b> the <b>rapporteur</b> and the responsible EP committee: ideological distances to the Council of Ministers, qualifications of MEPs, and institutional factors. Our results indicate that greater ideological distance between EP delegates and the Council depresses bargaining success; that inter-institutional contestation becomes more focused on the left-right dimension over time; that several factors that one might expect to benefit EP bargaining success in fact show a negative correlation; and that rapporteur-level variables {{are the most important}} predictors during the 1999 – 2004 EP term, while committee-level predictors matter from 2004 – 2009 – a difference we ascribe to successively greater oversight <b>of</b> <b>rapporteurs</b> by their parent committees...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{right to}} food is {{increasingly}} evoked by a range of actors, {{but there is not}} sufficient critical analysis of distinct interpretations of what this right means in practice. Through examination of a mineral extraction project with agricultural implications, this article explores diverse human rights narratives and illuminates associated corporate efforts to minimize recognition of food as a fundamental right. A British mining company proposes the Phulbari open pit coal mine in an agriculturally important region of Bangladesh. Highly contested by affected populations, clashes in 2006 between the police and protestors turned deadly in the area. In February 2012, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> UN Special <b>Rapporteurs</b> cautioned the Government of Bangladesh regarding human rights violations associated with the planned mine. They warned that the project would displace hundreds of thousands of people, while destroying fertile agricultural land. In contrast, an ongoing publicity campaign by the corporation attempts to promote their intervention as a positive step, fully compliant with international human rights and corporate social responsibility standards. Taking this case as an exemplar, the article illuminates the pursuit of mining profit and the distinct use of human rights narratives by corporations and UN Special Rapporteurs. These diverse actors represent the layering of voices weighing in on mineral extraction and associated {{right to food}} concerns. Collectively, these layered narratives represent a new terrain for the promotion and contestation of mining and highlight the need to scrutinize mining practices in light of social responsibility and human rights claims being voluntary and self-regulated...|$|R

40|$|The role <b>of</b> the Justice <b>rapporteur</b> in the Brazilian Supreme Court {{still has}} not been subject of great {{scholarly}} attention. The most widespread {{view is that the}} Justice rapporteur has a prominent role, because he or she is the Justice who most intensively studies the case.
