During the attack the Japanese took several casualties to booby traps and trip wires that had been set up in front the Australian position and from heavy small arms fire, but they succeeded in pushing the Australians back slightly to the south. Meanwhile, the II Battalion attempted a flanking move to the west, where they came up against the 2/31st Infantry Battalion, which was occupying a position on the flank that the Japanese had thought was unheld. Heavy casualties in the centre of the Australian line were inflicted by Japanese artillery, but the depleted [...] composite unit managed to check the Japanese advance in their sector throughout the day. The following day, 15 September, the other half of the III Battalion attempted to find the eastern flank of the Australian position, but found that the line was much longer than expected there also due to the earlier movement made by the 2/33rd during the preparatory phase of the battle. Nevertheless, the Japanese found a gap in the Allied line in between the 3rd Infantry Battalion and the 2/33rd, seizing an opportunity to rush an Australian Militia section that had forgotten to post a sentry whilst expanding its pits. Seizing a vital position that allowed them to fire down on the Australians from the east, the Japanese had succeeded in a gaining a significant vantage point, but they were unable to exploit it further after the 2/25th counter-attacked from its <b>depth</b> <b>position.</b> The 2/25th's counter-attack was turned back and failed to dislodge the Japanese on the right of the Australian line. The Japanese were subsequently able to dig-in there, although the III Battalion was unable to exploit their position any further, being caught in between the two Australian infantry battalions. A stalemate developed on the left which the Australians and Japanese each attempted to break by launching flanking attacks that were subsequently countered each time. The 2/33rd also attempted a counter-attack on the right to attack the Japanese detachment from behind but was unable to locate the Japanese in the thick vegetation.|$|E

50|$|On 17 November the YEO MTD DIV {{pursuing}} the retreating Turkish forces through the hills {{in front of}} Jerusalem, came upon a strong rearguard position, on the ridge line between the villages of Sidun and Abu Shusheh. A force of 4,000 men supported by artillery and machine-guns the majority of which around Abu Shusheh, with a <b>depth</b> <b>position</b> to its south. Major-General George de S. Barrow ordered the 22nd MTD Brigade to attack the position from the north, the Camel Corps Brigade from the north-west and the 6th MTD Brigade from the south-west. At 07:00 the 22nd MTD and Camel Corps Brigades attacked on foot. Goodwin {{in command of the}} 6th MTD Brigade decided to attack mounted. He dispatched half of his machine-gun squadron and a squadron from the Berkshire Yeomanry forward to provide covering fire assisted by the Berkshire Battery R.H.A. located 3500 yd south-west of the village. He ordered the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry to charge Abu Shusheh, the remainder of the Berkshire Yeomanry on their left would charge a spur {{to the north of the}} village. The Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry would be the brigade reserve, protecting the brigades right flank. The artillery and machine-guns opened fire as the Berkshire Yeomanry moved into the open towards the village, but confronted by heavy machine-gun fire were forced to take cover in a defile. At the same time the Dorset Yeomanry moved around to the south to take that position from the rear, attracting the attention of the machine-gunners. Seeing this the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry came out of cover and charged the village. The Buckinghamshire Yeomanry and the two squadrons of Berkshire Yeomanry reached the village around the same time as the Dorset Yeomanry charged home on the machine-gun position. The position was secured but while clearing up the brigade was counter-attacked, which was broken up, suffering heavy losses, by the brigades artillery. By 09:00 the position was secured with over 400 Turkish dead, 360 prisoners and several machine-guns captured, British losses were thirty-seven dead and wounded. The Turkish survivors were pursued north by the 22nd MTD Brigade, who caught some prisoners, but an unknown number escaped into the surrounding hills.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the night}} of 7/8 November {{there was a general}} Turkish withdrawal, the Desert Mounted Corps {{supported}} by the 60th Division were ordered to advance at dawn 8 November at their best speed to the north-west in an attempt to cut off the retreating Gaza garrison. The ANZ MTD DIV, with the 7th Mounted Brigade attached, were given the objective of Bureir, 12 mi north-east of Gaza, to their left was the AUS MTD DIV then the 60th Division. The corps advance was met by pockets of resistance, varying in size from company to several regiments, but the speed of the British advance had prevented them forming any type of organised defences. At 11:00 the Turks managed to gather enough of a force together to counter-attack the 2nd LH Brigade at Tel el Nejile which brought the ANZ MTD DIV to a halt. Chaytor pushed the 7th MTD Brigade through his centre towards Bir el Jemameh, where it was known there was a supply of water. At 13:00 just before they reached the village they also were counter-attacked, which drove back their left flank. The brigade only being saved by the arrival of the 1st LH Brigade from the west, which forced the Turks back. The light horsemen continued into the village, capturing the water pumping station intact and the high ground to the north. The AUS MTD DIV and 60th Divisions were also successful and fought several small battles during which they captured a number of heavy howitzers by the simple tactic of going round and charging the position from the rear. At 15:00 the 60th Division came under heavy artillery fire from the area of Huj and requested help from some passing squadrons of the Warwickshire Yeomanry and Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars, part of the 5th MTD Brigade. Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Cheape of the Warwicks led the force into dead ground to about 800 yd from the Turkish guns unobserved. Huj was the location of the Turkish Headquarters, the terminus of their military rail line from the coast. The position consisted of a battery of field artillery another of mountain artillery and four machine-guns forward with another two artillery batteries and three heavy howitzers in a <b>depth</b> <b>position</b> at the rear. The yeomanry squadrons came out of the dead ground, charged the position from the flank and had almost reached it before the Turks managed to turn their guns around and opened fire at point blank range. The fight was over in minutes the Turkish gunners killed or wounded and the positions twelve guns captured. British loses were heavy of the 170 men that started the charge seventy-five were killed or wounded. With Huj captured the AUS MTD DIV were able to move in and water their horses, the successful charge also captured the main Turkish ammunition depot and their radio code books which were used to decipher Turkish signals until January 1918. That afternoon the 4th Brigade was ordered to turn left and try and link up with XXI Corps advancing along the coast. Moving at their best speed, at times going around instead of fighting through Turkish positions, the brigade linked up with the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade just before dark near Beit Hanun. Also on 8 November the YEO MTD DIV had moved to the British left, to attack the Turkish right which would force them across the front of the 53rd Division and the Camel Corps Brigade at Tel KhuweiKeh. The 8th MTD Brigade began the attack but were dislodge the Turkish defenders before being ordered back to Sharia, to prepare for a pursuit of the Turkish forces withdrawing on the coastal plain.|$|E

40|$|In {{drilling}} operations, non-Newtonian {{drilling fluid}} is continuously circulated {{in a closed}} loop. One {{of the ways to}} monitor and regulate drilling operations is by accurately measuring the flow rate of circulating drilling fluid before entering and after returning from the wellbore. The circulating fluid flows in an open channel on the return path from the wellbore. This work investigates the use of Venturi constriction to estimate the non-Newtonian fluid flow in an open channel. Based on the specific energy principle, a relation between volumetric flow rate and critical depth is developed, which is used to estimate the flow rate based on the measured critical depth. To measure a critical depth for a given flow rate, it is necessary to locate a critical <b>depth</b> <b>position</b> in the Venturi flume. In this study, the critical <b>depth</b> <b>position</b> is located using specific energy diagram (at a minimum specific energy within the Venturi constriction) and Froude Number approach (at a Froude Number equals to 1). Based on the identified critical depth, the flow conditions (subcritical, critical or supercritical) along the Venturi flume are observed. The location of the critical depth in the Venturi section is found by performing experiments at 350 [kg/min] flow rate of the fluid. Further, the developed critical depth flow model is tested for randomly varying flow rates (250 - 500 [kg/min]) with the identified critical depth location. The flow estimations of the model were within the acceptable limit. However, it is found that the estimates for 350 [kg/min] are comparatively more accurate, which proves that the critical depth and critical <b>depth</b> <b>position</b> depends on the flow rate and rheological properties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we report}} on the recent {{development}} of a novel low coherence interferometry technique for the purpose of 3 D-topography measurements. It combines the well established techniques of spectral-interferometry (SI) and chromatic-confocal microscopy (CCM). It allows for the detection of an object’s <b>depth</b> <b>position,</b> without the necessity of a mechanical axial-scan, and the measurement is performed in a so-called “single-shot ” manner. Focusing the white-light with a microscope objective combined with a diffractive optical element leads to an expansion of the axial-range of the sensor beyond the depth-of-focus, limited by the numerical aperture (NA) of the used objective. Confocally filtering the object’s light causes the reduction of the lateral dimension of the area sampled upon the object. Due to the high NA, a high light collection-efficiency is achieved as well. The attained interferometric signals consist of high-contrast wavelets in the optical-frequency domain. The <b>depth</b> <b>position</b> of an investigated point of the object is given by the modulation-period of the wavelets. Therefore, unlike in CCM, position-wavelength referencing is not necessary...|$|E

40|$|Quite recently, we {{introduced}} a novel Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) method, termed as Master Slave OCT (MS-OCT), especially to deliver en-face images. MS-OCT operates like a time domain OCT, selecting signal from a selected depth only while scanning the laser beam across the sample. Time domain OCT allows real time production of an en-face image, although relatively slowly. As a major advance, the Master Slave method allows collection of signals from {{any number of}} depths, {{as required by the}} user. MS-OCT is an OCT method that does not require resampling of data and can be used to deliver en-face images from several depths simultaneously. However, as the MS-OCT method requires important computational resources, the number of multiple depth en-face images produced in real-time is limited. Here, we demonstrate that taking advantage of the parallel processing feature of the MS-OCT technology by harnessing the capabilities of graphics processing units (GPU) s, information from 384 <b>depth</b> <b>positions</b> is acquired in one raster with real time display of 40 en-face OCT images.
