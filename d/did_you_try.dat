6000|$|... "You very foolish person," [...] she repeated. [...] "Stop, though. Why {{all this}} mystery? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{to keep that}} letter from me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, come, Basil; I see you're keeping {{something}} back. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to do {{for those}} people? Did you tell them where you were stopping?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite illegible," [...] was Mrs. Grantly's dictum. [...] "It {{does not}} {{resemble}} writing at all. The influences have not got to working yet. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> it, Mr. Barton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't go just yet, dear Constance," [...] she said. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to--shut {{me out of}} your heart? Oh, if {{you knew}} how much--how very much I feel for you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I met {{you first}} {{on board a}} Canadian train and now you find me helping at a Montreal store. Isn't this enough? Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{to find out where}} I come from?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothin'. There was a trolley {{loose in}} the field," [...] replied Worry. [...] "Can you get up? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to block that {{football}} rusher?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{to put her}} off in that way--to {{make her}} believe he wasn't intoxicated?" [...] asked Annie, venting her {{postponed}} emotion, which was of disapproval.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to run away?" [...] {{said the}} Fortune, when his struggles had ceased and his screams were stilled. [...] "Why do you glare at me so inhospitably?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} this big hole," [...] Boduoc said, [...] "it {{is the only}} one by which they can come down at present. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> and prevent them from {{enlarging}} any of the others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rubbish!" [...] {{the woman}} remarked, sitting {{up on the}} couch. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to make me so uncomfortable, Hester? Sir Leslie may be very clever, but I am not exactly a fool myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is {{the problem}} {{for a man to}} solve. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> that. Good <b>you</b> {{certainly}} can be, if you look to Him for assistance. Let that come first; and then the greatness, if that be possible.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, if I {{can only}} save you by running for help!' she cried. 'Oh, I {{would have died}} instead! Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> so hard to deliver me?' And she turned away wildly to run for assistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{he spoke}} of such things as these, did he?" [...] {{returned}} Paul. [...] "Well, yes, he's bin up to a deal of mischief in his day. And {{what did you say}} to him, lass? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to quiet him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then, my boy," [...] said Uncle Chris affably. [...] "I {{will leave}} you to turn the whole thing over in your mind. Act entirely as you think best.

6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to {{hold your}} mother here in the wilderness, Louis Nelson?" [...] he asked suddenly. [...] "Surely a lad like {{yourself}} cannot hope to make a clearing unaided, and it is but keeping her in great danger of a cruel death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what are}} <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> here?" [...] I asked. [...] "It has been long years since you {{revisited}} Earth, and never {{before in the}} trappings of Mars. Lord! but {{it is good to}} see you--and not a day older in appearance than when you trotted me on your knee in my babyhood. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> explain it, John Carter, Warlord of Mars, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to explain it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Help it! <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try?</b> It was the {{one thing}} you were sure o' yoursel'; it {{was the one}} thing you thought worth anybody's learning. You stood before her crowing the whole day. I said the now I wished you would go and leave her wi' me: but I wouldna dare to keep her; she's {{helpless}} without you; if you took your arm awa frae her now, she would tumble to the ground." ...|$|E
60|$|Somebody {{was leaning}} {{out of my}} bedroom window, {{refreshing}} his forehead against the cool stone of the parapet, and feeling the air upon his face. It was myself. I was addressing myself as 'Copperfield', and saying, 'Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to smoke? You might have known you couldn't do it.' Now, somebody was unsteadily contemplating his features in the looking-glass. That was I too. I was very pale in the looking-glass; my eyes had a vacant appearance; and my hair--only my hair, nothing else--looked drunk.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want {{to fasten}} {{it all in}} my mind," [...] she said [...] "before I go on. Mr. Michael Vanstone knew of the first will; he knew what {{prevented}} {{the making of the}} second will; he knew of the letter and he read the words. What did he know of besides? Did you tell him of my mother's last illness? Did you say that her share in the money would have been left to us, if she could have lifted her dying hand in your presence? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to make him ashamed of the cruel law which calls girls in our situation Nobody's Children, and which allows him to use us as he is using us now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] said Lady Agatha, [...] "how you men argue! I am sure I {{never can}} make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with <b>you.</b> Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray {{to give up the}} East End? I assure you he would be quite invaluable. They would love his playing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{anything}} like that again, I'll make it warm for you. Get a swab and clean the deck up at once!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>you</b> <b>do!</b> Don't <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to be slippery, Molly. The plain pikestaff is your style, morally speaking--if any {{one knows}} what a pikestaff is. Well, now, listen! You're anxious about me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{and your}} master have saved my life, have you?" [...] he said. [...] "Well, neighbour, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{to save my}} life by {{shooting}} at me with that great black bow of yours, which I see is made of Eastern woods?" [...] He stared at the case in which it was now again hidden as though tanned leather were no obstacle to his sight; then went on: [...] "Do not answer: I will tell you why. You shot at me because you were afraid of me, and fear is ever cruel, is it not? Only something happened to your arrow, something that has never happened to any arrow of yours before. Oh, yes, you have saved me from the Italian cut-throats, and being a gentleman I thank you very much. Only why did the arrow burst in your bow?" [...] and he smiled with those dreadful eyes of his.|$|E

5000|$|Quentin's main {{obsession}} is Caddy's virginity and purity. He {{is obsessed}} with Southern ideals of chivalry and is strongly protective of women, especially his sister. When Caddy engages in sexual promiscuity, Quentin is horrified. He turns to his father for help and counsel, but the pragmatic Mr. Compson tells him that virginity is invented by men {{and should not be}} taken seriously. He also tells Quentin that time will heal all. Quentin {{spends much of his time}} trying to prove his father wrong, but is unable to do so. Shortly before Quentin leaves for Harvard in the fall of 1909, Caddy becomes pregnant by a lover she is unable to identify, perhaps Dalton Ames, whom Quentin confronts. The two fight, with Quentin losing disgracefully and Caddy vowing, for Quentin's sake, never to speak to Dalton again. Quentin tells his father that they have committed incest, but his father knows that he is lying: [...] "and he <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to make her do it and i i was afraid to i was afraid she might and then it wouldn't do any good" [...] (112). Quentin's idea of incest is shaped by the idea that, if they [...] "could just have done something so dreadful that they would have fled hell except us" [...] (51), he could protect his sister by joining her in whatever punishment she might have to endure. In his mind, he feels a need to take responsibility for Caddy's sin.|$|E

"I {{tell you}} what, John," [...] said he, [...] "do you choose your day, some day {{early in the}} season, and {{come out on the}} best thing you have, and I'll bring, not the black horse, but my old mare; and then <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> and keep near me. If I don't leave you at the back of Godspeed before long, I'll give you the mare and the horse too." ...|$|R
