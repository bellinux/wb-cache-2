5|$|Varaha {{symbolizes the}} resurrection of the earth from a pralaya (dissolution of the universe) and the {{establishment}} of a new kalpa (aeon). Symbolism also attributes that evolution from water could relate to the geological phenomenon of the tectonic age. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> represent the rescue of earth from “false cults”.|$|E
5|$|According to the Montour County Multi-jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan, a {{major failure}} in the Lake Chillisquaque Dam could cause damage to several nearby communities, such as Strawberry Ridge and Washingtonville. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> result in a {{decrease}} in the output of the Montour Power Plant, causing a brownout in the area. A severe failure of the dam is considered by the Multi-jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan to be the most dangerous threat to Montour County.|$|E
5|$|Administratively, the German {{administration}} had a Zivilverwaltung (Civil Administration) tasked with dealing with day-to-day matters {{and a network}} of local Kommandanturen in towns and cities across Belgium. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> call on up to 80,000 soldiers. In most cases, however, the administration was content to use the existing Belgian civil service and local government for much of its administration.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, {{graphene}} {{appears to}} be the strongest material ever tested. The process of separating it from graphite will require some further technological development before it is economical for industrial processes. If successful, graphene could be used in the construction of a space elevator. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be used to safely store hydrogen for use in a hydrogen based engine in cars.|$|E
5|$|Athletes will {{sometimes}} become citizens {{of a different}} nation so {{they are able to}} compete in the Olympics. This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.|$|E

5000|$|The Pororoca (...) is a tidal bore, with waves up to 4 metres {{high that}} travel {{as much as}} 800 km inland {{upstream}} on the Amazon River and adjacent rivers. Its name comes from the indigenous Tupi language, where <b>it</b> <b>could</b> translate into [...] "great roar". <b>It</b> <b>could</b> be <b>also</b> a Portuguese version of the term poroc-poroc, which in the native indigenous' language {{was a way of}} expressing the act of destroying everything. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> be <b>also</b> a portmanteau of the words poroc (to take out, to tear away) and oca (house). It occurs {{at the mouth of the}} river where its waters meet the Atlantic Ocean.|$|R

5|$|Game Capture HD, which {{connects to}} gaming {{consoles}} to record gameplay, {{was introduced in}} 2012. It was created in response to gamers that were hacking EyeTV products for gameplay recording. The device connects between a gaming console and the TV and {{is powered by a}} USB connection. It captures video as the console sends it to the television, compresses and stores it. A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and noted that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be used to record iPad games with the right setup.|$|E
5|$|Quaggas {{have been}} {{reported}} gathering into herds of 30–50 individuals and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. They may have been sympatric with Burchell's zebra between the Vaal and Orange rivers. This is disputed, {{and there is no}} evidence that they interbred. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> have shared a small portion of its range with Hartmann's mountain zebra (Equus zebra hartmannae).|$|E
5|$|The Diet had {{legislative}} powers. The {{legislative initiative}} was {{possessed by the}} Emperor, along with the Diet executive (six deputies and the Marshal), and all individual deputies. It could debate and pass laws related to many issues {{in the field of}} education, culture, welfare, justice, public works, administration, religion and military. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> impose supplementary taxes, up to 10% of the direct tax.|$|E

5|$|The PocketStation was a {{miniature}} game console created by SCE as a peripheral {{for the original}} PlayStation. Released exclusively in Japan on December 23, 1999, it featured a monochrome LCD, a speaker, a real-time clock and infrared communication capability. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> {{be used as a}} standard PlayStation memory card by connecting it to a PlayStation memory card slot. It was extremely popular in Japan and Sony originally had plans to release it in the United States but the plan was ultimately scrapped due to various manufacturing and supply-and-demand problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} nasal arch of Gryposaurus, {{like other}} cranial modifications in duckbills, {{may have been}} used for a variety of social functions, such as identification of sexes or species and social ranking. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> have functioned as a tool for broadside pushing or butting in social contests, and there may have been inflatable air sacs flanking it for both visual and auditory signaling. The top of the arch is roughened in some specimens, suggesting that it was covered by thick, keratinized skin, or that there was a cartilaginous extension.|$|E
5|$|The radar {{technology}} was not flawless. It struggled to gauge heights of incoming formations above 25,000 feet {{and could not}} measure their numerical strength. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> take several minutes to assess the line of advance for aircraft on a zigzag course. Moreover, the radar looked out to sea {{and was unable to}} track aircraft overland. That was the job of the Royal Observer Corps. Tens of thousands of volunteers, the length and breadth of Britain tracked the German formations over land. They were connected to Sector airfields by landline and could communicate intelligence in real time.|$|E
50|$|The name Salt {{probably}} {{comes from}} the Latin word saltus which means valley of trees or thick forest as there are many trees in the area. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> have <b>also</b> come from the Saranac salta meaning hard stone.|$|R

5|$|This {{thumb is}} {{typically}} {{interpreted as a}} close-quarter stiletto-like weapon against predators, although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> {{have been used to}} break into seeds and fruits, or against other Iguanodon. One author has suggested that the spike was attached to a venom gland, but this has not been accepted, as the spike was not hollow, nor were there any grooves on the spike for conducting venom.|$|E
5|$|A {{batch of}} 10 were {{produced}} and five were built from existing H-6s. The machines {{were joined by}} a center wing formed by two sections 6.15m (20ft) in length. The powerplants were five Junkers Jumo 211F engines producing 1,000kW (1,340hp) each. The total fuel capacity was 8,570L (2,260US gal). This was increased by adding of four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks. The He111Z could tow a Gotha Go 242 glider or Me 321 for up to 10 hours at cruising speed. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> remain airborne if the three central powerplants failed. The He 111Z-2 and Z-3 were also planned as heavy bombers carrying 1,800kg (3,970lb) of bombs and having a range of 4,000km (2,500mi). The ETC installations allowed for a further four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks to be installed.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E

5|$|Courtly {{love was}} the eroticisation of love between the nobility. Emphasis {{was placed on}} {{restraint}} between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments, where knights would fight wearing a token from their lady, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be private and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult {{is one example of}} stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other, although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous– Henry I of England had over 20bastards for instance– but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, the {{practice}} was most prevalent from the medieval era until the outbreak of World War I, but evidence of intermarriage between royal dynasties {{in other parts of}} the world can be found as far back as the Late Bronze Age. Monarchs were often in pursuit of national and international aggrandisement on behalf of themselves and their dynasties, thus bonds of kinship tended to promote or restrain aggression. Marriage between dynasties could serve to initiate, reinforce or guarantee peace between nations. Alternatively, kinship by marriage could secure an alliance between two dynasties which sought to reduce the sense of threat from or to initiate aggression against the realm of a third dynasty. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> enhance the prospect of territorial acquisition for a dynasty by procuring legal claim to a foreign throne, or portions of its realm (e.g., colonies), through inheritance from an heiress whenever a monarch failed to leave an undisputed male heir.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{infantry}} {{had reached the}} German trenches, the artillery shifted from the creeping barrage to the standing barrage, a static barrage that would protect {{the infantry}} from counter-attack while they consolidated the position. A variant was the box barrage, in which three or four barrages formed a box—or more often three sides of a box—around a position to isolate and prevent reinforcements being brought up into the front line. This was normally used to protect trench raids, although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be used offensively against a German unit. Another type of barrage was the SOS barrage, fired {{in response to a}} German counterattack. An SOS barrage could be brought down by firing a flare signal of a pre arranged colour, as a German barrage tended to cut the telephone lines. A pre-registered barrage would then descend on No Man's Land.|$|E

5000|$|Early governments {{generally}} {{relied on}} tax in kind and forced labor for their economic resources. However, {{with the development}} of money came the first policy choice.
