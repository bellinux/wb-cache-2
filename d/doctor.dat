40|$|Aim: To analyse {{the role}} of Germany {{in the context of}} the strong {{international}} migration of <b>doctors.</b> In doing so, the migration of German <b>doctors</b> abroad and foreign <b>doctors</b> to Germany is qualitatively and quantitatively presented. Subjects and methods: The annual statistical reports from the country's medical associations given to the Federal Medical Association were investigated on migratory movements. Furthermore, a survey on how many German <b>doctors</b> are working in these countries was done within relevant organisations in some European countries and the US. Results: Germany is affected by an international migration of <b>doctors</b> in two directions. German <b>doctors</b> are emigrating and as well foreign <b>doctors</b> are immigrating. The exchange is not balanced, Germany loses more <b>doctors</b> every year to foreign countries than it gains through immigration. Discussion and conclusions: The increasing emigration of German <b>doctors</b> reinforces the shortage of <b>doctors</b> in Germany. In addition, the functioning of the German health system increasingly depends on the immigration of foreign <b>doctors...</b>|$|R

The <b>Doctor</b> opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the <b>Doctor</b> are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the <b>Doctor</b> is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E

40|$|In the hospital, {{both male}} and female <b>doctors</b> ‘do gender’, but because men and masculinity are {{associated}} with greater authority (and by association, competence), masculinised traits are favoured over feminine traits in the hospital workplace. In order to be accepted as competent <b>doctors,</b> female <b>doctors</b> expend a great deal of ‘emotional labour’ and ‘do gender’ by acting out prized masculine traits through appearance and behaviour strategies and thereby gaining legitimacy as respected, competent <b>doctors</b> in their interactions with other co-workers (<b>doctors,</b> nurses) and patients. Our study looks at the varied experiences of both older/senior and younger/junior medical <b>doctors.</b> Through in-depth interviews with 41 male and female <b>doctors,</b> this article examines how masculinities and masculine practices become embedded, routinized and legitimised in the hospital workplace. We find that gender, age and specialty play important roles in gender stereotyping, negatively affecting not just female <b>doctors,</b> but male <b>doctors</b> too who may need to ‘do gender’ by adhering to the strictest masculine norms. By examining the interplay of gender inequalities in the everyday interactive workplace relationships between <b>doctors,</b> nurses and patients in hospitals, our study finds that everyday practices of gendered behaviour are driven by complex age-gender stereotypic intersections that do not prioritise female <b>doctors,</b> particularly young and female <b>doctors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the knowledge, attitudes and smoking behavior among <b>doctors</b> at Mahosot University Hospital in Lao PDR. A cross-sectional, descriptive study used a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. The study population comprised 164 <b>doctors.</b> Answers were retrieved from 151 (92 %) of the <b>doctors.</b> The prevalence of smoking among male <b>doctors</b> was 35 %, 16 % smoked daily and 19 % occasionally. None of the female <b>doctors</b> reported to have ever smoked. Out of the five diseases related to smoking, 5 % of the <b>doctors</b> recognized all and 10 % recognized only one. <b>Doctors</b> were significantly more likely to advise patients with symptoms related to smoking. However, approximately one in two <b>doctors</b> reported that they did not always counsel smokers with severe smoking related symptoms to stop smoking. Almost all <b>doctors,</b> independent of smoking behavior, perceived tobacco prevention to be important. The findings indicate a lack of comprehensive knowledge on tobacco related issues.
