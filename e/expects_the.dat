IBM also intends to market the DeepQA software to large corporations, with a price in the millions of dollars, reflecting the $1 million needed to acquire a server that meets the minimum system requirement to operate Watson.

5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he <b>expects</b> <b>the</b> debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E

Jerry is frustrated by his television's bad reception, and is convinced by Kramer to have cable illegally installed by two Russians (Vic Polizos and James Lashly).|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} of Jerry Alisandros {{and the other}} mass tort lawyers are based on their previous experience. Several times before they had caught Varrick marketing seriously faulty drugs, as well as ruthlessly trying out their products in Third World countries. In all these cases, Varrick preferred to negotiate lucrative compensations for these lawyers' clients, of which the lawyers got a big cut. Alisandros <b>expects</b> <b>the</b> same to happen again: the lawsuits {{from all over the}} U.S. would be concentrated in South Florida, with a federal judge which Alisandros considers amendable; Varrick would negotiate, reach again a settlement out of court and everybody will grow rich.|$|E
5|$|Variations between AADT {{and average}} summer daily traffic (ASDT) traffic volumes are {{attributed}} {{to the fact that}} the motorway carries substantial tourist traffic to the Adriatic Sea resorts along the Istria peninsula. On average, the A9 motorway carries 218% more ASDT than AADT. The largest increase of the ASDT relative to the AADT is observed on the Nova VasVišnjan section, at 229%.

After the students have left the school, Principal Himbry is stabbed to death in his office. Tatum's boyfriend, Stu Macher throws a party to celebrate the school's closure. The party is attended by Sidney, Tatum, their friend Randy Meeks, and multiple other students. Reporter Gale Weathers attends uninvited to cover the situation, as she <b>expects</b> <b>the</b> killer to strike. Tatum's brother deputy sheriff Dewey Riley also looks out for the murderer at the party. Tatum is killed during the party after having her head crushed by the garage door. Billy arrives to speak to Sidney privately, and the two ultimately consummate their relationship. Dewey and Gale investigate a nearby abandoned car. Many party attendees are drawn away after hearing news of Himbry's death; Sidney, Billy, Randy, Stu, and Gale's cameraman Kenny remain.|$|E
