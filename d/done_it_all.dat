500|$|In 2011 Steve Ignorant {{embarked}} on an international tour, entitled [...] "The Last Supper". He performed Crass material, culminating with a final performance at the Shepherds Bush Empire on 19 November. Ignorant {{said that this was}} the last time he would sing the songs of Crass, with Rimbaud's support; the latter joined him onstage for a drum-and-vocal rendition of [...] "Do They Owe Us A Living", bringing the band's career full circle after 34 years: [...] "And then Penny came on...and we did it, 'Do They Owe Us A Living' as we'd first <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> those years ago. As it started, so it finished". Ignorant's lineup for the tour were Gizz Butt, Carol Hodge, Pete Wilson and Spike T. Smith, and he was joined by Eve Libertine for a number of songs.

500|$|A third Dooley collection, Mr. Dooley's Philosophy, {{appeared}} in 1900. The lead story was [...] "A Book Review", that is, Mr. Dooley's discussion of New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt's wartime memoir, The Rough Riders. In Mr. Dooley's version, Roosevelt wins the whole war by himself, a role slightly {{greater than that}} in his actual book. Dooley's conclusion: [...] "No man that bears a grudge against himself'll ever be governor of a state. [...] And if Teddy <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> he ought to say so and relieve the suspense. [...] But if I were him I'd call the book Alone in Cuba." [...] Somewhat to Dunne's surprise, [...] "Rosenfelt" [...] (as Dooley called him) took the sting in good humor, and when the two met, told Dunne of a young female admirer of his, who told the governor that she had read all of his books, with her favorite Alone in Cuba. Roosevelt was elected vice president on McKinley's ticket in 1900, and when he succeeded after the president was assassinated the following year, Dunne wrote of the new chief executive, the youngest to hold that position, [...] "a man is... {{old enough to be}} president when he becomes president. If he ain't, it'll age him." ...|$|E
