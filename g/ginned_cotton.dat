40|$|The Commission {{working paper}} on the cotton sector is {{available}} on the internet. It sets out the situation on the world market for cotton; the situation on the community cotton market; and the operation of the EU's cotton regime. It notes that the world market price of cotton is volatile in both the short term and the long term, with developments on the Chinese market having a major influence. The USA is also a major global player, with about 30 % of world production and about 30 % of world trade. Consumption of <b>ginned</b> <b>cotton</b> has risen from 14. 3 million tonnes in the 1980 s to 20. 6 million tonnes in 2001. Within the EU, Greece and Spain are the primary cotton producers. From 1992 / 93 to 2000 the area under cotton rose steadily (from 300, 000 hectares to 500, 000 hectares) before falling back slightly. Since Spain 's accession to the EU the area under cotton has practically doubled EU imports of <b>ginned</b> <b>cotton</b> are exempt from customs duties, and EU exports do not receive export refunds (instead processors receive processing aids to allow them to compete at world market prices where this is necessary). The EU has a negative trade balance in <b>ginned</b> <b>cotton,</b> importing around 708, 000 tonnes and exporting around 227, 000 tonnes. The EU produces just under half of the <b>ginned</b> <b>cotton</b> it consumes. Comment: While the EU is not a major international player in the world cotton trade, {{this does not mean that}} the EU cotton regime does not affect developments on world markets. The impact of the EU cotton regime on EU production can be seen in the doubling of Spanish production since accession and the expansion of the area under cotton since the 1980 s.

40|$|The EU support {{regime is}} centred on a {{production}} aid per tonne of unginned cotton within national guaranteed quantities. Aid is granted to processors, who pay a minimum price to growers, {{based on the}} difference between the 'guide price' and the world price. Since 1995 / 96 the 'guide price' has been set at € 1, 063 per tonne with a guaranteed minimum price of € 1, 009. 9 per tonne. Greece has a NGQ of 782, 000 tonnes, Spain an NGQ of 249, 000 tonnes and other member states a total of 1, 500 tonnes. EU support to the cotton sector totalled € 773 million in 2001. The cotton sector contributes only 0. 5 % to final agricultural output in the EU, but is important in certain EU regions (Thessaly, Macedonia-Thrace, Sterea Ellada and Andalusia. For example in Greece, cotton represent 9 % of total agricultural output. In these areas cotton is farmed by small holders. The area under cotton however is decreasing. At a world level the EU is a minor producer, contributing only 2. 2 % of total production (the USA by contrast accounts for 20. 1 % of world production). The EU exports some 227, 000 tonnes of <b>ginned</b> <b>cotton</b> and is a major net exporter of <b>ginned</b> <b>cotton.</b> The USA however dominates world cotton exports, accounting for 30 % of world trade (west Africa accounts for only about 11 %). The EU consumes about 1 million tonnes of <b>ginned</b> <b>cotton</b> per annum. Comment: The guaranteed minimum price system means that regardless of the world market price EU cotton growers receive over € 1, 000 per tonne for their cotton. This insulates EU producers entirely from the low world market prices for cotton which have plagued west African cotton producers. Since 2000 EU imports of cotton have declined as EU production and exports have increased (despite a 13. 5 % decline in the price of <b>ginned</b> <b>cotton).</b> This demonstrates the extent to which production and trade in cotton in the EU is insulated from developments on world markets.

However, although the benefits of roller ginning on lint turn out and fiber quality are fairly well understood, it is still unclear whether these improvements translate into improved yarn quality and processing performance. The aim of this research was to com-pare the impact of saw and roller ginning on Long Staple Upland cotton in a high-production and commercial environ-ment and to evaluate quality and textile processing performance in a commercial textile mill.

40|$|The pink {{bollworm}} Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is a cosmopolitan insect, {{and a major}} pest in many cotton producing countries including Greece. In the present thesis, {{certain aspects of the}} biology and ecology of {{pink bollworm}} were studied. Biological parameters of wild pink bollworm population, emergence of the overwintering generation, oviposition preference studies, oviposition and infestation in field and the effect of pink bollworm. s infestation on yield and qualitative characteristics of <b>ginned</b> <b>cotton</b> were studied. Wild population, obtained from the area of Epanomi N. Greece, was used in all the experiments conducted from 2001 to 2004. The experiments were conducted in the Laboratory of Applied Zoology and Parasitology, of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the university farm of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and in cotton fields in the area of Epanomi N. Greece. Biological parameters of three successive generations were determined in the laboratory. The three studied generations were the overwintering generation, the generation developed in squares and the generation developed in bolls. Developmental times of immature stages, adult longevity and fecundity were determined. Our results showed that, developmental times of egg, larval and pupal stages differed significantly among the studied generations. The average life span of adults ranged for females from 14. 3 d in square generation to 16. 4 d in boll generation and for males from 13. 1 d in square generation to 17. 5 d in boll generation. Significant differences were also observed in fecundity, which ranged from 89. 5 to 235. 5 eggs per female of the square and boll generation respectively. No differences were observed concerning the pupal stage and adult longevity of the two sexes. In the wider area of Thessaloniki N. Greece, where the study was conducted, pink bollworm overwinters as fully grown larvae in seeds, either in late season immature bolls in the field or in the seed cotton. Larval exit from seeds, pupation and adult emergence of the overwintering generation in storehouse and in outdoor conditions was studied in the area of Thessaloniki from 2001 to 2004. Mean period of adult emergence lasted more than a month and fluctuated from 35 to 75 days. The majority of adults emerged in June in storehouse conditions and in July in outdoor conditions. Adult emergence was significantly correlated with daily mean air temperature. The quadratic model arisen from the correlations explained 64 to 66 % of the adult emergence. Suicidal emergence was calculated considering the insect. s biological parameters (oviposition period, adult age, development time of the egg stage) in relation to the age of the most suitable square for larval survival. In the area of Thessaloniki suicidal emergence ranged from 7 to 73 % according to the year of study. Oviposition preference studies were conducted under laboratory, semifield and field conditions, to elucidate the parameters that may affect the oviposition preference. Young plants and bolls from four commercial upland cotton cultivars (Lachata, Macnair- 220, Midas and Sandra), cultivated in the area of Thessaloniki, were used in the tests. No choice, two, three and four choice experiments with young plants or bolls were conducted in all possible cultivar combinations. The four cultivars had palmate leaves and nectaries on both leaves and bolls. Differences were observed in the trichome density and the length of leaf petiole among the cultivars. Typical shape of bolls was either round or ovate and differences were observed in boll size and bract. s length. Differences were also observed in the time that fruiting parts are being formed. Depending on the year, the fruiting parts were formed in Sandra 3 to 5 days earlier than Lachata and Macnair- 220 and 6 to 8 days earlier than Midas. Although the four cotton cultivars were characterized by a variation in morphologic and agronomic characteristics, the mean number of eggs oviposited on young plants and bolls did not differ among the cultivars in the two-, threeand four- choice experiments. Considering all the experiments, eggs were oviposited mainly on newly developed unfolded leaves of the young plants and under the calyx of the bolls. In semifield experiments a preference for oviposition on bolls than on plant terminals was observed in all the varieties tested. Under field conditions oviposition and infestation followed the same pattern during the cultivating period for the four cultivars (Lachata, Macnair- 220, Midas and Sandra), but differed according to the year of study. During 2003 and 2004 oviposition and infestation was low till the end of August and increased rapidly thereafter. Pheromonic traps were placed in the experimental field. Neither oviposition nor infestation was correlated with the number of catches in the traps in the three-year study. On the contrary a significant, positive correlation was observed between the mean number of eggs oviposited per boll and the percentage of infested bolls. The linear model arisen from the correlation explained 87 % of the percentage of infested bolls. Boll infestation by pink bollworm caused a significant reduction in seed cotton weight, fibre yield and also decreased all the qualitative characteristics of the <b>ginned</b> <b>cotton</b> in the four cultivars (Lachata, Macnair- 220, Midas and Sandra) studied. Seed cotton weight decreased from 7 to 36 % and fiber yield decreased from 1 to 24 % as the number of larvae per boll increased.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of oxodegradable thin film on cotton establishment and lint yield. It was hypothesised that the use of thin oxodegradable plastic film would increase soil temperature and conserve seedbed water possibly reducing the risk in early planting, while not reducing lint yield or fibre quality of cotton. Experiments were conducted near Narrabri, NSW Australia during the 2010, 2012 - 2014 and the 2012 and 2013 seasons near Griffith, a cooler region in southern NSW with three or four thin oxodegradable plastic films with different formulations and break down rates being compared with a bare soil treatment. Planting depth soil temperature and soil water potential was monitored at three hourly intervals. Soil temperatures were elevated by 2 - 4. °C under the film compared with the bare soil that resulted in earlier (2 - 4 days) emergence of cotton under the film compared with bare soil. Soil also remained wetter beneath the film. Two films began to degrade at the time when cotton seedlings emerged (10 - 20 days), resulting in greater seedling survival (2 - 7 vs 12. plants/m). Seedlings were unable to penetrate four films on emergence and did not survive. When these films were slit to allow seedling growth, survival depended on subsequent environmental conditions; whether overcast/sunny or cool/warm conditions occurred. Using film that had been slotted prior to being laid in the field also increased soil temperature and conserved seedbed water. This enhanced (50 - 80 %) emergence and survival of emerged seedlings, and overcame the need to slit film in the field. A climate analysis and simulation study was also conducted to determine the benefit or otherwise of thin film and early planting over a longer-term than is possible from field studies. Results for both sites indicated that the earlier the planting date (August/September), compared to a "normal" planting date (October) there was a greater the chance of cold (6. 5 vs 2. 5 days) and frost (2. 5 vs 0 days) being experienced, which resulted in lower or no lint yield. Lint yield tended to be greater (3200 vs 2800. kg. lint/ha), although not significantly so, with thin film compared with bare soil. Fibre quality parameters were not affected by the use of thin film. All surface film had degraded {{by the end of the}} season posing no risk of contamination of the lint. Film below ground did remained intact, but this does not pose a contamination risk for the cotton lint at harvest. No plastic film was detected in <b>ginned</b> <b>cotton</b> after being machine harvested at both sites. There was no significant benefit in lint yield due to thin film, while all fibre quality parameters made base grade. Long-term simulation of early planting, with and without thin film, indicated that lint yield was variable with no consistent benefit due to the presence of thin film for the locations simulated. There is still a risk of cold weather or frost occurring when planting early with thin film that growers need to consider. In practical terms it is anticipated that growers would potentially only plant 5 % of their area early depending on the seasonal forecast...|$|E

In a saw gin, circular saws grab the fibre and pull it through a grating that is too narrow for the seeds to pass. A roller gin is used with longer staple cotton. Here a leather roller captures the cotton. A knife blade, set close to the roller, detaches the seeds by drawing them through teeth in circular saws and revolving brushes which clean them away.|$|R
