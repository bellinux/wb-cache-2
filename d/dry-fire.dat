50|$|The M&P is {{a hybrid}} {{evolution}} of the Smith & Wesson Sigma and Smith & Wesson SW99 design but does not share parts compatibility with the Sigma. The M&P design has an improved trigger and enhanced ergonomics that allow for end-user customization. An industry standard picatinny rail and a higher grip has been afforded with an improved grip and beavertail. Many of the ergonomic study elements that had been incorporated into the Sigma and the Smith & Wesson SW99 were brought over to the M&P. The improved trigger weight and feel and the unique takedown method (not requiring a <b>dry-fire</b> pull of the trigger) were meant to set the M&P apart from the popular Glock pistols.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the sport}} of biathlon, because semiautomatic guns are illegal for race use, straight-pull actions are quite common, and are used almost {{exclusively}} on the world cup along with the Lateral Toggle action. The first company to make the straight pull action for [...]22 caliber was J. G. Anschütz; the action is specifically the straight pull ball bearing lock action, which features spring-loaded ball bearings {{on the side of}} the bolt which lock into a groove inside the bolt's housing. With the new design came a new <b>dry-fire</b> method; instead of the bolt being turned up slightly, the action is locked back to catch the firing pin. The two companies who have made the lateral toggle are Finn biathlon, as well as Izhmash. Finn was the first to make this type of action, however, due to the large swing of the arm as well as the stiffness of the bolt, these rifles fell out of favour and have been discontinued. Izhmash improved on the lateral swing with their Biathlon 7-3 and 7-4 series rifles, which have some use on world cups, but are largely thought of as inaccurate as well as having the inconvenience of having to remove the shooter's hand from the grip.|$|E
40|$|A global Earth {{system model}} {{is applied to}} {{quantify}} the impacts of direct anthropogenic aerosol effective radiative forcing on gross primary productivity (GPP) and isoprene emission. The impacts of different pollution aerosol sources (anthropogenic, biomass burning, and non-biomass burning) are investigated by performing sensitivity experiments. The model framework includes all known light and meteorological responses of photosynthesis, but uses fixed canopy structures and phenology. On a global scale, our results show that global land carbon fluxes (GPP and isoprene emission) are not sensitive to pollution aerosols, even under a global decline in surface solar radiation (direct + diffuse) by [*]∼[*] 9  %. At a regional scale, GPP and isoprene emission show a robust but opposite sensitivity to pollution aerosols in regions where forested canopies dominate. In eastern North America and Eurasia, anthropogenic pollution aerosols (mainly from non-biomass burning sources) enhance GPP by + 5 – 8  % on an annual average. In the northwestern Amazon Basin and central Africa, biomass burning aerosols increase GPP by + 2 – 5  % on an annual average, with a peak in the northwestern Amazon Basin during the <b>dry-fire</b> season (+ 5 – 8  %). The prevailing mechanism varies across regions: light scattering dominates in eastern North America, while a reduction in direct radiation dominates in Europe and China. Aerosol-induced GPP productivity increases in the Amazon and central Africa include an additional positive feedback from reduced canopy temperatures in response to increases in canopy conductance. In Eurasia and northeastern China, anthropogenic pollution aerosols drive a decrease in isoprene emission of − 2 to − 12  % on an annual average. Future research needs to incorporate the indirect effects of aerosols and possible feedbacks from dynamic carbon allocation and phenology...|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the {{original}} Contender, <b>dry-firing</b> of the G2 Contender {{is possible only}} in the center (safe) hammer position, located on the hammer between the centerfire and rimfire positions. Also, unlike {{the original}} Contender, the break-action {{does not need to}} be opened/closed (cycled) to practice <b>dry-firing,</b> provided the hammer is lowered between dry firing [...] "shots". The adjustability of G2 Contender triggers is also slightly different from the original G1 Contender.|$|R
50|$|The main design {{weakness}} in the CZ-45 is a brittle firing pin like the CZ 52 and should never be dry-fired. <b>Dry-firing</b> the CZ-45 will also damage the extractor which acts as the firing pin retainer. Damaging the firing pin retainer bulge on the extractor will cause the firing pin {{to fall out of}} the pistol.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{the later}} G2 Contender, the {{original}} Contender may be safely dry-fired (provided the hammer is not drawn {{back from the}} second notch) to allow a shooter {{to become familiar with}} the trigger pull. The break-action only has to be cycled, while leaving the hammer in the second notch position, to practice <b>dry-firing.</b> G2's with switchable firing pins (centerfire or rimfire) can be safely dry-fired with the hammer only in the safety (center) position.|$|R
5000|$|Drill rounds are inert {{versions}} of cartridges used {{for education and}} practice during military training. Other than the lack of propellant and primer, {{these are the same}} size as normal cartridges and will fit into the mechanism of a gun {{in the same way as}} a live cartridge does. Because <b>dry-firing</b> (releasing the firing pin with an empty chamber) a gun can sometimes lead to firing pin (striker) damage, dummy rounds termed snap caps are designed to protect centerfire guns from possible damage during [...] "dry-fire" [...] trigger control practices.|$|R
5000|$|But Paul Kulak counter claims (according to the L.A. Weekly) that Stryker {{has made}} threats {{to him and}} the club's customers: “He {{constantly}} reminds me he’s a firearms expert and will hide behind his back door when I dump the trash. Once, he started making mechanical gun clicks. I could see he had a pistol in his hand as he was <b>dry-firing</b> it... I’m willing to risk my life to keep this club going.” Stryker responded to Kulak's claim and was quoted as saying, [...] "That guy is so out there!" ...|$|R
50|$|From a {{very young}} age, hunting and {{shooting}} fascinated Anderson. Without benefit of a coach or proper equipment (including ammunition), he taught himself how to shoot by <b>dry-firing</b> his rifle {{for hours at a}} time. Dreams of becoming an Olympic gold medalist in shooting led Anderson to the US Army. In 1959, after convincing skeptical US Army coaches that his implausibly high shooting scores were accurate, he was assigned to the elite U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit at Fort Benning, Georgia. His first international competition was the Pan American Games in 1959—only two years later, in 1961, he would win his first national championship.|$|R
