2500|$|Below follow {{some basic}} {{facts about the}} role of the {{collection}} of all rotation matrices of a <b>fixed</b> <b>dimension</b> (here mostly 3) in mathematics and particularly in physics where rotational symmetry is a requirement of every truly fundamental law (due to the assumption of isotropy of space), and where the same symmetry, when present, is a simplifying property of many problems of less fundamental nature. Examples abound in classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Knowledge of the part of the solutions pertaining to this symmetry applies (with qualifications) to all such problems and it can be factored out of a specific problem at hand, thus reducing its complexity. A prime example [...] in mathematics and physics [...] would be the theory of spherical harmonics. Their role in the group theory of the rotation groups is that of being a representation space for the entire set of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation group SO(3). For this topic, see Rotation group SO(3) § Spherical harmonics.|$|E

40|$|Many {{optimization}} techniques, {{including several}} targeted specifically at embedded systems, {{depend on the}} ability to calculate the number of elements that satisfy certain conditions. If these conditions can be represented by linear constraints, then such problems are equivalent to counting the number of integer points in (possibly) parametric polytopes. It is well known that this parametric count can be represented by a set of Ehrhart polynomials. Previously, interpolation was used to obtain these polynomials, but this technique has several disadvantages. Its worst-case computation time for a single Ehrhart polynomial is exponential in the input size, even for <b>fixed</b> <b>dimensions.</b> The worst-case size of such an Ehrhart polynomial (measured in bits needed to represent the polynomial) is also exponential in the input size. Under certain conditions this technique even fails to produce a solution. Our main contribution is a novel method for calculating Ehrhart polynomials analytically. It extends an existing method, based on Barvinok’s decomposition, for counting the number of integer points in a non-parametric polytope. Our technique always produces a solution and computes polynomially-sized Ehrhart polynomials in polynomial time (for <b>fixed</b> <b>dimensions)</b> ...|$|R
