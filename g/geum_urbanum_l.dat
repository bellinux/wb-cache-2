40|$|Summary. All abiotic and biotic {{stresses}} induce or involve {{oxidative stress}} to some degree, {{and the plant}} ability to control oxidant levels is highly correlated with stress tolerance. Polyamines (PAs) have antioxidant properties and their induction in response to stress is well known. Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L., Thellungiella halophila Mey., Plantago major L. and <b>Geum</b> <b>urbanum</b> <b>L.</b> plants were grown for six weeks in water culture with modified Winter nutrient medium, 14 h at 350 µmol/m 2 s 1, 23 °C – 16 °C.

Free, soluble bound and insoluble conjugated fractions were extracted and determined. After UV-B irradiation the plants with different adaptation strategy showed different dynamics of PAs content. M. crystallinum, T. halophila, P. major are known to have a more effective antioxidant system than G. urbanum. The data provided evidence that the UV-B stress caused PA divergent responses and fractionations in halophyte (M. crystallinum and T. halophila) and glycophyte (P. major and G. urbamum) ____________...|$|E

This may also be true for species of the semi-natural vegetation in agricultural landscapes. To determine the effect of landscape elements we analyzed Wood Avens (<b>Geum</b> <b>urbanum</b> <b>L.)</b> populations within three 4 × 4 km 2 agricultural landscapes in Germany, Switzerland and Estonia, which differ in levels of land use intensity and habitat fragmentation. Genetic variation was determined in 15 randomly selected populations in each landscape using 10 microsatellite loci. The landscape structure was assessed at two circles around each population, with radii defined by the range limits of spatial genetic autocorrelation. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the influence of landscape structure variables for inter- and intrapopulation genetic diversity. Gene diversity was equally high in Germany (He= 0. 27) and Switzerland (He= 0. 26) but lower in Estonia (He= 0. 16). A high overall inbreeding coefficient (FIS= 0. 89) was found, as expected for a selfing breeding system in G. urbanum. Genetic differentiation among populations was high (overall FST= 0. 43, 0. 48, and 0. 45 in Estonia, Switzerland and Germany, respectively), and did not differ among the three landscapes. Only a moderate influence of individual land use types on genetic diversity within and among populations was found with some idiosyncratic relationships. Genetic variation within populations was correlated to the amount of hedgerows positively in Estonia but negatively in Switzerland. The study demonstrates that the distribution of individual land use types affects the genetic pattern of a common plant species. However, different variables were identified to influence the genetic structure in three different landscapes.

Reproductive adults were transplanted and their fate, i. e. survival and counts of leafs and flowers, plus the fate of their progeny, were monitored for three years following cutting of coppice shoots (three light levels) or yearly autumn mowing. Cardamine pratensis and P. elatior produced more flowers with increasing light availability. Mowing increased flower and leaf production with time for P. elation Seedling numbers followed a similar trend. <b>Geum</b> <b>urbanum</b> initially produced more flowers with increasing light and when mown, but the effect disappeared and did not increase seedling numbers. Its basal leaves showed the opposite pattern. Population growth rates (lambda), calculated for P. elatior and G. urbanum, confirmed the strong treatment effects on the former and the absence of effects on the latter. Yet, decomposition of treatment effects, showed considerable flexibility in life history of G. urbanum, except for contributions of fecundity. The latter, however, contributed most to positive effects on lambda for P. elatior. Early flowering species with an affinity for open habitats (C. pratensis > P. elatior) benefited more from temporal resource release than the later flowering, typical woodland species.

40|$|The {{preferences}} of some woodland understorey species for ammonium and nitrate were investigated {{by measuring the}} potential nitrification (conversion of ammonium to nitrate) in the rhizosphere compared with the bulk soil. Less acid-tolerant species, which usually prefer nitrate or a mixture of ammonium and nitrate in hydroponic culture, should have a higher potential nitrification in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil due to a low uptake of ammonium (since ammonium is relatively immobile). Acid-tolerant species should have a high uptake of ammonium and thereby lower or equal potential nitrification in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil. The hypothesis was tested in a field investigation of five understorey herb species, Deschampsia flexuosa, Convallaria majalis, Poa nemoralis, <b>Geum</b> <b>urbanum</b> and Aegopodium podagraria performed in oak forests in southern Sweden. Overall, the two less acid-tolerant species, <b>Geum</b> <b>urbanum</b> and Aegopodium podagraria, had high potential nitrification in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil (indicating a relatively low uptake of ammonium), whilst the acid tolerant species, Deschampsia flexuosa and Convallaria majalis, had approximately equal potential nitrification in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil (indicating a relatively high uptake of ammonium). In the case of Poa nemoralis, a species which grows in both acid and less acid soils, we found the potential nitrification in the rhizosphere and in the bulk soil to be similar at low inorganic nitrogen concentrations, but the difference (rhizosphere > bulk) increased when nitrification in the bulk soil was enhanced (i. e. when the nitrogen availability increased). The potential nitrification in the bulk soil varied between 0 and 16 nmol g(- 1) h(- 1) and {{was positively correlated with}} pH. When species occurred at the same site, the potential nitrification in the bulk soil tended to be lower for the acid tolerant species.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} habitat fragmentation, fragment age and local environment in shaping the genetics of plant populations, we examined the genetic structure of the self-compatible forest herb <b>Geum</b> <b>urbanum</b> using microsatellite markers. A historical land-use reconstruction assigned the studied populations to two age classes: populations in primary forest fragments, and populations in secondary fragments. Local environmental conditions were quantified {{on the basis of}} the herb-layer community composition. A stepwise general linear model revealed that levels of within-population genetic diversity were best explained by population size, landscape connectivity and the interaction between both. Connectivity was positively correlated with the genetic diversity of small populations, but did not significantly affect the diversity of large populations. Contrary to what we expected, secondary-forest populations showed lower divergence relative to populations located in primary patches. Small populations were genetically more diverged compared to large populations. Mantel tests showed no significant isolation by distance and no significant correlation between habitat similarity and genetic differentiation. We conclude that gene flow has probably prevented founder events from being reflected in the present genetic structure of G. urbanum. Gene flow towards low-connectivity populations, however, seemed to be insufficient to counteract the effects of drift in small populations. status: publishe...|$|R

The morphological variables of burrs were estimated, and the dependence of the force on the size and the morphology of burrs was examined. The contact separation force of the burr significantly differed among species studied. It ranged from 3. 36 to 143. 85 mN. The increase of the force is positively correlated with burr length and burr diameter in the basal part. However. in C. lutetiana, the burrs experienced the lowest force, although the values of morphological burr variables were, intermediate, and the force applied did not cause the burr damage. In the three species studied, the fruits of which bear many burrs, the force was considerably lower than the fruit weight. To hold the fruit attached to the animal, the interlocking of several burrs (5 - 21 depending on the species) is required. Total force of all burrs covering the fruit exceeded the fruit weight by 4 - 20 times. This may increase the attachment force of the fruit, when more than the minimal burr number required are interlocked. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of forest plant communities in post-agricultural landscapes is largely determined by dispersal constraints, but can environmental legacies of former land use additionally limit the recolonization of recent forests by forest herbs? Location: Ancient forest and recent forest on former heavily fertilized agricultural land (Muizenbos, northern Belgium). Methods: Seeds and adults of two forest herbs with similar life-history traits, but contrasting colonization capacity – the fast-colonizing <b>Geum</b> <b>urbanum</b> and the slow-colonizing Primula elatior– were introduced into both ancient and recent forest sites. Soil conditions and plant tissue nutrient concentrations were measured to characterize habitat quality. To {{determine whether the}} introduced species could successfully establish and persist, we monitored recruitment, longevity and adult performance during 8 years in permanently marked plots. Results: Phosphorus availability was ten times higher in recent forest soils and was also reflected in the plant tissue samples. Species longevity was clearly lower in recent forest sites indicating higher turnover. The fast-colonizing G. urbanum counterbalanced this lower longevity by new establishment, while the slow-colonizing P. elatior dropped below the number of originally introduced individuals. Additionally, G. urbanum performed better in recent forest sites in contrast to P. elatior. Conclusions: Even when dispersal constraints of the slow-colonizing forest herb P. elatior are eliminated through introduction, environmental conditions in recent forest sites additionally restrict its recruitment, longevity and performance. These experimental results suggest that environmental constraints may strengthen the differences in colonization capacity among forest herbs if slow dispersers {{also tend to be}} less likely to establish. status: publishe...|$|R

We hypothesized that fast-colonizing species respond the most opportunistically to increased P availability, and that a low light availability can mask the effects of P on performance. All species showed a significant increase in P uptake in the aboveground biomass. The addition of P had a positive effect on the vegetative performances of two of the species, although this was unrelated to their colonization capacities. The regenerative performance was affected by light availability (not by P addition) and was related to the species' phenology. Forest herbs can obviously benefit from the increased availability of P in post-agricultural forests, but not all species respond in the same way. Such differential patterns of plasticity may be important in community dynamics, as they affect the interactions among species...|$|R
40|$|In Flanders, forests {{have been}} {{subjected}} to subsequent periods of reclamation and reforestation, leading to a mosaic of forest patches of various ages and with different abiotic conditions, depending on the duration and intensity of the past agricultural activities. While extensive research has been done on the relative importance of dispersal limitation and establishment limitation in explaining colonization patterns of so-called ancient forest plant species, {{little is known about the}} viability of populations of these species once they have colonized recent forests. Therefore, a comparative study on population structure and plant performance was carried out for three forest plant species with different colonization capacity (Primula elatior, <b>Geum</b> <b>urbanum</b> and Arum maculatum) in three different habitat types: ancient forests, recently established forests and small landscape elements (hedgerows). Contrary to the expectation, it was shown that adult plant performance - a combination of vegetative as well as reproductive characteristics - of the three species was generally higher in recent forests and small landscape elements. This also led to higher seedling densities and proportions in these habitat types. Adult densities, however, were extremely low in newly established forests, suggesting reduced seedling and juvenile survival under these circumstances, probably due to higher light availability and hence increased competition from species like Urtica dioica. Although there might be no immediate establishment limitation, installing a shrub layer in recent forests might enhance survival and result in a stable population structure. Hedgerows on the other hand seemed to contain viable populations of certain forest plant species and can therefore function as an important colonization source when incorporated in recently established forests. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Current {{understanding}} of plantherbivore interactions postulates that forest understory species are less tolerant to herbivory by large mammals than grassland species. As yet, research on forest species {{has focused on}} extensive biomass loss. However, forest dwelling ungulates are often selective browsers, hence biomass loss experienced by forage species is mostly limited to specific plant modules. We investigated the impact of herbivory on common forage species of roe deer Capreolus capreolus by simulating browsing on wild transplants of the two herbs <b>Geum</b> <b>urbanum</b> and Prenanthes purpurea, and the two graminoids Carex sylvatica and Luzula luzuloides. Two clipping regimes simulated different browsing frequencies, whereas shading and full day light represented light conditions in closed forests and gaps, respectively. Single clipping did not affect above ground biomass production of any species, independent of light conditions. Repeated biomass loss led to undercompensation in L. luzuloides, marginal compensation in C. sylvatica, and full compensation in G. urbanum and P. purpurea measured as above ground biomass production. The change in root biomass after clipping {{was positively correlated with}} the change in above ground biomass production in all four species. In contrast, nitrogen concentration was negatively correlated with above ground biomass in the graminoids, whereas no relationship between nitrogen and biomass was found in the herbs. Although light conditions and plant provenance affected biomass production, we found no effect of light conditions on plant reactions to herbivory. These results suggest that forest understory species, graminoids as well as herbs, are tolerant to herbivory by selective browsers such as roe deer. As in grassland ecosystems, the degree of compensatory growth depends on amount and frequency of biomass loss...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Seed {{banks are}} central to the {{regeneration}} strategy of many plant species. Any factor altering seed bank density thus affects plant regeneration and population dynamics. Although seed banks are dynamic entities controlled by multiple environmental drivers, climatic factors are the most comprehensive, but still poorly understood. This study investigates how climatic variation structures seed production and resulting seed bank patterns. Location: Temperate forests along a 1900 km latitudinal gradient in north-western (NW) Europe. Methods: Seed production and seed bank density were quantified in 153 plots along the gradient for four forest herbs with different seed longevity: <b>Geum</b> <b>urbanum,</b> Milium effusum, Poa nemoralis and Stachys sylvatica. We tested the importance of climatic and local environmental factors in shaping seed production and seed bank density. Results: Seed production was determined by population size, and not by climatic factors. G. urbanum and M. effusum seed bank density declined with decreasing temperature (growing degree days) and/or increasing temperature range (maximum-minimum temperature). P. nemoralis and S. sylvatica seed bank density were limited by population size and not by climatic variables. Seed bank density was also influenced by other, local environmental factors such as soil pH or light availability. Different seed bank patterns emerged due to differential seed longevities. Species with long-lived seeds maintained constant seed bank densities by counteracting the reduced chance of regular years with high seed production at colder northern latitudes. Main conclusions: Seed bank patterns show clear interspecific variation in response to climate across the distribution range. Not all seed banking species may be as well equipped to buffer climate change via their seed bank, notably in short-term persistent species. Since the buffering capacity of seed banks is key to species persistence, these results provide crucial information to advance climatic change predictions on range shifts, community and biodiversity responses...|$|R
