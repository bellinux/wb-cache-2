For my part, I {{do not believe that}} the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus on the present moment and to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E
25|$|Shelter {{employees}} are sometimes {{at risk from}} violence perpetrated by the clients they are serving. In order to address problems faced by employees {{who are trying to}} help the homeless in New York, the Department of Homeland Security increased security at some shelters and conducted security assessments of shelters in 2015. While many employees of shelters <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> risk when working in high-crime neighborhoods or with individuals who are mentally ill, they continue to work at homeless shelters because they feel that they are performing a public service akin to the police or firefighters.|$|E

500|$|It was {{not until}} after the victory at the Battle of Rafa that Chauvel was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, but this {{particular}} order is awarded for important non-military service in a foreign country. It was not just his military service at Romani which had not been recognised, but also the service {{of all those who}} fought in the Anzac Mounted Division at Romani, at El Arish, at Magdhaba and at Rafa. In September 1917, not long after General Edmund Allenby became Commander in Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, Chauvel wrote to GHQ to point out the injustice done to his front-line troops, acknowledging that it was [...] "difficult to do anything now to right this, but consider the Commander-in-Chief should <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> great deal of bitterness over it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, {{there seems}} to be bands that appear to be more lighthearted and less {{concerned}} over being described as deathcore. Scott Lewis of the San Diego-based deathcore band Carnifex started [...] "We're not one of those bands trying to escape the banner of deathcore. I know a lot of bands try and act like they have a big problem with that, but if you listen to their music, they are very 'deathcore.' I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lot of resentment towards deathcore and kind of younger bands." [...] Also in a 2012 interview with Chelsea Grin, guitarist Jake Harmond said: [...] "Everyone likes to flap their jaw and voice their own opinion how 'embarrassing' it is to be in a band that can be labeled 'deathcore,' but honestly we have never given a fuck." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{late night}} {{negotiations}} over wording, the IPCC added clarifications including [...] "due to natural variability, trends based on short records {{are very sensitive}} to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends", but at the press conference releasing the IPCC Summary for Policymakers on 27 September, journalists focussed questions on the [...] "pause" [...] rather than the overall conclusions. This focus resulted in headlines such as [...] "Global Warming Slowdown Seen as Emissions Rise to Record" [...] from Reuters. The National Post used the subheading [...] "IPCC report skeptics seize on lull in global warming". Even Nature headlined their news report [...] "IPCC: Despite hiatus, climate change here to stay", though it said that [...] "the 'hiatus' since the record hot year of 1998 — probably due to increased heat uptake by the oceans — is no sign that global warming has stopped, as some would like to hope", and quoted climatologist Thomas Stocker saying that [...] "Comparing short-term observations with long-term model projections is inappropriate", and adding [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lot of natural fluctuation in the climate system. A 15-year hiatus is not so unusual even though the jury is out as to what exactly may have caused the pause." [...] He said that claims dismissing climate models would only be justified if [...] "temperature were to remain constant for the next 20 years", and Brian Hoskins said other factors showed climate change.|$|E
