We first compare properties of topologies that can be obtained from networks deploying CDP versus Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and Management Information Base (MIB) Forwarding Database (FDB).

A smaller blocking effect was found when participants performed a highly demanding secondary task than when they performed a less demanding secondary task. The modulatory effect of secondary task difficulty was significant only when the secondary task was administered during both the learning and the test phase of the contingency judgement task. The results suggest that <b>forward</b> <b>blocking</b> in human contingency learning cannot be fully accounted for by associative processes. Instead, <b>forward</b> <b>blocking</b> seems to depend at least partially on deliberate deductive reasoning processes. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Thyristors able {{to block}} 4 kV have been {{fabricated}} and characterised. The experimental forward current is 1. 3 A @ V-AK = 10 V for a 9 mA gate current during 550 ns. The device active area is 2. 3 mm(2). The devices and their edge terminations {{have been designed}} using numerical simulations. Two different edge terminations have been envisaged (mesa and a combination of mesa and JTE). A SiO 2 passivation layer also improves the <b>forward</b> <b>blocking</b> voltage depending on the sign and {{the magnitude of the}} effective charge density in the oxide. The mesa protection is not enough to allowing the thyristor to block 5 kV, due to the low etching rate in SiC. Thus, a mesa/JTE protection has been used. The influence of the etching depth, the JTE dose and length on the <b>forward</b> <b>blocking</b> voltage of the thyristor has been studied in details. Simulation results have allowed designing the devices, not far from the optimal structure. The best results of the <b>forward</b> <b>blocking</b> voltage are 4 kV for the mesa protected thyristor, while the mesa/JTE combination yields 3. 6 M Furthermore, experimental results confirm the simulations concerning the influence of the oxide thickness on the <b>forward</b> <b>blocking</b> voltage. The better results for the mesa protected thyristor are due to a lower interface SiC/SiO 2 charge density provided by the different oxidation processes (at different foundries). In addition, the comparison between experiments and simulations allows estimate the effective charge density of the SiO 2 layer in 10 (12) - 5 x 10 (12) cm(- 2) range for the two fabricated thyristors. The improvement in the <b>forward</b> <b>blocking</b> voltage must pass through an improvement of the passivation layer. Passivation still remains a technological key step to obtain SiC high-voltage devices. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The enhanced noise is the signature of electron bunching, which originates from random switches between the strongly and weakly conducting states of the QD.

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that outcome additivity pretraining modulates blocking in human causal learning. However, the existing evidence confounds outcome additivity and outcome maximality. Here the authors present evidence for the influence of presenting information about outcome maximality (Experiment 1) and outcome additivity (Experiment 2) on subsequent <b>forward</b> <b>blocking.</b> The results of Experiment 3 confirm that, with outcome maximality controlled, outcome additivity affects backward blocking but not release from overshadowing.
