50|$|IBM ThinkPad 760CD - Produced {{as a small}} {{improvement}} over the original 760C, again with the improved 90/120 MHz Pentium I processor and option of RAM expansion. The chassis was updated to allow the standard fitment of in <b>internal</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although a {{significant}} advance over preceding portable Macs, the PowerBook 5300 {{suffered from a}} number of design faults and manufacturing problems that have led to it being cited as among the worst Apple products of all time. Amongst other issues, {{it was one of the}} first laptops to suffer negative publicity from battery fires, and featured a hot-swappable drive bay with insufficient space for an <b>internal</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
50|$|The early models did {{not come}} with an <b>internal</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive,</b> but these soon {{appeared}} as mobile technology progressed. Such models can link up with an external CD-ROM drive through the parallel port on the rear (since USB ports came later as well). Some Satellites also lacked an internal floppy disk drive, but a port on the side allowed {{the use of a}} proprietary external module for such. These machines tended to be smaller in physical size than their contemporaries.|$|E

5000|$|Apple {{had first}} popularized the 3.5" [...] floppy on the Macintosh line and IBM {{brought them to}} the PC in 1986 with the PC Convertible. In addition, they could be had as an {{optional}} feature on the XT and AT. The PS/2 line used entirely 3.5" [...] drives which assisted in their quick adoption by the industry, although the lack of 5.25" [...] drive bays in the computers created problems later on in the 90s as they could not accommodate <b>internal</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drives.</b> In addition, the lack of 5.25" [...] floppy drives meant that PS/2 users could not easily run the large body of existing IBM compatible software.|$|R
50|$|The Macintosh IIvx (code name Brazil) is {{the last}} of the Macintosh II series of Macintosh {{computers}} from Apple Computer. The IIvx included either a 40, 80, 160 or 400 MB hard drive, three NuBus slots, and a Processor Direct Slot. It was the first Macintosh to have a metal case and the first case design of any personal computer to provide for an <b>internal</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive.</b> An internal double-speed CD-ROM drive which used a disc caddy was available as an option from Apple.|$|E
50|$|The Mac IIvx {{began its}} life in {{development}} as a proof-of-concept to see how an <b>internal</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> could be added to a Mac. But after Apple CEO John Sculley gave a speech at MacWorld Tokyo which promised a Mac with a CD-ROM drive, the IIvx was rushed into production. Several shortcuts were taken in its design; most notably, its 32 MHz processor was crippled by a 16 MHz bus, making it slightly slower than the popular but aging Macintosh IIci. Its serial port was limited to 57.6 kbit/s, which could cause problems with serial connections and MIDI hardware. The Macintosh IIvi (a slower version of the IIvx with a 16MHz processor) was introduced {{at the same time}} but discontinued only four months later. The high-end member of the original Performa family, the Performa 600 was also based on the same architecture. The IIvx was the only model in the series with a 32K L2 cache.|$|E
50|$|The {{success of}} the {{original}} LTE series led Compaq to apply the designation to later models. The LTE 386 made extensive use of flexible electronics for the motherboard and motherboard interconnects. Other later Compaq LTE computers had a pointing stick {{in the middle of}} the keyboard, however the LTE Elite 486 models had a trackball mounted to the right of the LCD screen. The LTE Elite series had an easily removable hard drive for data security purposes. Starting with the LTE 386, the LTE series computers were able to connect to a (in some cases, powered) docking station to act as a regular desktop computer. Later models are able to remove the floppy drive to add an <b>internal</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive,</b> which was an expensive upgrade option for the late LTE series. The last LTE laptops were the 5000 series ending with the 5400, which had a 150 MHz Pentium processor and was quite capable of running Windows 98SE. It also allowed for swappable Floppy Drive/CD-ROM Drive.|$|E

5000|$|CD-ROM discs {{are read}} using <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drives.</b> A <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> may be {{connected}} to the computer via an IDE (ATA), SCSI, SATA, FireWire, or USB interface or a proprietary interface, such as the Panasonic CD interface, LMSI/Philips, Sony and Mitsumi standards, [...] Virtually all modern <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> can also play audio CDs (as well as Video CDs and other data standards) when used with the right software.|$|R
50|$|Other PAS cards {{included}} proprietary interfaces to <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> {{they were}} packaged with. These included drives made by Sony and Matsushita (Panasonic). There was also variant with LMSI controller for LMSI Philips CM205, CM206 <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The new AV {{machines}} {{were some of}} the first to ship standard with an <b>internal</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> (earlier Quadra and Centris models were available with the built-in CD-ROM drive as optional extras). The Quadra 840av was the first Apple computer to come with an internal CD-ROM standard. The operating system installation package came on CD-ROM rather than a series of floppy disks whenever the CD-ROM drive was included. A hidden QuickTime video included on the original Quadra 840AV/Centris 660AV [...] "Install Me First" [...] CD-ROM, shows the jubilant Cyclone / Tempest design team in the midst of celebrating their accomplishment. In this video, a Cyclone (840AV) prototype logic board is shown. The logic board is fitted with a 25 MHz 68040, a number of rework wires, and most conspicuously, a daughter card nicknamed [...] "Karma", on which the audio and video input/output ports are located. Notably, the audio and video ports on the card are front-facing, positioned as though they would protrude from an opening in the lower front of the case, where they are more easily accessible to the user. According to a member of the team, the [...] "AV on a card" [...] feature was omitted, because there was not enough room for it in the case. Coinciding with the introduction of both AV Macs, Apple introduced the Apple AudioVision 14 Display, featuring easily accessible audio input, audio output and video input ports of its own, which could be fed by an ADC adapter cable connected with the rear AV ports of the AV Macs.|$|E

5000|$|An {{optional}} 1.44 MB 3.5" [...] MS-DOS/IBM compatible floppy drive can be fitted. An optional 644 MB SunCD 32X-speed, Photo CD compatible <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> or {{an optional}} 10X DVD-ROM could be specified as well.
