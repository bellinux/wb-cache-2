5|$|To find {{an effect}} which ruled out mere exposure, Nuttin created a yoked control design {{in which two}} {{subjects}} evaluated the same letters separately. Some of the letters belonged to one subject's name, {{and some of the}} letters belonged to the other subject's name, while some were random. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>design,</b> any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name.|$|E
5|$|When {{radially}} broaching workpieces {{that require}} a deep cut per tooth, such as forgings or castings, a rotor-cut or jump-cut design can be used; these broaches are also known as free egress or nibbling broaches. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>design</b> the RPT is designated {{to two or three}} rows of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide notch, or undercut, and then the next tooth has a smaller notch (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no notch. This allows for a deep cut while keeping stresses, forces, and power requirements low.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their trucks with adjacent cars. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>design</b> by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only {{reduced the number of}} trucks under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E

25|$|The great {{advance in}} {{magnetron}} design was the resonant cavity magnetron or electron-resonance magnetron, which works on entirely different principles. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>design</b> the oscillation {{is created by}} the physical shaping of the anode, rather than external circuits or fields.|$|E

25|$|A renewed {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>design</b> structure {{came with the}} proliferation of the Xen VMM software, ongoing discussion on monolithic vs. micro-kernels (particularly in Usenet newsgroups and Web forums), Microsoft's Ring-1 design structure as part of their NGSCB initiative, and hypervisors embedded in firmware such as Intel VT-x (formerly Vanderpool).|$|E
25|$|The highest surge-current rated film {{capacitors}} are film/foil capacitors with a {{metal foil}} construction. These capacitors use thin metal foils, usually aluminum, as the electrodes overlying the polymer film. The advantage of this construction is the easy and robust connection of the metal foil electrodes. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>design,</b> the contact resistance {{in the area of}} the schoopage is the lowest.|$|E

25|$|These are {{the prime}} main-line steam {{locomotives}} of the railway, {{and are in}} high demand for tourist services. Two of them, double headed, are required to scale the steepest grades with a train of any length. Like the other locomotives they are tank engines with large side tanks and a rear coal bunker, under cover of the cab roof <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>design,</b> {{the tank}} is placed behind the cab, usually over a {{supporting}} bogie. This removes {{the weight of}} the water from the driving wheels, giving the locomotive a constant tractive weight. The disadvantage is a reduction in water carrying capacity. A rear tank is an essential component of the American Forney type of loco, which is essentially a 4-4-0 American-type with wheels reversed.|$|E
25|$|The urine {{separation}} function {{can also}} be achieved by designing the toilet bowl {{in such a way}} as to take advantage of the Coandă effect. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>design,</b> users must direct their urine stream against the interior walls of the bowl (usually assisted by a sloping front section) so that it can be collected via a small trough that is recessed into the base of the bowl.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} {{had been}} long before selected, and {{the whole of the}} ground had even been surveyed, with a view to meet the contingency which had now actually occurred; but then it must be remembered, that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>design</b> the co-operation of the IV Corps (Bülow's) was fully expected, whereas the latter had now become a doubtful question: and hence it was that Blücher was led to place more reliance upon a direct support from Wellington, than would otherwise have been the case.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{design for}} the roof {{is suggested by the}} slightly earlier Trajan's Column, where watchtowers are shown with hipped (or pyramidal) roofs. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>design,</b> a balcony is shown below the roof, acting as the observation platform. To maintain the equivalent viewing height as the flat roofed design, this design would necessitate a slightly higher tower. Physical evidence supporting this design {{comes in the form of}} both roof tiles fragments in a few turrets, and slates in some others.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>design,</b> used {{in earlier}} and smaller locomotives, {{the water is}} stored in a 'well' on the {{underside}} of the locomotive, generally between the locomotive's frames. This does not restrict access to the boiler, but space is limited there, and the design is therefore not suitable for locomotives that need a good usable range before refilling. The arrangement does, however, have the advantage of creating a low centre of gravity, creating greater stability on poorly laid or narrow gauge tracks. The original tank locomotive, Novelty, was a well tank.|$|E

25|$|A closed {{collection}} system has a barrier or diaphragm {{that separates the}} pump tubing from the horn. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>design,</b> the suction of the pump motor lifts the diaphragm to create a vacuum within the collection system to extract milk. An open system allows for the free passage of air/suction. Bacteria and viral filters may be present to prevent any contamination or overflow into pump motor. The pump mechanism motor's suction is directly passed to the mothers breast versus indirectly with closed diaphragm systems.|$|E
25|$|The Mathieu {{groups can}} be {{constructed}} in various ways. Initially, Mathieu and others constructed them as permutation groups. It was difficult to see that M24 actually existed, that its generators did not just generate the alternating group A24. The matter was clarified when Ernst Witt constructed M24 as the automorphism (symmetry) group of an S(5,8,24) Steiner system W24 (the Witt design). M24 is the group of permutations that map every block <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>design</b> to some other block. The subgroups M23 and M22 then are easily defined to be the stabilizers of a single point {{and a pair of}} points respectively.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{of using}} a grid for control was {{patented}} by Lee de Forest, resulting in considerable research into alternate tube designs that would avoid his patents. One concept used a magnetic field instead of an electrical charge to control current flow, leading {{to the development of}} the magnetron tube. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>design,</b> the tube was made with two electrodes, typically with the cathode in the form of a metal rod in the center, and the anode as a cylinder around it. The tube was placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet arranged such that the magnetic field was aligned parallel to the axis of the electrodes.|$|E
