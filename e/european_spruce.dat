2500|$|Although {{sometimes}} described, e.g., by Switzer (1960), as relatively {{resistant to}} attack by insects and disease, white spruce {{is far from}} immune to depredation. Important insect pests of white spruce include the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana [...] ), the yellow-headed spruce sawfly (Pikonema alaskensis Rohwer), the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> sawfly (Gilpinia hercyniae [...] ), and spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis [...] ) (Fowells 1965, Rose and Lindquist 1985, Ives and Wong 1988). As well, other budworms, sawflies, and bark beetles, gall formers, bud midges, leaf miners, aphids, leaf eaters, leaf rollers, loopers, mites, scales, weevils, borers, pitch moths, and spittlebugs cause varying degrees of damage to white spruce (Ives and Wong 1988).|$|E

50|$|For most declining species {{the main}} problem is lack of dead wood in the forest. When {{suitable}} tree trunks are too sparse in the landscape, not all species are able to spread to new trunks after old ones have been consumed, causing the population to decline and eventually vanish. Thus, species that are abundant in old-growth forests with abundant dead wood can be totally absent from managed forests. For instance Amylocystis lapponica and Fomitopsis rosea are dominant species in North <b>European</b> old-growth <b>spruce</b> forests from Poland to Norway, but absent in managed forests.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a rising}} {{interest}} {{in the role of}} species diversity in ecosystem functioning and services, including productivity. Yet, how the diversity-productivity relationship depends on species identity and abiotic conditions remains a challenging issue. We analysed mixture effects on species productivity along site productivity gradients, calculated from a set of abiotic factors, in two biogeographic contexts (highlands and lowlands). We compared the productivity of 5 two-species mixtures (i. e. 10 cases of mixed species) with that of monocultures of the same species. Five main European tree species were considered: sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst). Our data set was compiled from the 2006 to 2010 French National Forest Inventory data base and covers 2361 plots including pure and mixed stands. Overall productivity of mixtures in highlands, that is <b>European</b> beech-Norway <b>spruce,</b> <b>European</b> beech-silver fir and to a lesser extent, silver fir-Norway spruce, was found to be higher than expected from the productivity of corresponding monospecific stands. Overyielding was mainly due to European beech for the first two mixtures and to silver fir for the third one. No effect of mixture was found for sessile oak-Scots pine and sessile oak-European beech stands in lowlands. Overyielding of sessile oak mixed with Scots pine was not strong enough to significantly increase overall stand productivity. Overyielding of European beech was balanced by an underyielding of sessile oak. The mixture effect changed along site productivity gradients for six cases out of the 10 studied, with a stronger and positive effect on sites with low productivity. The magnitude of this change along site productivity gradients varied up to 89 % depending on the tree species. Synthesis. The nature of species interaction in mixtures with regard to productivity changes with species assemblage and abiotic conditions. Overyielding is strongest when species grow in highlands on less productive sites. A negative link between mixture effect and site productivity was found, in line with the stress-gradient hypothesis...|$|R
50|$|Especially {{protected}} are the Norway spruce-dominated highland forests, mixed mountain {{forests of}} European silver fir, <b>European</b> beech and <b>spruce</b> trees and water meadow spruce woods in the valleys. Although a few remnants of ancient forest remain, the National Park area is still {{heavily influenced by}} the former forestry industry. Since nature is now left to take its course again, there is no human intervention when there are catastrophic events such as large scale bark beetle infestation. This resulted {{in the death of}} a portion of the high elevation forests in the 1990s and triggered controversial discussions amongst the residents of the National Park, which highlighted differing attitudes to the wilderness. As the result of a compromise, bark beetle is now fought in the buffer area.|$|R
40|$|Experiments on somatic {{embryogenesis}} in selected spruce, fir and larch species {{were performed to}} determine if this method of micropropagation enables production of quality seedlings for forest nurseries. High frequencies of embryogenic callus in spruce (23 - 31 %) and fir (29 %) were achieved when mature zygotic embryos were used as explants, while in larches (36 %) only when megagametophytes (endosperms with immature embryos) were used. The possibility of {{somatic embryogenesis}} initiation also from somatic embryos (resulting in secondary and third generation of embryogenic callus) indicate high efficiency of this method of micropropagation. The best results at all stages of somatic embryogenesis (good proliferation of embryogenic callus, high rate of embryo regeneration and their survival) were obtained for Norway <b>spruce,</b> <b>European</b> larch and some hybrid larches...|$|R

40|$|The {{disturbances}} are processes, which {{change the}} landscape (Bengstsson et al., 2003). In Central <b>European</b> mountains <b>spruce</b> forest, windthrows and subsequent bark beetle (Ips typographus) outbreaks {{are the most}} important (Bengstsson et al., 2003; Brůna, 2013; Čada, 2013; Fischer et al., 2002; Matějka, 2013) This scenario was taking place in the study area - the Šumava National Park between 2006 and 2012. The objective was to analyse changes in the land cover caused by the disturbances. The land cover flows were used. The Land cover flows describe changes within land cover types: the area of change from one type into another (Martinez-Fernandez et al., 2015). Layers of the land cover for each year were created; they show the changes mostly in forested landscape. These fourteen-land cover types layers were input into analysis in the Land change modeler for ArcGIS (Clark Labs, 2015). The most important land cover flows were set and further analysis of evaluation in five spatial frames (Physical - geographical typology, Aspect, Elevation, Ecological conditions, Non-intervention and intervention management) were undergone for deeper knowledge about spatial factors of distribution.
