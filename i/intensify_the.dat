5|$|A {{tropical}} depression developed well {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles on August29. Initially drifting westward, the storm gradually intensified and became a tropical storm early the next day. By August31, the system strengthened into a Category1 hurricane. The next day, the hurricane entered the Caribbean Sea, passing the island of Dominica as a Category2 hurricane. Continuing to <b>intensify,</b> <b>the</b> storm further intensified into a Category3 hurricane on September2 {{and then to a}} Category4 the following day. Around 18:00UTC on September3, the hurricane peaked with winds of 155mph (250km/h), observed by a ship. Simultaneously, the storm made landfall near Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Virgil was a late season {{hurricane}} of the 1992 Pacific {{hurricane season}} that struck southwestern Mexico in October 1992. Forming from a tropical wave that left Africa on September 13, it slowly {{developed into a}} tropical depression. It soon strengthened into Tropical Storm Virgil, and rapidly intensified into a hurricane on October 2. Continuing to <b>intensify,</b> <b>the</b> hurricane attained major hurricane strength, and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane {{off the coast of}} Mexico. Shortly before landfall, it weakened to a Category 2 hurricane, and it dissipated on October 5. Damage was generally minimal, though one person was reported missing.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} landfall, the NHC issued a {{tropical}} storm warning from Baffin Bay, Texas to Rio San Fernando, Mexico; this was canceled once the storm failed to <b>intensify.</b> <b>The</b> Servicio Meteorológico Nacional warned residents of gusty winds and heavy rainfall in excess of 4–8in (100–200mm) capable of producing localized flooding and mudslides. Upon moving ashore, the depression produced a storm surge of 2–4ft (0.6–1.2m) along the southern coastline of Texas. Rainfall accumulations peaked at 5.16in (131mm) along the Guadalupe River, with lesser amounts elsewhere, including across areas affected by Hurricane Alex a week prior.|$|E

5|$|She {{pointed out}} that when the {{discussion}} was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to <b>intensify</b> <b>the</b> war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E

5|$|When {{neutrophils}} {{release their}} granule contents in the kidney, {{the contents of}} the granule (reactive oxygen compounds and proteases) degrade the extracellular matrix of host cells and can cause damage to glomerular cells, affecting their ability to filter blood and causing changes in shape. In addition, phospholipase products (e.g., leukotrienes) <b>intensify</b> <b>the</b> damage. This release of substances promotes chemotaxis of more neutrophils to the site of infection, and glomerular cells can be damaged further by the adhesion molecules during the migration of neutrophils. The injury done to the glomerular cells can cause renal failure.|$|E

5|$|A British assault force {{landed on}} the island on 7 February, after which Nelson moved to <b>intensify</b> <b>the</b> {{blockade}} off Bastia. For {{the rest of the}} month he carried out raids along the coast and intercepted enemy shipping. By late February St Fiorenzo had fallen and British troops under Lieutenant-General David Dundas entered the outskirts of Bastia. However, Dundas merely assessed the enemy positions and then withdrew, arguing that the French were too well entrenched to risk an assault. Nelson convinced Hood otherwise, but a protracted debate between the army and naval commanders meant that Nelson did not receive permission to proceed until late March. Nelson began to land guns from his ships and emplace them in the hills surrounding the town. On 11 April the British squadron entered the harbour and opened fire, whilst Nelson took command of the land forces and commenced bombardment. After 45 days, the town surrendered. Nelson subsequently prepared for an assault on Calvi, working in company with Lieutenant-General Charles Stuart.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} developed {{within the}} Intertropical Convergence Zone on June17 and remained distinct on its track west. An {{area of low pressure}} developed {{in association with}} the system over the northwestern Caribbean on June24 and further organized into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC the following day, supported by data from a reconnaissance aircraft. Steered west and eventually west-northwest by an expansive ridge across the Bahamas and Gulf of Mexico, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alex by 06:00UTC on June26 and attained an initial peak with winds of 65mph (100km/h) before moving ashore near Belize City, Belize several hours later. Alex maintained tropical storm intensity as it crossed the Yucatan Peninsula, and upon executing a northward turn and a second westward bend, began to steadily <b>intensify.</b> <b>The</b> cyclone intensified into the season's first hurricane at 00:00UTC on June30 and attained peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) as it made landfall near Soto la Marina, Mexico, at 02:00UTC on July1. Once inland, Alex turned west-southwest and rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico. It dissipated by 06:00UTC on July2.|$|E
5|$|In November 1994, the Siege of Bihać {{entered a}} {{critical}} stage as the VRS and the ARSK {{came close to}} capturing the town from the Bosniak-dominated ARBiH. Bihać {{was seen as a}} strategic area by the international community. It was thought that its capture by Serb forces would <b>intensify</b> <b>the</b> war, widening the division between the United States on one side and France and the United Kingdom on the other (advocating different approaches to the area's preservation), and feared that Bihać would become the worst humanitarian disaster of the war. Furthermore, denying Bihać to the Serbs was strategically important to Croatia. Brigadier General Krešimir Ćosić expected the VRS and the ARSK would threaten Karlovac and Sisak once they captured Bihać, while Chief of Croatia's General Staff General Janko Bobetko believed the fall of Bihać would represent an end to Croatia's war effort.|$|E

5|$|Khánh had {{a meeting}} with Lodge in the morning of the coup for around an hour after {{arranging}} a meeting through Wilson. Due to concerns as to whether Washington would express support for the coup and what the official policy was, the meeting was not held at the embassy but at the home of Lodge's aide Dunn. However, if Lodge was concerned about keeping a low profile regarding the coup, Khánh was not, arriving at Dunn's residence with seven jeeploads of aides before embracing Lodge. He told Lodge that he would go after the communists aggressively and that the coup would not disrupt the military in any significant way. Khánh vowed to <b>intensify</b> <b>the</b> war effort, ask Lodge for guidance constantly, introduce democracy and install a direct phone line between Vietnamese military headquarters and the US Embassy. Lodge also reported that Khánh wanted {{to give the impression that}} he seriously thought that neutralist deal involving de Gaulle was a genuine and ominous prospect, and that de Gaulle had made much progress in influencing the previous administration.|$|E
5|$|On June24, 2004, {{an area of}} low {{pressure}} associated with developing convection formed about 1,110km (690mi) to the east-southeast of Guam. Early the next day, as the system began to <b>intensify,</b> <b>the</b> Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the {{low pressure}} as a tropical depression. With low wind shear and favorable diffluence, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the storm at 0000UTC, classifying it as Tropical Depression 11W twelvehours later. The depression traveled towards the northwest along the edge of a mid-latitude ridge. Outer bands began developing around the system, although the ridge to its north restricted outflow. About 24hours after the JMA designated the depression, the agency upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Tingting, which was contributed by Hong Kong and is a fairly common pet name for young girls. At 0600UTC on June26, the JTWC also classified Tingting as a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|On June8, a {{tropical}} wave exited {{the west coast}} of Africa, moving quickly westward without development. During the evening hours of June15, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a large area of disturbed weather in association with {{a tropical}} wave over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. That day, a low pressure area developed just north of Panama. Drifting west-northwest, environmental conditions were expected to be favorable for organization, but the system moved over eastern Nicaragua on June16. Despite moving over land, the circulation and convection became better organized, and after it emerged over open waters, the system developed into Tropical Depression Two at 1200UTC on June17 about 25mi (45km) north-northwest of La Ceiba, Honduras. Located about 60mi (95km) east of Monkey River Town, Belize, the depression was not expected to undergo significant strengthening. Failing to <b>intensify,</b> <b>the</b> depression made landfall in southern Belize near Big Creek late on June17 with winds estimated at 35mph (55km/h). Despite a waning structure, the NHC noted that if the system emerged into the Bay of Campeche, re-development and intensification was plausible.|$|E

5|$|The area of low {{pressure}} gained sufficient shower activity and organization to be renamed as a tropical cyclone at 1800UTC on 10 March while located {{southwest of the}} Solomon Islands capital of Honiara. Erica gradually intensified, attaining the equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS) Originally moving to the southeast at a slow pace, Erica began to accelerate due to the influence of weak mid–level ridge to its east. Continuing to <b>intensify,</b> <b>the</b> cyclone reached its peak intensity on 13 March with a minimum barometric pressure of , and peak winds of 260km/h (150mph 1-minute sustained). The eye of the cyclone began to shrink in diameter and become symmetrical. Later on 13 March, Erica began to parallel the western coast of New Caledonia while maintaining a strong intensity, before crossing the extreme southern end of the island at the Caledonian island commune of L'Île-des-Pins.|$|E
5|$|A ridge located {{over the}} central Philippines caused Conson to turn towards the north. Continuing to <b>intensify,</b> <b>the</b> JTWC {{assessed}} the storm {{to have reached}} typhoon status at 1800UTC on June7. The JMA also upgraded the storm to a typhoon about twelve hours later. A 28km (17mi) wide eye developed as the cyclone turned towards the northeast. Originally, forecasts showed the typhoon making landfall in southern Taiwan but the turn towards the northeast spared the island from a direct hit. Shortly after being classified as a typhoon by the JMA, the JTWC upgraded Conson to a Category 2 typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 155km/h (100mph 1-minute winds). The eye later became slightly disorganized and the cloud tops around the center warmed. However, the storm reorganized {{the next day and}} was upgraded to a Category 3 typhoon by the JTWC with winds of 185km/h (115mph 1-minute winds). The intensification {{was the result of the}} influence of an approaching shortwave trough which enhanced poleward outflow. Around this time, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Typhoon 'Frank' as it moved out of their area of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|As {{the ridge}} pushed the storm {{away from the}} coast, weaker wind shear and warm sea-surface {{temperatures}} allowed Kiko to gradually <b>intensify.</b> <b>The</b> storm reached its peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) 991mbar (hPa; 29.28inHg) late on October 20 while located around 175mi (280km) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. As it {{moved away from the}} coast, an eye began to form. Shortly thereafter, shear increased and began to separate the low from the deep convection. By the afternoon of October21, the storm was poorly organized and the center was partially exposed. At this time, the weakening system had winds sustained at 50mph (85km/h). Early on October22, a brief burst in showers and thunderstorms allowed the storm to maintain its intensity. That evening, Kiko was downgraded to a tropical depression as strong wind shear removed convection from the storm's center and exposed the low. As the depression moved over a dryer and more hostile area, two inhibiting factors for development of tropical cyclones, it slowly weakened. It lost almost all convection and degenerated to a remnant low-pressure area on October23, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory that night. The remnant low moved west before dissipating on October27 over open waters.|$|E

5|$|In November 1994, the Siege of Bihać, {{a battle}} of the Bosnian War, entered a {{critical}} stage as the VRS and the ARSK came close to capturing the town of Bihać from the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). It was a strategic area and, since June 1993, Bihać {{had been one of}} six United Nations Safe Areas established in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The US administration felt that its capture by Serb forces would <b>intensify</b> <b>the</b> war and lead to a humanitarian disaster greater than any other in the conflict to that point. Amongst the United States, France and the United Kingdom, division existed regarding how to protect the area. The US called for airstrikes against the VRS, but the French and the British opposed them citing safety concerns and a desire to maintain the neutrality of French and British troops deployed {{as a part of the}} UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In turn, the US was unwilling to commit ground troops. On the other hand, the Europeans recognized that the US was free to propose military confrontation with the Serbs while relying on the European powers to block any such move, since French President François Mitterrand discouraged any military intervention, greatly aiding the Serb war effort. The French stance reversed after Jacques Chirac was elected president of France in May 1995, pressuring the British to adopt a more aggressive approach as well. Denying Bihać to the Serbs was also strategically important to Croatia, and General Janko Bobetko, the Chief of the Croatian General Staff, considered the potential fall of Bihać to represent an end to Croatia's war effort.|$|E
5|$|Photography was {{provided}} by Willy Hameister, {{who went on to}} work with Wiene on several other films. The camera does not play a large part in Caligari, and is used primarily to show the sets. The cinematography tends to alternate only between medium shots at straight-on angles and abrupt close-ups {{to create a sense of}} shock, but with few long shots or panning movement. Likewise, there is very little interscene editing. Most scenes follow the other without intercutting, which gives Caligari a more theatrical feel than a cinematic one. Heavy lighting is typically absent from the film, heightening the sense of darkness prevalent in the story. However, lighting is occasionally used to <b>intensify</b> <b>the</b> uneasiness created by the distortions of the sets. For example, when Cesare first awakens at the fair, a light is shone directly on a close-up of his heavily made-up face to create an unsettling glow. Additionally, lighting is used in a then-innovative way to cast a shadow against the wall during the scene in which Cesare kills Alan, so the viewer sees only the shadow and not the figures themselves. Lighting techniques like this became frequently used in later German films.|$|E
