500|$|In late 2010, The White Stripes reissued {{their first}} three albums on Third Man Records on a 180-gram vinyl along with 500 limited edition, [...] "split-colored" [...] records to {{accompany}} it. Jack hinted at a possible White Stripes reunion in a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair. He said, [...] "We thought we'd <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that we'd never done: a full tour of Canada, a documentary, coffee-table book, live album, a boxed set...Now that we've {{gotten a lot}} of that out of our system, Meg and I can get back in the studio and start fresh." ...|$|E
500|$|Disney's {{public persona}} was very {{different}} from his actual personality. Playwright Robert E. Sherwood described him as [...] "almost painfully shy... diffident" [...] and self-deprecating. According to his biographer Richard Schickel, Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public identity. Kimball argues that Disney [...] "played the role of a bashful tycoon who was embarrassed in public" [...] and knew that he was doing so. Disney acknowledged the façade, and told a friend that [...] "I'm not Walt Disney. I <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke. I smoke. Walt Disney does not drink. I drink." [...] Critic Otis Ferguson, in The New Republic, called the private Disney: [...] "common and everyday, not inaccessible, not in a foreign language, not suppressed or sponsored or anything. Just Disney." [...] Many of those with whom Disney worked commented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his exceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said [...] "That'll work", it was an indication of high praise. Instead of direct approval, Disney gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or recommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would be passed on.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} the album was thematically {{different}} from Fallen, Lee said that [...] "all of the negative and hard, difficult experiences" [...] that characterized the band's music still came across, but displays a less hopeless attitude. Rather than wallowing in [...] "the hard stuff", the record's theme reflects on looking for solutions and happiness. In an interview with MTV News, Lee said about the album's title: I feel like I {{have the ability to}} <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> I couldn't do before, for a number of reasons......A lot of doors have kind of been opened in my life—not just since everything has happened for us. The singer also felt the band [...] "broke the doors" [...] and tried doing different things, which was also an inspiration for the title. Simon Cosyns of The Sun labelled the record's artwork—which sees Lee in front of an open door—as [...] " [...] the dark Evanescence image intact, with sinister fairytale scenes, elaborate Victorian gothic arches, illuminated typography and elaborate flowing dresses". Dane Prokofiev of PopMatters praised the album cover, calling it [...] " [...] gother-looking piece." ...|$|E

500|$|Development on Mega Man 3 {{began at}} Capcom {{over a year}} after the release of Mega Man 2. Akira Kitamura, the lead {{supervisor}} for the first two games quit his job at the company during that gap of time. Artist Keiji Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", considered Mega Man 3 as one of his least favorite entries in the series due to [...] " [...] what went into the game and what was behind the release of the game." [...] He had [...] "preset notions" [...] about successful development because of the team's good experience with Mega Man 2 and found that his new superior [...] "didn't really understand Mega Man the way his predecessor did". During the game's production, the developers lost the main planner, so Inafune had to take over that job for its completion. Inafune recalled the final two months of development as particularly turbulent, when he had to take responsibility for assessing and dividing up tasks among the team members who were not meeting deadlines. The team was forced to put Mega Man 3 on the market before they thought it was ready. Inafune concluded, [...] "I knew that if we had more time to polish it, we could <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> better, make it a better game, but the company said that we needed to release it. The whole environment behind what went into the production of the game is what I least favored. Numbers one and two – I really wanted to make the games; I was so excited about them. Number three – it just turned very different." ...|$|E
