5000|$|In geology or geography, {{the word}} [...] "{{quadrangle}}" [...] usually {{refers to a}} United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute quadrangle map, which are usually named after a local physiographic feature. The shorthand [...] "quad" [...] is also used, especially {{with the name of}} the map; for example, [...] "the Ranger Creek, Texas quad map". These maps are one-quarter of the older 15-minute series. On a quadrangle map, the north and south limits of the quadrangle are not straight lines, but are actually curved to match <b>Earth's</b> <b>lines</b> of latitude on the standard projection. The east and west limits are usually not parallel as they match <b>Earth's</b> <b>lines</b> of longitude. In the United States, a 7.5 minute quadrangle map covers an area of 49 to 70 sq mi.|$|R
40|$|WO 2008125341 A 1 UPAB: 20081112 NOVELTY - The {{isolator}} has an <b>earth</b> <b>line</b> and {{a capacitor}} (c) {{arranged in a}} signal conducting line. The dimensions of the lines are designed such that the conducting line shields an electric field of propagated changing direct current voltage signals to provide an area on an upper surface of the conducting line. The amplitude of electric field strength of the voltage signals {{is lower than the}} amplitude of electric field strength of direct current voltage signals entering an upper surface of the <b>earth</b> <b>line,</b> in the area. The capacitor is arranged in the shielded area of the conducting line. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for isolation of direct current voltage and alternating current voltage components of signals. USE - Direct current voltage isolator for use in an amplifier for amplifying direct current or high frequency signals, and in a measuring technique (all claimed) that is used for measuring scattering parameters. ADVANTAGE - The isolator is designed such that the direct current voltage supply is provided with enlarged bandwidth, higher cut-off frequency and enhanced maximum direct current (DC) current flow. The isolator prevents a direct galvanic current flow between the signal-conducting <b>lines</b> and the <b>earth</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R

Not all figures have a unique reversion: the figures that are neither {{entering}} nor exiting revert into themselves, and the other figures with even points revert into their inverted figure. Reversion often represents an axial polarity, such as {{the male and female}} axis between Puer and Puella.|$|R

5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to <b>Earth's</b> <b>line</b> of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by {{a little more than a}} degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star.

30|$|The {{performance}} of the presented devices can be further improved {{by the addition of}} sensing of target objects, or by the usage of more sophisticated electrode structures (e.g., a multi-ring configuration). The 3 D shape of the Coulomb well can also be adjusted with a precise control of net charge density distribution on the trapping electrodes, e.g., by fixing <b>earth</b> <b>lines</b> in the microchannels. We believe that the working principle of the current device is applicable to smaller devices; therefore, it may lead to a sophisticated technique of “electrostatic nano-tweezers” for sorting, separation, trapping, and manipulation of individual charged nanoparticles, such as proteins and DNA, which are often naturally charged.|$|R

50|$|AU Mic's disk {{has been}} {{observed}} {{at a variety of}} different wavelengths, giving humans different types of information about the system. The light from the disk observed at optical wavelengths is stellar light that has reflected (scattered) off dust particles into <b>Earth's</b> <b>line</b> of sight. Observations at these wavelengths utilize a coronagraphic spot to block the bright light coming directly from the star. Such observations provide high-resolution images of the disk. Because light having a wavelength longer than the size of a dust grain is scattered only poorly, comparing images at different wavelengths (visible and near-infrared, for example) gives humans information about the sizes of the dust grains in the disk.|$|R
