5|$|Spirits {{were high}} during the unit's brief {{training}} period {{as the men}} enjoyed playing sports, observing the country scenery and experiencing the night-life of the nearby capital. They were not adequately trained, receiving only a basic medical examination, a few days' fitness training and a cursory explanation of proper conduct in the bush. They expressed surprise when instructed to paint stripes of camouflage green on their weapons and combat boots in the Rhodesian fashion, having never before <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> practice.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, 16 August {{after an}} {{inflammatory}} sermon, a demonstration {{organized by the}} Supreme Muslim Council marched to the Wall. The Acting High Commissioner summoned Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini and informed {{him that he had}} never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> demonstration being held at the Wailing Wall, {{and that it would be}} a terrible shock to the Jews who regarded the Wall as a place of special sanctity to them. At the Wall, the crowd burnt prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication left in the Wall's cracks, and the beadle was injured. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town.|$|E
500|$|According to Elisabeth Dhanens, {{the shape}} and rounded top of the {{original}} frame is reminiscent of those found on the top register of panels of the Ghent altarpiece, which are accepted as designed by Jan's brother Hubert. [...] She believes the current frame is too narrow and small, and contains [...] "clumsy marbling". From a detailed 1851 inventory, we know {{the text of the}} hymn inscribed on original frame. The text is written in a poetic form and begun on the lower border and then extended upwards on the vertical borders, ending on the top border. The lower border of the frame read FLOS FLORIOLORUM APPELLARIS; the sides and top MATER HEC EST FILIA PATER EST NATUS QUIS AUDIVIT TALIA DEUS HOMO NATUS ETCET ("The mother is the daughter. This father is born. Who has <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thing? God born a man"). The fifth stanza of the hymn (not included in van Eyck's transcription) reads, [...] "As the sunbeam through the glass. Passeth but not staineth. Thus, the Virgin, as she was. Virgin still remaineth." [...] The lettering on the hem of her robe echoes the inscription on the frame, words similar to those found on Mary's dress in van Eyck's 1436 Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele, a passage from the Book of Wisdom (7:29) reading EST ENIM HAEC SPECIOSIOR SOLE ET SUPER OMNEM STELLARUM DISPOSITIONEM. LUCI CONPARATA INVENITUR PRIOR ("For she is more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be superior").|$|E

2500|$|A {{portion of}} the highway near {{downtown}} Kansas City, Missouri was closed on May 20, 1997, in order to film the music video for the U2 song [...] "Last Night on Earth". The band reimbursed the Kansas City Police Department for all traffic control and security costs. A permit issued by the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (the predecessor to MoDOT) stated the closure [...] "will enhance and promote the notoriety of...Kansas City's skyline." [...] Mike Right, vice-president of public affairs for the American Automobile Association Auto Club of Missouri, told the Kansas City Star [...] "I can't believe the stupidity of it. They're going to close down an interstate highway that serves downtown Kansas City for a...music video? I've never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three centuries later, the English scholar Edward Jenks {{suggested}} that a chart {{said to have been}} created in 1542 and later held by the British Museum may have been Le Testu's source for Jave la Grande. Le Testu's Cosmographie Universelle (1555) and world atlas (1556) are both in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. [...] The map, said Jenks, was said to have been “the property of a man named Rotz, a French sailor who passed some part of his life in England”. [...] Jenks commented: “this fact gives some colour to the claim put forward by the French, that their countryman, Guillaume le Testu, was [...] the true discoverer of Australia. The claim is based mainly upon the fact that Testu’s name appears on a map dated 1555, on which a southern continent, styled Jave la Grande (“Great Java”), is outlined. But this fact, of course, merely proves that Testu had <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> country..." ...|$|E

"Si--the Signore did {{say that}} the family of Smees came from that island--as the vice-governatore calls it, though I {{acknowledge}} I never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> island. There are Sicilia, Sardegna, Elba, Caprea, Ischia, Irlanda, Inghilterra, Scozia, Malta, Capraya, Pianosa, Gorgona, and America, with several more in the east; but I never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> island as Guernsey. Si, Signore; we are humble people, and I hope modest people in the island of Elba, {{but we do know}} something {{of the rest of the}} world, notwithstanding. If you wish to hear these matters touched on ingeniously, however, you will do well to call in the vice-governatore for half an hour and invite him to open his stores of knowledge.

5000|$|As was {{the case}} in all three trials, the {{defendants}} pleaded innocent and insisted they were not members of any Mafia, and that they had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> organization. When Leggio took the stand he made the rather strange claim that he was being framed by a police officer who had [...] "begged me repeatedly to pleasure his wife; and I, for moral reasons, refused...Please don't ask me for names, I am a gentleman." [...] He and some other defendants did, however, admit to the minor crime of dealing on the black market during World War II.|$|R
60|$|But, {{it may be}} asked, {{what was}} my aim, whither went I, what {{inquiries}} had I made? To answer the last question first, I had made every possible inquiry, but {{with little or no}} result. Marie's letter had said that they were encamped {{on the bank of the}} Crocodile River, about fifty miles from Delagoa Bay. I asked everyone I met among the Portuguese--who, after all, were not many--if they had <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> encampment <b>of</b> emigrant Boers. But these Portuguese appeared to have heard nothing, except my host, Don José, who had a vague recollection of something--he could not remember what.|$|R
