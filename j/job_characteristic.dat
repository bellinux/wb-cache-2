Feedback {{refers to the}} degree that an individual receives direct and clear information about his or her performance related to work activities. Feedback is particularly important so that the employees continuously learn about how they are performing. Electronic communication provides fewer cues for teleworkers and thus, they may have more difficulties interpreting and gaining information, and subsequently, receiving feedback. When a worker is not in the office, there is limited information and greater ambiguity, such as in assignments and expectations. Role ambiguity, when situations have unclear expectations as to what the worker is to do, may result in greater conflict, frustration, and exhaustion.|$|E

Previous research found that four job characteristics (autonomy, variety, identity, and feedback) could increase workersâ performance, satisfaction, and attendance. Task significance was derived from Greg Oldhamâs own work experience as an assembly line worker. Though his job did not provide task variety or identity, he still experienced meaningfulness through the realization that others depended on his work. This realization led to the inclusion of task significance as another <b>job</b> <b>characteristic</b> that would influence experienced meaningfulness of the job.

It was found that autonomy increased teleworkers' satisfaction by reducing work-family conflicts, especially when workers were allowed to work outside of traditional work hours and be more flexible for family purposes. Additionally, autonomy explained an increase in employee engagement when {{the amount of time spent}} teleworking increased.

5000|$|Some of the {{potential}} benefits and drawbacks of telecommuting {{can be explained by}} <b>job</b> <b>characteristic</b> theory, which proposes that the traits and tasks of the job itself affect employeesâ work attitudes and behavior.

Many studies have provided evidence that job characteristics influence employeesâ behaviors and attitudes. [...] Additionally, job characteristics can interact with individual differences to impact employee attitudes and behavior. Of these five job characteristics, telework specifically changes autonomy and feedback compared to face-to-face work and can thus influence employeesâ behaviors and attitudes. According to Job Characteristics Theory, changes in autonomy and feedback influence work behaviors and attitudes more than a change in skill variety, task identity, or task significance.|$|E

50|$|The three {{critical}} psychological {{states of}} <b>job</b> <b>characteristic</b> theory (JCT) draw upon cognitive motivation theory and some previous work on identifying {{the presence of}} certain psychological states could lead to favorable outcomes. JCT provided the chance to systematically assessed {{the relationship between the}} previously discovered psychological states ('Experienced Meaningfulness, 'Experienced Responsibility, and Knowledge of Results) and outcomes. More importantly, previous work on work design showed job characteristics can predict individual performance, but did not provide âwhyâ and âhowâ this relationship existed. Job Characteristics Theory filled this gap by building a bridge between job characteristics and work-related outcomes through the use of the three critical psychological states. The three psychological states, which are also the conceptual core of the theory, include (1) Experienced Meaningfulness of the Work, (2) Experienced Responsibility for the Outcomes of the Work, and (3) Knowledge of the Results of Work Activities. These psychological states are theorized to mediate the relationship between job characteristics and work-related outcomes. According to the theory, these three critical psychological states are noncompensatory conditions, meaning jobholders have to experience all three critical psychological states to achieve the outcomes proposed in the model. For example, when workers experience the three psychological states, they feel good about themselves when they perform well. These positive feelings, in turn, reinforce the workers to keep performing well.|$|E
