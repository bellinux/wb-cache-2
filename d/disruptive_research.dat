30|$|Even {{in these}} early developments, long before the term ‘Systems Biology’ was coined, we can discern two {{principal}} trends: the strive for biological realism (see, e.g., [13]) {{and the search for}} fundamental design principles or ‘natural laws’ underlying the biological systems (see, e.g., [14]). These two trends are still visible today, e.g., comparing realistic simulations of the yeast cell cycle [15] with minimal model approaches [16] for the same system. In the case of the MAPK cascade (one of the systems with the richest modeling history in Systems Biology [17]), {{there seems to be a}} clear trend towards ever more detailed and realistic simulations. This research is of high relevance for the mathematical description and numerical exploration of a specific cellular function. One example is the work of Hatakeyama et al. [18], who studied the different regulatory events triggered by a single kinase, PI 3 K, via a detailed mathematical model (see also [19]). However, when searching for the <b>disruptive</b> <b>research</b> result that provided insight into the design principles of the cascade and its evolutionary constraints, the seminal work by Huang and Ferrell [20] stands out, where the cascade was related to ultrasensitivity. A recent progress in understanding further generic principles is reported in [21], where the broad range of dynamical behaviors a MAPK cascade can potentially display was studied with a technique developed in Physics – generalized modeling [22].|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Case {{management}} {{studies from}} Europe and the United States continue to yield conflicting results. At a symposium at the World Psychiatric Conference in Hamburg in 1999, researchers from four European countries explored the possible reasons {{for differences in}} outcome. They also examined reasons for the differing foci of case management studies across the different cultures. The authors summarize the symposium's findings. METHODS: Individual case presentations were given of studies and services from the United Kingdom (three studies), Sweden (two studies), Germany, and Italy (one each). Outcomes, methodologies, and national service context were examined. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A significant influence of national culture is evident both in the acceptability of case management and in approaches to researching it. Case management is perceived as an "Anglophone import" in Italy but is now national policy for persons with severe mental illness in the other three countries. Studies from the United Kingdom emphasized methodological rigor, with little attention to treatment content, whereas those from Sweden accepted a less <b>disruptive</b> <b>research</b> approach but with a more prescriptive stipulation of treatment content. Studies from Italy and Germany {{emphasized the importance of}} differing descriptive methodologies. Marked differences in the range of social care provision were noted across Europe. Overall, European researchers are less concerned than U. S. researchers with studying the impact of case management on hospital use...|$|E
40|$|Response to {{environmental}} change {{is at the}} heart of firm sustainability. In the case of <b>disruptive</b> technology, previous <b>research</b> describes this challenge as a problem of commitment. Because disruptive proposals do not fit the criteria considered in the existing resource allocation process, they are denied organizational commitment. The following research seeks to address the phenomenon where incumbents do commit substantial resources, but then force those commitments around their existing business rather than find new markets. The analysis draws on extensive multi-level, longitudinal field data collected from a single revelatory case of a newspaper company as its management responded to the Internet. The conceptual framework for the study links the resource allocation and threat rigidity literatures. The data show that threat framing helps build impetus and commitment for disruptive projects that would otherwise stall. However, this same threat-induced action invokes a set of rigidities that prove maladaptive in the face of <b>disruptive</b> change. The <b>research</b> suggests that the role of structure goes beyond resource allocation. Structural independence creates strategic de-coupling of threat and opportunity framing, allowing the simultaneous management of otherwise inconsistent frames.

40|$|This bachelor’s thesis {{builds on}} the {{phenomenon}} of disruptive innovation and the business philosophy of market orientation. More specifically, it strives to study how market orientation could help incumbent companies to defend against disruptive innovations (i. e. avoid losing market share disruptive competitors). The main research methods are literature reviews as well as qualitative meta-analysis, which both help in the definition and discussion of the relevant concepts, such as market orientation and disruptive innovation. Based on the literature of innovation management and management practice research streams I identified four components which are crucial to incumbent’s defense against disruptive innovations: (1) early recognition of potential disruptions, (2) response strategy formulation, (3) response strategy implementation, (4) innovation ability. Subsequently, these items are cross analyzed with the existing literature of marketing orientation, resulting in a confirmation of marketing orientation’s positive effect on three of the components, namely 1, 3, and 4. The findings are significant, as they open a novel instance of market orientation’s indirect performance benefits. In addition, the thesis contributed to the <b>disruptive</b> innovation <b>research</b> by suggesting a broader approach to disruptive innovation respondin...|$|R

40|$|Families {{migrate to}} improve their outcomes, however the process is very <b>disruptive.</b> My <b>research</b> asks and answers the {{question}} can scaffolding communication through technology mitigate the disruption caused to families by migration, and if so, how? In my work I have explored two forms of disruptive family migration—parental migration (where parents and children live in separate countries) and refugee resettlement (resulting from forced migration). In both forms, families are embedded in support networks of individuals they rely on to minimize vulnerabilities faced post-migration and to rebuild a stable family structure. My empirical results revealed barriers (distance, language, literacy and so forth) that render the communication between families and their support network less than effective. Through participatory approaches, I then design and evaluate separately, two systems to mitigate the barriers and improve communication in the various support networks. The end contributions of my work include: i) contributing a nascent agenda on migration for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and related fields through providing an increased understanding of the challenges that limit the livelihoods of migration-separated and refugee families; ii) demonstrating two communication scaffolding systems for transient use by migrants to mitigate communication barriers [...] - time and distance on one hand (to support transnational home-school communication) and language and literacy on the other (through mediated human-in-the-loop voice translations for everyday interactions with refugees); iii) putting forth a reflection on methods to guide others seeking to work with similar groups and establishing the notion of designing for transient use {{in the development of}} systems to scaffold communication.

40|$|Problem/Purpose: Process {{prioritisation}} is an ill-structured {{and complex}} problem that {{remains a mystery}} phase in business process management (BPM) research. More explorative approaches {{are called upon to}} tackle process management problems, to facilitate process innovation and to design new processes in dynamic environments. This dissertation aims (i) to design and evaluate a Prioritisation and Categorisation Method (PCM) for addressing process prioritisation problems; and (ii) to explore process innovation by <b>disruptive</b> technologies. <b>Research</b> methods: This research follows the design science research (DSR) paradigm. The design exploration and the engaged scholarship approaches are also adapted. The demonstration and evaluation of the Prioritisation and Categorisation Method have been conducted with case studies in large Swedish companies, i. e. Seco Tools and Ericsson. An empirical study of the impacts of disruptive technologies on process innovation was conducted at a large insurance company in Sweden. Results: This research has led to the design and evaluation of the PCM: a new context-aware, effective and holistic method for BPM. In addition, the lessons learnt from the insurance case deepened the understanding of the challenges that are faced by a company when exploring new capabilities (e. g. processes and IT) for future business. Such lessons also emphasise the necessity of configuring PCM based upon business contingencies and industry factors in process prioritisation. Contributions: This dissertation contributes a novel method to explore BPM in a holistic, yet flexible and effective way. The challenges identified in process innovations improve the configuration capabilities of the PCM through {{a deeper understanding of the}} dynamic capabilities within organisations (Capability Layer Model-CLM). This research contributes design knowledge to DSR in the forms of the PCM as an invention, and the three design principles for the PCM: design by holistics, design by commitments and design by explorations.
