5|$|Between 1959 and 1962, Balabushka {{handcrafted}} between 20 and 30 cues {{per year}} on a part-time basis. Because of the relative dearth of private cuemakers and the excellence of his product, Balabushka's name quickly became known amongst professional players. By the end of 1962, Balabushka was receiving more orders for cues than he could fill given his time constraints. Balabushka accordingly sold <b>his</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pool room, converted his garage into a carpentry shop, and by 1964 was building cues full-time, while continuing to hone his cuemaking abilities.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} {{pre-production}} {{on the third}} series began, Bullen had grown tired of writing the series single-handedly and believed all the stories that could be told had been told. ITV were keen {{to increase the number}} of episodes per series to 20 but Granada refused, though did agree to add two more, bringing the total to eight. A writing team of five was assembled, overseen by Bullen. Four of the scriptwriters were deemed not good enough and they parted company with Granada. David Nicholls remained and scripted four of the eight-third series episodes; Bullen wrote the other four and <b>his</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series was revived.|$|E
5|$|Cannon Films {{picked up}} an option for a fourth Superman/Reeve film, with Reeve reprising the role due to <b>his</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film's topic {{regarding}} nuclear weapons. However, Cannon decided to cut the budget of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace from $35 million to $15 million, with poor special effects and heavy re-editing, which contributed to the film's poor reception. Warner Bros. decided to give the series a break following the negative reception {{of the last two}} Superman films.|$|E

Up until his death, he collaborated in a project {{on the history of}} quantum theory at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928. Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in the philosophical foundations and implications of physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as the basic status of scientific knowledge in physics.|$|E

5|$|Henry was Catherine's {{favourite}} son. Unlike his brothers, {{he came to}} {{the throne}} as a grown man.

He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life.

Instead, he allowed his brother to buy <b>his</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house, a decision that led to conflict between the two brothers regarding the price and timing of the sale.

He {{was impressed by the}} Italian countryside, and in Granada by the Moorish architecture of the fourteenth-century Alhambra.

5|$|The project faced {{multiple}} hurdles, which forced its temporary abandonment. The political {{tensions and}} communal rioting surrounding India's 1947 partition and independence stalled production. Shortly after partition, Shiraz Ali migrated to Pakistan, leaving Asif without a financier. The actor Chandra Mohan {{suffered a heart}} attack and died in 1949. Shiraz Ali had previously suggested that business tycoon Shapoorji Pallonji could finance the film. Although Pallonji knew nothing about film production, in 1950 he agreed to produce the film because of <b>his</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of Akbar. Production was then restarted with a new cast.|$|E
