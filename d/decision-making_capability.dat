They proposed a market reform, {{beginning with the}} granting of greater self-rule and more independent <b>decision-making</b> <b>capability</b> to enterprises to facilitate their [...] "realization of plan goals". But the recommended economic improvements, however limited, were not compatible with the obligatory at that time heavy-handed centralized economic command system, and the reform effort fizzled out.|$|E

50|$|The very {{existence}} of an Informal Bank brings about the homogeneity and affinity {{among members of the}} poor. Thrift savings of the members serve as the main bondage among members. The bank promote regularity in savings and assures sufficient frequency for group meetings. The informal banks will instill collective <b>decision-making</b> <b>capability</b> among the poor women. This sublime quality will be of great assistance to them for their fight against poverty and their participation in planning process and economic development activities. Informal banks will slowly do away with the subsidy syndrome prevailing in the lowest stratum of the society. The poor women will begin to enjoy the unique pleasure of doing things with their own money. The financial empowerment of women achieved through thrift and bank accessibility will improve their status in their own families and society. Naturally, their confidence will increase. Above all Informal Banks provide loans to the poor women at their own doorsteps without any hassle.|$|E
40|$|Orientation: Assessing and {{developing}} managerial <b>decision-making</b> <b>capability</b> {{in a complex}} and volatile marketplace is imperative for most South African businesses. Purpose: The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the test–retest reliability of the career path appreciation (CPA) procedure in assessing current and potential levels of work <b>decision-making</b> <b>capability.</b> The study also explored whether different gender and race groups differed significantly in terms of these levels at two CPA assessments. Motivation for the study : Limited recent test–retest research has been done regarding the reliability of the CPA technique as a tool for measuring the work <b>decision-making</b> <b>capability</b> of professional and managerial talent in the South African context. Scholars and practitioners in the field of industrial psychology could therefore benefit from follow-up research into the reliability of CPA. Research approach, design and method : The research followed an ex post facto correlational design using longitudinal data of a non-probability purposive sample (N = 527) within the Bioss SA database. Main findings : The results showed that the participants’ first CPA assessment scores correlated significantly and positively with their second CPA assessment scores. Gender and race groups differed significantly in their levels of current work <b>decision-making</b> <b>capability</b> at both assessments. Practical/managerial implications: The CPA procedure can be used with confidence as an assessment tool in the selection, mentoring and development of high-potential managerial and professional talent for diverse gender and race groups. Contribution/value-add : These findings contribute valuable information regarding the reliability of CPA and the differences between race and gender groups in the South African context. </p...|$|E

40|$|This article {{integrates}} {{social network}} and exchange theory {{to develop a}} model of customer value based on three relational drivers: relationship quality (the caliber of relational ties), contact density (the number of relational ties), and contact authority (the <b>decision-making</b> <b>capability</b> of relational contacts). The {{results suggest that the}} value generated from interfirm relationships derives not only from the quality of customer ties (e. g., trust, commitment, norms), as is typically modeled, but also from the number and <b>decision-making</b> <b>capability</b> of interfirm contacts and the interactions among relational drivers. Moderator analysis of customer characteristics suggests that increasing contact density benefits sellers that have customers with high employee turnover rates, whereas building relationships with key decisions makers generates the highest returns among customers that are more difficult to access. The conceptual model of the impact of interfirm relational drivers on customer value receives support from dyadic data across 446 business-to-business exchanges...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Staffs in {{government}} units may encounter problems of pressure when facing dramatic organizational changes.

Results followed. First, the hypothesized negative impact of change pressure on organizational identification was not supported. Second, change pressure has a significant negative influence on commitment. Third, identification influences on commitment positively. Fourth, the positive moderation role of knowledge capability in the relationship between pressure and identification was not supported. Fifth, the positive moderation role of knowledge capability in the relationship between change pressure and commitment was supported.
