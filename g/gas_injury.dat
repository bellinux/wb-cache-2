40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of topical cyclosporine A 0. 05 % for treatment of mustard gas-induced ocular surface disorders with special attention to conjunctival goblet cell density in patients with severe dry eye. Methods: This prospective clinical study included 20 eyes of 20 patients previously exposed to mustard gas with dry eye syndrome unresponsive to artificial tears. Before and after treatment with topical cyclosporine A 0. 05 % twice daily for 3 months, subjects were evaluated for improvement in symptoms using the ocular surface disease index (OSDI) and signs by tear breakup time (TBUT), Schirmer test and measurement of superior bulbar conjunctival goblet cell density. Limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) and the degree of corneal squamous cell metaplasia were also assessed before and after treatment. Results: Before treatment, mean OSDI score, Schirmer test I value and mean TBUT were 42. 8 ± 6. 1, 4. 2 ± 1. 2 mm and 2. 5 ± 1. 3 s, respectively. After 3 months of treatment with topical cyclosporine A, these scores reached 36. 4 ± 5. 2, 5. 8 ± 1. 6 mm and 4. 9 ± 2. 1 s, respectively showing a statistically significant improvement (P 0. 05).

Chest physiotherapy {{is one of the}} useful methods in care, cure and infection prevention of these patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the short-term effect of chest physiotherapy on spirometric indices in chemical warfare victims exposed to sulfur mustard gas. Materials & Methods: In this study, 27 of the chemical warfare victims with respiratory diseases were selected. Chest physiotherapy including postural drainage percussion and vibration were used in four positions for all patients. Pulmonary function test (PFT) was obtained before (baseline), immediately and 20 minute after the chest physiotherapy. The SPSS software was used for the data analysis of the collected data. Results: Results of this study showed the significant effect (p< 0. 01) of chest physiotherapy upon forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV 1) (baseline mean, 44. 19 immediately after intervention mean 47. 3 and 20 minute after intervention mean 48. 3) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (baseline mean, 69. 37 immediately after intervention mean, 73. 67 20 minute after intervention 75. 74).

Mutagenesis, carsinogenesis and {{cytotoxicity}} {{effects on}} body tissues are {{side effects of}} sulfur mustard which in turn, causes the bone marrow and lymphoid system dysfunction. Previous investigation in 31 Iranian chemical casualties, indicated the presence of persistant atypical lymphocytes and the decrease of T lymphocyte subsets and surface markers. The present study was performed to evaluate the changes of B lymphocyte surface markers in the above mentioned group and compare the changes with two other control groups. &# 13; Methods. The first control group consisted of 30 chemical casaulities with the same clinical conditions and the same history of exposure to mustard but absence of atypical lymphocytes in their blood, and the second control group were consisted of 30 completely normal indivduals. Monoclonal antibodies congugated to fluoroscein isothiocyanate {{were used to determine}} B lymphocyte markers. The monoclonal antibodies used in this study were against human immunoglobuline δ and µ heavy chain, λ and κ light chains, anti human HLADR and anti human CD 10. The tests were performed on 100 ml of peripheral blood, using flow cytometer model EPICS®XL. &# 13; Results.

Methods: A total of 43 male patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to chemical <b>gas</b> <b>injury</b> were enrolled into this study. Severity of disease was defined by the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) guideline. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the St George Respiratory Questionnaire. Symptoms, activity, impact, and total score were calculated for each patient. Results: The mean ± SD age of patients was 42. 5 ± 7. 4 years. According to the GOLD guideline, most (72 %) of the patients were in stage 2 (mean: FEV 1 1. 9 ± 0. 75 L, 53. 1 % ± 18. 5 % predicted).

Despite this, the signaling consequences of air bubbles in the vasculature are poorly understood {{and there is a}} lack of pharmacological therapies available. Here, we investigate the mitochondrial consequences of air bubble contact with endothelial cells. Methods and Results: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were loaded with an intracellular calcium indicator (Fluo- 4) and either a mitochondrial calcium indicator (X-Rhod- 1) or mitochondrial membrane potential indicator (TMRM). Contact with 50 – 150 mm air bubbles induced concurrent rises in intracellular and mitochondrial calcium, followed by a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Pre-treating cells with 1 mmol/L ruthenium red, a TRPV family calcium channel blocker, did not protect cells from the mitochondrial depolarization, despite blocking the intracellular calcium response.

The study included 130 burn patients (61 male and 69 female) with inhalation injury admitted to Menoufiya University Hospital Burn Center & Chest Department (Egypt) from January 2008 to January 2010. It was found that the presence of inhalation injury, increasing burn size, and advancing age were all associated with increased mortality (p < 0. 01). The incidence of inhalation injury was 46. 3 % (the 130 patients came from a total number of 281 burn victims). The overall mortality rate among patients with inhalation injury was 41. 5 % (54 / 130) compared with 7. 2 % (11 / 151) among patients without inhalation injury.

The Principles comport with modern tenets of healthy housing, i. e. : keep housing dry, clean, ventilated, and pest free; avoid contaminants; and properly maintain housing. III. APHA’s Principles The 30 Principles fall into four categories: a. Fundamental Physiological Needs (e. g., for illumination, heat, cooling, space, chemical purity, quiet); b. Fundamental Psychological Needs (e. g., for privacy, adequate space, cleanliness, peace-of-mind, normal family and household activity); c.

40|$|Inflammation is {{associated}} with various pulmonary diseases and contributes to the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. We previously identified a proinflammatory signaling pathway triggered by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in which stimulation of Gq-coupled GPCRs results in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Because damage to the lung causes the release of multiple mediators acting through Gq-coupled GPCRs, this signaling pathway is likely to contribute to inflammatory processes in the injured lung. In an effort to identify novel inhibitors of lung inflammation, the National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection, a library of 446 compounds, was screened for inhibitory activity toward production of IL- 8 induced by stimulation of the Gq-coupled tachykinin 1 receptor with substance P in A 549 cells. Twenty-eight compounds that significantly inhibited substance P-induced IL- 8 production were identified. The most potent inhibitor was triptolide, a diterpenoid compound from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, a vine used in traditional Chinese medicine {{for the treatment of}} autoimmune diseases. Triptolide inhibited IL- 8 production induced by substance P with an IC 50 of 2. 3 × 10 − 8 M and inhibited NF-κB activation in response to an agonist of the protease-activated receptor 2 with an IC 50 of 1. 4 × 10 − 8 M.

Methods: The clinical questions were designed by the guideline team. Websites and databases including National Guidelines Clearinghouse, National Institute for Clinical Excellence, Cochrane, and PubMed were searched to find related CPGs and explore possible answers to the clinical questions. Since there were no relevant CPGs in the literature, related articles in Persian and English languages were extracted. Each article along with its level of evidence was summarized. Additionally, hand search was performed by looking the reference list of each article. Consequently, recommendations were developed considering the clinical benefits and side effects of each therapeutic modality. The recommendations were re-evaluated in terms of customization criteria. All recommendations along with the related evidence were scored from 1 to 9 by experts from all medical universities of Iran. The level of agreement among the experts was evaluated by analyzing the given scores. Results: The agreement was achieved for all recommendations.

The intragastric administration on rats was continued for 7 days timely in each day. Under simulated 8000 m altitude using low pressure oxygen cabin, the arterial blood gas of each group were tested, pathological changes of brain tissues were observed and related indexes of brain were detected after 12 h hypoxia. Results Comparing with group N, the blood oxygen partial pressure (PO₂), value of blood oxygen saturation (SO₂), oxygenation index (PO₂/FIO₂), Na⁺ concentration (Na⁺), actual bicarbonate radical (HCO₃⁻) significantly decreased (P< 0. 01), lactic acid (Lac), hemoglobin concentration (Hb) significantly increased (P< 0. 01) and pathological damage was inflicted in group M; and contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in brain tissue significantly increased (P< 0. 01), content of glutathione(GSH) and activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in brain tissue significantly decreased (P< 0. 01) in group M. Compared with group M, PO₂, SO₂ and PO₂/FIO₂ significantly increased (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 05) in group GAS-L; Na⁺ and HCO₃⁻ significantly increased (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 05) in three dose groups of GAS; Lac significantly decreased (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 05) in group GAS-L and GAS-H. Hb significantly increased (P< 0. 01) in group GAS-H, a rising trend appeared in group GAS-L but with no statistical significance. Damages of brain tissue were alleviated in group RC and three dose groups of GAS comparing with group M. Compared with group M, MDA significantly decreased (P< 0. 01) in three dose groups of GAS; there was a decreasing trend of H₂O₂ but with no statistical significance in three dose groups of GAS; GSH and GSH-Px significantly increased (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 05) in three dose groups of GAS. However, three groups of GAS has no dose dependent. Conclusion There was an protective effect of gastrodin on arterial blood <b>gas</b> and brain <b>injury</b> of rats under simulated high altitude hypoxia environment.

30|$|During {{insertion}} of a verres needle or indeed a primary trocar, a dramatic drop {{in blood pressure}} may signify injury to a major vessel. Blood {{may or may not}} exude from the needle. Bradycardia may also occur during creation of a pneumoperitoneum. This can be managed quickly by stopping the flow of gas and administering an anticholinergic agent [17]. Very rarely, a gas embolism may occur where carbon dioxide is introduced into a large vein via the verres needle. This may present with a raised JVP, cyanosis, sudden circulatory collapse, a drop in end tidal carbon-dioxide concentration and a characteristic mill-wheel murmur. It is important that the carbon dioxide and insufflation are stopped immediately and the patient rolled on to the left side and the Trendelenburg position maintained. The patient should be ventilated with 100 % oxygen to prevent hypoxaemia and a large catheter inserted into the right atrium through the internal jugular vein to aspirate the <b>gas.</b> Immediate <b>injury</b> to the stomach may manifest itself with bouts of eructations and equivalent damage to the intestine may either result in flatulence or the detection of a faeculent smell. If the damage to the stomach or bowel is only the size of the verres needle, then no further surgical repair is required and antibiotic prophylaxis will usually suffice. If the damaged is of a greater diameter, then surgical repair will usually be required. Damage to the bladder may be apparent at the time of surgery and a small defect may be managed conservatively with the Foley catheter for 2  weeks. A larger defect in the bladder will need suturing. The identification of a ureteric injury can be difficult to assess intra-operatively. Indigo carmine dye injected intravenously to verify the leakage of dye through the ureter can be undertaken.|$|R
40|$|Hyperbaric {{therapy is}} the basis of {{treatment}} for pervasive development disorders. For this reason, the choice of the right therapeutic table for each case is critical. Above all, the delay in recompression time with respect to the first symptoms and to the severity of the case must be considered. In our experience, the use of low-pressure oxygen tables resolves almost all cases if recompression takes place within a short time. When recompression is possible almost immediately, the mechanical effect of reduction on bubble volume due to pressure is of remarkable importance. In these cases, high-pressure tables can be considered. These tables can also be used in severe spinal-cord decompression sickness. The preferred breathing mixture is still disputed. Heliox seems to be favored because it causes fewer problems during the recompression of divers, and above all, because nitrox can cause narcosis and contributes nitrogen. Saturation treatment should be avoided or at least used only in special cases. In cases of arterial <b>gas</b> embolism cerebral <b>injury,</b> it is recommended to start with an initial 6 ATA recompression only if the time between symptom onset and the beginning of recompression is less than a few hours...|$|R
