5000|$|Until {{the past}} few centuries, the {{authority}} to designate a nation as an outcast, or pariah state, was relatively clear, often resting with religious authorities. (E.g., [...] "the Ottoman Empire for example was regarded as an outcast by European States" [...] since the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 until the nineteenth century on a [...] "religious basis.") In more recent times, however, the criteria for and attached implications of pariah statehood, {{as well as the}} <b>designating</b> <b>authorities,</b> are the subject of much disagreement. For example, the Nigerian scholar Olawale Lawal has stated: There are so many open questions on the issue of Pariah State. For instance who determines a Pariah State and how a nation becomes a Pariah State... This becomes more profound when one realizes that a nation that is an outcast in one region, has diplomatic and friendly relations with others. By some criteria, nations can be considered pariahs within their own neighborhood of surrounding states. By others, an international body (such as the United Nations) or perhaps a consensus among certain nations may govern the meaning or use of the term.|$|E
