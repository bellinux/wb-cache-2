5|$|The {{administration}} {{and management of}} the Vikos–Aoös National Park belongs to two district forest offices, supervised by a forest directorate at the prefecture level. Moreover, the office of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in the village of Papingo plays an essential role in management issues. Apart from government efforts, incentives have been given to local management organizations and the local population to participate in the protection of the park. In the park's core, according to the law, forestry activities, grazing, hunting, and fishing are prohibited. In the peripheral zone there are no such restrictions, but the Forest Service can take any necessary measure for the realization of the aims of the park. Apart from the above-mentioned activities, dangers to the park include land erosion, landslides, and wildfires which threaten the local flora and fauna. Another issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of tourism in recent decades. On the other hand, extreme geophysical conditions make the construction and maintenance of the necessary infrastructure network, mainly access routes and telecommunications, difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{normal force}} {{is due to}} repulsive forces of {{interaction}} between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. The normal force, for example, {{is responsible for the}} structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.|$|E

25|$|Melbourne's {{air quality}} is {{generally}} good and has improved significantly since the 1980s. Like many urban environments, the city faces significant environmental issues, {{many of them}} relating to the city's large urban footprint and urban sprawl {{and the demand for}} infrastructure and services. One such issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of drought on water supply. Periodic droughts and consistently high summer temperatures deplete Melbourne water supplies, and climate change may exacerbate the long-term impact of these factors on Melbourne's water supplies. During the Millennium drought, the Bracks Government implemented water restrictions and a range of other options including water recycling, incentives for household water tanks, greywater systems, water consumption awareness initiatives, and other water saving and reuse initiatives. However, as water storages continued to fall further measures were required; in June 2007 the Bracks Government announced the construction of the $3.1 billion Wonthaggi desalination plant, and the so-called North-South Pipeline from the Goulburn Valley in Victoria's north to Melbourne. Neither project was used extensively before the drought broke during 2010, and therefore both have been criticised as 'white elephants'.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Gansu Survey of Children and Families (GSCF) is a longitudinal study of poverty, education, health, and economic mobility among children and youth in Gansu, rural northwest China. The initial wave of the study (GSCF- 1) interviewed 2000 children at ages 9 to 12 in the year 2000; re-interviews were conducted in 2004, 2007, and 2009. (At present the UK Data Archive only holds data from Wave 1.) The project addresses the following questions: What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> of childhood nutrition and health on subsequent education? What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> of childhood nutrition and health on psychological well-being? What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> correlation between psychological well-being and education outcomes, and how does the evolution of behavioral and psychological problems over time vary by family, school and community characteristics? What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> of childhood nutrition and health on the decision {{to stay in school}} or enter the workforce? How do education outcomes, including specific cognitive skills, affect the labour force productivity of young adults? What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> of childhood nutrition and health on the labour productivity of young adults?
