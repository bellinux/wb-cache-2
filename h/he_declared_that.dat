5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev became the Soviet leader {{following}} the deposition and execution of Lavrentiy Beria and the pushing aside of rivals Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes. As part of a campaign of de-Stalinization, <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> {{the only way to}} reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April 1945, at his {{afternoon}} situation conference, Hitler {{fell into}} a tearful rage (famously dramatized in the 2004 German film Downfall) when he realised that his plans, prepared the previous day, could not be achieved. <b>He</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> the war was lost, blaming the generals for the defeat {{and that he would}} remain in Berlin until the end and then kill himself.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Horne resumed working at Triplex, and was promoted {{to the position of}} sales director. Despite his subsequent joint career in broadcasting and business, his commercial activities always took precedence. <b>He</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> his work on radio was only a hobby, and that he would give it up before his business career. He combined his two roles by working full-time, and writing scripts with Murdoch at weekends.|$|E

5|$|When the Achaeans {{arrived at}} Argos for an assembly, Cleomenes {{came down from}} Tegea to meet them. However, Aratus—who had reached an {{agreement}} with Antigonus—demanded that Cleomenes present 300 hostages to the Achaeans and enter the city alone, or approach the city with all his forces. When this message reached Cleomenes, <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> he had been wronged and once again declared war on the Achaeans.|$|E
5|$|According to Maple's account, in {{the last}} few weeks of Pickingill's life, when he had become very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} against his will, where <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{was popular}} with the fans and media and made the NBA's All-Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league. He was {{frequently}} involved in on- and off-court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy, as in March 1991 when he spat on a young girl while attempting to spit at a heckler, and as in 1993 when <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> sports figures {{should not be considered}} role models. Short for a power forward, Barkley used his strength and aggressiveness {{to become one of the}} NBA's most dominant rebounders. He was a versatile player who had the ability to score, create plays, and defend. In 2000, he retired as the fourth player in NBA history to achieve 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore {{campaigned for}} Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis's Presidential bid. Four years later, he {{supported}} President George H. W. Bush for reelection {{and was an}} outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. However, in 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton's Republican opponent Bob Dole, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film Striptease. Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention, and supported George W. Bush that year. He did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> he maintains some Republican ideologies.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1861, General John C. Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without {{consulting}} his superiors in Washington, a proclamation {{of martial law}} in Missouri. <b>He</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{returned}} to Normandy in 1125 and spent {{about a year}} at the royal court, where her father Henry was still hoping that his second marriage would generate a male heir. In the event that this might fail to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice, and <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> she was to be his rightful successor if he should die without a male heir. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore in January to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.|$|E

5|$|Mountbatten {{used his}} {{influence}} with the princes {{to push them}} towards accession. <b>He</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> the British Government would not grant dominion status {{to any of the}} princely states, nor would it accept them into the British Commonwealth, which meant that the states would sever all connections with the British crown unless they joined either India or Pakistan. He pointed out that the Indian subcontinent was one economic entity, and that the states would suffer most if the link were broken. He also pointed to the difficulties that princes would face maintaining order in the face of threats such as the rise of communal violence and communist movements.|$|E
5|$|Antioch was Diocletian's primary {{residence}} from 299 to 302, while Galerius swapped {{places with}} his Augustus on the Middle and Lower Danube. Diocletian visited Egypt once, {{over the winter}} of 301–2, and issued a grain dole in Alexandria. Following some public disputes with Manicheans, Diocletian ordered that the leading followers of Mani be burnt alive along with their scriptures. In a 31 March 302 rescript from Alexandria, <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> low-status Manicheans must be executed by the blade, and high-status Manicheans must be sent {{to work in the}} quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island, Turkey) or the mines of Phaeno in southern Palestine. All Manichean property was to be seized and deposited in the imperial treasury. Diocletian found much to be offended by in Manichean religion: its novelty, its alien origins, the way it corrupted the morals of the Roman race, and its inherent opposition to long-standing religious traditions. Manichaeanism was also supported by Persia at the time, compounding religious dissent with international politics. Excepting Persian support, the reasons he disliked Manichaenism were equally applicable, if not more so, to Christianity, his next target.|$|E
5|$|At age 11, {{he came to}} the {{attention}} to the prefect of Grenoble, Joseph Fourier, who had accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte on the Egyptian expedition which had discovered the Rosetta Stone. An accomplished scholar in addition to a well known mathematical physicist, Fourier had been entrusted by Napoleon with the publication {{of the results of the}} expedition in the monumental series of publications titled Description de l'Égypte. One biographer has stated that Fourier invited the 11-year-old Champollion to his home and showed him his collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts and documents. Champollion was enthralled, and upon seeing the hieroglyphs and hearing that they were unintelligible, <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> he would be the one to succeed in reading them. Whether or not the report of this visit is true, Fourier did go on to become one of Champollion's most important allies and supporters, and surely had an important role in instilling his interest in Ancient Egypt.|$|E

5|$|From 1992 – 1994, Li Hongzhi {{traveled}} throughout China giving week-long {{seminars on}} Falun Gong's spiritual philosophy and exercises and meditation practices. In late 1994, <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> {{he had finished}} his work of teaching the practice in China, {{and the content of}} his lectures was compiled in the book Zhuan Falun, published in January 1995. Later that year, Li left China and began teaching the practice overseas, beginning with a stop at the Chinese embassy in Paris in March 1995, followed by lectures in Sweden in May 1995. Between 1995 and 1999, Li gave lectures in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore. Falun Gong associations and clubs began appearing in Europe, North America and Australia, with activities centered mainly on university campuses.|$|E
5|$|Hadropithecus stenognathus is {{classified}} as the sole member of the genus Hadropithecus and belongs to the family Archaeolemuridae. This family in turn belongs to the infraorder Lemuriformes, which includes all the Malagasy lemurs. The species was formally described in 1899 from a mandible (lower jaw) found at Andrahomana cave in southeastern Madagascar by paleontologist Ludwig Lorenz von Liburnau, who thought it represented an ape. A year later, Lorenz von Liburnau also described Pithecodon sikorae based on photographs of a skull, which upon further review {{turned out to be}} a juvenile version of Hadropithecus stenognathus. In a publication from 1902, <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> Hadrophithecus stenognathus was not an ape, but a lemur. Over 100 years later, the rarity of its skeletal remains has made this species one of the least understood species of subfossil lemur.|$|E
5|$|In a long {{article in}} Le Figaro in July 1856, Offenbach traced {{the history of}} comic opera. <b>He</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> the first work worthy to be called opéra-comique was Philidor's 1759 Blaise le savetier, and he {{described}} the gradual divergence of Italian and French notions of comic opera, with verve, imagination and gaiety from Italian composers, and cleverness, common sense, good taste and wit from the French composers. He concluded that comic opera had become too grand and inflated. His disquisition was a preliminary to the announcement of an open competition for aspiring composers. A jury of French composers and playwrights including Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas, Charles Gounod and Eugène Scribe considered 78 entries; the five short-listed entrants were all asked to set a libretto, Le docteur miracle, written by Ludovic Halévy and Léon Battu. The joint winners were Georges Bizet and Charles Lecocq. Bizet became, and remained, a devoted friend of Offenbach. Lecocq and Offenbach took a dislike to one another, and their subsequent rivalry was not altogether friendly.|$|E

5|$|In summer 1548, the galleys {{returned}} to Scotland to scout for English ships. Knox's health was now {{at its lowest}} point due to the severity of his confinement. He was ill with a fever {{and others on the}} ship were afraid for his life. Even in this state, Knox recalled, his mind remained sharp and he comforted his fellow prisoners with hopes of release. While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and Dundee, the spires of the parish church where he preached appeared in view. James Balfour, a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark. He replied that he knew it well, recognising the steeple of the place where he first preached and <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> he would not die until he had preached there again.|$|E
5|$|The Combined Chiefs of Staff {{authorised}} Morgan {{to issue}} orders {{in the name}} of the Supreme Allied Commander to the Commanders in Chief of the Air, Naval and Land Forces, even though they outranked him. When Montgomery was appointed Commander in Chief Land Forces for the invasion, in December 1943, <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> Morgan's original plans were unworkable; they had originally been limited by the availability of landing craft, but Montgomery insisted it would require more men attacking over a wider front. Ultimately, more landing craft were obtained and the invasion was scaled up to Montgomery's satisfaction, at the cost of a month's delay and a reduction in the Southern France operation. However, all the key features of Morgan's plan remained; the choice of Normandy as the assault area, the use of Mulberry harbours, the deployment of American forces on the right and British on the left, the use of airborne troops to cover the flanks, and some form of diversionary operation in Southern France.|$|E
5|$|The next era of Kīlauea's history {{began with}} the {{establishment}} of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory on the volcano's rim in 1912. The first permanent such installation in the United States, the observatory was the brainchild of Thomas Jaggar, head of geology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; after witnessing the devastation of the 1908 Messina earthquake near Mount Etna in Italy, <b>he</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> something must be done to support systematic volcanic and seismic study, and chose Kīlauea as the site of the first such establishment. After securing initial funding from MIT and the University of Hawaii, Jaggar took directorship of the observatory and, whilst its head between 1912 and 1940, pioneered seismological and observational study and observation of active volcanoes. After initial funding ran out, the Observatory was successively funded by the National Weather Service, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Park Service, before settling on the USGS, under whose banner the observatory has been operating since 1947. The main building has been moved twice since establishment, and today is positioned on the northwest rim of Kīlauea's caldera.|$|E
