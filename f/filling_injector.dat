40|$|Although {{there are}} many {{different}} modelling and simulation languages, only few are suited to analysis of hybrid systems. In this paper a classification of different kinds of models and modelling languages is given. It is made clear that many hybrid languages are basically either continuous-time or discrete-event languages to which discrete-event or continuous-time constructs have been added. The χ formalism has been designed with the purpose of integrating continuous-time and discrete-event concepts. In this way it is suited to specification and simulation of discrete-event, continuous-time and hybrid systems. An informal treatment of its syntax and semantics is presented, together with a case study of a barrel filling system. The barrels are brought in on a conveyor which is modelled as a discrete-event system. When a barrel is under the <b>filling</b> <b>injector,</b> the barrel is filled from a filling reservoir. This reservoir is modelled as a continuous process, but it is controlled by a discrete-event process. The pumps are modelled by hybrid processes that make use of conditional equations. In this way, the example clarifies the hybrid nature of the χ language...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of {{four different}} self-expandable stents in phantom model. Three stents ware made of nitinol {{and one was}} made of cobaltbased alloy. Each stent placed in plastic <b>injector,</b> <b>filled</b> with diluted iodinated contrast material, and placed on a plastic case filled with saline. CTA was performed on a four-detector CT scanner (detector collimation, 0. 5 mm: helical pitch 3. 5). Axial and longitudinal reconstructions of CT imaging were compared with the instent attenuation. Three nitinol stents showed few artifact, and cobalt-based alloy stent was appeared artificial narrowing. In conclusion, CTA is useful for follow-up examination after carotid artery stenting (CAS) as a less invasive evaluation method...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the CLIC {{parameters}} at 1 and 3 TeV (5 TeV?) in order to re-define new "target' parameters taking into account: - the new model of the multibunch accelerating structure, - the new drive beam scheme, - the beam simulations with multibunches. Suggested schedule: 7 Present parameters and objectives of the review (moderator: J. P. Delahaye). The multibunch accelerating structure (moderator: I. Wilson) Best guess of the RF parameters - Optimisation of RF to beam efficiency. Single bunch and multibunches parameters (moderator: G. Guignard) Charge per bunch and bunch length, minimum vertical emittance Number of bunches and separation between bunches. Constraints and freedom from new drive beam scheme (moderator: R.

30|$|Results: The average {{synthesis}} {{times were}} 30 minutes for [11 C]methionine, 38 minutes for [11 C]PK 11195, 20 minutes for [11 C]metomidate and [11 C]acetate including purification, formulation and online sterile filter integrity test. [11 C]Radiopharmaceuticals were obtained in good radiochemical yields, sufficiently for several simultaneous clinical doses. The radiochemical purity exceeded 95 % in all syntheses. The use of column selector enables easy change of HPLC columns between syntheses. The <b>filling</b> of the <b>injector</b> loop with pneumatic syringe decreases losses of the injection solutions {{compared to the}} inbuilt fluid detector. Due to {{the limited number of}} electrical connections in Tracerlab FXC-Pro the column selector, loop syringe and SFU are remote controlled from external touch screen. Readings from additional GM tubes are also shown on the touch screen.|$|R
40|$|The Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator (NLCTA) {{being built}} at SLAC will {{integrate}} {{the new technologies}} of X-band Accelerator structures and RF systems for the Next Linear Collider, demonstrate multibunch beam-loading energy compensation and suppression of higher-order deflecting modes, and measure the dark current generated by RF field emission in the accelerator. The current injector being constructed for phase 1 of the NLCTA tests is a simple injector consisting of a gun with a 150 ns long pulse and X-band bunching and accelerating system. While the injector will provide average currents comparable to what is needed for NLC it will not provide the bunch structure since every X-band RF bucket will be <b>filled.</b> The <b>injector</b> upgrade will produce a similar bunch train as planned for NLC mainly a train of bunches 1. 4 ns apart with 3 nC in each bunch up to 50 to 60 MeV. The bunching system for the upgrade is more elaborate than the current injector and {{the plan is to}} produce a bunch train right at the gun. The difference between the NLCTA injector upgrade and the planned injector for NLC is that the NLCTA injector will not have polarized beam and the accelerator sections are X-band rather than S-band. If the authors are able to produce beams comparable to the NLC requirements with the X-band injector then it should be easier to do with the S-band...|$|R
40|$|In {{mass spectrometric}} (MS) systems with {{electrospray}} ionization (ESI), the sample {{can be analyzed}} coupled to separation systems (such as liquid chromatography or capillary electrophoresis) or simply by direct infusion. The greatest benefit {{of the type of}} injection is the possibility of continuous use of small amounts of samples {{over a long period of}} time. This extended analysis time allows a complete study of fragmentation by mass spectrometry, which is critical for structure elucidation of new compounds, or when using an ion trap mass analyzer. The <b>injector</b> <b>filled</b> with the sample is placed at the ESI source inlet creating an electric field suitable for the continuous formation of a spray (solvent and sample) and consequently, the gradual and even release of the sample. For the formation of the spray, is necessary that the injector end is metalized. The formation of a bilayer of titanium and gold provided an excellent attachment of the film, resulting in a nanoinjector for ionization/spray formation in the system for MS. The nanoinjectors showed high repeatability and stability over 100 min by continuous sampling with 10 µL of sample...|$|R
40|$|Control of {{the rate}} at which hypergolic {{propellants}} are supplied to a rocket engine prior to ignition is critically important. Potentially damaging explosions may result from excessive lead of either propellant into the combustion chamber. Because the <b>injector</b> <b>fill</b> process is governed by the engine as well as the propellant feed system design, proper management of this issue must take both into consideration. This was recognized early in the development of TRW's Advanced Columbium-Liquid Apogee Engine (LAE), which was flight-qualified in 1996 to maneuver the Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF) spacecraft into orbit. The LAE runs on hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide (MON- 3) at a nominal mixture ratio of 1. 0. This paper describes the comprehensive test program conducted to ensure reliable startup operation of the LAE in the AYAF propulsion system. The most significant factors affecting chamber fuel lead were found to be: (1) engine location, (2) propellant saturation level, (3) amount of undissolved gas in the lines, and (4) off- nominal tank pressures. Hot-fire tests at a chamber fuel lead range over and above that expected for the LAEs in AXAF demonstrated extremely tolerant behavior of the engine. AY-AF is scheduled for launch on NASA's STS- 93 in December 1998...|$|R
