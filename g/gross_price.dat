40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} empirical validity of several theories on 8 ̆ 5 rms price-setting {{behavior and the}} dynamics of ination. The dissertation consists of two essays. The rst essay, Reassessment of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve: Gross vs. Value-Added Price Ination, reexamines the new Keynesian Phillips curve based on the distinction between <b>gross</b> <b>price</b> and value-added price ination. It is shown that a standard new Keynesian Phillips curve {{can be interpreted as}} describing the behavior of <b>gross</b> <b>price</b> ination and, therefore, it is essential to incorporate intermediate input costs in constructing marginal cost measures. Moreover, from this <b>gross</b> <b>price</b> ination model, the valued-added price ination model is derived explicitly, in which the real price of intermediate inputs plays an important role. The new Keynesian Phillips curve is tested using both ination models. Our results show that (1) the evidence for the new Keynesian Phillips curve is weak for the whole sample period regardless of model speci 8 ̆ 5 cation; (2) in some subsamples, however, especially during high an...|$|E

40|$|There are {{watercourses}} on {{the globe}} which as yet do not deliver up their energy {{to the needs of}} the people. How much energy their waters bear, is it worth to take away this energy? Those and alike questions must be (and they are) answered before start to build hydro power station. Similar problems must be solved to control hydro power plants in most gainful way which is known as hydrothermal coordination. The notion of price of water can be met lately in technical literature as one of numerical indices of these issues. The <b>gross</b> <b>price</b> of water and net price of water are considered in this paper. <b>Gross</b> <b>price</b> of 1 t water is the price of electric energy obtained by conversion of potential energy of 1 t of water, lifted to a height of power station water head. Net price of water is the difference between <b>gross</b> <b>price</b> and total expenses determined by hydro power station building and its exploitation costs in a year related to 1 m 3 of water. If net price of water is positive, it is worth building power station. The greater net price is, the more urgent is the building. Net price of water grows with water head but it continues only to some height of the dam because further increase of head sharply increases capital outlay and other exploitation expenses. To maximize net price of water, optimization of net price function can be done. Net price of water diminishes when some amount of water is diverted for other needs. When amount of diverted water is out of discussion, no controversy can emerge. However when by diverted water some goods with some monetary worth can be obtained, the task must be solved how much water can be diverted so that the water of watercourse be used to the maximum benefit. The environmental issues must be taken into account as well...|$|E

In particular, it examines three applications of rules of origin: rules of origin in free trade areas, preferences to developing countries, and the treatment of imports that have some domestic factor content. Traditionally each of these has used all-or-nothing rules of origin. The paper proposes a new method of dealing with all three problems. This method substitutes a valuation based on the value added in different origins for the present methods of valuing goods at the <b>gross</b> <b>price</b> and attributing origin to only one country.

40|$|The {{production}} of specialist psychiatric services in Australia reflects the "mixed" system {{of public and}} private {{production of}} health services generally. This paper, an exercise in descriptive or positive economics, is concerned only with private production, i. e. those services provided by psychiatrists operating in "private practice" on a fee-for-service basis. It is shown that there is a sharp distinction in Australian institutional arrangements between psychiatric services produced in-hospital and out-of-hospital. The main differences relate to the general coinsurance rates applied, 75 per cent in the former case and 85 per cent in the latter case. In addition out-of-hospital services are subject to a "gap" safety-net provision. Using both algebraic and geometric expositions, the central relationships between <b>gross</b> <b>prices,</b> net prices, schedule fees and subsidies/rebates are illustrated in general, and in various special cases, e. g. where a psychiatrist "direct bills" or "bulk bills" the Health Insurance Commission.

40|$|The Internet has radically {{reduced the}} cost of {{collecting}} and distributinginformation. Consequently, researchers initially predicted that the resulting price transparency would drive prices toward a single market price. However, this has largely not happened, partly because retailers use shipping costs to make prices less comparable. Using data on 517, 048 offers of 895 retailers from a leading European price comparison site, we show that retailers pursue two different shipping cost strategies. Both strategies lead to higher <b>gross</b> product <b>prices,</b> which are the sum of net product price and shipping costs and thus try to capture consumer surplus. These strategies are conflicting, however, and target different consumer segments: Some retailers charge high shipping costs and thereby try to exploit consumers’ biased perceptions of partitioned prices, while other retailers offer “free shipping” to attract consumers and exploit their so-called zero-risk bias.

40|$|Property tax limitations, as well {{as other}} tax and {{expenditure}} restrictions on state and local governments in the United States, date back to the late nineteenth century. A surge in property tax limitation legislation occurred in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, and its effects on government revenue, school financing, and educational quality have been studied extensively. However, there is surprisingly little literature on how property tax limits affect housing markets. For the first time, we examine the impacts of property tax limitations on housing growth, in addition to their impacts on housing prices. Using state-level data over twenty-three years, we find that property tax limits increase housing prices (indexes) by approximately 1. 6 %. These limits appear to have little impact on the growth in the housing stock, as measured by the number of permits. Our evidence suggests that this is because while property tax limits reduce property taxes they also increase the price of housing. These two counteracting effects lead to ambiguous impacts on the <b>gross</b> <b>price</b> of housing. ...|$|E
40|$|The debate {{concerning}} the legalisation of marijuana is intensifying. As {{the price of}} marijuana would most likely decrease following legalisation, the law of demand implies that consumption would rise. But by how much? This paper analyses the effect of legalisation on consumption by using data from a specifically-conducted survey of first year students at The University of Western Australia. The results indicate that 53 percent of students have consumed marijuana with males exhibiting a higher intensity than females. The results also show that legalisation would cause consumption to increase by approximately 4 percent. Both legalisation and a 50 percent fall in the price would cause an 11 {{percent increase in the}} marijuana consumption. For all consumers, the <b>gross</b> <b>price</b> elasticity, which includes the effects of both legalisation and a price change, is estimated to be -. 2. the net price elasticity, which takes out the legalisation effect, is -. 1. Accordingly, marijuana consumption is estimated to be price inelastic.

The recent growth of the dental insurance industry, however, may partly offset this price barrier among insureds. Our purpose {{is to examine the}} relationship between coinsurance and dental prices for 16 dental services among a sample of Pennsylvania Blue Shield (PBS) adult insureds. The dependent price measure is the annual average <b>gross</b> <b>price</b> paid for 16 specific preventive, restorative, periodontic, endodontic, prosthodontic, and surgical dental services. Independent variables in the price model include the insured's age, education, coinsurance rates, time costs, market area, non-wage income, oral health status, area dentist-population ratio and usual source of care. Data sources are 1980 PBS claims and coinsurance rate data and a mail survey of sampled insureds. OLS regression analysis reveals that the model's independent variables explain little dental price variation. No variable is consistently significant across services, but market area, coinsurance rates, and time costs alternately dominate across equations. These results suggest that, among adult insureds, coinsurance and time costs influence dental fees in a minority of dental services. Insurance reduces the patient's sensitivity to money price, and non-price factors correspondingly seem to become more important in patient search. insurance dental prices patient search oral health...|$|E

A total of 50 traders were selected (10 from each market) for personal interview and focus group discussion. Traders typically operated with capital of around Tk. 5000 to 15000 /day. Among the cultured species, Rohu, Catla, and Mrigal fetched higher prices (Tk. 120 - 250 /kg) and price depends on market structure, species, quality, size and weight. It was observed that under market channel I (Fish farmer – Paikers- Wholesalers- Retailers- Consumers), fish farmer’s <b>gross</b> <b>price</b> per quintal of fish was Tk. 9000. Similarly for channel II (Fish farmer-Wholesalers-Retailers- Consumers) the price spread was Tk. 1605 per quintal of ' fish, while the fish farmers gross share was 82. 16 % of consumers price. In case of channel III (Fish farmers-retailers- consumers) the price spread was Tk. 1087 per quintal of fish while the fish farmer’s gross sale was 87. 92 %.

40|$|Benefit-cost {{analysis}} of environmental policies typically focuses on benefits {{to human health}} and well-being. When it comes to humans' willingness to pay (WTP) for improvements {{in the quality of}} life for other species, however, the evidence is limited. We argue that the other-species morbidity-reduction component of WTP should be calculated net of any "outrage" component associated with the cause of the harm. This net WTP is likely to be correlated with the premium that people are willing to pay for chicken products from birds for which the quality of life has been enhanced by improved animal welfare measures. This paper uses a conjoint choice stated preference survey to reveal the nature of systematic heterogeneity in preferences for "humanely raised" versus "conventionally raised" chicken. We also use latent class analysis to distinguish between two classes of people - those who are willing to pay a premium for humanely raised chicken and those who are not. Proposition 21 on California's 2010 ballot concerned an $ 18 annual surcharge on vehicles to support state parks. Prop 21 failed, implying 25 % of these parks risk closure. Voting patterns at the Census tract level depend on <b>gross</b> <b>price,</b> incomes, age profiles, political ideology, environmental preferences, the availability of local substitutes, and park salience. We simulate counterfactual scenarios under which Prop 21 might have passed and use county-level hold-out samples to illustrate the predictive ability of our model. The California Air Resources Board is slowly phasing out perchloroethylene as the main input in dry cleaning operations in the state. Exploiting differential implementation of this regulation between SCAQMD (South Coast Air Quality Management District) and the rest of the state, we examine the effect of this regulation on the propensity for dry cleaning businesses to exit the industry. We find that regulation has encouraged early exit from the industry in some cases. We also find that regulation decreased ambient concentrations of perchloroethylene in the atmosphere.
