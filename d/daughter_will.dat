Knowing {{that his}} <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> survive, President Wilson remains in Washington D.C. to address the nation {{for the last time}} before he, along with {{millions}} of people, die in earthquakes and tsunamis worldwide. With the presidential line of succession gone, Carl assumes the position of acting commander-in-chief.|$|E

Makkhi invites Chulbul to his marriage with Nirmala. Chulbul convinces Rajjo's father to marry her. Rajjo's father commits suicide, as he knows that his <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> not marry anyone while he is alive. Chulbul takes Rajjo to Makkhi's exuberant wedding. Realising that Makkhi has stolen his money to finance the wedding, Chulbul marries Rajjo in an impromptu ceremony. Nirmala's father feels disgraced and cancels his daughter's wedding.|$|E
5|$|High {{reveals that}} two humans, Líf and Lífþrasir, will have also survived the {{destruction}} by {{hiding in the}} wood Hoddmímis holt. These two survivors consume the morning dew for sustenance, and from their descendants {{the world will be}} repopulated. Vafþrúðnismál stanza 45 is then quoted. The personified sun, Sól, will have a daughter at least as beautiful as she, and this <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> follow the same path as her mother. Vafþrúðnismál stanza 47 is quoted, and so ends the foretelling of Ragnarök in Gylfaginning.|$|E

5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or his wife and <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> be killed {{and he will be}} left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
25|$|When a {{daughter}} {{reached the age}} of seven, her father will start collecting building materials for the construction of the house where his <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> live with her future husband. According to Acehnese custom, the girl has to live with her husband in the house of her mother until the first child is born. Afterwards she is allowed to move to her own house, within the compound of her mother. When her parents died, the <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> acquire the rice fields and her parents' house.|$|E
25|$|Carmilla appears injured {{after her}} {{carriage}} accident, but her mysterious mother informs Laura's father that her journey is urgent and cannot be delayed. She arranges {{to leave her}} daughter with Laura and her father until she can return in three months. Before she leaves, she sternly notes that her <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> not disclose any information whatsoever about her family, past, or herself, and that Carmilla is of sound mind. Laura comments that this information seems needless to say, and her father laughs it off.|$|E
40|$|Although parental {{influence}} over mate choice {{is important to}} human mating decisions, it is often overlooked within evolutionary psychology. Based on evolutionary theory, we predict that, while both parents likely influence a child’s mate choice, <b>daughters</b> <b>will</b> perceive having a low quality partner (i. e., traits indicating poor parental investment, a lack of creativity, and physical unattractiveness) would be more unacceptable to their mother {{when compared with the}} father. However, <b>daughters</b> <b>will</b> perceive having a partner with traits indicating low social status as more unacceptable to their father when compared with the mother. The results supported the hypotheses. ...|$|R

25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing things that go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk about things that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E
500|$|In stanza 44, Odin {{poses the}} {{question}} to Vafþrúðnir as to who of mankind will survive the [...] "famous" [...] Fimbulwinter ("Mighty Winter"). Vafþrúðnir responds in stanza 45 that those survivors will be Líf and Lífþrasir, {{and that they will}} hide in the forest of Hoddmímis holt, that they will consume the morning dew, and will produce generations of offspring. In stanza 46, Odin asks what sun will come into the sky after Fenrir has consumed the sun that exists. Vafþrúðnir responds that Sól will bear a daughter before Fenrir assails her, and that after Ragnarök this <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> continue her mother's path.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Rapture", Castiel enters Dean's {{dreams and}} {{arranges}} {{a meeting to}} tell him something important. However, when Sam and Dean go to meet him, they instead find Jimmy, Castiel's vessel, {{who claims to have}} little memory of his life as a vessel. Anna theorizes Castiel must have angered his superiors, prompting him to be taken back to Heaven. When Jimmy is shot {{at the end of the}} episode trying to save his family from demons, Castiel returns, taking Jimmy's daughter as his new vessel. After the demons are killed, a dying Jimmy begs Castiel to take him back as a host so his <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> not have to go through what he did, and the angel acquiesces. Dean then asks him what he needed to tell him, but Castiel coldly replies his loyalty is to Heaven, not to mankind or to him.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{centromere}} is {{the point}} of attachment for the mitotic apparatus, acentric fragments are not evenly distributed to the daughter cells in cell division (mitosis and meiosis). As a result, one of the <b>daughters</b> <b>will</b> lack the acentric fragment.|$|R
5000|$|Huyton {{does not}} have its own hospital, {{therefore}} most of its famous sons and <b>daughters</b> <b>will</b> have been born elsewhere, usually in Liverpool or Whiston. As well as the aforementioned footballers, the following people have or have had links with Huyton: ...|$|R

500|$|To {{find out}} why the curse failed, the Queen turns to Rumpelstiltskin (Carlyle), the {{original}} owner of the curse. Rumpelstiltskin offers to help the Queen if, in turn, she makes him a wealthy and respected person {{in the new world}} and promises that she will do anything he asks so long as he says [...] "please." [...] The Queen agrees, reminding him that in the new world, they would have no recollection of their agreement. Rumpelstiltskin then tells the Queen that she must cut out the heart of the thing she loves the most and use it to complete the spell. The Queen protests that what she loved most died because of Snow White, but Rumpelstiltskin suggests that there is something else the Queen also loves. He also tells the Queen that he has informed Snow White and Prince Charming that their unborn <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> be able to break the Queen's curse.|$|E
500|$|Kazuki and Tokiko {{find the}} white kakugane, which can negate {{the effects of}} the black kakugane and is guarded by Victor's {{daughter}} Victoria, who is herself a humanoid homunculus. [...] During the Alchemist Army's final battle against Victor, Kazuki applies the white kakugane to Victor, but it only weakens him. To protect humankind from both of them, Kazuki propels himself and Victor to the moon. Later, Papillion creates a white kakugane to heal Kazuki. The Alchemist Army rescues Kazuki, creates another white kakugane and restores Victor's humanity. Reunited with his daughter, Victor asks the Alchemist Army to turn him into a homunculus and tells them that he and his <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> lead all the homunculi to the moon. The Alchemist Army dedicates itself to research a way to revert homunculi back into humans, ending their war activities. All Warriors abdicate their kakugane. Kazuki and Tokiko return to their daily lives together while Papillon becomes an urban legend throughout Japan.|$|E
2500|$|The story {{ends with}} a {{newspaper}} cutting announcing {{the birth of their}} child, Callie Rose, with an announcement from Sephy that her <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> take her father's surname of McGregor.

2500|$|In Luchino Visconti's Bellissima (1951) {{she plays}} Maddalena, a blustery, obstinate stage mother who drags her {{daughter}} to Cinecittà for the 'Prettiest Girl in Rome' contest, with dreams that her plain <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> be a star. Her emotions in the film went from those of rage and humiliation to maternal love. The film was made during the [...] "grim period" [...] of Italy's post-World War II recovery.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{government}} is by kings, which they call sachema, and those reign by succession, but always of the mother's side: for instance, {{the children of}} him who is now king, will not succeed, but his brother, by the mother, or the children of his sister, whose sons (and after them, the children of her <b>daughter,)</b> <b>will</b> reign, for no woman inherits. The reason they render for this way of descent, is, that their issue may not be spurious. The five divisions of tribes commonly known are: ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{frustrating}} {{affair with}} Maddalena Fumaroli which, as noted above, came to nothing during these early years, the success achieved by Bianca e Gernado gave Bellini fresh hope {{that her parents}} would finally relent, and a new appeal was made through a friend. This was utterly rejected by Maddalena's father, who returned all the letters which she had received along with a letter from him stating that [...] "my <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> never marry a poor piano player (suonatore di cembalo)". [...] However, when Florimo gave him the news, {{he said that he}} was going to try again and win, but the next move was to come later from the Fumarolis family.|$|E

2500|$|... allows New Zealand {{citizens}} {{who wish to}} stay for more than 90 days {{in the country to}} apply for a residence card from the regional directorate of the Office of Immigration and Nationality within 90 days of arrival and do not need to obtain a residence permit prior to arrival in Hungary (unlike most other non-EEA and Swiss foreign nationals). Note also that family members (who are not New Zealand citizens) accompanying New Zealand citizens can apply for a residence permit after arriving in Hungary. For example, if a New Zealand citizen wishes to move to Hungary with her husband and her daughter (who are both Samoan citizens and not New Zealand citizens), all three of them can apply for a Hungarian residence permit after arriving in Hungary (although the husband and <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> have to apply for a Schengen visa prior to travelling to Hungary).|$|E
2500|$|In some cultures, such as Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Slovak, Czech, etc. {{surnames}} change form {{depending on}} {{the gender of the}} bearer. For example, in Greece, if a man called Papadopoulos has a daughter, she will likely be named Papadopoulou (if the couple have decided their offspring will take the father's surname), since that name has a female version. In Poland, if the husband is named Podwiński, and his wife takes his surname, her last name, and those of their unmarried daughters, would be Podwińska. The sons would be known as Podwiński. In Lithuania, if the husband is named Vilkas, his wife will be named Vilkienė and his <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> be named Vilkaitė. In Slovakia and Czech Republic alike, if a man is called Novák, the wife adds a feminine suffix [...] "-ová" [...] to his surname after the marriage, hence Nováková. The same is true for daughters which almost always inherit the father's surname with the feminine suffix.|$|E
2500|$|In {{analyzing}} {{the character of}} Rose, Clive Barnes described her as [...] "bossy, demanding, horrific". [...] Rich described Rose as [...] "a monster". Critic Walter Kerr commented that though Rose is a monster, she must be liked and understood. Patti LuPone describes Rose: [...] "She has tunnel vision, she's driven, and she loves her kids.... And she is a survivor. [...] I do not see her as a monster at allshe may do monstrous things, {{but that does not}} make a monster." [...] Sondheim has said of the character: [...] "The fact that she's monstrous to her daughters and the world is secondary... She's a very American character, a gallant figure and a life force." [...] Sondheim also noted, [...] "Yet the end of Gypsy is not entirely bleak. Louise comes out a star and forgives her mother. [...] There is hope for her. [...] Rose does confront who she is in 'Rose's Turn.' There is a catharsis. It's not Rodgers and Hammerstein, but you feel maybe the mother and <b>daughter</b> <b>will</b> come to an understanding and maybe triumph over Rose's craziness and Louise's bitterness." ...|$|E
