40|$|This {{article focuses}} on a study on six Portuguese {{teachers}} (three pre-service and three beginning teachers), who had developed most of their knowledge of TGfU informally through <b>self</b> <b>directed</b> <b>study</b> and attempts to adopt the approach during teaching practica. It investigated {{the ways in which}} they learnt about TGfU, how this shaped their experiences of trying to implement it during practicum and how this influenced their subsequent attitudes toward it and use of it. The six participants had limited exposure to TGfU in their PETE program but had been interested enough to pursue a better understanding of TGfU as self-directed learners. The study investigated their understanding of TGfU, how they developed it, and their experiences of trying to implement it on practicum. Positive support from a mentor teacher on practicum arose as the critical difference between participants’ who can be seen to have been successful and those were not and this is the focus of this article...|$|R

The dynamics of <b>directed</b> <b>self</b> assembly face challenges {{as a result of}} the rugged potential energy surface of nanoscale systems. The development of a dynamic model involving a master equation to simulate <b>directed</b> <b>self</b> assembly is presented. The model describes the probability of each possible configuration of a fixed number of nanoparticles as function of time during self assembly. Two case studies demonstrate the ability of the model to represent kinetic traps.

40|$|Background: Medical {{students}} {{perceive a}} lack of adequate feedback on their learning, as shown annually in the National Student Survey. We have previously shown that an audience response system (ARS) improves students’ satisfaction with the provision of feedback whilst also improving knowledge retention. However, feedback remains the area with the lowest satisfaction ratings. Previous studies highlighted that feedback is most effective when tailored to the individual. Summary of work: Students were assigned an ARS keypad {{at the start of}} one academic year and were regularly assessed on their understanding during physiology lectures by answering questions using the ARS. We provided students with instant feedback, generalised feedback (class responses and feedback on each question) and personalised feedback (individual results were imported into Blackboard). Students were asked to complete an online evaluation form including Likert-scale and free-text questions. Summary of results: Evaluation is underway and we will present {{the results of this study}} alongside staff perceptions of this method of feedback. Conclusions: Providing students with individualised formative feedback may highlight areas where they have difficulties, enabling them to guide their <b>self</b> <b>directed</b> <b>study.</b> Take-home messages: Use of an ARS to provide individualised feedback has potential to improve student satisfaction of feedback but also has drawbacks...|$|R
40|$|The chilly climate {{environment}} is posited as a phenomenon {{deemed to be}} the result of micro-inequalities and discrimination experienced by women within the classroom. The major implication proposed is that women are disadvantaged in an academic environment. Women studying degrees externally and situated outside the classroom setting are faced with multiple realities and influences. This research proposes that women undertaking a Research Higher Degree experience role strain and the actors for role strain are incorporated into the chilly climate. The actors within role strain are not gender specific and this paper also includes other women as a variable to the chilly climate. Integrating role strain theory into the chilly climate seeks to expand the understanding of the disadvantages women may experience undertaking <b>self</b> <b>directed</b> <b>study.</b> This research is an exploratory study involving four women in various stages of a Research Higher Degree. This paper intimates that the chilly climate is more complex than previous research suggests, particularly with the implication of role strain, which can disadvantage women undertaking a Research Higher Degree. The aim of this research is to outline strategies used by the participants to cope with or dissipate the chilly climate and to propose strategies for higher education institutions that may be beneficial for women considering or undertaking a Research Higher Degree...|$|R
40|$|Students are {{expected}} and encouraged where possible to explore {{as much of}} the literature pertaining to their field of study as possible. Using this literature to enrich their knowledge and improve their assessment submissions. This acquisition and discovery of literature is usually gathered during a student's <b>self</b> <b>directed</b> <b>study</b> period. It is therefore the case that multiple students could be searching for the same materials and resources. Whilst in itself this is not a concern, by effectively crowd-sourcing the research more in-depth and diverse sources could be discovered. In addition, this information, source location and relevance to a topic is lost after the students submission of their assessment. This paper presents an on-line peer collaboration tool called DIVERSE (Development and Integration of Varying Educational Resources and Student Engagement) whose aim is to develop active participation, research and sharing of knowledge between students themselves. It is hoped that the use of such a collaborative tool can improve student research, engagement and attainment with their studies. Within this paper DIVERSE is discussed with regard to its application to student collaboration of research and literature materials and its use throughout the pedagogical experience. Results from the use of DIVERSE with trial modules topics are also presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new, stratified approach for the metric self calibration {{of a camera}} with fixed internal parameters. The method works by intersecting modulus-constraint manifolds, which are {{a specific type of}} screw-transform manifold. Through the addition of a single scalar parameter, a 2 -dimensional modulus-constraint manifold can become a 3 -dimensional Kruppa-constraint manifold allowing for <b>direct</b> <b>self</b> calibration from disjoint pairs of views. In this way, we demonstrate that screw-transform manifolds represent a single, unified approach to performing both stratified and <b>direct</b> <b>self</b> calibration. This paper also shows how to generate the screw-transform manifold arising from turntable (i. e., pairwise-planar) motion and discusses some important considerations for creating a working algorithm from these ideas...|$|R

We investigate the <b>directed</b> <b>self</b> assembly of two systems, polystyrene-block-poly-DL-lactic acid (PS-b-PDLA) and PS-b-poly(methyl methacrylate). For the PS-b-PDLA system we use an open source EUVL resist and a commercially-available underlayer to prepare templates for DSA. We investigate the morphology of the phase separated domains {{and compare the}} LER of the resist and the PS-PDLA interface. For the PS-b-PMMA system we again use an open source resist, but the annealing conditions in this case require crosslinking of the resist prior to deposition of the block copolymer. For this system we also investigate the morphology of the phase separated domains and compare the LER of the resist and the PS-PMMA interface...|$|R

40|$|Background: Patient {{and public}} {{involvement}} (PPI) {{in the research}} process is a key feature of NHS Research and Development policy but reporting of the extent and value of PPI in relation to physiotherapy research is lacking. Aims: To determine whether the proposed methodology within the randomized controlled trial aspect of the <b>SELF</b> <b>study</b> was acceptable to patients and to ascertain whether enhancements could be made in relation to elements that matter most to patients. Methods: A focus group discussion was undertaken with four lay people who were currently attending physiotherapy. The data was transcribed verbatim and analysed using the framework method.

40|$|Higher Education Institutes {{worldwide}} {{are investing}} significant resources in <b>self</b> <b>study</b> programmes to improve institutional performance, to enhance quality {{and to meet}} external stakeholder demands.

40|$|The {{commercialization of}} 32 nm {{lithography}} {{has been made}} possible by using double patterning, a technique that allows for an increased pattern density, potentially, through resist freezing and high precision pattern registration. Recent developments in <b>directed</b> <b>self</b> assembly (DSA) also uses resist freezing for stabilizing positive tone resists used in graphoepitaxy. We have developed a method of patterning an open source, positive tone EUV resist using electron beam lithography (EBL), and studied a novel way of freezing a positive tone EUV photoresists through electron beam induced crosslinking. Through metrological analysis, crosslinked pattern was observed to retain consistent critical dimensions (CD) and line-edge roughness (LER) after they were annealed at temperatures higher than the glass transition of the photoresist. This process {{has been used to}} freeze patterned EUV photoresists, which have been subsequently used for <b>directed</b> <b>self</b> assembly of PS-b-PMMA and has potential applications in double patterning in an LFLE scenario...|$|R
