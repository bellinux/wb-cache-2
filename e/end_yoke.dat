50|$|The Magtataho (taho vendor) is {{a common}} sight in the Philippine streets. A magtataho carries two large {{aluminum}} buckets that hang from each <b>end</b> of a <b>yoke.</b> The larger bucket carries the tofu base; the smaller bucket holds the arnibal and sago pearls.|$|R
50|$|The {{basic design}} is a wood or bamboo yoke, usually tapered. From each <b>end</b> of the <b>yoke,</b> {{a load of}} equal mass is {{suspended}}. The load may be a basket of goods, pail of milk, water or other liquid, suspended on rope. The load may be hung directly from the yoke, without any rope.|$|R
5000|$|A U-shaped {{reversing}} yoke which tilted {{back and forth}} to control reversing and cutoff. The <b>ends</b> of the <b>yoke's</b> arms pivoted on the rear frame mount, and there was also another pivot mounted near the base of the arm. The yoke was connected at the top to the reach rod leading to the reverser.|$|R
50|$|At 06:00 on 31 August, the 7th Marines and two battalions of the 1st KMC {{launched}} the assault with an attack from Hill 793 up {{the eastern edge}} of the Punchbowl towards Yoke Ridge in the west and Tonpyong in the east. By late morning, despite heavy rain and enemy minefields, the assault units had reached Yoke Ridge and were engaging the KPA defenders. By the end of the first day, US/ROK force occupied the southeastern <b>end</b> of <b>Yoke</b> Ridge and had suffered 3 killed and 57 wounded (mostly by landmines), while the KPA had lost 129 killed, a further 218 estimated killed, 233 estimated wounded and 14 captured.|$|R
50|$|Many canoes {{include a}} thwart which is {{shaped like a}} yoke to aid in {{carrying}} the boat. The gunwales of the inverted canoe rest upon the <b>ends</b> of the <b>yoke,</b> which is normally positioned slightly ahead of the centre of gravity of the vessel. This allows the bow to tip slightly upward when being transported, giving the carrier a view {{in the direction of}} travel when being portaged.|$|R
25|$|Ivan III {{considered}} himself an {{heir to the}} fallen Byzantine Empire and defender of the Orthodox Church. He proclaimed himself sovereign of all Rus and claimed patrimonial rights to the former lands of Kievan Rus'. Such ambitions led to the steady growth of Muscovite territory and power. The Mongol <b>Yoke</b> <b>ended</b> in 1480 with the defeat of Akhmat Khan of the Golden Horde in the Great stand on the Ugra river. Moscow extended its influence to the Principality of Ryazan in 1456, annexed the Novgorod Republic in 1477, and the Principality of Tver in 1483. Further expansionist goals of Ivan III clashed with the Lithuanian interests.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} an engine mount assembly for supporting an aircraft engine in aft-cantilevered position beneath the aircraft wing. The assembly includes a pair forward engine mounts positioned {{on opposite sides}} of an integrally formed yoke member wrapped about the upper half of the engine casing. Each side of the yoke is preferably configured as an A-shaped frame member with the bottom portions joining each other and the pylon. To prevent backbone bending of the engine trunnion assembly, the forward engine mounts supported at opposite <b>ends</b> of the <b>yoke</b> engage the casing along its centerline. The trunnion assembly is preferably constructed of high strength titanium machined and/or forged...|$|R

50|$|The {{excavation}} of the Newbridge chariot burial {{was carried out}} by a team from Headland Archaeology and conservators from the National Museum of Scotland. The excavation revealed that the pit would have been little larger than the chariot. It was dug to the depth of the axle then two smaller pits were cut into its base to receive the wheels. A narrower slot accommodated the chariot pole but broadened at the <b>end</b> for the <b>yoke.</b> From the outset {{it was clear that the}} iron tyres and other metal fittings around each wheel were well-preserved and it was decided to lift each wheel in a block of soil, allowing specialist excavation and conservation under laboratory conditions.|$|R
50|$|The yoke {{arrangement}} {{is similar to}} ’58 Pattern, though the strap adjustment was much simpler. The haversack had a similar pick handle storage attachment arrangement to ’58 webbing between the shoulder blades. It {{is attached to the}} rear of the yoke with the help of two doubled ¾ inch wide nylon straps passing through plastic D-rings on the top rear of the sack and adjustable at the <b>yoke</b> <b>end</b> by the same type of green buckle used elsewhere. The front and back strap arrangements allowed the webbing to be easily drawn in or let out dependent on load. A pair of straps was also fastened to D-rings threaded onto the rear yoke straps, to allow a sleeping bag or poncho to be carried on top.|$|R
50|$|The yoke of {{this type}} is {{sometimes}} made of wood, but is usually made of bamboo. A large diameter piece of bamboo is used. It is split to produce a fairly flat piece, which is then tapered at each end. A notch is cut at the ends, similar in shape to an arrow head. This prevents the ropes from slipping off. The bamboo yoke is normally between 1 and 1.5 meters in length, and carried with the curved (outside surface) of the bamboo against the shoulder. Three ropes, about 0.5 metres each, attach the basket to the <b>ends</b> of the <b>yoke.</b> Throughout China, the baskets usually include a cover. However, these are rarely used. They are normally kept inverted {{on the top of}} the baskets. The goods are placed within the inverted cover.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} fast ramped superferric magnets with {{repetition}} {{rates in the}} order of 1 Hz requires reliable software tools to calculate the complex 3 D magnetic field quality as well as the impact of eddy currents and hysteresis losses. Various technological construction details should be taken into account to obtain a high field quality. We present a methodical study of these problems based on ANSYS calculations for simplified dipole models. The results of this analysis are compared with recently published results obtained by different special codes, i. e. an integral and the FIT method. The time dependencies of the eddy current power due to longitudinal magnetic field component at the <b>yoke</b> <b>ends,</b> the transient field distribution in the yoke volume and the total eddy current loss are investigated, using identical geometries with the same magnetic and electric properties of the lamination steel as used by the other codes. According to the results of this investigation the appli-cation potential of the different methods is discussed...|$|R
2500|$|The finds {{from the}} {{excavation}} were very few, and of limited help in dating the site. A small iron chain was found, {{consisting of a}} circular ring and remains of five oval links. There were also a few scraps of Iron-Age pottery, and a fragment of a bronze tube {{believed to be a}} [...] "horn-cap," [...] a type of object which it is believed was mounted on the <b>ends</b> of chariot <b>yokes.</b> Hawkes himself believed that the fort was built in the first century BC and was demolished in about 43 AD, possibly by the Romans. Advances in Iron-Age archaeology since the 1930s have now led modern archaeologists to adopt a longer chronology for the site. The site may date from the Early to Middle Iron-Age (c. 5th century BC) and may have started out with a single bank and ditch system. Later the ramparts may have been refurbished, and the outer ramparts were added to the original construction. Many hillforts in southern England had been abandoned well before the Roman conquest, and Buckland Rings may have fallen out use by the 1st century BC. The finds from excavation are stored in Winchester.|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{magnetic}} properties of electrical steel is vital {{in improving the}} quality of electrical machinery since it is used as magnetic cores for transformers, motors and generators. A double yoke single sheet tester (SST) was modeled using two identical C-cores wound with copper wires at limb side in horizontal arrangement. The magnetic properties for electrical steels, grade M 4 and M 19 were tested under a frequency of 50 Hz with the current ranging from 0. 2 to 2. 4 A. The effects of the sample dimension and anisotropy on magnetic measurements were investigated. Evaluation on specimen dimensions indicate that the non-uniformity of sample magnetization in overhang sample can attribute to the flux leakage between the yoke legs. The stray flux is also increased with the overhang sample. However, the so-called fit-in sample which is fitted nicely between the <b>yoke</b> <b>end</b> poles can minimize the effect of stray flux. One way ANOVA and T-test were used as statistical methods and executed at the 5 % significance level. It is statistically proven that the magnetic properties of both magnetic materials are influenced by their anisotropy...|$|R

40|$|The National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) {{storage ring}} at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) will be {{equipped}} with 54 dipole magnets having a gap of 35 mm, and 6 dipoles having a gap of 90 mm. Each dipole has a field of 0. 4 T and provides 6 degrees of bending for a 3 GeV electron beam. The large aperture magnets are necessary to allow the extraction of long-wavelength light from the dipole magnet to serve {{a growing number of}} users of low energy radiation. The dipoles must not only have good field homogeneity (0. 015 % over a 40 mm x 20 mm region), but the integral transfer functions and integral end harmonics of the two types of magnets must also be matched. The 35 mm aperture dipole has a novel design where the <b>yoke</b> <b>ends</b> are extended up to the outside dimension of the coil using magnetic steel nose pieces. This design increases the effective length of the dipole without increasing the physical length. These nose pieces can be tailored to adjust the integral transfer function as well as the homogeneity of the integrated field. One prototype of each dipole type has been fabricated to validate the designs and to study matching of the two dipoles. A Hall probe mapping system has been built with three Group 3 Hall probes mounted on a 2 -D translation stage. The probes are arranged with one probe in the midplane of the magnet and the others vertically offset by {+-} 10 mm. The field is mapped around a nominal 25 m radius beam trajectory. The results of measurements in the as-received magnets, and with modifications made to the nose pieces are presented...|$|R
60|$|I went {{upon the}} Molo, passing between {{the pillars of}} the Lion and the Saint, and walked freely back and forth, taking in the glory of that {{prospect}} of water and of vague islands breaking the silver of the lagoons, like those scenes cunningly wrought in apparent relief on old Venetian mirrors. I walked there freely, for though there were already many gondoliers at the station, not one took me for a foreigner or offered me a boat. At that hour, I was in myself so improbable, that if they saw me at all, I must have appeared to them as a dream. My sense of security was sweet, but it was false, for on going into the church of St. Mark, the keener eye of the sacristan detected me. He instantly offered {{to show me the}} Zeno Chapel; but I declined, preferring the church, where I found the space before the high altar filled with market-people come to hear the early mass. As I passed out of the church, I witnessed the partial awaking of a Venetian gentleman who had spent the night in a sitting posture, between the columns of the main entrance. He looked puffy, scornful, and uncomfortable, and at the moment of falling back to slumber, tried to smoke an unlighted cigarette, which he held between his lips. I found none of the shops open as I passed through the Merceria, and but for myself, and here and there a laborer going to work, the busy thoroughfare seemed deserted. In the mere wantonness of power, and the security of solitude, I indulged myself in snapping several door-latches, which gave me a pleasure as keen as that enjoyed in boyhood from passing a stick along the pickets of a fence. I was in nowise abashed to be discovered in this amusement by an old peasant-woman, bearing at either <b>end</b> of a <b>yoke</b> the usual basket with bottles of milk packed in straw.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Ferris {{took his}} way through the devious footways where the shadow was chill, and through the broad campos where the sun was tenderly warm, and the towers of the church rose against the speck-less azure of the vernal heaven. As he went along, he frowned in a {{helpless}} perplexity with the case of Don Ippolito, whom he had begun by doubting for a spy with some incomprehensible motive, and had ended by pitying with a certain degree of amusement and a deep sense of the futility of his compassion. He presently began to think of him with a little disgust, as people commonly think of one whom they pity and yet cannot help, and he made haste to cast off the hopeless burden. He shrugged his shoulders, struck his stick on the smooth paving-stones, and let his eyes rove up and down the fronts of the houses, {{for the sake of the}} pretty faces that glanced out of the casements. He was a young man, and it was spring, and this was Venice. He made himself joyfully part of the city and the season; he was glad of the narrowness of the streets, of the good-humored jostling and pushing; he crouched into an arched doorway to let a water-carrier pass with her copper buckets dripping at the <b>end</b> of the <b>yoke</b> balanced on her shoulder, and he returned her smiles and excuses with others as broad and gay; he brushed by the swelling hoops of ladies, and stooped before the unwieldy burdens of porters, who as they staggered through the crowd with a thrust hero, and a shove there forgave themselves, laughing, with [...] "We are in Venice, signori;" [...] and he stood aside for the files of soldiers clanking heavily over the pavement, then muskets kindling to a blaze in the sunlit campos and quenched again in the damp shadows of the calles. His ear was taken by the vibrant jargoning of the boatmen as they pushed their craft under the bridges he crossed, and the keen notes of the canaries and the songs of the golden-billed blackbirds whose cages hung at lattices far overhead. Heaps of oranges, topped by the fairest cut in halves, gave their color, at frequent intervals, to the dusky corners and recesses and the long-drawn cry of the venders, [...] "Oranges of Palermo!" [...] rose above the clatter of feet and the clamor of other voices. At a little shop where butter and eggs and milk abounded, together with early flowers of various sorts, he bought a bunch of hyacinths, blue and white and yellow, and he presently stood smelling these while he waited in the hotel parlor for the ladies to whom he had sent his card. He turned at the sound of drifting drapery, and could not forbear placing the hyacinths in the hand of Miss Florida Vervain, who had come into the room to receive him. She was a girl of about seventeen years, who looked older; she was tall rather than short, and rather full,--though it could not be said that she erred in point of solidity. In the attitudes of shy hauteur into which she constantly fell, there was a touch of defiant awkwardness which had a certain fascination. She was blonde, with a throat and hands of milky whiteness; there was a suggestion of freckles on her regular face, where a quick color came and went, though her cheeks were habitually somewhat pale; her eyes were very blue under their level brows, and the lashes were even lighter in color than the masses of her fair gold hair; the edges of the lids were touched with the faintest red. The late Colonel Vervain of the United States army, whose complexion his daughter had inherited, was an officer whom it would not have been peaceable to cross in any purpose or pleasure, and Miss Vervain seemed sometimes a little burdened by the passionate nature which he had left her together with the tropical name he had bestowed in honor of the State where he had fought the Seminoles in his youth, and where he chanced still to be stationed when she was born; she had the air of being embarrassed in presence of herself, and of having an anxious watch upon her impulses. I do not know how otherwise to describe the effort of proud, helpless femininity, which would have struck the close observer in Miss Vervain.|$|R
