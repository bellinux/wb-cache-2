5|$|In amphibians, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of <b>habituation,</b> associative learning through both classical and instrumental learning, and discrimination abilities.|$|E
5|$|Aversive {{conditioning}} deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise {{makers and}} rubber bullets are used {{each time the}} bear performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual <b>habituation</b> of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear will {{be less likely to}} continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).|$|E
5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual perception. Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of {{small changes in}} patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of <b>habituation</b> in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E
25|$|Repeated tapping of {{the abdomen}} leads to <b>habituation</b> {{of the tail}} flip mechanism. However, self–habituation is {{prevented}} by command neuron–derived inhibition because when a tail flip is begun, the mechanisms that induce <b>habituation</b> are repressed. The <b>habituation</b> occurs {{at the level of}} the A type and C type interneurons, which experience synaptic depression. The <b>habituation</b> process is also mediated further up the circuit through the buildup of tonic inhibition, brought on by the repeated stimulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Habituation</b> {{involves}} decreased {{levels of}} attention and responsiveness to a stimulus {{that is no longer}} perceived as being novel. In the realm of olfactory memory, <b>habituation</b> refers to a decrease in responsiveness to an odor as a result of prolonged exposure (restricted to a certain repeated stimulus), which involves adaptation of cells in the olfactory system. Receptor neurons and mitral cells located in the olfactory system adapt in response to odors. This includes the involvement of piriform cortical neurons which adapt rapidly, more completely and selectively to novel odors and are also thought to play a very important role in the <b>habituation</b> of odors. Norepinephrine is considered to {{have an effect on the}} functioning of the mitral cells by increasing their responsiveness. Acetylcholine is also regarded as an important neurotransmitter involved in the <b>habituation</b> of olfactory stimulus, though the exact means through which it operates are not yet clear.|$|E
25|$|There are {{considered}} to be three paradigms used to investigate fetal learning and memory. They are: classical conditioning, <b>habituation</b> and exposure learning.|$|E
25|$|Fatigue and <b>habituation</b> {{effects have}} {{previously}} been connected to visual extinction; experiments {{such as those}} done by Vuilleumier and Rafal eliminate the connection of these effects with visual extinction.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 Leon Chua {{published}} a tutorial underlining the broad span of complex phenomena and applications that memristors span {{and how they}} can be used as non-volatile analog memories and can mimic classic <b>habituation</b> and learning phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin is a monoamine {{neurotransmitter}} {{which has}} been associated with schizophrenia. The psychedelic drug classes indoleamines and phenethylamines can affect serotoninergic 5-HT2A receptors. LSD, an indoleamine, affects startle <b>habituation</b> and prepulse inhibition of startle, which are indicators of human schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Surgical treatments, {{such as a}} {{semi-circular}} canal occlusion, {{do exist}} for BPPV, but carry the same risk as any neurosurgical procedure. Surgery is reserved {{as a last resort}} option for severe and persistent cases which fail vestibular rehabilitation (including particle repositioning and <b>habituation</b> therapy).|$|E
25|$|Wolf {{attacks are}} more likely to happen when preceded by a long period of <b>habituation,</b> during which wolves {{gradually}} lose their fear of humans. This was apparent in cases involving habituated North American wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park, Vargas Island Provincial Park and Ice Bay, as well as 19th century cases involving escaped captive wolves in Sweden and Estonia.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{emotional}} approach coping {{could also be}} due to exposure to stressful stimuli when actively processing and expressing emotions. The repeated exposure to the stressor could result in physiological <b>habituation.</b> Repeated exposure to a stressor through emotional expression and processing could also lead to cognitive reappraisal of the stressor and related self-affirmations.|$|E
25|$|An {{array of}} more subtle and {{lingering}} symptoms after orgasm, {{which do not}} constitute POIS, may contribute to <b>habituation</b> between mates. They may show up as restlessness, irritability, increased sexual frustration, apathy, sluggishness, neediness, dissatisfaction with a mate, or weepiness over the days or weeks after intense sexual stimulation. Such phenomena {{may be part of}} human mating physiology itself.|$|E
25|$|Lesions in the {{perirhinal cortex}} account for deficits in {{reference}} memory and working memory, {{and increase the}} rate of forgetting of information during training trials of the Morris water maze. This accounts for the impairment in the initial acquisition of the task. Lesions also cause impairment on an object location task and reduce <b>habituation</b> to a novel environment.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{includes}} balance retraining exercises (vestibular rehabilitation). The exercises include {{movements of}} the head and body specifically developed for the patient. This form of therapy is thought to promote <b>habituation,</b> adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, and/or sensory substitution. Vestibular retraining programs are administered by professionals with knowledge and understanding of the vestibular system and its relationship with other systems in the body.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Cameroonian {{government}} {{is working with}} various non-governmental organisations to develop ecotourism in the South. These efforts are largely concentrated on the area's two major parks, the Dja and Campo Reserves, {{both of which are}} bases for various gorilla <b>habituation</b> projects. The Netherlands Development Organisation runs another project that takes travellers to the Campo Reserve and then to traditional homes in Ebodjé, a village 25km north.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 review {{found that}} {{increased}} caffeine intake {{was associated with}} a variation in two genes that increase the rate of caffeine catabolism. Subjects who had this mutation on both chromosomes consumed 40mg more caffeine per day than others. This is presumably due to the need for a higher intake to achieve a comparable desired effect, not that the gene led to a disposition for greater incentive of <b>habituation.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Habituation</b> – This is {{a process}} in which the brain learns to ignore repetitive, {{meaningless}} stimuli while remaining sensitive to others. A good example of this is a person who can sleep through loud traffic in a large city, but is awakened promptly due to the sound of an alarm or crying baby. Reticular formation nuclei that modulate activity of the cerebral cortex are part of the ascending reticular activating system.|$|E
25|$|Coyotes {{occasionally}} {{lose their}} wariness {{of humans and}} frequent roadsides or developed areas, becoming conditioned to human food by receiving handouts or picking up food scraps. They can quickly learn bad habits like roadside begging behavior. This leads to potential danger for humans and coyotes. Several instances of coyote aggression toward humans {{have occurred in the}} park, including one that involved an actual attack. <b>Habituation</b> most likely played a role in this unusual coyote behavior.|$|E
25|$|Effigies of both {{predators and}} conspecifics {{have been used}} with success to {{disperse}} gulls and vultures. The effigies of conspecifics are often placed in unnatural positions where they can freely move with the wind. Effigies {{have been found to}} be the most effective in situations where the nuisance birds have other options (e.g. other forage, loafing, and roosting areas) available. Time to <b>habituation</b> varies. (Seamans et al. 2007, DeVault et al. 2013).|$|E
25|$|Results {{from another}} recent {{study suggest that}} fetuses were able to form both {{short and long term}} memories. This {{conclusion}} was drawn from the fact that <b>habituation</b> rates (number of stimuli needed to habituate) were higher in babies in the neonatal stage that had not previously undergone fetal stimulations when compared to those who had: therefore demonstrating the memory of the stimulus in its fetal stage being carried into the neonatal stage.|$|E
25|$|Springer's move to {{her home}} waters needed to be well timed to {{maximize}} her chances of re-integrating into a wild pod. To minimize her <b>habituation</b> to humans, {{she needed to be}} moved as soon as possible and had to be released during the time her pod was usually present in Johnstone Strait between May 6 and July 25, usually in mid-July. On July 9, OrcaLab detected orca calls closely related to Springer's, moving towards Johnstone Strait.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{following}} the initial formative period, the SC {{does not appear}} to display any neural plasticity. Despite this, <b>habituation</b> and sensititisation over the long term is known to exist in orientation behaviors. This apparent plasticity in function has been attributed to the adaptability of the AES. That is, although neurons in the SC have a fixed magnitude of output per unit input, and essentially operate an all or nothing response, the level of neural firing can be more finely tuned by variations in input by the AES.|$|E
25|$|Another {{recommended}} {{technique is}} from the Satipatthana Sutta, which outlines the practice of mindfulness, which {{is not just a}} formal meditation, but a skill of attentive awareness and self monitoring. In developing mindfulness, one is advised to be aware of all thoughts and sensations that arise, even unwanted or unpleasant ones and continuously attend to such thoughts. Eventually, through <b>habituation</b> and exposure, the intensity and unpleasantness of such thoughts will disappear. Buddhist texts also promote the training of positive emotions such as loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity.|$|E
25|$|Smoking during pregnancy: Prenatal {{exposure}} to cigarette smoke {{is known to}} produce lasting arousal, attentional and cognitive deficits in humans. This exposure can induce up-regulation of nicotinic receptors on α4b2 subunit on Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) cells, resulting in increased tonic activity, resting membrane potential, and hyperpolarization-activated cation current. These major disturbances of the intrinsic membrane properties of PPN neurons result in increased levels of arousal and sensory gating deficits (demonstrated by a diminished amount of <b>habituation</b> to repeated auditory stimuli). It is hypothesized that these physiological changes may intensify attentional dysregulation later in life.|$|E
25|$|<b>Habituation</b> {{is shared}} across species {{and is the}} {{simplest}} form of learning. Here a person’s response to a stimulus weakens when it becomes familiar. For example, with drink driving advertising in New Zealand, a decade ago we saw cars smashing into each other as a scare tactic. The content of these adverts has become less and less shocking the more we {{have been exposed to}} them. We have now become so desensitised to them that a humour approach has to be taken and the latest example is the ‘Legend’ advert.|$|E
25|$|The Brandt–Daroff {{exercises}} may {{be prescribed}} by the clinician {{as a home}} treatment method, usually in conjunction with particle-repositioning maneuvers or {{in lieu of the}} particle-repositioning maneuver. The exercise is a form of <b>habituation</b> exercise, designed to allow the patient to become accustomed to the position which causes the vertigo symptoms. The Brandt–Daroff exercises are performed in a similar fashion to the Semont maneuver; however, as the patient rolls onto the unaffected side, the head is rotated toward the affected side. The exercise is typically performed 3 times a day with 5–10 repetitions each time, until symptoms of vertigo have resolved for at least 2 days.|$|E
25|$|Overall, studies {{indicate}} {{that there is an}} ability for fetal learning and memory, and through classical conditioning, <b>habituation</b> and exposure learning that memory can be measured. It {{is important to note that}} certain periods in fetal development allow for different learning and memory abilities, which should be taken into consideration when determining if fetal memory exists. Auditory stimuli presented in the womb can be retained and recognized (learned) into the days following birth and that learning is specific to familiar auditory stimuli. Measuring learning and memory in the fetus has only been discussed in terms of healthy pregnancies; however, many factors such as disease affect these delicate processes.|$|E
25|$|Lasers {{have been}} used with success to {{disperse}} several species of birds. However, lasers are species specific as certain species will only react to certain wavelengths. Lasers become more effective as ambient light levels decrease, thereby limiting effectiveness during daylight hours. Some species show {{a very short time}} to <b>habituation</b> (Airport Cooperative Research Program, 2011). The risks of lasers to aircrews must be evaluated when determining whether or not to deploy lasers on airfields (Federal Aviation Administration 2012). Southampton Airport utilises a laser device which disables the laser past a certain elevation, eliminating the risk of the beam being shone directly at aircraft and air traffic control tower (Southampton Airport 2014).|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a common {{neurological}} disorder characterized by a degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra {{and a loss of}} dopamine in the putamen. It is described as a motor disease, but it also produces cognitive and behavioral symptoms. The most common treatment is dopamine replacement therapy, which consists in the administration of levodopa (L-Dopa) or dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole or ropinirole) to patients. Dopamine replacement therapy is well known to improve motor symptoms but its effects in cognitive and behavioral symptoms are more complex. Dopamine has been related to the normal learning of stimuli with behavioral and motivational significance, attention, and most importantly the reward system. In accordance with the role of dopamine in reward processing, addictive drugs stimulate dopamine release. Although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated, the role of dopamine in the reward system and addiction has been proposed as the origin of DDS. Models of addiction have been used to explain how dopamine replacement therapy produces DDS. One of these models of addiction proposes that over the usage course of a drug there is a <b>habituation</b> to the rewarding that it produces at the initial stages. This <b>habituation</b> is thought to be dopamine mediated. With long-term administration of L-dopa the reward system gets used to it and needs higher quantities. As the user increases drug intake there is a loss of dopaminergic receptors in the striatum which acts in addition to an impairment in goal-direction mental functions to produce an enhancement of sensitization to dopamine therapy. The behavioral and mood symptoms of the syndrome are produced by the dopamine overdose.|$|E
25|$|Bonobos {{are both}} {{terrestrial}} and arboreal. Most ground locomotion {{is characterized by}} quadrupedal knuckle walking. Bipedal walking has been recorded as less than 1% of terrestrial locomotion in the wild, a figure that decreased with <b>habituation,</b> while in captivity {{there is a wide}} variation. Bipedal walking in captivity, as a percentage of bipedal plus quadrupedal locomotion bouts, has been observed from 3.9% for spontaneous bouts to nearly 19% when abundant food is provided. These physical characteristics and its posture give the bonobo an appearance more closely resembling that of humans than that of the common chimpanzee. The bonobo also has highly individuated facial features, as humans do, so that one individual may look significantly different from another, a characteristic adapted for visual facial recognition in social interaction.|$|E
25|$|NMFS {{officials}} {{chose not}} to intervene, stating it lacked the funds or the confidence that a rescue, translocation and reunion was possible. No cetacean had ever been re-integrated into a wild pod after human intervention. Another orca, Keiko, had been released into the wild in 2002 after spending {{most of his life}} in captivity, but lived alone until his death in Norway in 2003. Scientists considered the possibility that Springer had been rejected by her pod (although resident orcas had never been known to do this). Springer's pod might respond to her reappearance by a physical attack. Also, the increasing <b>habituation</b> with humans and vessels could jeopardize a successful return to the wild and humans could be endangered by Springer's close contacts with small boats.|$|E
25|$|Sensorimotor {{deficits and}} neurochemical changes were {{observed}} in rats that were exposed to low doses of 56Fe-ions. Doses that are below 1 Gy reduce performance, as tested by the wire suspension test. Behavioral changes were observed as early as 3 days after radiation exposure and lasted up to 8 months. Biochemical studies showed that the K+-evoked release of dopamine was significantly reduced in the irradiated group, together with an alteration of the nerve signaling pathways. A negative result was reported by Pecaut et al., in which no behavioral effects were seen in female C57/BL6 mice in a 2- to 8-week period following their exposure to 0, 0.1, 0.5 or 2 Gy accelerated 56Fe-ions (1 GeV/u56Fe) as measured by open-field, rotorod, or acoustic startle <b>habituation.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{source of}} {{nonlinearity}} in the fMRI response {{is from the}} refractory period, where brain activity from a presented stimulus suppresses further activity on a subsequent, similar, stimulus. As stimuli become shorter, the refractory period becomes more noticeable. The refractory period does not change with age, nor do the amplitudes of HDRs. The period differs across brain regions. In both the primary motor cortex and the visual cortex, the HDR amplitude scales linearly with duration of a stimulus or response. In the corresponding secondary regions, the supplementary motor cortex, which is involved in planning motor behavior, and the motion-sensitive V5 region, a strong refractory period is seen and the HDR amplitude stays steady {{across a range of}} stimulus or response durations. The refractory effect {{can be used in a}} way similar to <b>habituation</b> to see what features of a stimulus a person discriminates as new.|$|E
500|$|Further {{regulation}} of cannabis followed in Massachusetts (1911), New York (1914), and Maine (1914). In New York, reform legislation began under the Towns-Boylan Act, which targeted all [...] "habit-forming drugs", restricted their sale, prohibited refills {{in order to}} prevent <b>habituation,</b> prohibited sale to people with a habit, and prohibited doctors who were themselves habituated from selling them. Shortly after, several amendments were passed by the New York Board of Health, including adding cannabis to the list of habit-forming drugs.|$|E
500|$|The {{first study}} showed infants a toy car that moved down an {{inclined}} track, disappeared behind a screen, and then reemerged {{at the other}} end, still on the track. The researchers created a [...] "possible event" [...] where a toy mouse was placed behind the tracks but was hidden by the screen as the car rolled by. Then, researchers created an [...] "impossible event." [...] In this situation, the toy mouse {{was placed on the}} tracks but was secretly removed after the screen was lowered so that the car seemed to go through the mouse. [...] Also in the 1991 study the researchers used an experiment involving two differently sized carrots (one tall and one short) in order to test the infants response when the carrots would be moved behind a short wall. [...] The wall was specifically designed to make the short carrot disappear, as well as tested the infants for <b>habituation</b> patterns on the disappearance of the tall carrot behind the wall (impossible event). Infants as young as 3½ months displayed greater stimulation toward the impossible event and much more <b>habituation</b> at the possible event. This indicated that they may have been surprised by the impossible event, which suggested they remembered not only that the toy mouse still existed (object permanence) but also its location. The same was true of the tall carrot in the second experiment. [...] This research suggests that infants understand more about objects earlier than Piaget proposed.|$|E
