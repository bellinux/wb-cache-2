He rented a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the Florida State University (FSU) campus. Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police; but his lone job application, at a construction site, had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification. He reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing credit cards from women's wallets left in shopping carts.|$|E

25|$|Swadesh Deepak {{started his}} journey in the {{literary}} world, {{when he was about}} 14 years (factually born in 1939). After partition of India in 1947, the family settled in Rajpura Town, where Swadesh Deepak completed his matriculation and would travel by train to Ambala City and Cantt for his graduation and Post Graduation studies (in English and Hindi). The seeds of his grim, dark story telling and the characters always carrying a loaded Gun, were sown during the partition of India, in blood bath, when <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> father, a teacher of Urdu and Persian, taking to gun to save his village from the onslaught of marauding crowds of looters; along with few friends of his, who also owned guns; thus kept the hordes of looters at bay from their roof tops, for about 7 days and nights. Swadesh and his elder sister watched many people falling dead or being maimed. It was the Gurkhas regiment from the Indian Army which saved all the Hindu families of the village and brought them to India; in a Refugee Camp of Tents in the city of Kurukshetra. After reaching India, his father suffered from tuberculosis due to the smoke of gunpowder and dust which had affected his lungs. Father was in a Sanatorium for about 5 years, where one of his lung was removed. The family was taken care of by the maternal grandfather, and brought to Ambala City (Baldev Nagar Camp, built by the displaced populace). When his father joined back,the family shifted permanently to Rajpura Town, which was constructed by the refugees from Bahawalpur, Rawalpindi, Balochistan and Multan, with the help of Indian Govt.|$|E

2500|$|The {{structure}} probably {{originated in}} the 13thcentury. [...] During the later part of the 16thcentury the tower was leased to two city guilds, the Painters and Stationers, and the Barbers and Chandlers, who sublet it to other guilds. [...] By 1612 {{the fabric of the}} tower was in a poor condition, and the lead had been lost from its roof. [...] It was restored by the two guilds, and above the door they placed a plaque containing the date 1613 and a carving of a phoenix, the emblem of the Painters. [...] In the Civil War, during the Siege of Chester in 1645, the tower had a gun in each storey, and it was damaged in the conflict. [...] A plaque on the tower states that King Charles I stood on the tower on 24September 1645 as <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> soldiers being defeated at the Battle of Rowton Heath. The historian Simon Ward has expressed doubts about this and has suggested that the king may have stood instead on a tower of Chester Cathedral, which he considers is confirmed by evidence that a captain standing beside him was killed by a stray shot.|$|E
2500|$|Like William Shakespeare, Marlowe is {{frequently}} {{claimed to have}} been homosexual. Others argue that the question of whether an Elizabethan was gay or homosexual in a modern sense is anachronistic. For the Elizabethans, what is often today termed homosexual or bisexual was more likely to be recognised as a sexual act, rather than an exclusive sexual orientation and identity. Some scholars argue that the evidence is inconclusive and that the reports of Marlowe's homosexuality may simply be exaggerated rumours produced after his death. Richard Baines reported Marlowe as saying: [...] "All they that love not Tobacco and Boys are fools". David Bevington and Eric Rasmussen describe Baines's evidence as [...] "unreliable testimony" [...] and make the comment: [...] "These and other testimonials need to be discounted for their exaggeration and for their having been produced under legal circumstances we would regard as a witch-hunt". One critic, J.B. Steane, remarked that he considers there to be [...] "no evidence for Marlowe's homosexuality at all." [...] Other scholars, however, point to homosexual themes in Marlowe's writing: in Hero and Leander, Marlowe writes of the male youth Leander, [...] "in his looks were all that men desire" [...] and that when the youth swims to visit Hero at Sestos, the sea god Neptune becomes sexually excited, [...] "magining that Ganymede, displeas'd, ad left the Heavens ... he lusty god embrac'd him, call'd him love ... <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> arms and, as they opened wide t every stroke, betwixt them would he slide nd steal a kiss, ... And dive into the water, and there pry pon his breast, his thighs, and every limb, ... nd talk of love", while the boy, naive and unaware of Greek love practices, protests, You are deceiv'd, I am no woman, I.' Thereat smil'd Neptune." [...] Edward the Second contains the following passage supporting homosexual relationships: ...|$|E
