5|$|The Liberals and PC party {{differed}} considerably on {{fiscal and}} tax policies. In his opening campaign speech at Massey Hall in Toronto, Diefenbaker contended that Canadians were overtaxed {{in the amount}} of $120 per family of four. Diefenbaker pledged to reduce taxes and castigated the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the <b>government</b> <b>surplus.</b> St. Laurent also addressed tax policy in his opening speech, in Winnipeg. St. Laurent noted that since 1953, tax rates had declined, as had the national debt, and that Canada had a reputation as a good place for investments. The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives would inevitably drive up the tax rate. Diefenbaker also assailed tight-money monetary policies which kept interest rates high, complaining that they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard.|$|E

25|$|Government {{receipts}} and expenditures are normally presented on a cash {{rather than an}} accrual basis, although the accrual basis may provide {{more information on the}} longer-term implications of the government's annual operations. The United States public debt is often expressed as a ratio of public debt to gross domestic product (GDP). The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease {{as a result of a}} <b>government</b> <b>surplus</b> as well as due to growth of GDP and inflation.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the US {{public debt}} {{as a share}} of gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) has increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined. The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease {{as a result of a}} <b>government</b> <b>surplus</b> or due to growth of GDP and inflation. For example, debt held by the public {{as a share of}} GDP peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 35 years. In recent decades, aging demographics and rising healthcare costs have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.|$|E
500|$|The early 1950s saw {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} in Canada; in most years there was a <b>government</b> <b>surplus.</b> In 1951, the Government introduced an old age pension for Canadians to receive {{from the age of}} 70. With little unemployment and thus a surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, coverage was extended to seasonal workers, such as fishermen. St. Laurent's supervision of his ministers was minimal at the start of his tenure, and decreased as the years passed. With the Opposition few in numbers, ministers did as they wanted, and when Howe was accused by British Columbia Tory MP Howard Green in 1951 of being willing to end tariffs if the people would let him, Howe replied, [...] "Who would stop us?

King, Kenedy and Co. gained a monopoly over river trade until former business partners of Stillman, King and Kenedy's José San Román and John Young started their own river boat venture.

40|$|The latest boom in {{commodity}} prices fueled concerns about fiscal policies in commodity-exporting countries, with many claiming that it triggered {{loose fiscal policy}} and left no funds for a rainy day. This paper examines the links between fiscal policy and terms-of-trade fluctuations using a sample of 74 countries, both developed and developing. It finds evidence that booms {{in the terms of}} trade do not necessarily lead to larger <b>government</b> <b>surpluses</b> in developing countries, particularly in emerging markets and especially during capital flow bonanzas. This is not the case in OECD countries, where fiscal policy is of an acyclical nature. ...|$|R
40|$|Some {{emerging}} economies {{have recently}} experienced large <b>government</b> <b>surpluses</b> and accelerating foreign exchange reserve accumulation far {{in excess of}} what would be implied by the literature on optimal reserves. China in particular has repeatedly stressed that there may be an upper limit to how many reserves it is willing to hold. Using a dynamic general equilibrium model, we show that the credible expectation of such a limit would lead to a balance of payments anti-crisis, which is characterized by an economic boom, real appreciation, growing demand for domestic currency, and domestic inflation, in the period prior to the limit being reached. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a {{protracted}} debate on the "fiscal theory of the price level". This doctrine {{is based on the}} intertemporal government budget constraint, which says that the real value of the government debt equals the discounted value of future <b>government</b> <b>surpluses.</b> It is observed that the intertemporal government budget constraint consists of the proposition that government debt management defines a portfolio strategy that has no bubble. Therefore the intertemporal government budget constraint is satisfied in models in which bubbles can be ruled out, and it fails in settings in which bubbles can occur in equilibrium. bubbles...|$|R

50|$|Modern Monetary Theory, {{like all}} {{derivatives}} of the Chartalist school, emphasize that in nations with monetary sovereignty, a country is {{always able to}} repay debts that are denominated in its own currency. However, under modern-day monetary systems, the supply of money is largely determined endogenously. But exogenous factors like <b>government</b> <b>surpluses</b> and deficits play a role and allow government to set inflation targets. Yet, adherents of this school note that monetary inflation and price inflation are distinct, and that when there's idle capacity, monetary inflation can cause a boost in aggregate demand which can, up to a point, offset price inflation.|$|R
50|$|The savings {{identity}} or the savings-investment identity {{is a concept}} in national income accounting stating that the amount saved in an economy will be the amount invested in new physical machinery, new inventories, and alike. More specifically, in an open economy (an economy with foreign trade and capital flows), private saving plus governmental saving (the <b>government</b> budget <b>surplus</b> or the negative of the deficit) plus foreign investment domestically (capital inflows from abroad) must equal private physical investment. In other words, investment must be financed by some combination of private domestic savings, <b>government</b> savings (<b>surplus),</b> and foreign savings (foreign capital inflows).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{variants of}} the model suggested by Glick and Rogoff (1996) and VAR models to analyze short term effects of the main determinants for the current account in Costa Rica. Empirical evidence suggests that, lagged investment, <b>government’s</b> primary <b>surplus,</b> terms of trade, international interest rates, and the real exchange rate, have {{significant impact on the}} evolution of the current account. Changes in the terms of trade have a moderate effect on the current account. Terms of trade affect the current account by two channels, the quantum and the value of the exports and imports. The estimated net effect suggests that a decline on the terms of trade produces a worsening in the current account deficit. Government income and expenses have influence on the current account {{in such a way that}} increases in the <b>government’s</b> <b>surplus</b> net of interest payments will reduce the current account deficit. In addition, international interest rates and real exchange rate variations have a significantly positive effect on the current account. Finally, no significant effect of US growth on current account deficit can be identified. ...|$|R

25|$|Across Western Europe, {{the period}} from 1973 to 1981 {{marked the end of}} the booming economy of the 1960s. The Netherlands also {{experienced}} years of negative growth after that. Unemployment increased steadily, causing rapid growth in social-security expenditures. Inflation reached double digits; <b>government</b> <b>surpluses</b> disappeared. On the positive side, rich natural gas resources were developed, providing a current account trade surplus during most of the period. Public deficits were high. According to the long-term economic analysis of Horlings and Smits, the major gains in the Dutch economy were concentrated between 1870 and 1930 and between 1950 and 1970. Rates were much lower in 1930–45 and after 1987.|$|R
