5|$|Some early {{travellers}} found dodo meat unsavoury, {{and preferred}} to eat parrots and pigeons; others {{described it as}} tough but good. Some hunted <b>dodos</b> only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. <b>Dodos</b> were easy to catch, but hunters {{had to be careful}} not to be bitten by their powerful beaks.|$|E
5|$|The dodo {{was found}} {{interesting}} enough that living specimens {{were sent to}} Europe and the East. The number of transported <b>dodos</b> that reached their destinations alive is uncertain, and it is unknown how they relate to contemporary depictions and the few non-fossil remains in European museums. Based {{on a combination of}} contemporary accounts, paintings, and specimens, Julian Hume has inferred that at least eleven transported <b>dodos</b> reached their destinations alive.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 study {{examined}} the histology of thin-sectioned dodo bones, modern Mauritian birds, local ecology, and contemporary accounts, to recover information about the life history of the dodo. The study suggested that <b>dodos</b> bred around August, after having potentially fattened themselves, corresponding with the fat and thin cycles of many vertebrates of Mauritius. The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season. Adult <b>dodos</b> which had just bred moulted after Austral summer, around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the moulting would have completed {{at the end of}} July, in time for the next breeding season. Different stages of moulting may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumage.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, after {{a hundred}} years of neglect, {{a part of the}} Mare aux Songes swamp was {{excavated}} by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent malaria, the British had covered the swamp with hard core during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 <b>dodos</b> in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus, and 7.1% belonged to <b>dodos,</b> which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that <b>dodos</b> and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the swamp, which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp, few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the broad-billed parrot may have depended on <b>dodos</b> and Cylindraspis tortoises to eat palm fruits and excrete their seeds, which became food for the parrots. Anodorhynchus macaws depended on now-extinct South American megafauna in the same way, but now rely on domesticated cattle for this service.|$|E
5|$|The only extant {{remains of}} <b>dodos</b> taken to Europe in the 17th century are a dried head and {{foot in the}} Oxford University Museum of Natural History, a foot once housed in the British Museum but now lost, a skull in the University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum, and an upper jaw and leg bones in the National Museum, Prague. The last two were rediscovered and {{identified}} as dodo remains in the mid-19th century. Several stuffed <b>dodos</b> were also mentioned in old museum inventories, but none {{are known to have}} survived. Apart from these remains, a dried foot, which belonged to the Dutch professor Pieter Pauw, was mentioned by Carolus Clusius in 1605. Its provenance is unknown, and it is now lost, but it may have been collected during the Van Neck voyage.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dodo may already have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of <b>dodos</b> and other animals killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climactic changes shows the bird was resilient within its ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless {{bird that}} was endemic {{to the island}} of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.

5|$|The <b>dodos</b> on this islet may not {{necessarily}} {{have been the last}} members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715. The authors also pointed out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed out of hand.|$|E

5|$|An Indian Mughal {{painting}} rediscovered in St. Petersburg in the 1950s shows a dodo {{along with}} native Indian birds. It depicts a slimmer, brownish bird, and its discoverer A. Iwanow and dodo specialist Julian Hume {{regard it as}} one of the most accurate depictions of the living dodo; the surrounding birds are clearly identifiable and depicted with appropriate colouring. It is believed to be from the 17th century and has been attributed to artist Ustad Mansur. The bird depicted probably lived in the menagerie of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, located in Surat, where English traveller Peter Mundy also claimed to have seen <b>dodos.</b> In 2014, another Indian illustration of a dodo was reported, but it was found to be derivative of an 1836 German illustration.|$|E
5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848, as he {{believed}} the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white <b>dodos</b> were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that {{the discrepancy between the}} paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size {{and the fact that}} tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development period. The fact that no juvenile <b>dodos</b> have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or that the risk of miring was seasonal.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Dodo's</b> {{inability}} to fly was once beneficial for the bird because it conserved energy. The <b>Dodo</b> conserved more energy relative to birds {{with the ability}} to fly, due to the <b>Dodo's</b> smaller pectoral muscles. Smaller muscle sizes are linked to lower rates of maintenance metabolism, which in turn conserves energy for the <b>Dodo.</b> Lacking an instinct for fear was another mechanism through which the <b>Dodo</b> conserved energy because it never had to expend any energy for a stress response. Both mechanisms of conservation of energy was once advantageous because it enabled the <b>Dodo</b> to execute activities with minimal energy expenditure. However, these proved disadvantageous when their island was invaded, rendering them defenseless to the new dangers that humans brought.|$|R

5|$|The latest {{definite}} {{sighting of}} <b>dodos,</b> on Amber Island in 1662, {{may not necessarily}} {{have been the last}} members of the species.

5|$|All post-1638 depictions {{appear to}} be based on earlier images, around the time reports {{mentioning}} <b>dodos</b> became rarer. Differences in the depictions led authors such as Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans and Masauji Hachisuka to speculate about sexual dimorphism, ontogenic traits, seasonal variation, and even the existence of different species, but these theories are not accepted today. Because details such as markings of the beak, the form of the tail feathers, and colouration vary from account to account, it is impossible to determine the exact morphology of these features, whether they signal age or sex, or if they even reflect reality. Dodo specialist Julian Hume argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits, as seen in the Gelderland, Cornelis Saftleven, Crocker Art Gallery, and Ustad Mansur images. According to this claim, the gaping nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models. Most depictions show that the wings were held in an extended position, unlike flighted pigeons, but similar to ratites such as the ostrich and kiwi.|$|E
