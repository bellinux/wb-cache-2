50|$|The media often covers {{stories of}} dead {{foetuses}} being abandoned {{outside of the}} church's Blessed Sacrament chapel, a practise condemned by the Archdiocese of Manila. Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales has issued several canonical excommunications for women who perform <b>intentional</b> <b>abortion</b> in relation to such practices near the shrine, as ruled by the Latae Sententiae punishment by the Roman Catholic Church. The fetuses covered by the Filipino TV media are often left anonymously wrapped in sack-cloth or plain boxes.|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Assessment of <b>intentional</b> <b>abortion</b> and women's {{knowledge}} about its causes and complications {{is an important}} priority for women's health, {{but because of the}} sensitivity, the investigations in this topic are rare. This study was performed {{for the first time in}} order to determine women's knowledge and attitude toward <b>intentional</b> <b>abortion.</b> Methods: Women referring to pre-marriage counseling centers in Mashhad, Iran, were selected with easy sampling method and accessed with knowledge and attitude questionnaire. Data were analyzed by Q-Square, T-Test and Pearson correlation. Results: Of 480 participants, 71 % (CI 95 %= 66. 8 - 75. 0) had opposed attitudes about the <b>intentional</b> <b>abortion</b> and 26. 5 % (CI 95 %= 22. 6 - 30. 5) had appropriate knowledge. Between lower age and lower education, lack of interest to contraceptive use with low women's knowledge-attitude scores, there was a significant relationship (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Most of the participants opposed attitudes to <b>intentional</b> <b>abortion,</b> but more than 70 % of them had low {{knowledge about}} this topic. Inappropriate knowledge about causes and its adverse consequences, especially the beginning of marital life can lead to unwanted pregnancy, intentional and unsafe abortion that need attention...|$|E
40|$|The thesis The {{legalization of}} <b>intentional</b> <b>abortion</b> in Czechoslovakia i the year 1957 {{describes}} this topic {{in light of}} history- based on accessible historical documents- {{within the context of}} contemporary disputes and the creation of this law. In the preamble are given the discursions to theological ethics and church law, which should have sat this thesis in context of catholic theology. The thesis reflects also the progress and attepmts at full legalization of abortions soon after the Czechoslovakia was brought into being. The abortion act was enacted in {{the end of the year}} 1957. This fact is compared within the international situation. In addition more carefully is described the progress of the abortion act in USSR and several states of the Eastern bloc. The thesis also etchs in the activities of so-called "Prolicidal boards", which were settled down by the czechoslovakia government. These boards brought along that in the year of 1957 were abortions permitted only with partial restrictions. Intermediate abortion were at large allowed by the new abortion act as late as in the year of 1986. Keywords: Abortion Czechoslovakia 1957 Legalization Population La...|$|E
40|$|Over a 25 -year period we {{examined}} the anthropological characteristics of mothers and their partners, such as the place of living: urban vs. rural, the degree of education, parity, the time of menarche, {{and the frequency of}} <b>intentional</b> <b>abortions.</b> We examined 2 414 mothers and their partners in four periods of time extending from 1985 to 2009 in order to establish changes in the said anthropological characteristics over a period of 25 years. The degree of education of mothers and their partners is on the rise. In the period from 1985 to 1994, the percentage of mothers from the country was on the rise. Women with less education have on average more children, and those with better education the least children. Women from rural areas have on average more children than women from urban areas. The time of menarche dropped by 9 months over the period of 25 years. Girls from urban areas have their first menstrual cycle earlier. Women with higher professional qualifications had their first period earlier. The number of <b>intentional</b> <b>abortions</b> over the 25 -year period dropped...|$|R
40|$|Background: Self-reported {{counts of}} <b>intentional</b> <b>abortions</b> in {{demographic}} surveys are {{significantly lower than}} the actual counts. To estimate the extent of misreporting, previous research has required either a gold standard or a validation sample. However, in most cases, a gold standard or a validation sample is not available. Objective: Our main intention here is to show that a researcher has an alternative tool to estimate the extent of underreporting in a given dataset, particularly when neither a valid gold standard nor a validation sample is available. Methods: We adopt a binomial-thinned zero-inflated Poisson model and apply it to a sample dataset, the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), for which an alternative estimate of the average reporting rate (38 %) is available. We show how this model could be used to estimate the reporting probabilities of <b>intentional</b> <b>abortions</b> by each individual in addition to the overall average reporting rate. Results: Our model estimates the average reporting rate in the NSFG during 2006 ‒ 2013 as 35. 3 % (SE 8. 2 %). Individual reporting probabilities vary significantly. Conclusions: Our estimate of the average reporting rate of the dataset used is qualitatively and statistically similar to the available alternative estimate...|$|R

In legal limitation for abortion, low information about abortion laws and consequences of un-safe abortion can result in that women refer to il-legal providers. This study investigated knowl-edge of young women about abortion laws, its complications and their consent with <b>intentional</b> <b>abortion.</b> Near to 50 % of participants were not informed about national abortion legislation and its criminal law, and more than 66 % of partici-pants were not aware of unsafe abortion conse-quences. Of them 16 % believed that abortion must not be allowed at all, and 47 % expressed that legal facilities for safe abortion should be proved. High education and importance of using contraceptive were the most important variables in correlation with more information about abor-tion law and consequences. Providing informa-tion for women about abortion laws and com-plication should be more emphasized to prevent unsafe abortion especially in women with lower age and education...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVOS: Caracterizar a população que sofreu abortamento; {{investigar}} a existência de ansiedade e depressão; verificar se existe ou não sentimento de culpa após o abortamento e comparar os resultados entre mulheres que sofreram abortamento espontâneo e as que provocaram-no. MÉTODOS: 50 mulheres com abortamento espontâneo e 50 com provocado foram entrevistadas 30 dias após o abortamento. Foi realizada entrevista com questões abertas e fechadas e aplicada a escala Hospital Anxiety and depression. RESULTADOS: As mulheres que viveram o abortamento espontâneo encontram-se mais culpadas (30 %) que as que provocaram-no (18 %). No entanto, as mulheres que provocaram o abortamento encontraram-se mais ansiosas (média de 11) e mais deprimidas (média de 8, 3) que as mulheres que viveram abortamento espontâneo (médias de 8, 7 e 6, 1; respectivamente, p BACKGROUND: Pregnancy has {{a symbolic}} meaning for each woman. It {{varies according to}} personality structure and is related to women's previous life experiences. OBJECTIVES: {{the aim was to}} characterize the women that suffered abortion, asking about anxiety and depression, looking for guilty feelings after abortion, and to compare results between women who suffered spontaneous abortion and those who had <b>intentional</b> <b>abortion.</b> METHODS: fifty women with spontaneous and fifty with induced abortion were interviewed 30 days after the procedure. A semistructured questionnaire with open and closed-end questions and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered. RESULTS: woman who induced abortion revealed to be more anxious (mean 11) and depressed (mean 8. 3) than woman with spontaneous abortion (means 8. 7 and 6. 1 respectively, p< 0. 05).

40|$|The authors {{present results}} of {{researches}} whose {{aim was to}} determine the factors that may substantially influence population reproduction in the Republic of Serbia, taking into consideration all specific factors, like cultural background, economic situation, health education, health service organization, religious and historical factors, etc. The research was based on the population census from 1981. Seventeen regions of the inner part of the Republic of Serbia, Vojvodina and Kosovo were included in this research. Stratification was made according to the place of living (village, town) age, occupation (farmer, housewife, non and half-qualified, qualified and highly qualified workers) and education (without education, with unfinished or finished primary school, with secondary school, with college or university degree). In this way 2, 141 women were questioned with 101 questions by the method of interview. Interviews were conducted exclusively by doctors - gynaecologists. We determined the frequency of the use of contraceptives, <b>intentional</b> <b>abortions,</b> spontaneous abortions, pre-term deliveries, marriage infertility and term deliveries. Thus, 57. 4 % of women had basic knowledge of contraception, but only 15. 9 % of them used it; 58. 9 % of women had intentional abortions; 16. 2 % of women had spontaneous abortions, 5. 1 % of them had pre-term deliveries, and 67 % of women had term deliveries. Marriage infertility was found in 8. 6 % of women. When evaluating population health and behavior, we obtained some information and data concerning addicted diseases (alcohol, smoking, drugs, tranquilizers) homosexuality and ways of sexual intercourse. It was concluded that enormous differences existed among certain regions in the Republic of Serbia, which were conditioned by the diversity of the above mentioned influences. Proposals for the measures to be undertaken in the Republic of Serbia in order to regulate population policy, are given...|$|R
40|$|Background Nowadays {{using the}} stem cells has opened a new horizon in the medical science and is indeed a {{practical}} and non-invasive method for treating refractory diseases such as Leukemias, lymphomas, blood disorders and so on. Nonetheless, proper and sustainable uses of such powerful cells undoubtedly need to be as per certain ethical principles. of the existing challenges in using stem cells, we could mention issues such as: the resources used for stem cells such as fertilization and <b>intentional</b> <b>abortions,</b> generating embryos merely for laboratory studies, commercial benefits, the degree of accuracy in satisfaction, pushing therapeutic cloning towards reproductive cloning and exaggerated propagations on treatments using stem cells. Investigating the ethical challenges of researches and treatments using stem cells {{as well as providing}} suggestions on solving some ethical issues. Methods The research methods are based on using the existing library resources such as books, domestic & foreign magazines as well as the internet websites bearing ethical codes. Results Considering the extensive use of {{the stem cells}}, realistic programming for solving the ethical issues seems to be essential. using replacement resources for stem cells including: IVF surplus embryos, aborted fetuses, the embryos produced by Therapeutic cloning via Somatic cell nuclear Transfer (SCNT), Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), and parthenogenesis are recommended. Definitely, any of the suggested replacement resources have got their own ethical and complicated issues. promoting development of public umbilical cord blood blanks in order to maintain fairness among various social classes, carrying out the preclinical researches and risk to benefit analysis, performing systematic researches, refusing to pay against donation of gametes & embryos, Recommending cellular-therapy only in case it is safer than other available therapeutic methods. Informing the patient of the adverse effects of cellular therapy, providing the low income patients with financial supports via health insurances, using moral manuals and lastly stressing on religious ethics in line with medical ethics and expanding research and studies on the use of adults' stem cells are recommended as replacement methods.   Key words: cellular therapy, cloning, Medical ethics, Stem cells, Research ethics...|$|R
