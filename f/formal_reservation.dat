In 1910, the pronghorn antelope was moved from the Banff Paddock into Wood Buffalo National Park. Harkin believed the animal would benefit in a new protected park area. In March 1912, the park reported the presence of fourteen antelope. However, the effort was unsuccessful as the pronghorn antelope population decreased due to a lack of proper diet. In 1915, Harkin continued to play an essential role in antelope preservation near the village of Nemiskam, Alberta, where about 200 starving antelope were found in a rancher near the village of Foremost. The antelope were removed and sent to a reserved area of Maple Creek, where sufficient food and resources were available [...] On December 18, 1915, Minister William James Roche approved the <b>formal</b> <b>reservation</b> of seven square miles of land and established the Nemiskam National Antelope Park.

40|$|Although many <b>formal</b> <b>reservation</b> targets {{have been}} {{attained}} under Tasmania's Comprehensive, Adequate and Representative (CAR) reserve system, {{a large proportion}} of habitats important for threatened species, particularly invertebrates, remain in the off-reserve landscape. The development of conservation management strategies for species whose habitat coincides with areas subject to intensive forestry practices has been severely hampered by a lack of knowledge of the characteristics, spatial distribution and extent of habitats they occupy, and the of the planned disturbance regimes. The distribution, habitat and conservation requirements of three species of stag beetles (Coleoptera: Lucanidae) listed under the schedules of the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995, Hoplogonus simsoni, Lissotes latidens, and L. menalcas, were investigated in order to inform the development of management strategies for the conservation of their habitat throughout production forests. All three species are still restricted to small portions of the State, however this study found that they have wider distributions than previously recorded. Wet eucalypt forest and mixed/rainforest constituted potential habitat for all three species. Through relatively fine-scale predictive habitat modelling it was possible to identify with a reasonable level of confidence the spatial distribution of quality habitat for the litterdwelling lucanid H. simsoni, and the areas where this habitat overlaps most strongly with planned forestry activities. The abundance of H. simsoni was related to a particular forest structure, in addition to altitude, aspect and slope. Only broad forest types proved to be a reliable predictor of the occurrence of the obligate log-dwelling lucanid, L. menalcas, and the soil-dwelling L. latidens. However, as with H. simsoni, the abundance of L. latidens was associated with a particular forest structure, but also the quantity of coarse woody debris (CWD). The conversion of potential wet forest habitat to plantation resulted in the local extinction of H. simsoni. Given their association with CWD, it is expected that this practice would have a similar effect on the two Lissotes sp. Whilst all three species occurred in silvicultural regeneration following clearfelling, there was insufficient evidence {{to determine the effects of}} such practices on the long-term viability of populations of the species. Of concern for all three species is the loss of structural habitat features identified as important to the species through clearfell, burn and sow (CBS) forestry practices. There is an urgent need to determine the ecological sustainability of present forest management practices, such as CBS, in relation to the maintenance of CWD over successive rotations. All three species were inadequately reserved across their ranges with the bulk of their habitat coinciding with areas managed as production forest. A multi-scaled approach to the conservation of the three species' habitats, incorporating the maintenance of forest structural elements identified as important to each species, is recommended throughout their ranges. In particular, 'off-reserve' conservation strategies for the species need to include limits on the area of potential habitat that may be converted to plantation. The conservation requirements of these three threatened species illustrate the need to expand the focus of habitat conservation from static, set-aside approaches to strategies that incorporate the temporal dynamics of habitat maintenance. The value of single-species studies to the conservation of forest biodiversity in general is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Part A Karst Systems: A Tasmanian Context Tasmania's karst areas offer {{a variety}} of economic, scientific, {{educational}} and recreational resources, and, carefully managed, can continue to do so. The essential characteristics of karst stem from the fact that particular types of rock, commonly limestone or dolomite, have the capacity to be dissolved by natural waters, allowing seepage water and streams to be diverted underground. In the most fully expressed karst, integrated cave systems form the focus of underground drainage networks that are highly efficient. Karst areas {{offer a variety}} of heritage values but also pose a range of geomorphic hazards that include soils that are sometimes vulnerable to erosion or sudden collapse, and vulnerable aqUifers. Streams in underground solution channels often flow in directions that cannot be predicted from the surface topography. These streams have the capacity to rapidly transfer localised impacts to the wider karst system and, hence, the aqUifers are easily polluted. This can have important implications both for the protection of nature conservation values and for sustainable land management. The need to safeguard hydrological regimes and the soil and vegetation systems that condition water quantity and chemistry must be taken fully into account in developing and implementing management strategies if important heritage values are to be safeguarded and society's exposure to most of the geomorphic hazards that exist in many karst areas is to be minimised. The three-dimensional world beneath our feet is not a separate world. Rather, it is an extension of the surface world, and one highly integrated with the surface world. Karst environments result from a complex interplay between climatic, topographic, hydrologic, biologic and temporal factors and trends. Hence, a systems approach provides the most adequate means of seeking to come to terms both with the karst environment and with the requirements for determining appropriate uses and sustainable management of karst environments. The focus of this study is upon the maintenance of geodiversity in karst environments. A karst area classification system has been developed to facilitate the identification of sites of geoconservation Significance. This involves analysis at four levels: the Karst Systems level, or the mix of basic environmental controls that condition the evolution of any karst; the Karst Landform and Landform Communities level, or the individual species and communities of landforms that exist in any area; the Landform Contents level, which includes the various geological, biological and other phenomena found in caves and sinkholes; and Human Use and Aesthetics. The environmental systems that form the broad parameters within which Tasmania's karst has evolved are addressed in Chapter 2. These systems have largely controlled the nature of the landforms and landform communities that have developed, and the variations within them. In a sense, the system determinants can reasonably be utilised {{in a manner similar to}} that in which bio-regions are used to identify the broad environmental contexts from which representative examples of species and communities appropriate for conservation can be identified and selected. The principal difference is that while the karst environmental systems provide the framework from within which examples should be selected, the karst system controls are seldom spatially exclusive; rather, they overlap and interact with one another. Herein lies the origin of Tasmania's karst geodiversity, and the challenge to developing a comprehensive yet workable geoconservation strategy for karst phenomena. Part B An Atlas of Tasmanian Karst Areas Chapters 3 to 8 provide a brief overview of the 300 carbonate rock areas recorded in, respectively, the north-west, west, south-west, south-east, and north-east of Tasmania, and on some Bass Strait islands. Each area and its catchment has been depicted on maps at 1 : 100, 000 scale that have been photo-reduced for presentation here but are available at the original scale for digitising to Geographical Information Systems, or for other purposes. The broad systems context of each area is tabulated and a very brief summary of any known karst phenomena is appended. A brief introduction to each chapter provides a regional setting. Part C Discussion and Conclusions Chapter 9 provides a brief synthesis of management issues that arise in Tasmania's karst, including the vulnerability of soil and groundwater systems, accelerated sinkhole collapse affecting agricultural land and sometimes roads, refuse dumping in sinkholes, the risk of agricultural chemicals entering groundwater systems, the need for improved streamside management, issues related to limestone quarrying and forestry activities, and the management of caves used for recreational caving and commercial tourism. The inadequacy of managing arbitrarily-defined land parcels that have been superimposed on a highly interactive and systemic environment, is discussed: there is a need for a trans-tenure perspective on management of such systems. The desirability of developing community-based karstcare programs is addressed, together with the need to upgrade the system of <b>formal</b> <b>reservation</b> to protect some phenomena of major geoheritage significance. Initial steps towards the development of predictive modelling as an aid to strategic planning are discussed, together with approaches to the management of individual karst areas including the desirability of karst inventory and sensitivity mapping processes.

The assessment of conservation status at the systems, landform assemblage, and individual landform species levels are addressed, using examples...|$|E

40|$|Within the phenomenological Landau–Ginzburg–Devonshire theory, {{we discuss}} the paraelectric-ferrolectric {{transition}} in superstructures consisting of ferroelectric and paraelectric layers of equal thickness. The polar axis of the ferroelectric is perpendicular to the layer plane as expected in fully strained BaTiO 3 /SrTiO 3 superstructures on SrTiO 3 substrates with pseudomorphic electrodes. We concentrate on the electrostatic effects and do {{not take into account}} the boundary conditions other than the electrostatic ones. We find that when the ferroelectric phase transition in the superstructures is into a multidomain state, both its temperature and its character, i. e., the profile of the polarization appearing at the phase transition is strongly influenced by the nature of the near-electrode region. This is also the case for the layer thickness separating the single-and multidomain regimes of the transition. Such a finding makes us question the idea that these superstructures can be thought of as infinite systems, i. e., periodic superstructures similar to a crystal. The irrelevance of this idea in certain conditions is demonstrated by comparing the phase transitions in two different superstructures consisting of ferroelectric and paraelectric layers of the same thickness. In one of them, the ferroelectric layer is in immediate contact with an ideal metallic electrode, whereas at the other boundary, it is the paraelectric layer that is in contact with the electrode. In another superstructure, one paraelectric layer is split in two equal parts which are placed as the first and last layer between the electrodes and the ferroelectric layers which are closest to the electrodes. We show (with some <b>formal</b> <b>reservations)</b> that the phase transition temperature in the first superstructure can be over 100 [*]°C more than in the second one if the material parameters of BaTiO 3 /SrTiO 3 are used for the estimations. Moreover, the profile of the polarization arising at the phase transition is inhomogeneous along the superstructure and has the maximum amplitude in the ferroelectric layer contacting the electrode. We argue that this situation is general and results in smearing of the phase transition anomalies for the layer thicknesses corresponding to multidomain transitions. The work is mainly analyical but numerical methods have been used to support some statements that have been put forward as hypotheses...|$|R

5000|$|Since most {{existing}} {{legally binding}} {{international human rights}} instruments do not explicitly mention sexual and reproductive rights, a broad coalition of NGOs, civil servants, and experts working in international organizations have been promoting a reinterpretation of those instruments to link {{the realization of the}} already internationally recognized human rights with the realization of reproductive rights. An example of this linkage is provided by the 1994 Cairo Programme of Action: Reproductive rights embrace certain human rights that are already recognized in national laws, international human rights documents and other relevant United Nations consensus documents. These rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. It also includes the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence as expressed in human rights documents. In the exercise of this right, they should take into account the needs of their living and future children and their responsibilities towards the community.Similarly, Amnesty International has argued that the realisation of reproductive rights is linked with the realisation of a series of recognised human rights, including the right to health, the right to freedom from discrimination, the right to privacy, and the right not to be subjected to torture or ill-treatment. However, not all states have accepted the inclusion of reproductive rights in the body of internationally recognized human rights. At the Cairo Conference, several states made <b>formal</b> <b>reservations</b> either to the concept of reproductive rights or to its specific content. Ecuador, for instance, stated that: With regard to the Programme of Action of the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and laws of Ecuador and the norms of international law, the delegation of Ecuador reaffirms, inter alia, the following principles embodied in its Constitution: the inviolability of life, the protection of children from the moment of conception, freedom of conscience and religion, the protection of the family as the fundamental unit of society, responsible paternity, the right of parents to bring up their children and the formulation of population and development plans by the Government in accordance with the principles of respect for sovereignty. Accordingly, the delegation of Ecuador enters a reservation with respect to all terms such as [...] "regulation of fertility", [...] "interruption of pregnancy", [...] "reproductive health", [...] "reproductive rights" [...] and [...] "unwanted children", which in one way or another, {{within the context of the}} Programme of Action, could involve abortion.Similar reservations were made by Argentina, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Malta, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru and the Holy See. Islamic Countries, such as Brunei, Djibouti, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Syria, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen made broad reservations against any element of the programme that could be interpreted as contrary to the Sharia. Guatemala even questioned whether the conference could legally proclaim new human rights.|$|R
