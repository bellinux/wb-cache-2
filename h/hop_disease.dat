50|$|A {{powdery mildew}} <b>disease</b> of <b>hops</b> has {{sometimes}} been erroneously called blue mold. It is caused by Sphaerotheca humuli, a fungus in the order Erysiphales. This <b>hops</b> <b>disease</b> became epidemic in the New York state hops industry in 1909, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the crop in the Northeastern USA.|$|R

5000|$|In 1997, hop {{powdery mildew}} was {{reported}} {{for the first time}} in hop yards in the United States Pacific Northwest. In Washington, severe infections lead to a yield loss of 800 hectares (US $10 million) of crops. At the time, sulfur was the only registered pesticide used on hop that was effective against powdery mildew. In 1998, the disease was confirmed in Idaho and Oregon. As a result, Yakima Valley growers managed the disease using approaches developed in Europe, such as, labor-intensive cultural practices, mechanical removal of spring growth, and intensive fungicide programs despite the small number of fungicides available for hop at the time. Although the methods successfully limited disease development, the depressed market for hops couldn't sustain the expensive production costs ($1400/ha annually in 1998). In 2001, a contracting brewery rejected 50% of an aroma hop grown in Oregon because of cone browning after drying, resulting in an additional US $5 million in losses that year. These losses have contributed to economic depression in the hop market and have forced several growers to declare bankruptcy. Currently, hop powdery mildew exists annually in all production regions in the United States. While more research is necessary to understand Podosphaera macualaris and control, the current management system has returned economics to <b>hop</b> industry. <b>Disease</b> levels have decreased and control costs have been reduced to $740/ha on average. Unlike New York and California, hop production in the Pacific Northwest is likely to continue.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Plant Pathology, Washington State UniversityHop stunt viroid (HSVd) {{was first}} {{detected}} in hop orchards in Washington State in 2004. A 2012 survey {{for the presence}} of HSVd, in three major hop growing regions in Washington State indicated an overall incidence of 17. 3 percent. A five year yield study comparing HSVd infected and uninfected hop cultivars ‘Glacier’ and ‘Nugget’ revealed that, of those tested, ‘Nugget’ was the most tolerant hop cultivar to HSVd infection and ‘Glacier’ was the most severely affected. 	In this study, whole genome and RNA sequence analysis identified potential genes associated with expression of <b>hop</b> stunt <b>disease,</b> and identified DNA-markers that distinguish HSVd-tolerant plants from HSVd-sensitive cultivars. Healthy plants and HSVd-infected ‘Glacier’ and ‘Nugget’ revealed different gene expression profiles that suggested that a pathogenesis-related protein, thaumatin like protein (TLP), is a candidate marker for hop stunt viroid sensitivity. 	TLP was observed to be down regulated 2. 6 fold in ‘Glacier’ infected with HSVd compared to HSVd free ‘Glacier’; no change in TLP expression was observed in ‘Nugget’ between HSVd-infected or HSVd-free plants. RNA sequence analyses were confirmed using qRT-PCR for TLP expression levels normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). 	Alignments of the TLP coding sequence (CDS) and the region immediately up-stream of the TLP CDS for each cultivar revealed no sequence variations 100 bp upstream of the TLP CDS which includes the ATG translation start site, TATA box and the transcriptional start site. However, 23 nucleotide variations exist between ‘Glacier’ and ‘Nugget’ in a 397 bp region up stream of the first CAAT cis-regulatory element. (CRE). These variations create eleven unique CRE differences between ‘Glacier’ and ‘Nugget’. Additionally, within the TLP CDS nineteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed in ‘Glacier’ relative to ‘Nugget’. Several of these SNPs result in amino acid substitutions. Four of the SNPs within the ‘Glacier’ TLP CDS result in amino acid substitutions that were not observed in five other cultivars of hop. In total, 42 SNPs were identified that potentially may be used in marker assisted breeding programs to distinguish potential HSVd-tolerant plants from HSVd-sensitive plants. Evaluation of additional hop genotypes will be necessary to confirm this relationship. Plant Pathology, Washington State Universit...|$|R
40|$|Although the zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP- 70) is overexpressed in {{patients}} with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) displaying unmutated IGVH genes and poor prognosis, a previous microarray study from our group identified overexpression of LPL and ADAM 29 genes among unmutated and mutated CLL, respectively. To assess the prognostic value of these genes, we quantified their expression by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a cohort of 127 patients with CLL and correlated this with clinical outcome, IGVH mutational status, and ZAP- 70 protein expression. IGVH mutational status, ZAP- 70, and the LPL and ADAM 29 mRNA ratios (L/A ratio) were predictive of event-free survival for the whole cohort and for patients with stage A disease. {{in patients}} in stage B and C, the L/A ratio was an independent prognostic factor, whereas ZAP- 70 did not predict survival. Simultaneous usage of the L/A ratio and ZAP- 70 expression allowed an almost perfect (99 %) assessment of the IGVH status in the 80 % of patients with concordant results (L/A(+), ZAP- 70 (+) or L/A(-), ZAP- 70 (-)). LPL and ADAM 29 gene expression could also be determined by a simple competitive multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay. Overall, quantification of LPL and ADAM 29 gene expression is a strong prognostic indicator in CLL, providing better prognostic assessment than ZAP- 70 in advanced stages of the <b>disease.</b> <b>Hop</b> La Pitie Salpetriere, Serv Hematol Biol, F- 75013 Paris, FranceInst Pasteur, Unite Immunohematol & Immunopathol, F- 75724 Paris, FranceUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, Disciplina Hematol & Hemoterapia, São Paulo, BrazilInst Pasteur, Dept Ecosyst & Epidemiol Malad Infect, Paris, FranceHop La Pitie Salpetriere, Serv Immunol, Paris, FranceInst Pasteur, Ctr Rech Vaccinale & Biomed, Paris, FranceUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, Disciplina Hematol & Hemoterapia, São Paulo, BrazilWeb of Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Organic farmers {{rely heavily}} on crop rota-tions, crop residues, animal manures, legumes, green manures, composts, and mineral-bearing rock powders to feed the soil and supply plant nutrients. Insects, weeds, and other pests are managed by {{mechanical}} cultivation and cultural, biolog-ical, and biorational controls. Synthetic pes-ticides, growth regulators, and conventional fertilizers are prohibited. See the publica-tion NCAT’s Organic Crops Workbook and publications in ATTRA’s Organic Series at www. attra. ncat. org. While {{in the past the}} center of U. S. hops pro-duction was in the Pacific Northwest, mainly under contract with a few major breweries, now dried hops are easily imported {{from around the world to}} supply an essential ingredient to emerging U. S. microbrewer-ies. However, the price is high, and so is the organic premium. If U. S. production costs work out, a new niche market for organic hops could make U. S. farmers competitive with those in New Zealand. China is also starting to produce organic hops. Hops were first planted in the U. S. in 1629. (1) U. S. hops production was at 1. 5 million pounds by the mid- 1800 s. Due to powdery mildew and other <b>diseases,</b> <b>hops</b> production moved westward during the 1920 s. Currently, most hops are grown on the Pacific Coast, where disease pressure is less than in the humid eastern U. S. Culture The hop of commerce is the female flower, commonly called a cone. Hops are pro-duced on climbing vines from female rhi-zomes planted one to a hill, with four to six vines per plant. Vines are trained on almost vertical strings to a flat overhead trellis. Trellis pole supports need to be at least 12 feet above the ground and no more than 25 feet apart. Hop hills should be about 2 feet apart, allowing 10 hills (of the same variety) per set of poles. Careful choice of location of the hops vineyard will shelter vines from prevailing winds. (2) To produce hops in the proportions com-mon for brewing beer, growers should pla...|$|R
