First, before I begin about trends I’d like to share some experiences during my career as a reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist. I have treated thousands of patients with infertility and other reproductive disorders – young men with very abnormal sperm or with a history of testicular cancer; young women, some of them as young as 17, already in menopause; little girls with onset of puberty at 6 or 8 yrs old; and women with estrogen-dependent disorders, like endometriosis and uterine fibroids that can result in incapacitating pain, lead to compromised fertility and increased risk of miscarriage.

We appreciate {{the work of the}} Commission and the convening of the <b>hearing</b> <b>today</b> on Security and Liberty. You have asked us to provide information that is pertinent to a full consideration of how the government can best ensure security, protect privacy, and utilize technology while identifying potential terrorists. The statement is divided into four parts. In part one, I trace the important developments in privacy law in the United States, focusing in particular on the Privacy Act of 1974 and the federal wiretap law. Both laws reflect significant efforts to safeguard privacy even as the government sought to make use of new techniques for creating databases and monitoring private communications. In part two, I look at the concept of Privacy Enhancing Techniques, as the term was generally understood before 9 - 11. My central point is that privacy techniques did not generally arise in the context of larger proposals for surveillance. In the few cases where they did, there was significant public opposition.

(2) Will DTS correct the problems related to DOD travel previously identified by GAO and others? and (3) What challenges remain in ensuring that DTS achieves its goal as DOD's standard travel system? In addition, the Subcommittee asked that GAO provide a description of the intellectual property rights of DOD in DTS. Subsequent to this testimony, GAO plans to issue a report that will include recommendations to the Secretary of Defense aimed at improving the department's implementation of DTS. ...|$|E
