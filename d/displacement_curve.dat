The test material primarily used was paper pulp which forms highly heterogeneous filter cakes where the local values of, for example, porosity may be assumed to differ substantially from the average values. The experimental equipment used was a piston filter press equipped with a γ-radiation source and a scintillation detector {{that was used to}} measure concentrations of different species inside the filter cake at different bed heights. In these experiments, Cs+ ions were used as the tracer compound for studying displacement washing. The filtrate was also collected and, from the <b>displacement</b> <b>curves</b> based on the concentration in the filtrate, the dispersion coefficients and the Peclet number could be determined; these values were used to calculate local <b>displacement</b> <b>curves.</b> The calculated local <b>displacement</b> <b>curves</b> agreed well with the measured local <b>displacement</b> <b>curves</b> showing that local measurement of the dispersion coefficient is a very valuable tool for studying the washing of filter cakes...|$|R

30|$|A {{numerical}} model of generator unit # 4 with main power house, transformer chamber and tailrace surge chamber {{has been established}} and a transverse isotropic constitutive model and a splitting failure criterion are simultaneously employed to calculate the splitting zone of the surrounding rock masses. The maximum depth of the splitting area of the downstream sidewall of the main power house by calculation is approximately 14.8  m and the average of that of the upstream sidewall of the transformer chamber is approximately 6.8  m, which are similar with the monitoring values. By comparing the calculated and actually monitored <b>displacement</b> <b>curve,</b> {{it can be concluded}} that the <b>displacement</b> <b>curve</b> calculated with transverse isotropic constitutive model is more consistent with the actual field monitoring curve.

40|$|IntroductionThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if a synthetic bone substitute would provide results similar to bone from osteoporotic femoral heads during in vitro testing with orthopaedic implants. If the synthetic material could produce results similar to those of the osteoporotic bone, it could reduce or eliminate the need for testing of implants on bone. MethodsPushout studies were performed with the dynamic hip screw (DHS) and the DHS Blade in both cadaveric femoral heads and artificial bone substitutes in the form of polyurethane foam blocks of different density. The pushout studies were performed as a means of comparing the force <b>displacement</b> <b>curves</b> produced by each implant within each material. ResultsThe results demonstrated that test material with a density of 0. 16 g/cm(3) (block A) produced qualitatively similar force <b>displacement</b> <b>curves</b> for the DHS and qualitatively and quantitatively similar force <b>displacement</b> <b>curves</b> for the DHS Blade, whereas the test material with a density of 0. 08 g/cm(3) (block B) did not produce results that were predictive of those recorded within the osteoporotic cadaveric femoral heads. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that synthetic material with a density of 0. 16 g/cm(3) can provide a good substitute for cadaveric osteoporotic femoral heads in the testing of implants. However we do recognise that no synthetic material can be considered as a definitive substitute for bone, therefore studies performed with artificial bone substrates may need to be validated by further testing with a small bone sample in order to produce conclusive results.

40|$|Friction {{plays an}} {{important}} role in high-temperature deformation process. Friction affects local displacement field in the tool-workpiece interface region, thus affecting the overall material flow. Under high-temperature compression, macro-indicators like bulge radius and load <b>displacement</b> <b>curves</b> are not sensitive enough to distinguish subtle differences between various friction models. Hence, a new approach to match the experimental Lagrangian flow field with flow field obtained from FE simulation is proposed. For this uniaxial barreling, compression tests at constant temperature were conducted on Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulator. The compression tests were conducted at different strain, strain rate and friction conditions. Finite element simulations employing various friction models and parameters were performed for matching the experimental conditions. Experimental Lagrangian flow fields were obtained from the grain flow lines observed on high-resolution larger area micrographs of the specimen. It was observed that all the investigated friction models provided equally good fit with the macro-experimental indicators (bulge radius and load <b>displacement</b> <b>curves).</b> However, Coulomb friction model was the only friction model that provided the closest fit with the experimentally obtained Lagrangian flow fields.
