40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} the Stockholm Birth Cohort Study to {{document}} intergenerational associations in drunk driving between fathers and their children. The proportion of sons {{with a record of}} drunk driving is 2. 3 times larger for sons whose <b>fathers</b> <b>have</b> a conviction for drunk driving than for sons whose <b>fathers</b> <b>have</b> not been convicted. For daughters, the proportion is 7. 8 times larger. The average number of convictions is twice as large for sons whose <b>fathers</b> <b>have</b> a conviction for drunk driving than for sons whose <b>fathers</b> <b>have</b> not been convicted. For daughters, the average number of convictions is 15. 3 times larger. We argue that these intergenerational associations in drunk driving have important implications for treatment strategies and public policy. ...|$|R
