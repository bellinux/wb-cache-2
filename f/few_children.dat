5|$|In {{the colonial}} United States {{the nuclear family}} {{was the most common}} family form. Typical {{families}} consisted of five or more children initially; because of high infant mortality rates, only a <b>few</b> <b>children</b> survived adolescence. Colonial families existed to serve six main functions: self-sufficient business, school, vocational institute, church, house of correction, and welfare institution.|$|E

5|$|Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan {{languages}} (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), {{also part}} of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. <b>Few</b> <b>children</b> learn these languages, but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language, which has no proven relationship to Japanese or any other language, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido. Public and private schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well as English language courses.|$|E

Nonetheless, they take great delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.|$|E
5|$|Albert and Victoria {{chose the}} names Louisa Caroline Alberta. She was baptized on 13 May 1848 in Buckingham Palace's private chapel by John Bird Sumner, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Though she was christened Louisa at the service, she was {{invariably}} known as Louise throughout her life. Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her paternal great-great-uncle, for whom Prince Albert stood proxy); the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen (for whom her great-aunt Queen Adelaide stood proxy); and the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her first cousin once-removed, {{for whom the}} Duchess of Cambridge stood proxy). During the ceremony, the Duchess of Gloucester, one of the <b>few</b> <b>children</b> of King George III who was still alive, forgot where she was, and suddenly {{got up in the}} middle of the service and knelt at the Queen's feet, much to the Queen's horror.|$|E
5|$|The Knapps {{study in}} Monroe County, Indiana, found {{time-out}} and {{times to be}} {{by far the most}} prevalent terms in the 1970s. Variations included I've got times and time. Very <b>few</b> <b>children</b> reported the more traditional kings, queens or I've got kings X. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together. Time-out clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of time-out or time as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, {{only a small number of}} respondents reported anything other than time-out and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included pax, safe, base or home-base and freeze with one small area of fins (Mount Vernon). The Knapps reported that time-out had, since the 1950s, supplanted kings ex as the most popular truce term.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{determine}} the influence of pregnancy-related knowledge and the risk perception on reproductive decision making in women with epilepsy. MethodsWe enrolled women with epilepsy, who were of reproductive age and were considering having children in the future. A questionnaire was used to assess the level of pregnancy-related knowledge, perception of the offspring's risk for developing epilepsy or for having a congenial anomaly, and discussion with a physician concerning pregnancy-related issues. We evaluated the following outcome variables: (1) the decision to discontinue anti-epileptic drug (AED) during a future pregnancy regardless of the medical indication; and (2) the decision to have <b>fewer</b> <b>children</b> because of epilepsy. ResultsWe enrolled a total of 186 women with epilepsy. (1) Fifty-eight percent of the women were considering discontinuing AED during a future pregnancy regardless of the medical indication, and 25 % of the women decided to have <b>fewer</b> <b>children</b> because of epilepsy. (2) The decision to discontinue AED during a future pregnancy was associated with low-level pregnancy-related knowledge. (3) The decision to have <b>fewer</b> <b>children</b> because of epilepsy was associated with an exaggerated perception of the offspring's risk for developing epilepsy. (4) The women who had ever discussed pregnancy-related issues with their physician were less likely to decide to discontinue AED during a future pregnancy; however, a discussion on this issue had no impact on their decision to have <b>fewer</b> <b>children</b> because of epilepsy. ConclusionMore than 50 % of the women would decide to discontinue AED during a future pregnancy, and 25 % of the women stated that they would have <b>fewer</b> <b>children</b> because of epilepsy. These data highlight the importance of education on pregnancy-related issues and genetic risk counseling...|$|R
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1900s, formal {{education}} {{was confined to}} a system of religious instruction organized and presented {{under the aegis of the}} Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Church schools prepared individuals for the clergy and for other religious duties and positions. In the process, these schools also provided religious education to the children of the nobility and to the sons of limited numbers of tenant farmers and servants associated with elite families. Such schools mainly served the Amhara and Tigray inhabitants of the Ethiopian highlands. Misguided policies caused very <b>few</b> <b>children</b> to receive an education. As a result, Ethiopia did not meet the Educational standards of other African countries in the early 1900s.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of given names follows trends, with some names being popular in some years, and some considered definitely out-of-fashion. As an example, <b>few</b> <b>children</b> born since 1970 would bear the name Germaine, {{which is generally}} associated {{with the idea of}} an elderly lady. However, as noted above, such old-fashioned names are frequently used as second or third given names, because in France the second or further given names are traditionally those of the godparents or the grandparents. Some older names, such as Suzanne, Violette, and Madeleine, have become fashionable again in the upper class and in the upper middle class. Others such as Jean, Pierre, Louis, and François never really went out of fashion. Alexandre (Alexander) was never very popular, but is not uncommon in middle and upper classes.|$|E
25|$|There were {{children}} in the camp as well. At first, they arrived with mothers who were Romani or Jews incarcerated in the camp or were born to imprisoned women. There were <b>few</b> <b>children</b> early on, including a few Czech children from Lidice in July 1942. Later the {{children in the}} camp represented almost all nations of Europe occupied by Germany. Between April and October 1944 their number increased considerably, consisting of two groups. One group was composed of Romani children with their mothers or sisters brought into the camp after the Romani camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau was closed. The other group included mostly children who were brought with Polish mothers sent to Ravensbrück {{after the collapse of the}} Warsaw Uprising of 1944. With a few exceptions all these children died of starvation.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} adoptions in the United States peaked in 1970. It is {{uncertain}} {{what caused the}} subsequent decline. Likely contributing factors in the 1960s and 1970s include {{a decline in the}} fertility rate, associated with the introduction of the pill, the completion of legalization of artificial birth control methods, the introduction of federal funding to make family planning services available to the young and low income, and the legalization of abortion. In addition, the years of the late 1960s and early 1970s saw a dramatic change in society's view of illegitimacy and in the legal rights of those born outside of wedlock. In response, family preservation efforts grew so that <b>few</b> <b>children</b> born out of wedlock today are adopted. Ironically, adoption is far more visible and discussed in society today, yet it is less common.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{represent}} tries, corresponding to different trade-offs between memory use and speed of the operations. The basic form is that of a linked set of nodes, where each node contains an array of child pointers, one for each symbol in the alphabet (so for the English alphabet, one would store 26 child pointers and for the alphabet of bytes, 256 pointers). This is simple but wasteful in terms of memory: using the alphabet of bytes (size 256) and four-byte pointers, each node requires a kilobyte of storage, and when there is little overlap in the strings' prefixes, the number of required nodes is roughly the combined length of the stored strings. Put another way, the nodes {{near the bottom of the}} tree tend to have <b>few</b> <b>children</b> and there are many of them, so the structure wastes space storing null pointers.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the aspects}} of grammar that Genie did and did not acquire aided {{linguists}} in determining which structures were more dependent on exposure to language. In particular, the auxiliary component of language had been known {{to be one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>children</b> acquire at different rates depending on the amount of speech they heard. Genie's inability to master it supported the idea that its development and that of other similar systems of grammar is more sensitive than vocabulary or more basic grammar, such as word order or recursion, requiring a more conducive language environment to properly develop and having a more specific critical period. Linguists also noted the grammatical skills Genie acquired and used bore striking resemblance to the grammar of pidgin languages and the gesture systems deaf children invent when isolated from other deaf people, which contain certain aspects of language, such as vocabulary, recursion, and word order, but always lack other components such as auxiliary structures.|$|E
