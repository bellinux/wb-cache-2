5|$|Solid xenon {{changes from}} face-centered cubic (fcc) to <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> (hcp) crystal phase under {{pressure}} {{and begins to}} turn metallic at about 140GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. It is completely metallic at 155GPa. When metallized, xenon appears sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies. Such behavior is unusual for a metal and is explained by the relatively small width of the electron bands in that state.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{anomalous}} {{electron configuration}} for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. This was first realised in 1995, {{when it was}} pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the 6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the Fermi level should be <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> like the group 4 elements titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically. The 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration 5f1.|$|E

[...] The c axis of the unit cell is 0.87 nm. Hydrogen atoms occupy octahedral cavities between the layers. [...] The hydrogen layers come in vertically aligned pairs, bracketing the B and C layers and shifted like them. [...] For each hydrogen added the unit cell expands by 1.8 Å3 (0.0018nm3).

In this paper, the mechanical behaviour of a {{titanium alloys}} is modelised {{for the cold}} forming processes. The elasto-plastic constitutive law is decomposed in an anisotropic plastic criterion, an isotropic hardening and a kinematic hardening. Non quadratic criteria have been developed by Cazacu et al. (Orthotropic yield criterion for <b>hexagonal</b> <b>closed</b> <b>packed</b> metals, Int. J. Plasticity 22 (2006) 1171 - 1194), to model the plasticity of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>closed</b> <b>packed</b> materials. The implementation of this model in a finite element software switches between two bases, the equilibrium is calculated in a reference basis and the anisotropy axes define a local basis, updated by the deformation gradient. An identification procedure, based on tensile tests, allows to define all the parameters needed to model the elasto-plastic behaviour. Simulation of cold forming processes (bulging and deep drawing) have been done to validate this model. Numerical results are compared with experimental data, obtained from speckles analysis...|$|R
