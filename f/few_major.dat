40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) patients with limited ability to follow exercise protocols may receive smaller benefits from rehabilitation. The {{association between the}} ability to follow exercise protocols and short-term outcomes of rehabilitation was assessed in COPD patients. As {{a measure of the}} ability to follow exercise protocols, the number of major breaks lasting >or= 1 min was determined in 98 COPD patients during supervised exercise sessions. The benefits from rehabilitation were compared between patients with, on average, more than one and one or <b>fewer</b> <b>major</b> breaks per session. Patients with one or <b>fewer</b> <b>major</b> breaks per session showed significantly greater improvements in exercise capacity (between-groups difference of 38 m for 6 -min walking distance, 22. 1 W for short-time maximum exercise capacity (steep ramp test) and 5. 5 W for maximum exercise capacity). Quality of life also tended to be better in patients with one or <b>fewer</b> <b>major</b> breaks per session, but the differences were nonsignificant (adjusted between-groups difference in Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire total score of 0. 14).

5|$|Because the {{pay-per-view}} {{focused on}} the tournament, <b>few</b> <b>major</b> feuds were highlighted.

The qualifying match between the 1–2–3 Kid and Adam Bomb did, however, help advance a storyline. Bomb and Kwang, both managed by Harvey Wippleman, began feuding shortly after King of the Ring when Wippleman and Kwang turned on Bomb. Bomb began wrestling as a face as a result. Their feud did not end with a major blow off match, however. Instead, it was quietly resolved in a dark match prior to the SummerSlam 1994 broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being one}} of the <b>few</b> <b>major</b> {{thoroughfares}} in Rome able to cope with a high volume of traffic without congestion, it is the subject of much ire both within the Roman community and among historical scholars due to the circumstances under which it was constructed. The area around the church was rebuilt several times following the various Sacks of Rome, and again after having deteriorated due to the loss of prosperity resulting from the Papacy's relocation to Avignon during the 14th century. Through all of these reconstructions, the area in front of the short courtyard of Saint Peter's Basilica remained a maze of densely packed structures overhanging narrow side-streets and alleyways.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is a multisystem disorder that predominately affects {{women of the}} reproductive age. Onset of the disease beyond the age of 50  years is unusual. This study was undertaken to compare retrospectively the clinical and laboratory features between early and late onset (onset of disease beyond the age of 50  years) SLE patients in a Chinese population.  METHODS—Case records of all SLE patients who attended our rheumatology clinics between 1971  and 1997  were reviewed. Patients with a disease onset beyond the age of 50  years were identified. One hundred consecutive SLE patients who had their disease onset {{before the age of}} 50  were recruited as controls. The presenting clinical features, autoantibody profile, number of major organs involved, number of major relapses, and the use of cytotoxic agents in the two groups of patients were obtained and compared.  RESULTS— 25 patients with late onset SLE were identified. All the female patients in the late onset group were postmenopausal. The female to male ratio was 3. 2  to 1, compared with 13. 3  to 1  in the control group (p< 0. 02). Both groups had a comparable duration of disease. There {{were no significant differences in}} the presenting features between the two groups except for a lower prevalence of malar rash (24 % v 86 %, p< 0. 0001) and a higher prevalence of rheumatoid factor (32 % v 1 %, p< 0. 0001) in the late onset patients. On subsequent visits, the late onset group had a lower prevalence of lupus nephritis (4 % v 51 %, p< 0. 001), <b>fewer</b> <b>major</b> organs involved (mean number of major organs involved; 0. 3  v 0. 9, p< 0. 02), <b>fewer</b> <b>major</b> relapses (mean number of major relapses/patient; 0. 08  v 0. 47, p< 0. 002, number of major relapses/patient year; 0. 009  v 0. 12, p< 0. 001), and required fewer cytotoxic agents for disease control (percentage of patients on cytotoxic agents; 32 % v 79 %, p< 0. 002).  CONCLUSION—Late onset SLE in Chinese tends to run a more benign course with <b>fewer</b> <b>major</b> organ involvement and <b>fewer</b> <b>major</b> relapses. The significantly higher incidence of male sex in late onset SLE and the milder disease course in the postmenopausal female patients suggest that oestrogen status may influence disease activity.    Keywords: systemic {{lupus erythematosus}}; southern Chinese; Asian...|$|R

5|$|In {{spite of}} the <b>few</b> <b>major</b> operations, {{the first decade of}} the boom was {{dominated}} by numerous small producers. As production expanded and new companies were formed, consolidation occurred. By the late 1920s, ten companies produced more than half of the oil in the state: Gulf Production Company, Humble Oil and Refining Company, Southern Crude Oil Purchasing Company (later absorbed by Amoco which was later absorbed by BP), the Texas Company, Shell Petroleum Corporation, Yount-Lee Oil Company, Magnolia Petroleum Company, J. K. Hughes Oil Company, Pure Oil Company, and Mid-Kansas Oil and Gas Company (later Marathon Oil).|$|E
5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a <b>few</b> <b>major</b> finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s.

5|$|Proxy records {{based on}} paleotempestological {{research}} {{have revealed that}} major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia. <b>Few</b> <b>major</b> hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times. This millennial-scale variability {{has been attributed to}} long-term shifts in the position of the Azores High, which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation.|$|E

During the construction of the Circle Line on 20 April 2004, a tunnel being constructed under Nicoll Highway collapsed and led to the deaths of four people. Disruptions to the system of late, the cause of which often being cited by a lack of maintenance coupled with increased ridership due to population growth, have also raised concerns among the public.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} weak nature of the storm, impact was generally minor. Rip currents in Alabama and Florida led to five fatalities. The sixth death from the storm was also related to rough seas and occurred {{near the mouth of}} the Mississippi River in Louisiana. Storm surge and high tides also caused coastal flooding in the state, especially in Cameron Parish. Relatively strong winds left more than 2,000without electricity and damaged trees and the roofs of mobile homes. Storm surge caused coastal flooding in eastern Texas, particularly in the Gilchrist area. At least 25homes sustained damage, while portions of a <b>few</b> <b>major</b> roads, such as Interstate 10, were closed. Minor inland flooding occurred due to heavy rainfall, with a portion of Texas State Highway 36 being temporarily shutdown. Strong winds in the region damaged hundreds of homes, downed trees, and left about 300,000people without electricity. Overall, damage from Tropical Storm Edouard totaled slightly more than $550,000 (2008USD).|$|E
