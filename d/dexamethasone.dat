5|$|In October 2014, {{local media}} {{reported}} that the Badminton Association of Malaysia confirmed {{that one of the}} nation's top shuttlers tested positive for <b>dexamethasone</b> after urine samples were taken during the World Championships in late August. The identity of the shuttler was not revealed but was widely believed to be Lee Chong Wei. Dexamathasone is not a performance-enhancing drug but a commonly-administered anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that is not illegal when used off-season for injury rehabilitation, but deemed illegal if discovered in an athlete's body during competition.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for acute adrenal {{insufficiency}} requires the administration of intravenous saline or dextrose solution; volumes of over two liters may be required in an adult. This {{is followed by the}} administration of hydrocortisone, which is pharmaceutical grade cortisol, intravenously or into a muscle. The drug <b>dexamethasone</b> has similar properties, but its use is not recommended unless it is required to reduce swelling in the brain around the area of hemorrhage. Some are well enough not to require immediate cortisol replacement; in this case, blood levels of cortisol are determined at 9:00AM (as cortisol levels vary over the day). A level below 550nmol/l indicates a need for replacement.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} cancers {{in the brain}} come from {{elsewhere}} in the body – most commonly the lung, breast and skin. Cancers of brain tissue can also occur, and originate from any tissue {{in and around the}} brain. Meningioma, cancer of the meninges around the brain, is more common than cancers of brain tissue. Cancers within the brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position, with symptoms including headache and nausea, or the gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing, swallowing, talking, or as a change of mood. Cancers are in general investigated through the use of CT scans and MRI scans. A variety of other tests including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for the cause of the cancer and evaluate the type and stage of the cancer. The corticosteroid <b>dexamethasone</b> is often given to decrease the swelling of brain tissue around a tumour. Surgery may be considered, however given the complex nature of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{incidence}} of {{the adverse effects}} of <b>dexamethasone</b> are not available, hence estimates have been made as to the {{incidence of}} the adverse effects below based on the adverse effects of related corticosteroids and on available documentation on <b>dexamethasone.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{synthesize}} <b>dexamethasone,</b> 16β-methylprednisolone acetate is dehydrated to the 9,11-dehydro derivative. This is then {{reacted with}} {{a source of}} hypobromite, such as basic N-bromosuccinimide, to form the 9α-bromo-11β-hydrin derivative, which is then ring-closed to an epoxide. A ring-opening reaction with hydrogen fluoride in tetrahydrofuran gives <b>dexamethasone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nausea and vomiting: {{cisplatin}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} emetogenic chemotherapy agents, but this symptom is managed with prophylactic antiemetics (ondansetron, granisetron, etc.) in combination with corticosteroids. Aprepitant combined with ondansetron and <b>dexamethasone</b> has been shown to be better for highly emetogenic chemotherapy than just ondansetron and <b>dexamethasone.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> is {{also used}} as a direct {{chemotherapeutic}} agent in certain haematological malignancies, especially {{in the treatment of}} multiple myeloma, in which <b>dexamethasone</b> is given alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, including most commonly with thalidomide (Thal-dex), lenalidomide, bortezomib (Velcade, Vel-dex), or a combination of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and vincristine or bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> is the {{treatment}} for the very rare disorder of glucocorticoid resistance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> is used {{to treat}} many {{inflammatory}} and autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and bronchospasm. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a decrease in numbers of platelets due to an immune problem, responds to 40mg daily for four days; it may be administered in 14-day cycles. It is unclear whether <b>dexamethasone</b> in this condition is significantly better than other glucocorticoids.|$|E
25|$|As a {{glucocorticoid}}, <b>dexamethasone</b> is an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).|$|E
25|$|A {{single dose}} of the {{corticosteroid}} drug <b>dexamethasone</b> may be given during surgery to prevent post-operative vomiting. A systematic review found that a dose of <b>dexamethasone</b> during surgery can prevent vomiting in {{one out of every}} five children who receives the drug. The review also found that these children return to a normal diet more quickly and have less post-operative pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> and {{ondansetron}} {{are more}} effective than ondansetron alone in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> {{and other}} {{corticosteroids}} are agonists, and mifepristone and ketoconazole are antagonists of the GR.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> {{is given}} prior to {{beginning}} paclitaxel treatment to mitigate {{some of the}} side effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{usefulness}} of corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone or <b>dexamethasone)</b> {{in the treatment}} of TB is proven for TB meningitis and TB pericarditis. The dose for TB meningitis is <b>dexamethasone</b> 8 to 12mg daily tapered off over six weeks (for those who prefer more precise dosing should refer to Thwaites et al., 2004). The dose for pericarditis is prednisolone 60mg daily tapered off over four to eight weeks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> {{was first}} made in 1957. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Dexamethasone</b> is not expensive. In the United States a month of medication typically costs less than 25 USD. In India a course of treatment for preterm labor is about 0.5 USD. It is available in most areas of the world.|$|E
25|$|Inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes such as barbiturates, phenytoin, and {{rifampicin}} {{can reduce}} the half-life of <b>dexamethasone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Steroids (such as <b>dexamethasone)</b> may {{be useful}} for severe pharyngitis. Their general use however is poorly supported.|$|E
25|$|Two open-label, phase II trials (SUMMIT and CREST) {{established}} {{the efficacy of}} bortezomib 1.3mg/m2 (with or without <b>dexamethasone)</b> administered by intravenous bolus on days 1,4,8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle for a maximum of eight cycles in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The phase III APEX trial demonstrated the superiority of bortezomib 1.3mg/m2 over a high-dose <b>dexamethasone</b> regimen (e.g. median TTP 6.2 vs 3.5 months, and 1-year survival 80% vs 66%).|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> is a {{synthetic}} pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisol (hydrocortisone) {{and is also}} known as 1-dehydro-9α-fluoro-16α-methylhydrocortisone or as 9α-fluoro-11β,17α,21-trihydroxy-16α-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione.|$|E
25|$|In adrenal {{insufficiency}} and Addison's disease, <b>dexamethasone</b> is prescribed {{when the patient}} does not respond well to prednisone or methylprednisolone.|$|E
25|$|People {{with cancer}} {{undergoing}} chemotherapy are often given <b>dexamethasone</b> to counteract certain {{side effects of}} their antitumor treatments. <b>Dexamethasone</b> can increase the antiemetic effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron. The exact mechanism of this interaction is not well-defined, {{but it has been}} theorized that this effect may be due to, among many other causes, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, anti-inflammatory effects, immunosuppressive effects, decreased release of endogenous opioids, or a combination of the aforementioned.|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} use of <b>dexamethasone</b> {{may result in}} thrush, bone loss, cataracts, easy bruising, or muscle weakness. It is pregnancy category C in the United States meaning use {{should be based on}} benefits being predicted to be greater than risks. In Australia, it is category A, meaning it has been frequently used in pregnancy and not been found to cause problems to the baby. It should not be taken when breastfeeding. <b>Dexamethasone</b> has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects.|$|E
25|$|At present no program screens {{for risk}} in {{families}} {{who have not yet}} had a child with CAH. For families desiring to avoid virilization of a second child, the current strategy is to start <b>dexamethasone</b> as soon as a pregnancy has been confirmed even though at that point the chance that the pregnancy is a girl with CAH is only 12.5%. <b>Dexamethasone</b> is taken by the mother each day until it can be safely determined whether she is carrying an affected girl.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{the fetus}} is an {{affected}} girl {{can be determined}} by chorionic villus sampling at 9–11 weeks of gestation, or by amniocentesis at 15–18 weeks gestation. In each case the fetal sex can be determined quickly, and if the fetus is a male the <b>dexamethasone</b> can be discontinued. If female, fetal DNA is analyzed {{to see if she}} carries one of the known abnormal alleles of the CYP21 gene. If so, <b>dexamethasone</b> is continued {{for the remainder of the}} pregnancy at a dose of about 1mg daily.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> is {{commonly}} given {{as a treatment}} for croup in children, as a single dose can reduce the swelling of the airway to improve breathing and reduce discomfort.|$|E
25|$|Rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and {{phenobarbital}} {{increase the}} metabolism of diazepam, thus decreasing drug levels and effects. <b>Dexamethasone</b> and St John's wort {{also increase the}} metabolism of diazepam.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> {{is given}} in legal Bangladeshi brothels to prostitutes not yet of legal age, causing weight gain aimed at making them appear {{healthier}} and older to customers and police.|$|E
25|$|The {{first problem}} {{has not yet}} been entirely solved, but {{it has been shown that}} if <b>dexamethasone</b> is taken by a {{pregnant}} woman, enough can cross the placenta to suppress fetal adrenal function.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> {{is a type}} of {{corticosteroid}} medication. It is used in {{the treatment}} of many conditions, including rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, croup, brain swelling, and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis. In adrenocortical insufficiency, it should be used together with a medication that has greater mineralocorticoid effects such as fludrocortisone. In preterm labor, it may be used to improve outcomes in the baby. It may be taken by mouth, as an injection into a muscle, or intravenously. The effects of <b>dexamethasone</b> are frequently seen within a day and last for about three days.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 it was {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of MM along with <b>dexamethasone</b> and in 2007 by European Medicines Agency (EMA). In 2008, phase II trial observed efficacy in treating Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide {{is used as}} a {{first line}} {{treatment}} in multiple myeloma in combination with <b>dexamethasone</b> or with melphalan and prednisone, to treat acute episodes of erythema nodosum leprosum and for maintenance therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), as well as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). It is commonly carried on mountain-climbing expeditions to help climbers deal with complications of altitude sickness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dexamethasone</b> may {{be given}} to women at risk of {{delivering}} prematurely to promote maturation of the fetus' lungs. This {{has been associated with}} low birth weight, although not with increased rates of neonatal death.|$|E
25|$|After further {{work was}} done by Celgene and others, in 2006 the U.S.Food and Drug Administration granted {{accelerated}} approval for thalidomide in combination with <b>dexamethasone</b> {{for the treatment of}} newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients.|$|E
