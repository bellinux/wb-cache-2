5|$|The Wii's success caught {{third-party}} developers by surprise, {{leading to}} apologies {{for the quality}} of their early games. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Ubisoft's Yves Guillemot and Alain Corre admitted that they made a mistake in rushing out their launch titles, promising to take future projects more seriously. Take-Two Interactive, which released few games for the Nintendo GameCube, changed its stance towards Nintendo by placing a <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> on the Wii.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, however, he was engaged to write The Smugglers, which he was told should take a <b>higher</b> <b>priority.</b> “The Nazis” was ultimately abandoned on June 15, 1966, with the sentiment being that the events it portrayed were {{too close to the}} present day.|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} in data {{transmissions}} that some information {{is more important than}} others. This is especially true in space communications where mission critical information or science data are <b>high</b> <b>priority.</b> In this work, we propose a simple yet constructive scheme to send <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> data reliably and efficiently using Luby Transform (LT) codes. The new proposed scheme modifies the conventional LT encoder to send <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> data as a degree 1 and 2 so that <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> data can be quickly resolved and very likely recovered before a decoder stops. Preliminary results show that a carefully designed degree distribution of <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> data increases the likelihood of receiving <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> information while having negligible performance impact on data with lower priority. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated and compared with the conventional LT approach with the same parameters under a range of erasure error rates...|$|R
5|$|In {{alternative}} fashion, the (S) and (R) designators {{are used}} to indicate the absolute stereochemistry. Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are (S) at the α carbon, with cysteine being (R) and glycine non-chiral. Cysteine has its side chain in the same geometric position as the other amino acids, but the R/S terminology is reversed because of the higher atomic number of sulfur compared to the carboxyl oxygen gives the side chain a <b>higher</b> <b>priority,</b> whereas the atoms in most other side chains give them lower priority.|$|E
5|$|The Dallachy Wing was {{on alert}} to attack any ships {{found by the}} {{reconnaissance}} patrol. Although the group of five merchant ships were highly vulnerable to attack and a worthwhile target, Coastal Command came under the operational command of the Admiralty and was bound by its decision to give <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> to attacking warships than merchant vessels. As a result, the wing was dispatched against Z33 even though the destroyer and its escorts were well protected and {{in a difficult position}} for aircraft to attack.|$|E
5|$|Colorado held several {{meetings}} to convince reluctant Utah officials they {{would benefit from}} a freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City. Utah officials expressed concerns that, given the terrain between these cities, this link {{would be difficult to}} build. They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a <b>higher</b> <b>priority.</b> Colorado officials persisted, presenting three alternatives to route I-70 west of Denver, using the corridors of US40, US6 and a route starting at Pueblo, proceeding west along US50/US285/US24. In March 1955, Colorado officials succeeded in convincing Utah officials with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver. The two states jointly issued a proposal to the U.S. Congress that would extend the plans for I-70 along the US6 corridor. Under this proposal the freeway would terminate at I-15 near Spanish Fork, Utah, linking the Front Range and Wasatch Front metropolitan areas.|$|E

40|$|Consider {{a single}} server retrial {{queueing}} system with second optional service under pre-emptive priority service {{in which two}} types of customers arrive in a Poisson process with arrival rate λ 1 for low priority customers and λ 2 for <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers. In this model the server provides two types of services (i. e) Essential Service and Second Optional Service. The essential service will be given first to both low <b>priority</b> and <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers. This second optional service will be extended to only <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers if they demand. The service times of essential service follow an exponential distribution with parameters µ 1 and µ 2 for both low and <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers respectively. The service time of second optional service for <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers follows an exponential distribution with parameter µ 3. The retrial is introduced for low priority customers only. Let K be {{the maximum number of}} waiting spaces for <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers in front of the service station. The <b>high</b> <b>priorities</b> customers will be governed by the Pre-emptive priority service. The access from orbit to the service facility is governed by the classical retrial policy. This model is solved by using Matrix geometric Technique. Numerical study have been done for Analysis of Mean number of low priority customers in the orbit (MNCO), Mean number of <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers in the queue(MPQL),Truncation level (OCUT),Probability of server free and Probabilities of server busy with low, <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers and second optional service with <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers for various values of λ 1, λ 2, µ 1, µ 2, µ 3, σ and k in elaborate manner and also various particular cases of this model have been discussed.

5|$|The Tu-70 was {{completed}} in October 1946, but did not make its first flight until 27 November. It began manufacturer's trials in October, but an engine fire on the fourth flight caused it to make a crash-landing. This was traced to a design defect in the American-built supercharger-control system, but identifying the problem and fixing it prolonged the manufacturer's trials through October 1947. It was redesignated as the Tu-70 when it went through the State acceptance trials which ended on 14 December. It met all the design goals, but was not accepted for production as all the factories were already committed to building aircraft with a <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> and Aeroflot had no requirement for the type, being fully satisfied with its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 airliners.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} calm for Pagan {{ended in the}} early 1270s. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought {{to cut off the}} retreat of Song {{refugees}} in all directions. In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols.|$|E
5|$|Charles's {{cautious}} {{failure to}} directly assault the town, putting a <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> on minimising losses than on victory, had cost the Royalists dearly; while claims for their {{number of dead}} and wounded men ranged from 1,000 to 1,500, only around 50 people inside the city were killed. Essex's force, on the other hand, was in relatively good shape; its one issue {{was the lack of}} supplies. If he stayed in the Severn Valley, Essex would be unable to get reinforcements or outside aid, the London elements of the army would demand to go home, and the one remaining significant Parliamentarian force would find itself pinned down, while Charles, with secure bases at Oxford and Bristol, would be able to starve them into surrender while other Royalist armies ran rampant through Britain. Because of this, Essex {{had no choice but to}} try to return to London. Travelling back across the Cotswolds, as he had done to reach Gloucester initially, would expose the Parliamentarians to Charles's cavalry on open ground.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} avoid delays, {{software}} developers try to develop software incrementally by implementing requirements of <b>highest</b> <b>priority.</b> <b>Highest</b> <b>priority</b> requirements are such that they are preferred most by all the stakeholders, and stakeholders will get maximum benefits {{with the implementation of}} a <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> subset of set of thousands of requirements. Effective prioritization of requirements will depend on the quality of stakeholders involved and effectiveness in creating win-win situation among them. Thus, for the education sector, to take advantages of various software’s, the software should be of high quality delivered, well in time implementing <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> requirements.|$|R

5|$|The fort was {{designed}} to stop traffic on the river, not to withstand large-scale infantry assaults that armies would use during the war. Construction began in mid-June, using men from the 10th Tennessee Infantry and slaves. The first cannon was test fired on July 12, 1861. After this flurry of activity, the remainder of 1861 saw little action because forts on the Mississippi River had a <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> for receiving men and artillery. General Polk also neglected Forts Henry and Donelson in favor of defending Columbus, Kentucky. In late December, additional men from the 27th Alabama Infantry arrived along with 500 slaves to construct a small fortification across the river on Stewart's Hill, within artillery range of Fort Henry, and named it Fort Heiman. In January 1862, Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman assumed command of both Forts Henry and Donelson, with a combined force of 4,900 men. At Fort Henry, approximately 3,0003,400 men in two brigades were commanded by Colonels Adolphus Heiman and Joseph Drake. The men were armed primarily with antique flintlock rifles from the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 Rapid Rail Study {{assumed that}} {{ridership}} would increase {{in direct proportion}} to improving travel times. The study concluded that {{in order to meet the}} five goals presented in the 20-Year Strategic Plan of 1997, Caltrain should first rehabilitate and enhance the line, then electrify it. By itself, electrification was not projected to significantly improve service, and the high estimated cost of electrification and its lower priority meant electrification would be deferred. Some of the money to accomplish the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing track came from funds that had been intended for the downtown extension. Steve Schmidt, a councilman from Menlo Park, argued that electrification instead should be the top priority to make the rail line more palatable to neighbors, citing improvements in noise and pollution. Other advocates for electrification of Caltrain noted the $1.2billion BART extension to San Francisco International Airport may have revived the decades-old dream of BART around the Bay, which would render an electrified Caltrain redundant. The electrification of Caltrain was assigned a <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> than a future expansion of the system, which included proposals to bring service to Union City across the Dumbarton Rail Bridge and increased service to Gilroy. Under the latest proposal to revive rail service over the Dumbarton Rail Corridor, diesel multiple units would first be used to establish Dumbarton Rail service as a rail shuttle between a new rail station in Newark and Caltrain's Redwood City station, later extending service from Newark to Union City, and finally followed by a commuter rail operation running from Union City to San Francisco and San Jose using EMUs.|$|E

40|$|Initial {{detection}} of plant pests (includes diseases) is often {{made by the}} growers and consultants that work directly with crops; this form of detection {{is referred to as}} general surveillance. General surveillance activities have an important role in plant biosecurity for the early {{detection of}} pests and for demonstrating area freedom. In the Western Australian grains industry, reports of suspect <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> pests to the state Department of Agriculture and Food is the main form of general surveillance. There is little information on the level of knowledge of <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> pests in the grains industry in Western Australia and the ability of members to detect <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> pests if they were present. This study details a survey of members of the grains industry to determine their knowledge of the signs of <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> grains pests and the likelihood that they would detect a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> pest if it were present in grain or crops. Knowledge of the signs of the <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> grain diseases, Karnal bunt and Barley stripe rust, were found to be higher than those of the <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> insect pests, Khapra beetle and Russian wheat aphid. A wide range of responses was collected from respondents' self-rated likelihood of detecting each of these pests and diseases in crop or harvested grain. However, respondents were more confident in their ability to detect the two plant diseases than the two insect pests. The {{results of this study suggest}} that further training in recognition of the signs and symptoms of <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> grains pests is required to increase the ability of members of the grains industry to confidently detect and differentiate <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> pests from common pests in the course of routine activitie...|$|R

40|$|A {{wireless}} ad-hoc {{network is}} a self-organized wireless network without fixed or backbone infrastructure. All nodes have routing capability and use peer-to-peer packet transmission or forward packets to other node using multi hop communication.
