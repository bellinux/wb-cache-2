40|$|In {{order to}} verify the {{properties}} of the light propagating through a gradient-index (GRIN) <b>fibre</b> <b>probe</b> for optical coherence tomography (OCT), numerical simulation using the optical software GLAD is carried out. Firstly, the model of the GRIN <b>fibre</b> <b>probe</b> is presented, which is consisted of a single mode fibre (SMF), a no-core fibre (NCF), a GRIN fibre lens and an air path. Then, the software GLAD is adopted to numerically investigate how the lengths of the NCF and the GRIN fibre lens influence the performance of the Gaussian beam focusing through the GRIN <b>fibre</b> <b>probe.</b> The simulation results are well consistent with the experimental ones, showing that the GLAD based numerical simulation technique is an intuitive and effective tool for the verification of {{the properties of the}} light propagation. In this paper, we find that on the conditions of a constant GRIN fibre lens length of 0. 1 mm and an NCF length of 0. 36 mm, the working distance of the probe will be 0. 75 mm and the focus spot size is 32 3 ̆bcm. 9 2011 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

40|$|For the {{operation}} of high void fraction bubbly flows in bubble columns, insight in primary parameters such as bubble size, shape and velocity as well as gas volume fraction is essential. At high gas volume fractions the flow system becomes opaque, ruling out non-intrusive optical techniques. As an alternative optical fibre probes can be used, which {{have the advantage of}} low cost, simplicity of setup and easy interpretation of the results. By using four-point optical <b>fibre</b> <b>probe,</b> properties of bubbles can be studied, such as bubble velocity, bubble size, etc. However, the effect of bubble wobbling behaviour and physical properties of liquids on the accuracy of the velocity measurements has not been investigated in detail.

40|$|In {{this project}} {{experiments}} were performed and models {{were developed to}} describe the hydrodynamics and phase distribution in tall air-water bubble columns without liquid throughput. The experiments were performed in a two meters high, 23 cm internal diameter column with a porous plate air distributor. The superficial gas velocity varied between 1 and 9 cm/s, covering both homogeneous bubble flow and turbulent bubble flow. Three techniques of measuring the time averaged gas fraction are compared: using a glass <b>fibre</b> <b>probe,</b> pressure transducers, and the bed expansion technique. The glass <b>fibre</b> <b>probe</b> {{is also used to}} measure radial gas fraction distributions about 115 cm above the air distributor, at several superficial gas velocities. The glass <b>fibre</b> <b>probe</b> appeared to suffer from a serious anisotropy. Two methods to correct for this anisotropy are discussed. This results in far more uniform gas fraction distributions than measured by other researchers, who did not correct the anisotropy. Various models regarding the flow in bubble columns are presented. A Reynolds number criterion is suggested to predict the transition from homogeneous to turbulent bubble flow. Another model predicts the radial non-uniformity of the gas fraction distribution. It assumes the presence of a radial pressure gradient due to the centrifugal force of turbulent liquid velocity fluctuations. A momentum balance method based on the model of Geary and Rice (1992) is used to calculate liquid recirculation velocities. The structure and time-dependent behaviour of gas fraction fluctuations are examined by analysing the signals from one or two glass fibre probes with correlation techniques. A stochastic model is presented to describe the structures of these fluctuations. This model takes into account the characteristic properties of these structures such as their size, intensity, velocity, and lifetime. The values of these properties are estimated by fitting the measured covariance functions of the glass <b>fibre</b> <b>probe</b> signals to the model predictions. These fluctuations are also examined by analysing signals from pressure transducers mounted flush with the column wall. These pressure fluctuations are compared to the predictions of the gas fraction fluctuation model. However, they seem to originate from more than one effect.

40|$|For {{long-term}} in-situ {{monitoring of}} colloidal dispersions {{there are numerous}} challenges associated with the design and construction of the <b>fibre</b> optic <b>probe</b> for the spectrometer. These challenges involve the fouling of the probe which causes the overall light intensity emitted and collected to reduce over time, maintaining the position of individual <b>fibres</b> within the <b>probe</b> as the probe is moved and providing real-time control reference measurements for calibration of the probe.

40|$|In {{this paper}} results of {{measurements}} of the local and time-dependent behaviour of the two-phase flow; in a bubble column are presented. Measurements with Laser Doppler Anemometry. (LDA) and with glass <b>fibre</b> <b>probes</b> were performed in two homogeneously aerated air/water bubble columns of 15 and of 23 cm dia. These measurements show that considering the flow field as stationary considerably underestimates the velocities present.

LDA measurements showed that these swarms have typical velocities and that at different radial positions. different typical velocities are dominant. The measurements performed with sets of glass <b>fibre</b> <b>probes</b> show that these swarms are typically of the order of the column diameter. indicating that dispersive transport in the axial direction is limited to a distance of approximately the column diameter. Axial dispersion in a bubble column is thus regarded as transport with a typical velocity over a typical distance.

This method enabled fast reconstruction (12 frames per second) using a GPU.

Hydrodynamics and micro flow structure were experimentally studied in a CTFB (3. 6 m high and 0. 104 m id) using 76 µm FCC particle with air velocities of 0. 5 ~ 5. 0 m/s and solids circulation rates of 0 ~ 420 kg/m 2 s The distributions of solids holdup were acquired using optical <b>fibre</b> <b>probes</b> and pressure transducers at sampling frequencies of 50 kHz × 131 s and 1 kHz × 400 s respectively. A Pseudo Bubble-Free Fluidized Bed {{was developed to}} dynamically calibrate the optical <b>fibre</b> <b>probes.</b> Based on statistical parameters, a Moment Consistency Data Processing Method (MCDPM) was proposed to calculate solids holdups of the dense and dilute phases from the experimental data. A Divided Phase Cross-Correlation Method (DPCCM) was adopted in cross-correlating the solids holdup signals of the dense and dilute phases to obtain the phase particle velocities. MCDPM provided average solids holdups of the dense and dilute phases and the phase fractions over bubbling (BFB), turbulent (TFB), circulating turbulent (CTFB), high density circulating (HDCFB) and circulating (CFB) fluidized beds. The flow structure in terms of phase division and the micro flow characteristics were studied across all five regimes from low to high velocities, CTFB {{was found to have}} strong similarities with TFB. Study on the detailed hydrodynamics and transition characteristics of the CTFB demonstrated that solids holdup distribution in CTFB was more homogeneous both axially and radially than that of other regimes, and the local solids flux and the local particle velocity were both proportional to the solids circulation rate. Microscopically, CTFB was characterized by dilute phase dominating flow in the centre and dense phase dominating flow in the annular region. Such flow structure was different from either dense phase dominating flow in BFB or dilute phase dominating flow in CFB. New criteria for the transition air velocities were proposed for CTFB.

40|$|The {{gas-lift}} technique uses {{gas injection}} in vertical oil wells {{to decrease the}} gravitational pressure drop. The decreased pressure in the production pipe results in an increase of the pressure drop from the reservoir to the oil well and enhances the oil production. In this thesis we investigated {{the influence of the}} bubble size and initial concentration distribution on the gas-lift technique efficiency. A vertical upward bubbly pipe flow of air and water is used, with a height of 18 m and a diameter of 72 mm. The flow velocity conditions investigated in the experiments were representative of practical gas-lift circumstances. Different bubble injectors were tested in order to vary the size and initial concentration distribution of the bubbles. The influence of the initial concentration distribution was limited. The effect of bubble size, on the contrary, was significant. It was due to three contributions: the effect of the bubble size on the flow pattern changes, on the radial distribution (of void fraction and of gas and liquid velocity) and on the relative velocity between the gas and the liquid. To study separately these different contributions associated with bubble size changes we developed and used local measurement techniques. We investigated the possibility of Laser-Doppler Anemometry (LDA) measurements in bubbly flows. These tests were conducted in two different experimental configurations, corresponding to a stirred vessel and a pipe flow. To determine the size and the velocity of the bubbles a four-point optical <b>fibre</b> <b>probe</b> was validated and used. We also developed a method for estimating the bubble shape and orientation based on the time series provided by the four-point optical <b>fibre</b> <b>probe.</b> This method was first validated and then applied to our multiple bubbles pipe flow conditions. We then studied the effects of bubble size and concentration distribution on the gas-lift technique. In general it can be concluded that a decreasing bubble size increases the efficiency of the gas-lift technique. This is, among others, caused {{by the fact that the}} initial bubble size significantly affected the flow pattern transition from bubbly flow to slug flow. This effect could be described by using a bubble size dependent critical void fraction relation for the transition from bubbly flow to slug flow. With decreasing bubble size the transition shifts to larger values of the void fraction. Measurements were conducted to measure the influence of the bubble size on the velocity profile of gas and liquid and on the bubble concentration profile. For this purpose the four-point probe optical <b>fibre</b> <b>probe</b> and the LDA measurement technique were used. The velocity and concentration profiles were strongly influenced by the bubble size. Also the parameters C 0 and Udrift of the drift-flux model are therefore bubble-size dependent. Based on the measurements, mathematical relations have been developed to describe these bubble size effects on the drift-flux parameters. We also developed a numerical model based on the Euler-Euler modelling approach for predicting the radial profiles of the void fraction and velocity as a function of the relevant parameters, such as bubble size. The predictions were in reasonable agreement with experimental data. Applied Science...|$|E

40|$|The {{reliance}} {{of emerging}} engineering and scientific applications on nanometre scale surfaces {{has led to}} the requirement for embedded metrology instrumentation for on-machine measurement in precision and ultra-precision manufacturing processes. In-situ measurement provides reduction in waste, cost and production cycle time of manufactured components however the presence of environmental noise and difficulties of integration make embedded metrology challenging. In this thesis a review of on-machine methods of optical metrology is provided and commercially available instruments are summarised. The requirement for highly miniaturised methods of distance and surface topography measurement for operation within volume limited manufacturing environments is presented and the necessity for smaller, faster probes with increased range, resolution and robustness outlined. The potential for dispersed reference interferometry (DRI) to exceed the capability of existing single-point remote <b>fibre</b> <b>probing</b> instruments is then introduced. DRI as a technique for single-point distance and surface topography measurement is first evaluated in a bulk optics configuration using a short coherence light source and chromatic dispersion within the reference arm. The resulting spectral interferograms have symmetry positions which are directly related to absolute surface position to yield measurement with a 279 nm axial resolution over a 285 μm axial range. Improvement of this resolution results from introduction of template matching, a signal processing technique which correlates a measured interferogram with a set of pre-calculated template interferograms resulting in a relative method of measurement with an axial resolution of 0. 6 nm across the 285 μm axial range. Combination of this high resolution, relative measurement method with low resolution but absolute position data is then explored to improve the robustness of DRI to discontinuous and structured surfaces. Determination of high resolution wraparound order using low resolution absolute data is demonstrated over a 30 μm range, with extension to the full range of DRI expected as future improvements increase the measurement rate. Next a DRI topology is introduced which makes use of miniature common-path <b>probes</b> linked by <b>fibre</b> to a remote interrogation interferometer allowing reduction in size of the on-machine metrology apparatus. Modifications to the DRI are described to enable this common-path remote <b>fibre</b> <b>probing,</b> along with changes to the light source, spectrometer and dispersive element which allow extension of the range of DRI to 800 μm while maintaining nanometre axial resolution. Finally, a further work section offers insights into methods to improve miniaturisation of DRI probes as well as providing discussion of methods of hardware and signal processing optimisation to augment the instrument measurement rate...|$|R

The rate of glycolysis influences the meat quality, {{which can be}} measured {{by means of a}} rigormeter, a pH meter, a pork quality meter, a <b>fibre</b> optical <b>probe</b> or a meat quality meter. Meat quality depends largely on the genotype of the animal. Nevertheless it is possible to optimize the transport of pigs, from loading to lairage, in order to improve meat quality. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{calibration}} of a dual <b>fibre</b> optical <b>probe</b> was experimentally {{investigated in}} a circulating fluidized bed. The particle volume fraction registered by the optical probe {{was compared to}} pressure drop measurements {{for a range of}} operating conditions. A theoretical calibration theory was applied to the probe signal to obtain the local and instantaneous particle volume fraction. It was found that glare points on the particles and the beam length from the probe to the particle determines the curvature of the calibration function to a large extent...|$|R
