He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Well, I assume that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is {{the meaning of the word}} 'five'? No such thing was in question here, only how the word 'five' is used.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Teresa {{received}} the Nobel Peace Prize [...] "for work {{undertaken in the}} struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace". She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet for laureates, asking that its $192,000 cost be given to the poor in India and saying that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her to help the world's needy. When Teresa {{received the}} prize she was asked, [...] "What can we do to promote world peace?" [...] She answered, [...] "Go home and love your family." [...] Building on this theme in her Nobel lecture, she said: [...] "Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society—that poverty is so hurtable [...] and so much, and I find that very difficult." [...] Teresa singled out abortion as [...] "the greatest destroyer of peace today. Because if a mother can kill her own child—what is left for me to kill you and you kill me—there is nothing between." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Worster {{wishes to}} visit {{you with a}} view of getting your {{permission}} to introduce into the army [...] "Harmon's Sandal Sock." [...] Shall <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> pass for that object? ...|$|E
5000|$|There is {{no fault}} I find in you. One {{of them is}} indecisive, so <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> sword to {{encourage}} him to be more decisive. The other is careless, and so <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> belt to encourage him to rein himself in. Your abilities will mean that you will lack nothing. What can <b>I</b> <b>give</b> you? ...|$|R
60|$|This honest, {{friendly}} way {{of treating}} me unlocked all the sluices of my passions. He broke into my very soul by it; and I unravelled all the wickedness {{of my life}} to <b>him.</b> In <b>a</b> word, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> abridgment of this whole history; <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> picture of my conduct for fifty years in miniature.|$|R
60|$|I was {{in pretty}} good eyebrow-raising form by now, so <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> touch of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will {{excuse me}} if <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> little brandy, won't you, sir?" [...] he said. [...] "He's really not quite fit for getting about yet, {{but he was}} {{worrying}} about his book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd like to ask, ma'am," [...] {{said the}} Champion, earnestly, [...] "whether I {{can act as}} the lad's second when the time comes. I've waited on him the last two fights. Can <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> knee?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let him {{pick out}} the prisoners' eyes, and chop off their hands, and shoot them into the town from mangonels,--he must go far and thrive well ere <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> chance of doing that by me." ...|$|E
60|$|With this <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> long {{account of}} some of my strangest adventures, to which he listened patiently.|$|R
60|$|I felt a pipe was {{becoming}} after all, and that lit, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> favourable sketch of my career.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Baron Hausberg!' cried Hughie. 'Good heavens! <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> sovereign!' and he {{sank into}} an {{armchair}} {{the picture of}} dismay.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{only one}} line," [...] Jim replied. [...] "This thing cannot be talked about. Lance knows we know I cannot punish him in any lawful way; but if he stops at Dryholm, I'll use the backwoods plan. Well, <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> week to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|Soames stole a sideway look: [...] "It's {{much too}} late to go into that," [...] he said, [...] "I only {{want it to be}} quite {{understood}} that if <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> free hand, he doesn't let me in. I thought if you were to speak to him, it would carry more weight!" ...|$|E
6000|$|CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey {{there that}} told me after we left the two {{commercials}} in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs) Sober hearsedrivers a speciality. Will <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> short {{sketch of}} my adventures, and had hardly {{concluded}} {{it by the}} time that we reached our destination.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> {{look that}} might ha' melted a 'art of stone, {{and all it}} done to 'im was to make 'im laugh.|$|R
60|$|G.G. Simmons was an unpleasant, perky-looking stripling, mostly {{front teeth}} and spectacles, but <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> big hand. We Scripture-knowledge sharks stick together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Down in the medder, ploughin'. It's a toughish bit, and he'll be late, I reckon; for {{he took a}} long noon-spell, and <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> {{piece of}} my mind about it, so I'll venter to say he won't touch a bit of victuals till the last furrow is laid," [...] {{answered}} Uncle Dan, plodding away to wash his hands at the horse-trough.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{of course}} I am,' her {{companion}} replied, {{but in the}} tone of one who 'lived in Abraham's bosom all the year,' and was therefore untouched by solemn thought at the fact. 'He's my cousin--a native of this village. We were engaged before my father's death left me so lonely. I was only twenty, and a much greater belle than I am now. We know each other thoroughly, as you may imagine. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> little sermonizing now and then.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, Eva, I'm sorry papa is {{only going}} to stay two days here, and then I shan't see you again for ever so long! If I stay with you, I'd try to be good, and not be cross to Dodo, and so on. I don't mean to treat Dodo ill; but, you know, I've got such a quick temper. I'm not really bad to him, though. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> picayune, now and then; and you see he dresses well. I think, on the whole, Dodo 's pretty well off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's been {{worrying}} me also, I {{can assure}} you," [...] I told him; and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> account of my Wednesday evening's experience.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> look, {{just one}} look as I went out! But I don't think he saw it. He {{was talking to}} some one else.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> quick glance, {{and caught}} an instant's {{glimpse of what}} I took {{to be a very}} pale face and a very set jaw.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will do that," [...] said Alberdin; [...] "but I {{am afraid}} I {{shall not be}} able to help you find your way home, for in doing so I should throw myself off my guard, and might be set upon {{unexpectedly}} by this fellow, with whom I have a regular engagement to fight. There is to be a time fixed for the combat, for which I feel myself nearly ready, but I have no doubt that my enemy will be very glad to take me at a disadvantage if <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thus {{will his}} mouth be wetted {{that he may}} make much noise in the council. But to the Bear, of whom I am well proud, will I give of {{blankets}} two; of flour, twenty cups; of tobacco, double that of the Fox; and if he fare with me over the Mountains of the East, then will <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> rifle, mate to Thling-Tinneh's. If not? Good! The Wolf is weary of speech. Yet once again will he say the Law: Whoso taketh the life of one Wolf, the forfeit shall ten of his people pay.' ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this bit}} of truculent burlesque the quiet man made a bold push, and walked away with a {{somewhat}} sickened face, and as no one now intervened between them, the inebriate laid a familiar hand upon Cousin Frank's collar, and said with a wink at his late listener: [...] "Looks like a lerigious man, don't he? I guess <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> good dose, if he does think himself the head-deacon of this boat." [...] And {{he went on to}} state his ideas of religion, from which it seemed that he was a person of the most advanced thinking, and believed in nothing worth mentioning.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{put him in}} the river," [...] said Mr. Polly. [...] "That {{toned down}} his alcolaceous frenzy! <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> bit of a doing altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had a few}} words; he was wanting money again, and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> {{piece of}} my mind. I don’t think we shall see him again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> dig in the nose,' cried Maurice, in exultation; 'I pulled ever so much {{hair out}} of his whiskers. I had it just now.' ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR MOTHER,--I give {{my father}} up. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> parable: that the Waverley novels are better reading {{for every day}} than the tragic Life. And he takes it {{backside}} foremost, and shakes his head, and is gloomier than ever. Tell him that I give him up. I don't want no such a parent. This is not the man for my money. I do not call that {{by the name of}} religion which fills a man with bile. I write him a whole letter, bidding him beware of extremes, and telling him that his gloom is gallows-worthy; and I get back an answer--Perish the thought of it.|$|E
6000|$|Dryfoos did {{not think}} it {{necessary}} to answer such a question. [...] "It's all Fulkerson, Fulkerson, Fulkerson. It seems to me that Fulkerson about runs this family. He brought Mrs. Mandel, and he brought that Beaton, and he brought that Boston fellow! I guess <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> dose, though; and I'll learn Fulkerson that he can't have everything his own way. I don't want anybody to help me spend my money. I made it, and I can manage it. I guess Mr. Fulkerson can bear a little watching now. He's been travelling pretty free, and he's got the notion he's driving, maybe. I'm a-going to look after that book a little myself." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And a most rascally gallant," [...] said Zouch. [...] "The {{murder of}} his own page, of which <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> remembrancer, is among the least of his sins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't. I was lying. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> {{look that}} should have killed him, but I don't think it did. Rouse {{yourself}} from your chair, and call him--" ...|$|R
