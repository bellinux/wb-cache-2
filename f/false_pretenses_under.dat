5000|$|Title passes - <b>False</b> <b>pretense</b> is {{conventionally}} {{referred to}} as a crime against “title” and [...] "title" [...] must pass from the victim to the perpetrator for the crime to be complete. However, this is not to be taken literally {{for the simple reason that}} a person who obtains ownership of property by deceit does not obtain full title to the property; only a voidable title. <b>False</b> <b>pretense</b> applies to situations where the wrongdoer by deceit obtains “title or ownership - or whatever property interest the victim had in the chattel, if it was less than title.” If the victim has an interest is the property less than full title the acquisition of that interest through false representation can be <b>false</b> <b>pretenses</b> unless the only interest the person has is possession of the property. In such case the crime would be larceny by trick rather than <b>false</b> <b>pretenses.</b> Larceny by Trick also applies to situations where the wrongdoer by deceit obtains possession only, with the victim retaining ownership or some superior interest in the chattel.5 Determining whether the victim obtained title or possession can present problems. Generally a sell or conditional sell is sufficient to pass title for purposes of <b>false</b> <b>pretenses</b> whereas lending property does not involve a transfer of title. Note that if property is falsely obtained for a specific purpose - for example money to buy a car that does not exist - the crime is larceny by trick rather than <b>false</b> <b>pretenses</b> because the victim intended to pass title to the money only upon completion of the transaction; until such time the victim intended to deliver possession only.The essential distinction between <b>false</b> <b>pretenses</b> and larceny and embezzlement is that <b>false</b> <b>pretenses</b> requires that the victim pass title to the defendant whereas the other offenses do not.The determination as to whether the offense is larceny or <b>false</b> <b>pretenses</b> can have significant effect on the ability of true owner to reclaim the appropriated property. If <b>false</b> <b>pretenses,</b> a bona fide purchaser for value would acquire title superior to the victim; whereas, if the crime is larceny a purchaser from the wrongdoer, bona fide or otherwise, would not acquire any title to the property and would have to return the property to the victim.|$|R
