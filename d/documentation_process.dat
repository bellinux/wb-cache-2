40|$|Scientific and {{engineering}} communities (e. g., chemistry, bioinformatics {{and engineering}} manufacturing) have presented unprecedented requirements for knowing the provenance of their data products, i. e., where they originated from, {{how they were}} produced and {{what has happened to}} them since creation. Without such important knowledge, scientists and engineers cannot reproduce, analyse or validate experiments and processes. Previous work has conceived a computer-based representation of a past process for determining provenance, termed <b>process</b> <b>documentation.</b> However, current provenance systems do not adequately address the problem of reliably recording <b>process</b> <b>documentation</b> in large scale environments like Service Oriented Architectures. For example, a service may not be available and network connection may be broken. In this context, reliably recording <b>process</b> <b>documentation</b> becomes challenging, given that the documentation produced in a process can be spread over multiple provenance repositories across the world. The presence of failures (specifically, the crash of provenance repositories and communication failures) may prevent <b>process</b> <b>documentation</b> from being recorded, losing the evidence that a process occurred. This would have disastrous consequences and hence is not acceptable in the domains that rely on <b>process</b> <b>documentation</b> to determine the provenance of their data products. In this thesis, we systematically analyse all situations that may occur during capturing <b>process</b> <b>documentation</b> in the event of assumed failures. We then present a novel coordinator-based protocol that is formally proved to record complete <b>process</b> <b>documentation.</b> In addition, we use graphs to intuitively represent the topology of <b>process</b> <b>documentation</b> recorded in multiple interlinked provenance repositories, which helps us to investigate the entire retrievability of distributed <b>process</b> <b>documentation.</b> Finally, we evaluate a system architecture that employs the protocol and supports practical issues such as communication, storage and performance. The results show that the system can record complete and retrievable <b>process</b> <b>documentation</b> while maintaining acceptable performance.
