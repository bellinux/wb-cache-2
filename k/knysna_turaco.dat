25|$|Few studies {{into the}} {{chemical}} nature of turacoverdin {{have been performed}} to date. Research by R.E. Moreau in the 1950s showed it to be less soluble in basic solutions than its chemical cousin turacin. While originally thought to contain little copper by its discoverer, who instead believed it to be iron-based, later spectroscopic analysis demonstrated high copper (and low iron) content in pigment from the green feathers of the <b>Knysna</b> <b>turaco</b> and the Schalow's turaco.

25|$|Turacin and turacoverdin, being copper-based pigments, require large {{quantities}} of copper {{in order to be}} manufactured. As turacos are primarily arboreal species, they are able to accumulate copper through a diet rich in fruits, flowers, buds, and other plant matter. Church and Moreau estimated that 3 months' worth of fruit intake contribute to producing the pigment present in the newly grown plumage of the turaco species T. corythaix (the <b>Knysna</b> <b>turaco).</b> It has also been observed that it takes young turacos around a year to acquire their colorful adult plumage, and some authors have speculated that they probably need that long to acquire the necessary copper. It has also been noted that turacos all live across Central Africa, which corresponds geographically with one of the world's richest copperbelts. It is unknown whether turaco diets are especially rich in copper as compared to the diets of other birds, or whether turacos are especially effective at extracting copper from their foods. It is also unknown whether turaco species lacking turacin and turacoverdin-induced pigmentation have a comparatively copper-deficient diet, absorb less copper from their diet, or lack the enzymes required to synthesize the pigments.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeed {{dispersal}} {{plays an}} important role in the persistence, regeneration and maintenance of plant communities. It is therefore not surprising that much attention has been paid to the germination potential of seeds ingested by frugivorous animals. Consequently the aim of this study was to determine what effect ingestion of seeds by <b>Knysna</b> <b>Turacos</b> (Tauraco corythaix) has on the germination rate and germination percentage of indigenous South African tree species. Fruits from twelve tree species were fed to the Turacos in separate trials and seed retention times were determined as it has been suggested that a longer seed retention time may increase germination rates. At the end of each trial, seeds were extracted from excreta of individual birds and planted in trays containing potting soil. Germination was recorded daily until 14 days of no germination. <b>Knysna</b> <b>Turacos</b> seed retention times were in the range of those obtained by other studies, with Ficus sur seeds having the fastest retention times (12. 4 ± 0. 8 min) and Celtis africana the slowest (34. 6 ± 5. 6 min). Seed ingestion by <b>Knysna</b> <b>Turacos</b> did not influence the rate at which seeds germinated in 83 % of the tree species, but ingested Ficus lutea and Ficus natalensis seeds germinated significantly sooner than whole fruit seeds. Future studies relating the composition of indigenous forest fruits to food preferences of <b>Knysna</b> <b>Turacos</b> may give insight into their role as potential seed dispersers of indigenous fruiting tree species...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Knysna</b> <b>turaco</b> {{is usually}} seen flying between forest trees, or hopping along branches. It feeds on fruit, insects and earthworms. It has a loud kow-kow-kow-kow call.|$|E
50|$|By {{appearances}} and behaviour it has {{much in common}} with the <b>Knysna</b> <b>turaco</b> of South Africa, and Schalow's turaco which replaces it on the plateau regions to the west of its range.|$|E

5000|$|The reserve protects {{riverine}} {{and coastal}} scarp forest, {{and is known}} for its birdlife and butterflies. [...] There are a recorded 102 tree species in the reserve, with 48 considered rare. Close to 160 bird species have been recorded, including the <b>Knysna</b> <b>Turaco</b> and Purple Crested Turaco.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Knysna</b> <b>turaco</b> (Tauraco corythaix), or, in South Africa, Knysna lourie, {{is a large}} turaco, one of a {{group of}} African near-passerine birds. It is a {{resident}} breeder in the mature evergreen forests of southern and eastern South Africa, and Swaziland. It was formerly sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the green turaco of West Africa. The Livingstone's and Schalow's turacos were once considered subspecies.|$|E
50|$|The {{highlands}} {{are also}} rich in birdlife including trumpeter hornbill (Bycanistes bucinator), <b>Knysna</b> <b>turaco</b> (Tauraco corythaix), purple-crested turaco (Tauraco porphyreolophus), crested guineafowl (Guttera pucherani) and crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus). The forests are also full of butterflies, most notably swallowtails {{such as the}} emperor swallowtail (Papilio ophidicephalus) and the citrus swallowtail (Papilio demodocus) and the forest undergrowth in particular shelters a variety of reptiles including skinks, geckos, lizards, frogs, toads, and snakes.|$|E
50|$|Within its range, this is {{an unmistakable}} bird, {{although}} often inconspicuous in the treetops. It is 40-42 cm long, including a long tail. The small but thick orange-red bill and a white line just under the eye contrast with the mainly green plumage. It has a tall green crest, which is tipped with white. The eye is brown and the eye-ring deep red. In flight, <b>Knysna</b> <b>turaco</b> shows conspicuous crimson primary flight feathers. Sexes are similar, but juvenile birds have a shorter crest without the white tips.|$|E

50|$|Zenker's turaco (Tauraco persa zenkeri), is a {{subspecies}} of the Guinea turaco. It is a green turaco, in {{the family}} Musophagidae, subfamily Tauracinae, a group of near-passerines birds. Zenker's turaco is found in forests of Central Africa in the Congo Basin in Gabon, DR Congo and Congo Brazaville and south to northern Angola. It forms part of a superspecies complex that extends from West Africa to East Africa and {{as far south as}} the Cape in Southern Africa and include the black-billed turaco, Emin's, Schalow's turaco, Livingstone's turaco, the Transvaal turaco and the <b>Knysna</b> <b>turaco,</b> as subspecies within the group.|$|E
50|$|At least 201 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} at Empisini including:African fish-eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), African crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus), Wahlberg's eagle (Aquila wahlbergi), black-chested snake-eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), spur-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis), African black duck (Anas sparsa), tambourine dove (Turtur tympanistria), emerald-spotted wood-dove (Turtur chalcospilos), lemon dove (Aplopelia larvata), purple-crested turaco (Gallirex porphyreolophus), <b>Knysna</b> <b>turaco</b> (Tauraco corythaix), green malkoha (Ceuthmochares aereus), African wood-owl (Strix woodfordii), African palm-swift (Cypsiurus parvus), Narina trogon (Apaloderma narina), giant kingfisher (Megaceryle maximus), African pygmy-kingfisher (Ispidina picta), trumpeter hornbill (Bycanistes bucinator), olive woodpecker (Dendropicos griseocephalus), red-throated wryneck (Jynx ruficollis), spotted ground-thrush (Zoothera guttata), mountain wagtail (Motacilla clara), dark-backed weaver (Ploceus bicolor), magpie mannikin (Spermestes fringilloides), red-backed mannikin (Spermestes bicolor), green twinspot (Mandingoa nitidula) and forest canary (Crithagra scotops).|$|E
5000|$|Female trees bear their fruit irregularly, {{only every}} few years. The fleshy epimatium of the strobilus (or [...] "cone") covers {{all of the}} seed, and ripens to a yellow colour, when it acquires a soft, jelly-like consistency. The main agents of seed {{dispersal}} are fruit bats, which eat the fleshy covering but discard the hard, woody seed. Many birds feed on the fruits, such as Cape parrot, purple-crested turaco, <b>Knysna</b> <b>turaco,</b> Ross's turaco, African olive pigeon, African green pigeon, and eastern bronze-naped pigeon. [...] Animals that feed on the seeds include colobus monkeys, bushpigs, hornbills, turacos, and rodents. These may not be effective seed dispersal agents, because it appears that seeds that have gone through animal guts do not germinate well.|$|E
50|$|Some 180 {{bird species}} have been {{recorded}} in the reserve. The three pairs of crowned eagles that nest in the reserve prey on dassies, monkeys and hadeda ibis. Wahlbergs eagle, lanner and peregrine falcons all nest in the lower gorge. Secretive birds like broadbill, grey cuckooshrike, Narina trogon, emerald cuckoo and wood-owl all occur, but {{are more likely to}} be heard than seen. Winter migrants include chorister robin-chat, white-starred robin, yellow-throated warbler and the rare spotted ground-thrush. Trumpeter and crowned hornbills are numerous and conspicuous. <b>Knysna</b> <b>turaco</b> (subsp. corythaix) is not found elsewhere in the Durban metropole, and occurs alongside the more numerous purple-crested turaco. Late summer seed of broad-leaved setaria attract green twinspot, grey waxbill, swee waxbill and red-backed mannikin. Plain-backed pipit is regularly present after grassland burns, while bat hawk has been noted at dusk.|$|E

Moreau in 1958 observed that turaco species inhabiting forests {{are more likely to be}} green in color than species inhabiting other environments, which may offer concealment from predators. In fact, it has been observed that the greener and denser a turaco's forest habitat, the deeper green its plumage, while non-forest-dwelling turaco species tend to be devoid of the green pigment. This claim has not been studied rigorously from a biochemical or phylogenetic perspective, however, and awaits further research. Turacos may employ their unique green coloration for sexual or social advertisement, but again no spectrophotometric or biochemical studies have been conducted to test for sex differences in coloration, and to limited human perception there appears to be none.|$|E
