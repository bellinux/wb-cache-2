50|$|Some filters, {{especially}} {{found on}} diesel engines, {{are of a}} bowl-like design which collect water in the bottom (as water is more dense than diesel). The water can then be drained off by opening a valve {{in the bottom of}} the bowl and letting it run out, until the bowl contains only diesel. Many fuel filters contain a water sensor to signal to the engine control unit or directly to the driver (lamp on dashboard) if the water reach the warning level. It is especially undesirable for water in fuel to be drawn into a diesel engine fuel system, as the system relies on the diesel for lubrication of the moving parts, and if water gets into a moving part which requires constant lubrication (for example an injector valve), it will quickly cause overheating and unnecessary wear. This type of filter may also include a sensor, which will alert the operator when the filter needs to be drained.In proximity of the diesel fuel filter there might be a <b>fuel</b> <b>heater</b> to avoid the forming of paraffin wax (in case of low temperatures) inside the filtrating element which can stop the fuel flow to the engine.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional development goals like reliability, emission behaviour and energetic efficiency, the competition between the systems used for warming heating and drinking water is compelling the manufacturers of oil-fired heating systems to take increasingly into account product requirements such as adjustability, space requirements and operating noises, which {{have in the past}} been ignored. Above all, increasing importance is placed on reducing the lower power limit - which is at the moment around 15 kW for spray burners - against the background of a continuously falling need for heating energy. On the basis of these constraints, the pre-mixing surface burner for EL heating oil, developed as part of this work, provides a promising approach to a solution which links the possibility of metering minimal fuel mass flow rates with favourable emission behaviour, output dynamics and the virtually noiseless operation of this type of burner. To create the aerosol a superheated fuel jet is injected into the pre-mixing section of the burner via a closeable nozzle. As a result of the reduction in pressure at the nozzle outlet, vapour bubbles form with the injected jet, which is surrounded by air. The rapid growth of these vapour bubbles tears the liquid open. In addition, the kinetic forces of the internal turbulence and the sheer forces cause the liquid film to break up along the edges of the jet. In contrast to traditional methods of atomizing a liquid fuel much smaller drops are formed {{as a result of the}} overlaying of thermal and kinetic jet fragmentation. The injection device is designed as a volume-controlled metering system. A piston pump moves the fuel from a storage tank to the <b>fuel</b> <b>heater.</b> The injection nozzle is located at the outlet end of the <b>fuel</b> <b>heater.</b> Given a constant stroke volume the quantity of fuel which is injected is determined by the stroke frequency of the piston pump. Before the burner starts operating an electrical heating element heats the fuel to the required injection temperature. After the heater has operated for a brief period of time the hot reaction zone supplies the energy needed to heat up the fuel. The electrical heating element is either switched off, or activated at intervals in order to maintain a pre-set injection temperature. The fuel is heated under pressure in order to prevent the depositing of coke-like substances resulting from the liquid fuel phase. In order to provide a technical evaluation of the approach, a test burner with a power output of 2 - 10 kW was developed and examined on the basis of the following criteria: pollutant emission, flame stability, modulating operation, electrical energy requirement, noises and reliability. The results show that the nitrogen oxide emission and the surface burner noise level are considerably lower than those of conventional spray burners. (orig.)

40|$|The global energy consumption, which {{increased}} ~ 84 % during last thirty years, exceeded 1. 4. 1011 MWh in 2008. It {{is projected to}} increase another ~ 39 % until 2030. Current energy trends are unsustainable. Considering that 30 - 50 % of the global energy consumption is consumed for heating and cooling, more efficient heating and cooling systems are needed. The current power situation in Syria is serious {{and is likely to}} speed up the implementation of renewable energy systems. Comparison between the conventional <b>fuel</b> <b>heater,</b> electrical heater, air source heat pump and ground source heat pump in Syrian climate shows that GSHP systems have big potential and can make huge contributions to overcome the current energy shortage in Syria. Since the heating demand in Syria is almost twice the cooling demand, it is possible to use such systems for free cooling. Therefore, heat recharge of the borehole field is important. The amount of available solar energy in Syria, means that the combination of solar and GSHP has great potential. Climatic and geological conditions were analyzed for GSHP systems in Syria, which was chosen as a case study for the Middle East. A general study was made on the need for large-scale utilization of renewable energy, including an overview of different energy storage systems for heating and cooling. Chicken farms were chosen as a study case since the poultry industry is an important sector in Syria. There are 13, 000 chicken farms with an annual production of 172, 000 tons of meat. It employs almost 150, 000 people and has a large heating and cooling demand (1. 34 TWh/year). Next step was the design and simulate the operation of a GSHP system for a typical chicken farm in Syria. Based on this study the national potential for such systems was estimated. GSHP systems at all Syrian chicken farms would annually save 114, 000 m 3 of oil. Since GSHPs use the ground as a source or sink of thermal energy, the ground temperature is most important for its operation and efficiency. The ongoing global warming, which means that air, ground, and water is getting warmer, has therefore some consequences on such systems. Firstly, the effect of global warming on the ground temperature was studied. An equation, which describes the change of ground temperature field as a function of depth, time, and ground thermal properties, and local (global) warming, was derived. Secondly, the effect of the warming on heating and cooling demand of a certain building was studied in combination with its affects on the efficiency of GSHP system. The proper design of BHE requires knowledge of ground thermal properties, i. e. effective ground thermal conductivity, thermal resistance, and undisturbed ground temperature. Such site specific data were determined by thermal response test for heating and cooling of the Kharseh chicken farm in Hama, Syria. Used thermal response test equipment was designed and constructed within the project. Borehole thermal resistance has considerable effect on the performance of borehole heat exchangers. Therefore, forced convection in a water filled borehole (i. e. non-grouted) was tested to improve the heat transfer. Injected air, {{at the bottom of a}} borehole, resulted in a 28 % reduction of thermal resistance. Since injected air bubbles caused convection also in the groundwater, surrounding the borehole, the effective thermal conductivity was increased 28 %. Future work aims at the construction, operation, and monitoring of suggested GSHP system at the Kharseh chicken farm in Syria. The idea is to demonstrate the GSHP system as a means of promoting and implementing such systems in the Middle East. The main problem now is to get required permissions to build the ground heat exchangers since there is no existing permit procedure for such systems.

40|$|Background: Use of <b>fuel</b> <b>heaters</b> is {{associated}} with childhood asthma. However, no studies have evaluated the associations of flue use and mechanical ventilation (ventilation) with asthma symptoms in schoolchildren. Methods: This cross-sectional study investigated schoolchildren in grades 1 through 6 (age 6 - 12 years) in Sapporo, Japan. From November 2008 through January 2009, parents completed questionnaires regarding their home environment and their children's asthma symptoms. Results: In total, 4445 (69. 5 %) parents of 6393 children returned the questionnaire. After excluding incomplete responses, data on 3874 children (60. 6 %) were analyzed. The prevalence of current asthma symptoms and ever asthma symptoms were 12. 8 % and 30. 9 %, respectively. As compared with electric heaters, current asthma symptoms was associated with use of flued heaters without ventilation (OR = 1. 62; 95 % CI, 1. 03 - 2. 64) and unflued heaters with ventilation (OR = 1. 77; 95 % CI, 1. 09 - 2. 95) or without ventilation (OR = 2. 23; 95 % CI, 1. 31 - 3. 85).

Nowadays, the progress of processing technology especially in fish product are increase so quickly. This case make the researcher, scientist and society should add on their knowledge about fish processing technology therefore the processing of fish product has a social economic value for fisherman, fish fanner, processor and fish trader (llyas, 1983). Fish and the other fish products are highly perisable food, so {{the market value of}} preservating and processing product determined by fresh degree and the power of durability (Buckle, et al, 1983, in Hadiwiyoto). One of the way to hold that case is preservation method (Hudaya dan Darajad, 1982). Damage of Sea Product In production of sea product quality change that show in flavour smell, teksture and colour can caused by bacterial growth. The velocity of quality change depend on degree of bacterial in beginning, store condition, temperature, moisture, and atmosphere pressure. Sea product easier to decompocite than the other highly protein product. This is because of I. Some of sea product has a high degree of osmoregulator that formed in non {{protein nitrogen}} like trimetil amin, urea, amino acid etc that is good for growth media of bacteria. 2. Production of sea product harvested from cool water so flora bacteria not easy to pursuing by low temperature than flora animal and plant. Safety of production sea product especially depend from the probability of greasing pathogen mikrobia or caused by histamine because of the treatment not suitable. Today it is very urgent how to provide fish with high quality either for direct compsunbion or for manufacture material, so it is necessary for preservation technology which can fulfill the standard of food safety (Anggarwati, 1988). Making of salted fish is one of the way for preserving fishery product there are with salted and dryed. Many kinds of fish can be salted like teri,layur, pethek,pari etc that generally not consume in fresh condition. The obstacle that the producer may face are dying processing, like the limited field for drying a fish, because the empy field is used for public stay. At present fish are dryed above bamboo mat and opened, placed above the field for throw rubbish (See Glossary). This way is not exactly hygienis. In the rainy season, fish can not dry soon. This is can make a fish rotten, so the quality is go down therefore these fish not safety to consume. Remind for that case, it is necessary to research isulated fish dryer equipment which can be use not influenced by season and not depend on where is that equipment placed. With this isulated fish dryer technology we will take some advantages : •	The use of drying field can be effective •	Drying can be place anywhere, in store or the place which can fulfill the qualification •	Short time for drying •	Producing of drying can be continous •	Thriftying the employee who hold drying •	The fish more hygienis and increasing the store age.

PROBLEMS The process of preservating fish with salted and dryed with traditional method is not hygienis, decreasing value of nutrition and can not fulfill the qualification for food safety. Drying processing can not continous for a long time during rainy season, so it is necessary to research an equipment which can use operated during a season, either dry or rainy season, that equipment can be operated eventough sun ray intecity are low, the way is designing isutated fish dryer equipment which completed with <b>fuel</b> <b>heater.</b> This equipment designed in order that quality of fish product not go down in nutrient value, hygiene and safe to consume.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{reliable}} OH absorption technique {{was developed and}} applied to measure path integrated temperature and OH number density in scramjet combustor hardware. The first series of measurements was made in premixed combustion products at the exit of a Mach 2 nozzle mounted on a hydrogen <b>fueled</b> vitiated <b>heater.</b> The second series of tests was conducted during supersonic combustion evaluation of hydrogen/hydrocarbon fuel mixtures. These measurements were made near the exit of a 48 -inch long diverging supersonic combustor. The OH number density measurements indicated that both the nozzle and the combustor flow were not in equilibrium...|$|R
50|$|Air source {{heat pumps}} {{can last for}} over 20 years with low {{maintenance}} requirements. There are numerous heat pumps from the 1970s and 1980s in the United States that are still in service in 2012, even in places where winters are extremely cold. Few moving parts reduce maintenance requirements. However, the outdoor heat exchanger and fan must be kept free from leaves and debris. Heat pumps have more moving parts than an equivalent electric resistance <b>heater</b> or <b>fuel</b> burning <b>heater.</b> Ground source heat pumps have fewer moving parts than air source heat pumps as {{they do not need}} fans or defrosting mechanisms.|$|R

Background: Use of <b>fuel</b> <b>heaters</b> is associated with childhood asthma. However, no studies have evaluated the associations of flue use and mechanical ventilation (ventilation) with asthma symptoms in schoolchildren. Methods: This cross-sectional study investigated schoolchildren in grades 1 through 6 (age 6 – 12 years) in Sapporo, Japan. From November 2008 through January 2009, parents completed questionnaires regarding their home environment and their children’s asthma symptoms. Results: In total, 4445 (69. 5 %) parents of 6393 children returned the questionnaire. After excluding incomplete responses, data on 3874 children (60. 6 %) were analyzed. The prevalence of current asthma symptoms and ever asthma symptoms were 12. 8 % and 30. 9 %, respectively. As compared with electric heaters, current asthma symptoms was associated with use of flued heaters without ventilation (OR = 1. 62; 95 % CI, 1. 03 – 2. 64) and unflued heaters with ventilation (OR = 1. 77; 95 % CI, 1. 09 – 2. 95) or without ventilation (OR = 2. 23; 95 % CI, 1. 31 – 3. 85). Regardless of dampness, unflued heaters were significantly associated with current asthma symptoms in the presence and absence of ventilation...|$|R
