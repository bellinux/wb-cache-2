25|$|A {{further and}} most {{important}} appliance is the doctor, a thin sharp blade of steel that rests on the <b>engraved</b> <b>roller</b> and serves to scrape off every vestige of superfluous colour from its surface, leaving only that which rests in the engraving. On the perfect action of this doctor depends the entire success of printing, and as its sharpness and angle of inclination to the copper roller varies with the styles of work in hand it requires an expert to get it up (sharpen it) properly and considerable practical experience {{to know exactly what}} qualities it should possess in any given case. In order to prevent it from wearing irregularly it is given a to-and-fro motion so that it is constantly changing its position and is never in contact with one part of the engraving for more than of brass or a similar alloy is frequently added {{on the opposite side of}} the roller to that occupied by the steel or cleaning doctor; it is known technically as the lint doctor from its purpose of cleaning off loose filaments or lint, which the roller picks off the cloth during the printing operation. The steel or cleaning doctor is pressed against the roller by means of weighted levers, but the lint doctor is usually just allowed to rest upon it by its own weight as its function is merely to intercept the nap which becomes detached from the cloth and would, if not cleaned from the roller, mix with the colour and give rise to defective work.|$|E
50|$|The {{commercial}} {{method of}} calico printing using <b>engraved</b> <b>rollers</b> {{was invented in}} 1821 in New Mills. John Potts of Potts, Oliver and Potts used a copper-engraved master to produce rollers to transfer the inks.|$|R
50|$|Moire is a waved or {{watered effect}} {{produced}} especially on grosgrain silk and woolen moreen via <b>engraved</b> <b>rollers</b> and high pressure on carded material. The {{end result is}} a peculiar luster which works best when made from a corded fabric like grosgrain.|$|R
50|$|Moire {{can also}} be {{produced}} by running fabric through <b>engraved</b> copper <b>rollers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{paper roll}} is {{threaded}} between two hard rollers, usually made from steel. One {{or both of}} the steel rollers has a linen pattern engraved on it. As the nip pressure between the two hard rollers increases, the pattern from the <b>engraved</b> <b>roller(s)</b> is pressed into the paper. The end result is a pattern that looks like a linen table cloth or linen dress.|$|R
50|$|Before {{printing}} it {{is essential}} to strain or sieve all colours in order to free them from lumps, fine sand, and other impurities, which would inevitably damage the highly polished surface of the <b>engraved</b> <b>rollers</b> and result in bad printing. Every scratch on the surface of a roller prints a fine line on the cloth, and too much care, therefore, cannot be taken to remove, as far as possible, all grit and other hard particles from every colour.|$|R
50|$|In {{printing}}, wooden blocks, stencils, <b>engraved</b> plates, <b>rollers,</b> or silkscreens {{can be used}} {{to place}} colours on the fabric. Colourants used in printing contain dyes thickened to prevent the colour from spreading by capillary attraction beyond the limits of the pattern or design.|$|R
5000|$|In textiles, a moire ( [...] or [...] ), {{less often}} moiré, is a fabric with a wavy (watered) {{appearance}} produced mainly from silk, but also wool, cotton and rayon. The watered appearance is usually {{created by the}} finishing technique called calendering. Moire effects are also achieved by certain weaves, such as varying {{the tension in the}} warp and weft of the weave, or by running the fabric through <b>engraved</b> copper <b>rollers.</b> Silk treated in this way is sometimes called watered silk.|$|R
50|$|Previously {{imported}} to South Africa from Europe, the trademarked fabric {{has been}} manufactured by Da Gama Textiles in the Zwelitsha township outside King William's Town in the Eastern Cape since 1982. In 1992 Da Gama Textiles bought the sole rights to Three Cats, {{the most popular}} brand of the fabric made by Spruce Manufacturing Co. Ltd in Manchester, and the original <b>engraved</b> copper <b>rollers</b> were shipped to South Africa. Da Gama Textiles has made shweshwe from cotton imported from Zimbabwe and grown locally in the Eastern Cape.|$|R
25|$|The <b>engraving</b> {{of copper}} <b>rollers</b> {{is one of}} the most {{important}} branches of textile printing and on its perfection of execution depends, in great measure, the ultimate success of the designs. Roughly speaking, the operation of engraving is performed by three different methods, viz. (I) By hand with a graver which cuts the metal away; (2) by etching, in which the pattern is dissolved out in nitric acid; and (3) by machine, in which the pattern is simply indented.|$|R
50|$|Textile {{printing}} {{is referred}} as localized dyeing. It is {{the application of}} color {{in the form of a}} paste or ink to the surface of a fabric, in a predetermined pattern. Printing designs onto already dyed fabric is also possible. In properly printed fabrics the color is bonded with the fiber, so as to resist washing and friction. Textile printing is related to dyeing but, whereas in dyeing proper the whole fabric is uniformly covered with one color, in printing one or more colors are applied to it in certain parts only, and in sharply defined patterns. In printing, wooden blocks, stencils, <b>engraved</b> plates, <b>rollers,</b> or silkscreens can be used to place colors on the fabric. Colorants used in printing contain dyes thickened to prevent the color from spreading by capillary attraction beyond the limits of the pattern or design.|$|R
25|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} roller-printing machine {{consists of a}} strong cast iron cylinder mounted in adjustable bearings capable of sliding up and down slots in {{the sides of the}} rigid iron framework. Beneath this cylinder the <b>engraved</b> copper <b>roller</b> rests in stationary bearings and is supplied with colour from a wooden roller that revolves in a colour-box below it. The copper roller is mounted on a stout steel axle, at one end of which a cogwheel is fixed to gear with the driving wheel of the machine, and at the other end a smaller cogwheel to drive the colour-furnishing roller. The cast iron pressure cylinder is wrapped with several thicknesses of a special material made of wool and cotton lapping, the object of which is to provide the elasticity necessary to enable it to properly force the cloth to be printed into the lines of engraving.|$|R
40|$|As {{a former}} {{employee}} of Cranston Printworks and a current professor at the University of Rhode Island, Richard Malachowski provided a detailed history and overview of textile printing. Printing dates back 2000 years to the Chinese culture. Printings during early times were created manually, by stencils, or by blocks. The dyes used in this time period were derived from natural resources, such as roots or bark. “Industrial Printing” did not develop until 1690, when Richmond on Thames, the first printing company, opened in England. The revolution of machine printing began when <b>engraved</b> copper <b>rollers</b> were created in 1783. This technology lasted for about one hundred and eighty years. The dyes, however, did evolve over time. There were synthetic dyes created during this industrial revolution. Richard Malachowski included a photo of copper rollers in use at Cranston Printworks. It wasn’t until 1963 that copper rollers became outdated technology. Taking over in copper rollers place was rotary screen-printing, which is now the dominant method that is used...|$|R
40|$|Underglaze tissue ceramic {{transfer}} printing {{was first}} developed circa 1750 and involved {{the use of}} engraved or etched copper plates, from which a wet strength tissue paper was printed with an oxide (commonly cobalt for blue colour) the famous ‘Willow Pattern’ being the best known example. However skilled engravers are no longer trained or available. The project addresses that issue by introducing the potential of printing the traditional potter’s tissue and applying {{it in the same}} way as the late 18 th Century process, but creating the printing plate from a digital file. Thus creating a combination of the digital capabilities of flexographic printing technology and the earliest printing process developed for the ceramic industry. The results of the project reduced the time from one month needed to <b>engrave</b> a <b>roller</b> to less than a day to create a digital equivalent, whilst retaining the integrity of the final product. The authors are collaborating with Burleigh Pottery in Stoke-on-Trent, the last remaining company to produce ceramic tableware decorated using the traditional printed underglaze tissue method. The project title is Combining digital print technologies with 18 th Century underglaze ceramic printing to retain an industrial heritage process. The pottery was recently saved from closure by the Princes’ Regeneration Trust, who wish to maintain the traditional manufacturing skills for the next 25 years...|$|R
5000|$|For his part, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said A Public Affair {{achievement}} achieve excellent sound, {{than any}} previous studio album of the singer. He noted that A Public Affair album is a party atmosphere, pure and simple. In eight of the thirteen songs of album you can enjoy a good adrenaline {{at the time of}} hearing, either on a dance floor or a carefree sunny afternoons. Additionally, the musical editor Lizzie Ennever of BBC website said that A Public Affair sounds like something you can put in a children's party I was having a disco-dancing competition. The album seems to be <b>engraved</b> on a <b>roller</b> coaster. In sum, the editor said that the only salvageable song disc was [...] "BOY", since he could reach the height of Britney Spears. Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly described the album as a compilation of songs from the 80s, played by Simpson, dantoles one C as final grade.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} kraft handsheets of {{controlled}} pH and water absorbency was prepared and printed on a single-sheet flexographic proofpress, with a water-based ink. Ink transfer increased with increasing water absorbency. Ink penetration also increased with water absorbency, although {{the effect is}} small in the commercial range of ink levels. There is {{a slight increase in}} transfer of this alkaline ink to more acidicpapers, but there is no apparent influence of pH on ink setting. A series of newsprint samples was also printed. Within related wood species, print density on newsprint increases with fines content, while set-off decreases with increasing suqlace fines. The correlation between print-through and opacity is much better than was found with oil-based inks on the same newsprints, due to the absence of oil penetration effects. [11, capable of printing single handsheets made under a wider range of conditions and properties than is possible with webs. We report here the results of quantitative ink transfer measurements. We have printed handsheets made from a bleached kraft pulp at controlled pH and controlled water absorbency. Print density, printthrough, and set-off measurements have also been made on a well-characterized range of newsprints. EXPERIMENTAL Press A simple schematic diagram of the press is shown in Fig. 1. Typically, about 1 mL of ink forms the ink pond between the <b>engraved</b> inking <b>roller</b> (anilox cylinder) and the first doctor blade. After the ink is distributed on the anilox cylinder, the plate is inked and the sample printed. The press normally runs at 200 rpm (1. 6 d s). For set-off, a Kromecote cast-coated paper is used as reference. The nip between the print and the reference paper is closed immediately after printing. Print density, print-through, and set-off are determined from reflectance measurements, as describe...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} text ‘Penny Plain and Twopence coloured’ regarding Blue and White underglaze ceramic transfer printing begins: ‘Transfer printing is {{a particularly}} English form of ceramic decoration’ (Halfpenny, Pat. 1994). Underglaze tissue ceramic transfer printing first developed circa 1750 and involved the use of engraved or etched copper plates, from which a wet strength tissue paper was printed with an oxide (commonly cobalt for blue colour) the famous 'Willow Pattern' being the best known example. Underglaze tissue has a very distinctive, subtle quality – it {{is an integral part}} of both English ceramic history and the history of copperplate engraving. The process was common in the UK ceramics industry until the 1980 s. However from the 1950 s it began to be supplemented by screenprinting because it was relatively slow and required skilled artisans to apply the transfers. Screenprinted transfers are printed on top of the glaze, therefore the image will wear and fade in a dishwasher - having none of the delicate qualities and permanence of underglaze. In addition screenprinted transfers are easier to apply and do not require the skills necessary for underglaze tissue application. The authors are collaborating with Burleigh Pottery in Stoke-on-Trent, the last remaining company to produce ceramic tableware decorated using the traditional printed underglaze tissue method. The project title is ‘Combining digital print technologies with 18 th Century underglaze ceramic printing to retain an industrial heritage process’. The pottery was recently saved from closure by the Princes' Regeneration Trust, who wish to maintain the traditional manufacturing skills for the next 25 years. There is a long-term issue with both the maintenance and production of printing hand-engraved rollers and plates. The project addresses that issue by introducing the potential of printing the traditional potter's tissue and applying it in the same way as the late 18 th Century process, but creating the plate from a digital file.
