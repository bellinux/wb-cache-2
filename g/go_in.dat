Paul had a bullet <b>go</b> <b>in</b> one temple and out the other, blinding him permanently (he survived the wound and lived 20 more years after the battle).

5|$|Jerry Goldsmith had {{composed}} {{the music for}} The Motion Picture, but {{was not an option}} for The Wrath of Khan given the reduced budget; Meyer's composer for Time After Time, Miklós Rózsa, was likewise prohibitively expensive.

Meyer initially hoped to hire an associate named John Morgan, but Morgan lacked film experience, which would have troubled the studio.|$|E
5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that.

So we will literally <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E

5|$|Air Force {{began the}} final quarter of play in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down at the Virginia Tech 29-yard line. Needing sevenyards for a first down, the Falcons picked up six. Instead of attempting a field goal on fourth down, DeBerry ordered another fourth-down conversion, which was successful. Three plays later, Tech's defense again forced a fourth down, and again DeBerry ordered a fourth-down conversion. The try was again successful, and Air Force earned another first down. Virginia Tech's defense continued to prevent Air Force from gaining a big play or a touchdown, however, and forced another fourth down. Considering his third fourth-down conversion in the same drive, coach DeBerry instead sent in kicker Joey Ashcroft, who kicked a 21-yard field goal to cut Virginia Tech's lead to 17–13 with 9:50 to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the quarter.|$|E
