50|$|These fenders are {{extensively}} {{used for}} {{ship to ship}} transfers at mid seas, <b>double</b> <b>banking</b> operations, and as vessel-to-berth at dock/jetties. The special property of a pneumatic fender is its low reaction force at low deflection. This property of pneumatic fenders makes them the most suitable fender for liquid cargo vessels and defense vessels with very sensitive equipment. These fenders have excellent energy absorption characteristics and linear load deflection characteristics. Pneumatic fenders should comply to the ISO 17357 standard.The pneumatic fender {{is also known as}} the Yokohama fender or floating fender. There are four basic types of pneumatic fenders that comply with the international standard: Type I (Chain&Tyre Net Type), Type II (Sling Type), Type III (Rib Type) and Type IV (Rope Net Type). It has become an ideal ship protection medium used extensively by large tankers, LPG vessels, ocean platforms etc. The most appropriate type will depend on its application and the requirements of the equipment.|$|E
40|$|CFD {{study is}} done to propose an {{efficient}} PCHE (Printed Circuit Heat Exchanger) model; used as a recuperator in International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). 3 D steady-state conjugate heat-transfer simulations are done with helium as a working fluid and alloy 617 as the solid substrate. Effect of variation of thermo-physical properties, operating conditions and three different design modifications are studied. Thermal hydraulic performance is found better for single as compared to <b>double</b> <b>banking</b> and {{is the same for}} aligned as compared to the staggered arrangement of the hot and cold channels. PCHE models with hemispherical dimples are found to give better thermal hydraulic performance. The performance is presented for the variation of the heat transfer density (for a PCHE model) and the pressure drop (in the hot and cold channel). Various types of flow patterns are presented to analyze the thermal-hydraulic characteristics - leading to the heat transfer enhancement by the dimples. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Folklore {{tells us}} that these huge {{earthworks}} are {{the results of the}} rooting of a giant boar, with muic being the Irish word for pig.

50|$|The {{earthworks}} usually {{consist of}} a bank with a ditch on either side. The bank is usually about 9 m wide and the ditches are usually about 6 m deep. Excavation of a stretch in County Monaghan revealed that the original construction was of a substantial timber palisade with external ditch. Behind the palisade was a <b>double</b> <b>bank</b> with intervening ditch. The timber structure was radiocarbon-dated to 390-370 BCE, so all of the earthworks may date to that period. Such dates confound the once popular theory that the earthworks were made in imitation of the Roman frontier in northern Britain.|$|R
