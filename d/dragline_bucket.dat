50|$|A <b>dragline</b> <b>bucket</b> system {{consists}} of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom (a large truss-like structure) with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered {{by means of a}} number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The dragrope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuver of the hoist and the dragropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. A schematic of a large <b>dragline</b> <b>bucket</b> system is shown below.|$|E

They wield a large-volume bucket that is cast out toward the material {{that needs to be}} relocated using a football field-length boom and powerful swing motors and transmissions. The bucket lands atop the material and its teeth quickly bite into the material. Powerful drag force is applied to fill the bucket, followed by powerful hoist and swing forces applied to dump the material away from the excavation site to.

50|$|The {{dragline}} {{was invented}} in 1904 by John W. Page (as a partner of the firm Page & Schnable Contracting) for use in digging the Chicago Canal. By 1912, Page realized that building draglines was more lucrative than contracting, so he created the Page Engineering Company to build draglines. Page built its first crude walking dragline in 1923. These used legs operated by rack and pinion on a separate frame that lifted the crane. The body was then pulled forward by chain on a roller track and then lowered again. Page developed the first diesel engines exclusively for dragline application in 1924. Page also invented the arched <b>dragline</b> <b>bucket,</b> a design still commonly used today by draglines from many other manufacturers, and in the 1960s pioneered an archless bucket design. With its walking mechanism badly behind that of competitor Monighan (see below), Page updated their mechanism to an eccentric drive in 1935. This much improved mechanism gave a proper elliptical motion and was used until 1988. Page modernized its draglines further with the 700 series in 1954. Page's largest dragline was the Model 757 delivered to the Obed Mine near Hinton, Alberta in 1983. It featured a 75-yard bucket on a 298-foot boom and an operating weight of 4,500 tons. In 1988, Harnischfeger Corporation (P&H Mining Equipment) purchased Page Engineering Company.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} automation of <b>dragline</b> <b>bucket</b> excavators used to strip over-burden from open cut mines. In particular the automatic control of bucket carry angle and bucket trajectory are addressed. Open-loop dynamics of a 1 : 20 scale model <b>dragline</b> <b>bucket</b> are identified, through measurement of frequency response between carry angle and drag motor input voltage. A strategy for automatic control of carry angle is devised and implemented using bucket angle and rate feedback. System compensation and tuning are explained and closed loop frequency and time responses are measured...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. <b>Dragline</b> <b>bucket</b> {{designers}} {{are required to}} evaluate new bucket designs by building and testing scale buckets. Concerns about the reliability and accuracy of scale testing have been raised in recent years, {{but there was no}} alternative. However, recent advances in computing power and granular flow modeling are changing this and, we are entering an era where it is possible to numerically simulate <b>dragline</b> <b>bucket</b> filling. However, verification of the numerical simulation is necessary before useable data can be obtained. This thesis explains the algorithm used by modern discrete element codes to simulate granular materials. The process used to create the numerical model and calibrate the material will be discussed. An experimental test bench was also built to record experimental data for the verification the numerical model. As the project progressed {{it became clear that the}} time needed to run a single simulation dramatically limits the number of simulations that could be run. Consequently, different approaches that could reduce simulation time were also investigated. Unlike the other material parameters, there is no test that can be used to directly calibrate the damping. An array of numerical simulations were therefore conducted testing different damping schemes. The comparison performed between the numerical and experimental data showed that the numerical models could not accurately simulate the experimental measurements of the scale model <b>dragline</b> <b>bucket.</b> The numerical model did, however, predict many of the trends identified in the experimental simulation. With more realistic contact models and better computer facilities, nonetheless, it is highly probable that numerical models will be capable of simulating <b>dragline</b> <b>bucket</b> filling accurately. Further study is, therefore, justified...|$|E

50|$|During {{its first}} 30 years, ESCO was mainly a {{regional}} supplier of cast steel alloy {{products for the}} logging, construction, and {{pulp and paper industry}} throughout the Pacific Northwest. In the 1920s, the company expanded production to include cast steel alloy products like the Bardon choker hook, widely used in forestry. Further growth was sparked by the use of Hadfield manganese steel and the production of <b>dragline</b> excavator <b>buckets.</b> The ESCO trademark was first used in 1926 and eventually became the company’s new name.|$|R
50|$|On crane-type <b>draglines,</b> the <b>bucket</b> {{can also}} be 'thrown' by winding up to the jib and then {{releasing}} a clutch on the drag cable. This would then swing the bucket like a pendulum. Once the bucket had passed the vertical, the hoist cable would be released thus throwing the <b>bucket.</b> On smaller <b>draglines,</b> a skilled operator could make the bucket land about one-half {{the length of the}} jib further away than if it had just been dropped. On larger draglines, this is not a common practice.|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of chaotic instabilities is investigated {{in the swing}} motion of a <b>dragline</b> <b>bucket</b> during operation cycles. A dragline is a large, powerful, rotating multibody system utilised in the mining industry for removal of overburden. A simplified representative model of the dragline is developed {{in the form of}} a fundamental non-linear rotating multibody system with energy dissipation. An analytical predictive criterion for the onset of chaotic instability is then obtained in terms of critical system parameters using Melnikov 2 ̆ 7 s method. The model is shown to exhibit chaotic instability due to a harmonic slew torque for a range of amplitudes and frequencies. These chaotic instabilities could introduce irregularities into the motion of the dragline system, rendering the system difficult to control by the operator and/or would have undesirable effects on dragline productivity and fatigue lifetime. The sufficient analytical criterion for the onset of chaotic instability is shown to be a useful predictor of the phenomenon under steady and unsteady slewing conditions via comparisons with numerical results.

40|$|Draglines are {{the most}} {{expensive}} pieces of equipment used in coal mines {{at a cost of}} $ 50 M to $ 100 M each. Improving their productivity will produce major benefits to the coal mining industry. The dynamic behaviour of the dragline structure has a significant effect on the fatigue life of the main components of a dragline and related maintenance costs. This paper describes the field tests conducted on the dragline DRE 23 at the Peak Down coal mine, Queensland, Australia. Sixteen accelerometers were installed on the dragline boom and mast. Three different excitation methods were used in the test: 5. 4 -kg impact hammer, <b>dragline</b> <b>bucket</b> impulse and ambient excitations produced during normal operation. The aim of the modal testing was set to explore the six global modes for the dragline boom structure. The results showed that the impact hammer excitation was not adequate to excite any of the global modes. The excitation produced by bucket impulse was powerful but was difficult to control. The output-only identification using the response to the ambient excitation was promising but it was difficult to identify all targeted global modes...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} {{methods for}} removing <b>dragline</b> <b>bucket</b> wire rope terminations {{with the objective}} of finding efficient methods that are safer than the method most commonly used at U. S. surface mines, which is to use the explosive impact of a projectile fired from a cannon to remove the rope termination. Removal of a wire rope termination for repair or replacement requires separation of the wedge and socket that lock together to secure the rope end. The Bureau investigated currently used methods and improved upon and tested two safer alternate methods for removing wire rope terminations. A cannon test program was conducted, using 40 -and 50 -gr primer (detonating) cord, to establish the possible force produced with a 4 -in-bore cannon and a 55 -lb projectile. Wedge and socket units supplied from cooperating mines were separated under controlled conditions to establish data on separation force requirements. The two alternate methods investigated were use of the force generated by (1) a pendulum ram and by (2) a portable hydraulic pusher. Both methods are capable of providing sufficient force to effect wedge and socket separations on draglines with up to 78 -yd 3 buckets under normal conditions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} measuring the in-bucket payload volume on a dragline excavator {{for the purpose of}} estimating the material's bulk density in real-time. Knowledge of the payload's bulk density can provide feedback to mine planning and scheduling to improve blasting and therefore provide a more uniform bulk density across the excavation site. This allows a single optimal bucket size to be used for maximum overburden removal per dig and in turn reduce costs and emissions in dragline operation and maintenance. The proposed solution uses a range bearing laser to locate and scan full buckets between the lift and dump stages of the <b>dragline</b> cycle. The <b>bucket</b> is segmented from the scene using cluster analysis, and the pose of the bucket is calculated using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Payload points are identified using a known model and subsequently converted into a height grid for volume estimation. Results from both scaled and full scale implementations show that this method can achieve an accuracy of above 95...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} mining coal by the {{mountain}} top removal (MTR) process can create gently rolling land {{that may be}} used for multiple purposes that provide economic diversity for the Eastern Kentucky Coal Field region, part of the Appalachian Plateau physiographic province. A major limiting factor of postmine development is the settlement of mine spoils over time. Between 1981 and 1996, approximately 1, 000 acres of land were mined at the Star Fire Mine in Perry, Breathitt, and Knott counties by MTR processes using shovel and truck, and a 64 -yd 3 <b>bucket</b> <b>dragline</b> (Fig. 1).
