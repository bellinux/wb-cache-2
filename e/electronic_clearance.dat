The use of information technology construction of airport economic zone electronic port information platform helps to promote financial electronic, trade <b>electronic,</b> customs <b>clearance</b> <b>electronic</b> and tax electronic develop-ment and integration. This paper firstly analyzes the main business requirements and application module of the electronic port information platform, and then puts forward the overall structure and network topology structure of the information platform and analyzes the main application system of the information platform. The application of airport economic zone electronic port information platform helps to realize the interaction among airport economic zone information flow, capi-tal flow and logistics, realize the enterprise online customs clearance, improve customs clearance speed, reduce trade cost and improve enterprise competitiveness...|$|R
50|$|At MIT, Gupta led {{a team of}} {{researchers}} to develop technology to automatically read handwritten information on checks and proposed a nationwide check clearance system, allowing the <b>electronic</b> <b>clearance</b> of printed, typed, and handwritten checks. This innovation is manifested in the Check 21 system in the U.S. and in similar approaches in Singapore, and Brazil. Gupta and his colleagues also developed the first microcomputer-based image database management system.|$|E

In the procedure known as remote deposit, a depositor would make an image of the physical cheque with a smartphone or other device, and attach the image to a deposit. The depositing bank would use the cheque image in the normal <b>electronic</b> <b>clearance</b> process, though in this case MICR data is not available.|$|E
50|$|Customs Clearance: The custom {{agencies}} {{responsible for}} the Port are: the Tianjin Xingang Customs (天津新港海关), headquartered at the Container Logistics Center; the Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone Customs (天津港保税区海关), headquartered at the FTZ, and the Dongjiang Bonded Port Customs (东疆保税港区海关), headquartered at the Dongjiang Joint Inspection Center. All are subordinate units of Tianjin Customs (天津海关), which is {{responsible for the}} declaration, inspection, and duties collection for all international cargo, trade goods, luggage and postal items passing through the Port. This involves processing more than 1,52 million clearance forms a year, and efforts to streamline the process and to foster EDI use and other forms of <b>electronic</b> <b>clearance</b> are a continuous theme for Port reform.|$|E

40|$|Enhancing {{air traffic}} {{capacity}} while providing safety improvements constitutes the major challenge facing Air Traffic Management (ATM). However, the growth forecasts for air traffic in Europe {{and in the}} United States over the next fifteen years suggest that solely improving the ground component of ATM might {{not be sufficient to}} achieve the required capacity at appropriate safety levels. The development of a close co-operation between ground and airborne sides might be required to achieve this challenge. The Evolutionary Air-ground Co-operative ATM Concepts (EACAC) study of the Freer Flight project is investigating the delegation by the controller to the pilot, of some tasks related to separation assurance [5][6]. Starting from the analogy of visual clearances, EACAC is investigating the possibility of giving <b>electronic</b> <b>clearances</b> both in en-route airspace and in terminal areas. It takes advantage of emerging CNS/ATM technologies in pre-operational state – ADS-B or TIS-B [3] – along with additional avionics such as a Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) [4] or an Airborne Separation Assurance System (ASAS). EACAC targets near term applications – typically 2005 – taking place in current ATC organisations, {{while at the same time}} proposing long-term developments. This principle goes in line with th...|$|R

40|$|Technological {{innovations}} {{have recently}} changed {{many of the}} ways the private trucking industry operates. These changes have enabled trucking firms to monitor more closely the distribution of goods and services, improve productivity, and develop higher levels of customer satisfaction. Of these innovations, ITS related applications {{play an important role}} in creating benefits for the private sector. ITS technologies are also increasingly offering the potential to bring about change to state and national agencies charged with overseeing goods movement in trucking. Recent research has shown that public agencies may be able to significantly reduce costs through the adoption of certain ITS applications. Given the facts that the private sector has been experiencing the benefits brought about by innovations in transportation and ITS, experience in the private sector may offer guidance to public agencies wishing to adopt a given ITS technology. Despite the fact that the public and private sectors often use technologies in different ways, categories of benefits may be similar, and lessons from implementation may be transferable between the two. This report gives a brief overview of the studied benefits of ITS to private firms and the experienced and expected benefits to the public sector. As specific examples of the ways in which technology has changed the way private trucking firms operate, <b>Electronic</b> <b>clearance</b> and supply chain management are looked at. <b>Electronic</b> <b>clearance</b> is an ITS application that allows trucks to use transponders to move through vehicle inspections stations and border crossing with minimal delay. Supply chain management is a concept increasingly employed by private firms to increase productivity. Though not directly associated with ITS applications, supply chain management relies largely on technology-based process monitoring to realize its benefits. Public agencies may be able to extract some valuable lessons from supply chain management in the potential to apply its principles to vehicle operations and regulatory oversight. ...|$|E

However comprehensive efforts are required to implement, the provision related to single inquiry point which may require software compatibility among various agencies involved apart from addressing the infrastructural constraints. In case of GATT Article VIII which deals with issues related to fees and charges and import and export formalities and documentation requirements most of the provisions are in place but efforts are required to improve the border agency coordination.

The objectives of this research are to identify the factors that cause the product delivery delay to the customers, to analyze the causes that may contribute to product delivery delay and to suggest the solution to overcome the problems occurred in product delivery delay in SSCSM. The structured interview {{was done with the}} respective workers and was supported from documents review in order to support the analysis. The interviewees selection are very keen to carry out as the researcher only choose the experience workers who are directly involve in this product distribution. The structured interview can be analyzed using tools: Cause and Effect Diagram and Pareto chart. The finding revealed that the tools can determine the delays in terms of factors and causes through systematical analysis with more accurately. The finding also reveals that the factor that contributes to the delays in physical distribution is due to the inefficient of transportation system and the cause is due to vessel delay. In order to avoid this problem occurred in the future, the researchers recommended SSCSM to have integration of information technology and logistics management with shipping liners, to suggest port terminal to implement the usage of <b>Electronic</b> Port <b>Clearance</b> to increase their port productivity and efficiency, implementation of a system for maritime exchange of information from ship to shore, shore to ship and between all stakeholders, using service such as Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) will facilitate safer and more expedient navigation and logistic operations, whereby improving maritime transport integration with other transport modes, measuring port performance based on Port Performance Indicators (PPI) and targeting towards training program development...|$|R
