30|$|<b>Distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>technologies</b> (DLT)—with Blockchain as {{the most}} {{prominent}} example—allows for a distributed, transparent tracing of transactions, assets, and contributions and {{reduce the need for}} intermediaries such as banks and brokers, and centralized monitoring and control as with governmental agencies (Iansiti and Lakhani 2017). DLT also provide means for tracing and managing digital property rights, as well as automate important performance and incentive management processes in organizations. DLT enable enhanced transparency and mutual monitoring which are essential mechanisms in market and community governance (Arrow 1974; Bowles and Gintis 2002; Lerner and Tirole 2002; Stiglitz 1990) and may lessen the need for hierarchical control in collective action and exchange.|$|R
5000|$|The {{system is}} peer-to-peer, with {{transactions}} taking place directly between users {{and with an}} Coordinator intermediary. Transactions are considered confirmed when the Coordinator has included the transaction in its set of released milestones. In order to send a transaction, a user must validate two other transactions on the network. A sent transaction must accumulate a sufficient level of verification (i.e. must be validated {{a sufficient number of}} times by other users) in order to be accepted as “confirmed” by its recipient. The system works with a central or single administrator called the Coordinator, without which the network is not sufficiently secured in its early stages. The Coordinator is meant to be removed later when network is sufficiently large.

30|$|A {{bottom-up}} approach like the cellular concept (Benz et al., 2015) {{is able to}} face the increasing complexity in the system. According to the cellular concept, locally limited areas consisting of electrical producers, consumers and storages form an energy cell.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to provide the reader an overview of the <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>technology</b> (DLT), its fundamental challenges, the current and potential future uses in the financial industry, and to suggest future fields of the topic to be researched. The first task of this thesis is trying to answer, “how will the <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>technology</b> impact the financial industry”. Although the thesis will not cover exhaustively all the financial industry’s needs towards the <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>technology,</b> it will give an overview of the DLTs probable usage in the industry. By reading the thesis and especially its use cases from the fields of private equity, and settlement and clearing of public securities’ trading, the reader should get a more accurate answer to the secondary question “how can the public securities and private equity markets use <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>technology</b> in the near future”. The question about the distributed ledger technology’s impact on the whole market is complicated. Despite the amount of financing this technology has acquired in the recent years, there are no new, disruptive or widespread usages for the DLT in the financial industry. However, it is expected that during the next five years, the DLTs become reality. This is due to their enormous potentiality in security, efficiency and automation, which all could save the financial industry up to 50 % of their current costs. Additionally, during the same time period, it is highly expectable that some financial service applications, basing on the DLT, will be presented for the consumers by the players from outside the traditional markets. To answer the secondary question, the both markets will face significant changes during the upcoming years: public securities’ post-trade processes will benefit from the more secure and rapid settlement, whereas the private equity market’s whole nature can become a more accessible for both the investors and the businesses seeking for financing...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{technology}} is changing, and {{has changed the}} ways we create and consume narratives, from moving images and immersive storyworlds to digital long-form and multi-branched story experiences. At the same time, blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, is revolutionizing the way that transactions and exchanges occur. As a globally stored and collaboratively written list of all transactions that have ever taken place within a given system, the blockchain decentralizes money and offers a platform for its creative use. There are already examples of blockchain technologies extending {{beyond the realm of}} currency, including the decentralization of domain name servers that are not subject to government takedown and identity management and governance. By framing key blockchain concepts with past and present storytelling practices, this article raises questions as to how the principles and implementation of such <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>technologies</b> might be used within contemporary writing practices - that is, can we imagine stories as a currency or value system? We present three experiments that draw on some of the fundamental principles of blockchain and Bitcoin, as an instantiation of a blockchain implemented application, namely, (1) the ledger, (2) the blocks and (3) the mining process. Each low-fi experiment was intentionally designed to be very accessible to take part in and understand and all were conducted as discrete workshops with different sets of participants. Participants included a cohort of design students, technology industry and design professionals and writing and interaction design academics. Each experiment raised a different set of reflections and subsequent questions on the nature of digital, the linearity (or not) of narratives and collaborative processes...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{information}} technology has {{contributed significantly to}} the evolution of financial markets, without, however, revolutionising the way in which financial institutions interact with one another. This may be about to change, as some market players are now predicting that new database technologies, such as blockchain and other <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>technologies</b> (DLTs), could be the source of an imminent revolution. This paper analyses the main features of DLTs that could influence their potential adoption by financial institutions and discusses how the use of these technologies could affect the European post-trade market for securities. The original protocol underlying DLTs {{has its roots in the}} anarchic world of virtual currencies, which operate outside the conventional financial system. The public debate on DLTs has also been very much focused on the revolutionary potential of the technology. This paper concludes that, irrespective of the technology used and the market players involved, certain processes that feature in the post-trade market for securities will still need to be performed by institutions. DLTs could, however, stimulate a reorganisation of financial markets, which could in turn: (i) reduce reconciliation costs, (ii) streamline the post-trade value chain, and (iii) allow more efficient use to be made of collateral and regulatory capital. It should, nevertheless, be remembered that research into DLTs and their uses is at an early stage. The scope for financial institutions to adopt DLTs and their potential impact on mainstream financial markets are still unclear. This paper discusses three potential models of how market players could adopt DLTs for performing core post-trade functions. The DLT could be adopted either: (i) in clusters, (ii) collectively, or (iii) peer to peer. The evaluation of the three adoption models assumes that they are all equally compatible with the regulatory framework. It shows that, assuming this to be the case, they would each have different advantages and costs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Distributed</b> <b>Ledgers</b> (e. g. Bitcoin) occupy {{currently}} the first {{lines of the}} economical and political media and many speculations are done {{with respect to their}} level of coherence and their computability power. Interestingly, there is no consensus on the properties and abstractions that fully capture the behaviour of <b>distributed</b> <b>ledgers.</b> The interest in formalising the behaviour of <b>distributed</b> <b>ledgers</b> is twofold. Firstly, it helps to prove the correctness of the algorithms that implement existing <b>distributed</b> <b>ledgers</b> and explore their limits with respect to an unfriendly environment and target applications. %Secondly, it facilitates the identification of the minimal building blocks necessary to implement the <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> in a specific environment. Even though the behaviour of <b>distributed</b> <b>ledgers</b> is similar to abstractions that have been deeply studied for decades in distributed systems no abstraction is sufficiently powerful to capture the <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> behaviour. This paper introduces the <b>Distributed</b> <b>Ledger</b> Register, a register that mimics the behaviour {{of one of the most}} popular <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger,</b> i. e. the Bitcoin ledger. The aim of our work is to provide formal guarantees on the coherent evolution of Bitcoin. We furthermore show that the Bitcoin blockchain maintenance algorithm verifies the <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> register properties under strict conditions. Moreover, we prove that the <b>Distributed</b> <b>Ledger</b> Register verifies the regularity register specification. It follows that the strongest coherency implemented by Bitcoin is regularity under strong assumptions (i. e. partial synchronous systems and sparse reads). This study contradicts the common belief that Bitcoin implements strong coherency criteria in a totally asynchronous system. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one that makes the connection between the <b>distributed</b> <b>ledgers</b> and the classical theory of distributed shared registers...|$|R
30|$|Congestion {{management}} in distribution grids {{is an important}} task for distribution grid operators, both from a financial and a technological perspective. Whereas large generation units and large controllable loads might in general be controllable in a manual way, this is no option for small distributed generators and loads. With flexibility control in multiple owner scenarios, documentation, transparency and automation are of crucial importance. In this work, we present a fully automated congestion management approach based {{on a combination of}} <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>technology</b> and distributed algorithms in an agent-based architectural approach. We present a case study focused on the visualization of the concept and discuss the advantages and possible challenges for this approach. Whereas <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>technology</b> has been introduced for peer-to-peer energy trading within the last years, no similar approach has been presented yet for stable distribution grid management.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{therefore}} propose a fully automated congestion management system for distribution grid operation based on <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>technology</b> and intelligent agents by presenting {{a case study}} for an exemplary simplified scenario.
