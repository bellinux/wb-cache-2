The dynamic responses <b>of</b> the two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> gear <b>impact</b> models are compared by experimental and numerical analysis. Firstly, establish the motion equations of the two models. Secondly, verify the correctness of the mechanical models through experimental analysis. Comparing {{the results of the}} numerical and experimental analysis, we can find that the intensity noise of gear vibration is reduced by the elastic boundary.

2500|$|Due to {{corporate}} {{interest in the}} film surrounding its theme of promoting understanding between different groups, and its inclusion of violence and threats of greater conflict along with the romance of Pocahontas and John Smith, Schwartz became heavily involved in the storytelling. Bannerman estimated that he spent a week {{with one of the}} screenwriters and helped work out the overall themes of tolerance and cooperation. In June 1992, Schwartz researched Jamestown, Virginia where he absorbed the atmosphere and bought tapes of Native American music and English sea shanties and other music from the early seventeenth century that helped inspire numbers in the film. Schwartz modeled his lyrical writing for people of other ethnicities on that of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick. [...] "Colors of the Wind" [...] was the first song to be written for the film. Gabriel, Goldberg, and Pentecost insisted that the song help define the film's [...] "heart and soul". Schwartz began [...] "Colors" [...] with a few draft ideas for lyrics taking inspiration from Chief Seattle's letter to the United States Congress. Then, Menken wrote the melody with Schwartz listening at the piano and making suggestions. Schwartz would add lyrics before a session together where they were refined. [...] "Just Around the Riverbend", also composed by Menken and Schwartz, was devised by Schwartz's wife Carole, with the idea that Pocahontas would have a recurring dream that suggested something coming her way, paving the way for her [...] "I want" [...] song. The song almost did not make it into the completed film when Disney executives doubted whether her song would have the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> they wanted at that point. However, Schwartz stated he and Menken [...] "believed in it very strongly. Indeed, at one point we wrote a different song for that spot, but Alan and I were never as happy with the second song and ultimately everybody at Disney came to feel that way, too." ...|$|E
