To achieve the latter, loose commercial nanofiltration (NF) membranes were selected (Desal 51 HL, N 30 F and NF 270). To realize a high removal of organic compounds, combined with a low salt rejection, cascades of NF stages are proposed. Experiments with pesticides (aldrin, atrazine, bentazone, dieldrin, and propazine) and NaCl confirmed that a nearly complete rejection of pesticides is possible, depending on specific properties of the solutes such as molecular size and chemical structure (e. g. hydrophobicity). Salt rejection was highly dependent on the specifications of the membrane and on the ion charge, and ranged from low to high values. Through modeling based on transport equations and mass balances, it was shown that the separation was significantly improved by adopting the principle of an <b>integrated</b> <b>cascade</b> of NF membranes. status: publishe...|$|E

For small scale power generation, DC voltage from both technologies {{is low and}} requires step-up converter to raise DC voltage ratio before converted into AC voltage.

40|$|As in {{all other}} {{eukaryotic}} organisms, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers the evolutionarily conserved unfolded protein response in soybean, but it also communicates with other adaptive signaling responses, such as osmotic stress-induced and ER stress-induced programmed cell death. These two signaling pathways converge {{at the level of}} gene transcription to activate an <b>integrated</b> <b>cascade</b> that is mediated by N-rich proteins (NRPs). Here, we describe a novel transcription factor, GmERD 15 (Glycine max Early Responsive to Dehydration 15), which is induced by ER stress and osmotic stress to activate the expression of NRP genes. GmERD 15 was isolated because of its capacity to stably associate with the NRP-B promoter in yeast. It specifically binds to a 187 -bp fragment of the NRP-B promoter in vitro and activates the transcription of a reporter gene in yeast. Furthermore, GmERD 15 was found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and a ChIP assay revealed that it binds to the NRP-B promoter in vivo. Expression of GmERD 15 in soybean protoplasts activated the NRP-B promoter and induced expression of the NRP-B gene. Collectively, these results support the interpretation that GmERD 15 functions as an upstream component of stress-induced NRP-B-mediated signaling to connect stress in the ER to an osmotic stress-induced cell death signal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Montgomery modular {{multiplication}} {{constitutes the}} -metic foundation " of modern public-key cryptography with applications ranging from RSA, DSA and Diffie-Hellman over elliptic curve schemes to pairing-based cryptosystems. The increased prevalence of SIMD-type instructions in commodity processors (e. g.

In this paper, we introduce the Cascade Operand Scanning (COS) method to speed up multi-precision multiplication on SIMD architectures. We developed the COS technique {{with the goal of}} reducing Read-After-Write (RAW) dependencies in the propagation of carries, which also reduces the number of pipeline stalls (i. e. bubbles). The COS method operates on 32 -bit words in a row-wise fashion (similar to the operand-scanning method) and does not require a -canonical " representation of operands with a reduced radix. We show that two COS computations can be " integrated into an efficient vectorized variant of Montgomery multiplication, which we call Coarsely <b>Integrated</b> <b>Cascade</b> Operand Scanning (CICOS) method.

40|$|High {{resolution}} {{rain rate}} time series derived from disdrometer measurements are analyzed on an event-by-event basis. The rain rate process {{is found to}} be an <b>integrated</b> non-stationary <b>cascade</b> (H= 0. 53 in the framework of Universal Multifractals). This result is in contradiction with the usual modeling of rain rate time series as pure stationary multiplicative cascades (H= 0) based on daily or hourly measurements. In order to resolve this apparent difficulty, we show that, at these low resolutions, multifractal analysis techniques are profoundly biased by rain on-off intermittency. Therefore a new model for rain rate time series is proposed. The latter is based on an <b>integrated</b> multiplicative <b>cascade</b> thresholded in order to reproduce rain on-off intermittency. These synthetic time series are able to reproduce correctly the fractal dimension of rain periods, the non-stationarity of rain rate at high resolution and the artificial stationary multiplicative cascade when only low resolutions are considered. Finally, the analysis of non-intermittent radar rain maps leads to the same conclusion in space, although the value H is lower, which could be explain by the uncertainty of the relation between rain rates and radar reflectivities...|$|R
40|$|Discriminative methods often {{generate}} hand poses kinematically implausible, then generative {{methods are}} used to correct (or verify) these results in a hybrid method. Estimating 3 D hand pose in a hierarchy, where the high-dimensional output space is decomposed into smaller ones, has been shown effective. Existing hierarchical methods mainly focus on the decomposition of the output space while the input space remains almost the same along the hierarchy. In this paper, a hybrid hand pose estimation method is proposed by applying the kinematic hierarchy strategy to the input space (as well as the output space) of the discriminative method by a spatial attention mechanism and to the optimization of the generative method by hierarchical Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The spatial attention mechanism <b>integrates</b> <b>cascaded</b> and hierarchical regression into a CNN framework by transforming both the input(and feature space) and the output space, which greatly reduces the viewpoint and articulation variations.

Cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and differentiation are integral processes that are precisely regulated. Normal epithelial cells depend on the formation of intercellular adhesion contacts to form a continuous sheet of stratifying cell layers that are attached to one and other horizontally and vertically.

The mid-IR application space is summarized, and the current practice based on the optical parametric oscillators and solid state Raman lasers is discussed. Relevant properties of silicon are compared with popular Raman crystals, and linear and nonlinear transmission measurements of silicon in the mid-IR are presented. It is shown that the absence of the nonlinear losses, which severely limit the performance of the recently demonstrated silicon lasers in the near IR, combined with unsurpassed crystal quality, high thermal conductivity and excellent optical damage threshold render silicon a very attractive Raman medium, even when compared to the very best Raman crystals. In addition, silicon photonic technology, offering integrated low-loss waveguides and microcavities, offers additional advantages over today’s bulk crystal Raman laser technology.

40|$|<b>Integrated</b> <b>cascades</b> {{of protein}} {{tyrosine}} and serine/threonine phosphorylation play essential roles in transducing signals {{in response to}} growth factors and cytokines. How adaptor or scaffold proteins assemble signaling complexes through both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues to regulate specific signaling pathways and biological responses is unclear. We show in multiple cell types that endogenous 14 - 3 - 3 zeta is phosphorylated on Tyr(179) in response to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Importantly, 14 - 3 - 3 zeta can function as an intermolecular bridge that couples to phosphoserine residues and also directly binds the SH 2 domain of Shc via Tyr(179). The assembly of these 14 - 3 - 3 :Shc scaffolds is specifically required for the recruitment of a phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase signaling complex and the regulation of CTL-EN cell survival in response to cytokine. The biological significance of these findings was further demonstrated using primary bone marrow-derived mast cells from 14 - 3 - 3 zeta(-/-) mice. We show that cytokine was able to promote Akt phosphorylation and viability of primary mast cells derived from 14 - 3 - 3 zeta(-/-) mice when reconstituted with wild type 14 - 3 - 3 zeta, but the Akt phosphorylation and survival response was reduced in cells reconstituted with the Y 179 F mutant. Together, these results show that 14 - 3 - 3 :Shc scaffolds can act as multivalent signaling nodes for the integration of both phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine pathways to regulate specific cellular responses.

Specifically, ER-to-Golgi transport activates the KDEL receptor at the Golgi, which triggers a cascade that involves Gs and adenylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase isoforms and then PKA activation and results in the phosphorylation of transport machinery proteins. This induces retrograde traffic to the ER and balances transport fluxes between the ER and Golgi.
