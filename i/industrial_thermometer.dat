40|$|Whispering gallery (WG) mode {{resonators}} {{were studied}} since 1980 s for precision clock oscillators and for cavity quantum electrodynamics studies. They are {{a kind of}} stable, high Q, microwave resonators where a symmetric dielectric medium, such as a cylinder or a disk, is suspended in the centre of a metal cavity. A coaxial cable or a waveguide are used to couple the EM field in the microwave region and thus to excite the system resonant frequencies. WG modes are resonant modes of higher-order azimuthal number (m) having most of the EM energy concentrated on the dielectric surface. Within the temperature range of - 196 °C to 500 °C the most commonly used <b>industrial</b> <b>thermometer</b> is platinum resistance thermometer (PRT) with the uncertainties of 10 mK. The PRT offers high accuracy, low drift, a wide operating range; however, it is very sensitive to mechanical shock in handing and shipping. Besides, an AC resistance bridge which is typically required as a readout device for PRT is very expensive. Accordingly, there is a great need for a stability-improved, resistant to mechanical shock, potential lower uncertainty and cost-effective <b>industrial</b> <b>thermometer.</b> WGMR thermometer (WGMRT) is a new kind of thermometer which offers greater vibration immunity, improved stability, smaller uncertainty in temperature measurement and potential lower cost than platinum resistance thermometry. An innovative sapphire whispering gallery thermometer (SWGT) was first explored at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2007 by Strouse [1] with the uncertainty less than 10 mK. Five WGMs with nominal resonant frequencies ranging from 14. 4 GHz to 19. 1 GHz and with Q-factors, respectively, ranging from 20, 000 to 90, 000 were measured within the temperature range of 0 °C to 100 °C. The accuracies of his WGMTs were in the range of ± 0. 02 °C and ice point repeatability was better than 2 mK. The thesis reports the tests performed on several WGMR thermometers which have different shapes of crystals to evaluate their stability, resolution and repeatability in the temperature range of - 40 °C to 85 °C. Thermal cycle experimental results IV showed a Q in excess of 100000 for the mode with the highest azimuthal number, making it possible to achieve a potential temperature resolution of 0. 1 mK. Besides, different specimens of crystals with the same nominal specification and reassemble for the same specimen were both tested to check the reproducibility of the thermometer. The birefringence of the sapphire was also studied to make an innovative thermometer. The ratios of two doublet frequencies are sensitive to the temperature-dependent birefringence of the crystal and relatively insensitive to surface contamination and changes {{in the shape of the}} cavity. Besides, it can have an external shape that closely approximates the shape of conventional platinum resistance thermometer...|$|E

40|$|We devised {{calibration}} procedure for <b>industrial</b> <b>thermometers</b> by a comparison method at {{the boiling point}} of nitrogen (~- 196 °C). The uncertainty of the calibration was 4 mK (k = 2). As experimentally demonstrated in this work, {{the effect of the}} atmospheric pressure on the boiling point of nitrogen can be easily detected by the thermometer. Therefore, when the boiling point of nitrogen is used for calibration of thermometer by comparison, either a reference thermometer must be used to provide the reference temperature or the effect of atmospheric pressure should be carefully considered. The use of a copper block with a large thermal mass soaked into the liquid nitrogen was proven to be more reliable, and the stability of the temperature immersed into the copper block was 1. 4 mK.

40|$|Abstract. The most {{practical}} method of interpolation for <b>industrial</b> platinum <b>thermometers</b> {{is the use}} of the Callendar-Van Dusen second-order equation. Standard tables R(T) for IPRTs of different purity of the platinum wire were established by number of Standards (IEC, DIN, GOST, JIS). From fitting the coefficients B vs. A of the CVD equations, obtained for 166 thermometers with W(100) ranging from 1. 380 to 1. 392, the linear function B(A) was generated in this work, which makes it possible to establish the second-order reference function for PRTs of any nominal W(100) value. It is important, that substantial distortion of the interpolating CVD curves was found for the IPRTs with film platinum sensing elements. Although the ITS- 90 interpolation method is supposed to be applied only to the PRTs, that have a strain-free sensing element made of platinum wire of a very high purity (W(Ga) > 1. 11807), it has become usual practice to use the ITS- 90 function for <b>industrial</b> <b>thermometers.</b> As shown in the paper, a systematic difference occurs between temperature values calculated by means of the CVD equation and the ITS- 90 interpolation technique, which does not depend on the purity of the platinum wire in a large W(100) range, but highly depends on the temperature sub-range. For individual calibration of an IPRT in the sub-range 0 - 230 °C, it is possible to use only one calibration point, besides 0 °C...|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} of the flue-gas in the post combustion zone of a waste to energy (WTE) plant has to be maintained within a fairly narrow range of values, the minimum of which is prescribed by the European Waste Directive 2000 / 76 /CE, whereas the maximum value must be such as to ensure {{the preservation of the}} materials and the energy efficiency of the plant. A high degree of accuracy in measuring and controlling the aforementioned temperature is therefore required. In almost the totality of WTE plants this measurement process is carried out by using practical <b>industrial</b> <b>thermometers,</b> such as bare thermocouples and infrared radiation (IR) pyrometers, even if affected by different physical contributions which can make the gas temperature measurements incorrect.

40|$|We have {{designed}} low noise temperature sensing and control units {{with the objective}} of using them for the fabrication of far infrared active cavity radiometers. The sensing unit, first characterized at 300 K using <b>industrial</b> platinium resistance <b>thermometers,</b> has a noise level of ∼ 25 − 30 µKeff for a 3 hours measuring time and in a 1 Hz bandwidth. Using YBCO superconducting thermometers, the noise level goes down to 2. 5 µKeff, which is strongly limited by excess 1 /f noise in the YBCO film at the superconducting transition. The sample holder used in the 90 K experiments is built with an auxiliary heating resistor, which enables an easy and accurate identification of the electrothermal model, even in the closed loop operation. Based on a design previously published by NIST, we estimate from these experimental results that the overall noise limitations of radiometers could be lowered by one order of magnitude.

The maximum enhancement occurred for a radius ratio of 1. 4 and ventilation factors between 0. 2 and 0. 3. It was found that shroud orientation influenced the heat transfer, with maximum heat transfer generally occurring when the shroud's holes were centered {{on either side of the}} stagnation line.

40|$|For non–ventilated air {{temperature}} measurements at weather stations, both ambient wind speed and solar radiation {{are known to}} affect the magnitude of {{air temperature}} measurement errors. The objective {{of this study is}} to explore the effect of the sensor’s housing and to quantify any stagnation or conduction errors. The HMP 45 C temperature and relative humidity sensor with a Gill radiation shield is widely used in remote monitoring sites. The use of a filter in the HMP 45 C leads to loss of ventilation, while the protrusion of the sensor housing below the Gill shield exposes it to radiation loading and potentially increased conduction of heat to the sensor. The HMP 45 C sensors were deployed with and without an air filter in both standard Gill shields and in a Gill shield modified with extra plates to completely cover the base of the sensor housing. The data collected were examined using spectral analysis and statistical methods. Results show that both average air temperature errors and variations of air temperature errors were smaller in the HMP 45 C sensors when the manufacturer–supplied air filter was removed. The ranges of the three–sigma errors can be decreased by 0. 4 °C to 0. 7 °C and the accuracy of monthly average air temperature can be improved at least 0. 1 °C by employing an HMP 45 C without the air filter. Results suggest that the maximum air temperature taken with the filter may reach more than 1. 0 °C higher than that taken without the filter. The major frequency component contributing to air temperature errors using the HMP 45 C sensor in the Gill shield is the frequency of one day per cycle, which is expected. Partial radiation blocking combined with aspiration significantly reduces the contribution of the one–day cycle. In field tests, the R. M.
