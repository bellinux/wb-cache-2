40|$|Nowadays, {{deforestation}} of {{territories and}} degradation of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> {{is a global}} problem as it leads to a climate change, soil degradation, the decline in natural reproduction of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> and to the disappearance of many valuable species of forest cultures. Due {{to the importance of}} the preservation of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> for environment it is necessary to revise the conceptual approach to the reflection of such resources both at the micro- and at the macroeconomic level. Preservation, rational use and reproduction of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> is one of the priorities of forestry development inUkraine. Accounting is a tool which allows to form the information about the condition and availability of <b>forest</b> <b>resources.</b> In this regard, we consider that the accounting information is an important tool for the preservation of forest assets and the reduction of anthropogenic impacts on these slowly recovering natural resources. The reflection of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> in accounting should be implemented {{on the basis of the}} rules defined in the P(S) BU 30 called «Biological Assets» and IAS 41 called «Agriculture». In addition, we consider that while reflecting of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> in accounting it’s necessary to take into account the life cycle of the tree stand which consists of several stages where each one should be taken into account in the recognition of expenses on their reproduction. For the formation of analytical cuts of the costs of care for the <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> and their protection is proposed to open the following 3 sub-accounts to the account 155 called «Expenses on the formation of forest resources»: the first is «Expenses on the landing of forest cultures», the second is «Expenses on care for forest resources» and the third one is «Expenses on the protection of forest resources». Sustainable forest management involves the reproduction of <b>forest</b> <b>resources.</b> One of the main criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of forest management on the basis of sustainable development is the increasing of their productivity, the achievement and maintenance of high level of sanitary state of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> and provision of stable viability of forest ecosystems providing appropriate security and protection of <b>forest</b> <b>resources.</b> The proposed method of accounting of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> matches to the basic principles of the concept of sustainable development as it allows to generate the information about the reproduction of natural capital in the system of accounting and business entities reporting. The proposed changes in accounting will improve the enterprise management system of forest complex by forming the complete and reliable information about the availability and condition of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> and <b>forest</b> products. They will also provide the advantages to enterprises during participating in tenders when implementing of wood and the products of its recycling as they are confirmed by the legal origin of wood...|$|R
