40|$|National Security AffairsDuring {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{remarkable}} increase in attention paid to multinational military forces. The idea of UN standing multinational <b>maritime</b> <b>forces</b> has emerged as a potentially important contributor to international peace, order and stability. The assignment of national contingents to such a force on a standing basis seems desirable, but so far there has been no international consensus on the establishment such as this force. This thesis proposes that a UN Standing Multinational <b>Maritime</b> <b>Force</b> can be an important contributor to international security. Establishing a UN standing Multinational <b>Maritime</b> <b>Force</b> raises a central question: is it possible to establish a UN standing multinational <b>maritime</b> <b>force?</b> What are the problems and constraints of such force in the UN context? The point of this thesis {{is that there is a}} dilemma between realities and ideals, so that the establishment of a UN Standing Multinational <b>Maritime</b> <b>Force</b> seems to be a dream foreseeable only in the distant future. This thesis highlights the political constraints and problems that complicate the creation of a standing multinational <b>maritime</b> <b>force</b> in terms of UN naval missions and supporting tasks. Consequently, this thesis attempts to demonstrate that to establish a standing multinational <b>maritime</b> <b>force</b> within the UN organization is impossible unless these constraints and problems are solved.

50|$|The {{names of}} {{operations}} which are purely or primarily military in form, {{are given the}} prefix of either European Union Force (EUFOR), or European Union Naval Force (EUNAVFOR), for terrestrial and naval missions, respectively. EUFOR has been used four times so far: in the Republic of Macedonia from March 2003 to December 2003 as EUFOR Concordia, in Bosnia from 2004 as EUFOR Althea, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2006, and in Chad and the Central African Republic since 2007. These rapid reaction forces are subordinate to the European Union Military Staff, and complements other EU military forces such as Eurocorps, the European Gendarmerie Force, <b>European</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Force</b> and EU Battlegroups.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} post- 1989 {{organizational and}} capability adaptations of NATO and European naval command organizations. Specifically, this thesis examines how the adaptations of the Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe (STRIKFORSOUTH), the <b>European</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Force</b> (EUROMARFOR), and the Combined Amphibious Forces Mediterranean (CAFMED), {{as well as}} the definition of the European Multinational Maritime Force (EMMF) concept, strengthen the European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) within NATO and endow the European Union (EU) with a naval dimension. These organizational adaptations are intended to help the member nations of NATO and the EU meet evolving international security challenges. However, they have also raised significant questions about whether NATO European allies are willing to fund NATO's Defense Capabilities Initiative (DCI) to address military and naval deficiencies. The capabilities gap between the naval forces of the United States and those of NATO European allies poses noteworthy challenges, including interoerability. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|E
40|$|The Netherlands is {{geographically}} {{and historically}} highly {{concerned with the}} maritime domain. Major involvement in the Atalanta mission and the BeNeSam cooperation shows the Dutch encouragement to collaborate with other countries when covering the subject of maritime security. The current Dutch EU Presidency is after {{the introduction of the}} EUMSS a good opportunity to see what the Dutch are doing with the issue of maritime security at EU level. Therefore, maritime security on the EU level {{and the role of the}} Netherlands will be the focus of this thesis. This thesis will cover the subject of the increasing interest in maritime security on EU level. The Atalanta mission and the BeNeSam show the Dutch encouragement to collaborate with other countries within the domain of maritime security. Therefore, the topic of this thesis is <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> security and the role of the Netherlands. The research question is; what can the Netherlands ‘upload’ to <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> security cooperation? <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> security is something that is still developing and because of the new focus to maritime security in the EU, this thesis will also look how the Netherlands can shape <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> security cooperation at the moment.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the need for}} a Standing Amphibious Force in the Mediterranean (STAPHIBFORMED) and proposes a distinct <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>force,</b> under NATO auspices, to compliment US presence in the Mediterranean and, when necessary, to act as a substitute. The United States looks to simultaneously share some of the European regional security responsibility with its Al%Allies while still maintaining its influence with security matters. Concurrently, European nations have reduced their defense budgets and, in the spirit of Maastricht, look to rely on multinational defense organizations for both economic and political reasons. The STAPHIBFORMED concept is a mechanism for crisis response and peacekeeping operations that facilitates resource-sharing and permits Europeans to undertake some missions without direct US involvement. Such a force promotes a distinct European Security and Defense Identity, reflects the new NATO Strategic Concept, and helps to satisfy the American desire to share more of the European regional security burden with Europe.
