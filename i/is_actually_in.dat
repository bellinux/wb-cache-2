5|$|R Coronae Australis is an {{irregular}} variable star ranging from magnitudes 9.7 to 13.9. Blue-white, {{it is of}} spectral type B5IIIpe. A very young star, it is still accumulating interstellar material. It is obscured by, and illuminates, the surrounding nebula, NGC 6729, which brightens and darkens with it. The nebula is often compared to a comet for its appearance in a telescope, as its length is five times its width. S Coronae Australis is a G-class dwarf in the same field as R and is a T Tauri star. Nearby, another young variable star, TY Coronae Australis, illuminates another nebula: reflection nebula NGC 6726–7. TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8.7 and 12.4, and {{the brightness of the}} nebula varies with it. Blue-white, it is of spectral type B8e. The largest young stars in the region, R, S, T, TY and VV Coronae Australis, are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig–Haro objects, many of which have been identified nearby. Lying adjacent to the nebulosity is the globular cluster known as NGC 6723, which <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away.|$|E

25|$|The {{growth of}} the town in this eastwards (and to the north-east) {{direction}} continues to the present day, {{with little or no}} development especially to the south or west, to an extent that the traditional town centre (the medieval town) <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> the southwest corner of the entire settlement. It has also meant that the village of Ludford, immediately {{on the other side of}} the Teme at Ludford Bridge (itself at the foot of Lower Broad Street), remains a distinct community.|$|E
25|$|Africa has {{significant}} resources for generating energy in several forms (hydroelectric, reserves of petroleum and gas, coal production, uranium production, renewable energy such as solar and geothermal). The lack {{of development and}} infrastructure means that little of this potential <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> use today. The largest consumers of electric power in Africa are South Africa, Libya, Namibia, Egypt, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe, which each consume between 1000 and 5000 KWh/m2 per person, in contrast with African states such as Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Tanzania, where electricity consumption per person is negligible.|$|E

Marisa {{secretly}} flirts with Ray, who tells her they could take the medallion for themselves. Ray and Thomas then rescue the gun runner, who is wrapped in bandages, and return him to Mendoza. In private, he reveals himself to be Barnsby, telling Mendoza if he wants the rifles, he must hand over the McCalls. Meanwhile, Ray brags to Thomas and William of his plans with Marisa. Thomas goes to see Marisa, who says she was using Ray, hoping he would kill Mendoza, when she <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> love with Thomas.|$|E

25|$|To many retail investors, {{money market}} funds are confusingly similar to {{traditional}} bank demand deposits. Virtually all large {{money market funds}} offer check writing, ACH transfers, wiring of funds, associated debit and credit cards, detailed monthly statements of all cash transactions, copies of canceled checks, etc. This makes it appear that cash <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> the individual’s account. With net asset values reported flat at $1.00, despite the market value variance of the actual underlying assets, an impression of rock solid stability is maintained. To help maintain this impression, money market fund managers frequently forgo being reimbursed legitimate fund expenses, or cut their management fee, on an ad hoc and informal basis, to maintain that solid appearance of stability.|$|E
25|$|A retinal burn {{resulting}} in permanent damage from scarring is also {{caused by the}} concentration of direct thermal energy on the retina by the lens. It will occur only when the fireball <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> the individual's field of vision and would be a relatively uncommon injury. Retinal burns may be sustained at considerable distances from the explosion. The height of burst, and apparent size of the fireball, a function of yield and range will determine the degree and extent of retinal scarring. A scar in the central visual field would be more debilitating. Generally, a limited visual field defect, which will be barely noticeable, {{is all that is}} likely to occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{next-generation}} sequencing {{has also made}} large-scale population sequencing feasible, for example the 1000 Genomes Project to characterize variation in human population groups. While common variation is easily captured, rare variation poses a design challenge: too few samples with significant sequence redundancy risks not having a variant in the sample group, but large samples with light redundancy risk not capturing a variant in the read set that <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> the sample group. Wendl and Wilson report a simple set of optimization rules that maximize the probability of discovery for a given set of parameters. For example, for observing a rare allele at least twice (to eliminate the possibility is unique to an individual) {{a little less than}} 4-fold redundancy should be used, regardless of the sample size.|$|E

25|$|From Mission, the Canadian travels on the CPR {{route through}} the Fraser and Thompson river canyons. The CPR {{stays on the}} west (north) {{side of the river}} until Cisco where it crosses over to the east (south) side of the river. Near Basque (near Lytton), both the CPR and CN are {{on the same side of}} the river and have {{crossovers}} to access each other's tracks, and it is here that the eastbound Canadian transfers from the CPR back onto the CN line. Shortly thereafter the CN line crosses back over to the west/north side of the Thompson River and makes a few other crossings across the river before the staying on the north/west side for rest of the way into Kamloops and crosses the North Thompson River before arriving at the Kamloops station, which <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> North Kamloops, across the Thompson River from downtown Kamloops. On their regular schedules, both east and westbound Canadians travel through the Fraser and Thompson river canyons at night.|$|E
25|$|Windsor Terrace {{straddles}} {{the line between}} the original Dutch Colonial Brooklyn towns of Brooklyn and Flatbush, as can be seen from its street grid that is bent approximately northeast-southwest along present-day Terrace Place. Old South Brooklyn (which <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> western Brooklyn) is located to the north in the direction of 11th Avenue, and the Town of Flatbush to the south, located in the direction of Seeley Street. The grid of old Brooklyn, which is tilted at an angle, is adjacent to the Flatbush grid, which is roughly aligned with the cardinal directions, at this juncture. The only other still-extant nuance of this ancient Dutch boundary is the legacy of original Catholic Parish boundaries, which are between Holy Name and Immaculate Heart, and ZIP codes applied much later (11215 to the north and 11218 to the south). In this area, Vanderbilt Place, named after John Vanderbilt, splits western Brooklyn's general street grid (comprising numbered avenues from 1st–101st Streets) and southeastern Brooklyn's general street grid (comprising lettered avenues from East 1st to East 108th Streets).|$|E
