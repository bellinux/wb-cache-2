40|$|The {{problem of}} {{pedestrian}} injury {{is a significant}} one throughout the world. In 2001, there were 4724 pedestrian fatalities in Europe and 4882 in the US. Significant advances {{have been made by}} automotive safety researchers and vehicle manufacturers to address this issue with respect to the design of vehicles, but the complex nature of pedestrian accident scenarios has resulted in great difficulty when using traditional statistical methods. Specifically, problems have been encountered when attempting to study the effects of individual parameters of vehicle <b>front-end</b> <b>geometry</b> on pedestrian head injury. This paper attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the field of evolutionary computation to the problem of pedestrian safety by using a simple genetic algorithm to optimize the centre-line geometry of a car’s front-end for the reduction of pedestrian head and thoracic injury. The fitness of each design is assessed by creating a multi-body mathematical model of the vehicle front and simulating impacts with models of different sized pedestrians, and ranking according to the combined injury scores...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission {{is proposing}} {{legislation}} {{aimed at reducing}} the severity of injuries sustained by pedestrians {{in the event of}} an impact with the front-end of a motor vehicle. One aspect of this proposed legislation is reducing the pedestrian 2 ̆ 7 s leg injuries due to contact with the bumper and frontal surfaces of a vehicle, assessed using a 2 ̆ 7 pedestrian leg impact device, 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 leg-form. 2 ̆ 7 This proposed legislation presents the challenge of designing a bumper system which achieves the required performance in the leg-form impact-without sacrificing the bumper 2 ̆ 7 s primary function of vehicle protection during low-speed impacts. The first step in meeting this challenge is to understand what effects the <b>front-end</b> <b>geometry</b> and stiffness have on the leg-form impact test results. These results will then need to be compared to low-speed impact performance to assess if the two requirements are compatible. This paper describes an investigation-using concept Finite Element models and a front-end variable geometry vehicle test buck-of the styling and engineering tradeoffs for a pedestrian safe bumper system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An FE {{model of}} a {{pedestrian}} lower legform impactor has been developed and certied, both statically and dynamically, based on EEVC-WG 17 requirements. The legform is then utilized {{in a series of}} 40 km/hr pedestrian accident analyses to assess the protection level delivered by a typical sedan vehicle. The values of maximum tibia acceleration, maximum knee bending angle, and maximum knee shearing displacement have been extracted for 25 dierent accident congurations and compared with their admissible ranges. It has been shown that tibia acceleration is mainly in uenced by extension of the area transferring the impact load between the legform and the vehicle. However, variations of vehicle <b>front-end</b> structure <b>geometry</b> and stiness in the vertical direction {{have been found to be}} the most decisive parameters in the level of legform knee maximum bending rotation and maximum shearing displacement...|$|R
40|$|A silicon strip {{detector}} {{is being}} developed for the Inner Tracker of the LHCb experiment. The Inner Tracker consists of nine planar tracking stations and covers a total sensitive area of about 14 m 2. Experimental boundary conditions suggest detectors with a read-out pitch of about 240 m and a strip length of 22 cm, and front-end electronics with a fast shaping time {{of the order of}} 25 ns. Material budget is a crucial issue since mechanical supports and front-end electronics are located inside the acceptance of the experiment. Studies on the sensor <b>geometry,</b> <b>front-end</b> electronics and detector mechanics are presented...|$|R
40|$|On {{behalf of}} NHTSA, the European Commission, and the Dutch Ministry of Traffic and Transport, the Safety {{department}} of TNO Automotive is performing numerical fleet studies using multi-body models. Aim {{is to develop}} strategies for optimisation and evaluating the effects in new vehicles based on proposed test procedures to minimise the total harm in car-to-car crashes on a fleet-wide basis. For these studies multi-body models are being constructed from existing finite element models. The front-end structure and passenger compartment are modelled in detail to provide realistic deformation modes. Furthermore dummies, airbags, belts and main interior parts like dashboard and steering wheel are included. Currently seven models are available, each of a different vehicle class. Two geometrical variants of the smallest vehicles are also included. The objective {{of this paper is}} to show the potential of the multi-body vehicle models for crashworthiness optimisation and/or evaluation of a fleet. To this end a fleet study on offset frontal impacts is performed in which sensitivities of relevant accident and design parameters are investigated by means of parameter sweeps over these parameters. The accident parameters include vehicle type, impact speed and overlap. The design parameters relate to the <b>front-end</b> <b>geometry</b> of the two smaller vehicles. A total set of over 3200 scenarios is simulated. Analysis of results is done on the basis of measures for the overall injury risk and based on separate injury values for different body regions. For the separate injury values clear trends are observed with respect to variations in design variables. For overall injury risk measures these trends are not so clear due to contradicting influences of the design variables on separate injuries. This complicates usage of the overall injury measures. © Woodhead Publishing Ltd...|$|E
