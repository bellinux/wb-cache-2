In olden days almost all industries uses conventional machines for manufacturing processes. In conventional machining processes, the time consumption is very high, labour cost {{is high and}} which increases the manufacturing cost of the product. The accuracy is also not achieved as per the design requirements. To overcome all these difficulties, {{the industries}} are made automated through some devices such as electronic components, pneumatic device electrical equipments etc. For producing economically better quality products with high productivity, accuracy and quality, the conventional machine tools are being replaced gradually by the automated machine tool devices. Automation of the machines are made with help of Pneumatic device, Sensors, Mechatronics, and PLCs etc. Here the efforts are made to develop a electro pneumatic circuit for a shaping operations using a shaper machine. This makes the operations semi automatic producing shaping operations by a single point cutting tool. The three movements of the shaper are a) The reciprocating movement of the ram. b) The Crosswise movement of the tool lead across the cross rail. c) The vertical up and down movement of the table. The above movements are being automated using electropneumatic components such as pneumatic cylinders, <b>direction</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> flow <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and other electrical and electronics devices.

40|$|Supplying haptic {{or force}} {{feedback}} to operators using hydraulic machinery such as excavators {{has the potential}} to increase operator capabilities. Haptic, robotic, human-machine interfaces enable several enhancing features including coordinated motion control and programmable haptic feedback. Coordinated or resolved motion control supplies a more intuitive means of specifying the equipment's motion. Haptic feedback is used to relay meaningful information back to the user in the form of force signals about digging force acting on the bucket, programmable virtual constraints and system limitations imposed by the mechanism, maximum pressure or maximum flow. In order to make this technology economically viable, the benefits must offset the additional cost associated with implementation. One way to minimize this cost is to not use high-end hydraulic components. For smaller backhoes and mini-excavators this means that the hydraulic systems are comprised of a constant displacement pump and proportional <b>direction</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> Hydraulic and haptic control techniques suitable for backhoes/excavators are developed and tested on a small backhoe test-bed. A virtual backhoe simulator is created for controller design and human evaluation. Not only is the virtual simulator modeled after the test-bed, but the control algorithm used in the simulator {{is the same as the}} actual backhoe test-bed. Data from human subject tests are presented that evaluate the control strategies on both the real and virtual backhoe. The end goal of this project is to incorporate coordinated haptic control algorithms that work with low-cost systems and maximize the enhancement of operator capabilities. Ph. D.

40|$|A {{spool valve}} as a flow <b>direction</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> has usually {{been used in}} a {{hydraulic}} system. In recent years, some hydraulic actuator systems need high accuracy control of the spool valve {{in order to control}} the delivery precisely. For the reason, it is very important practically to know dynamic motion of the spool. To analyze the dynamic characteristics of the spool valve, it is necessary to consider the dynamic motion of the spool. Springs, solenoids and working fluid, which is pressurized by the pump in the circuit, support the spool. The motion of the spool is governed complicatedly by pressure force, flow force, electromagnetic force and mechanical spring force acting on itself. As a result, it is difficult to analyze the dynamic motion of the spool, and therefore, any commercial code to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the spool valve dose not exist at present. Final target {{of this study is to}} develop numerical code to predict precisely the dynamic motion of the spool valve. As the first step, dynamic characteristics of a spool valve coupled with electromagnetic and mechanical effects have been conducted in the present paper...|$|E

40|$|Rotary {{pneumatic}} actuators {{that are made}} out of linear one are always best suited for exoskeleton joint actuation due to its inherent power to weight ratio. This work is {{a modified version of}} knee actuation system that has already been developed and major modifications are made {{in order to make it}} more suitable for human wearing and also to reduce its bulkiness and complexity. The considered actuator system is a rotary actuator where a pulley converts the linear motion of the standard pneumatic piston into the rotary motion. To prove the capability of the actuator, its performance characteristics such as torque and power produced are compared to the required torque and power at the knee joint of the exoskeleton in swing phase and are found to be excellent. The two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed to find the effect of the throat area valve on knee angle. The ANOVA shows the significant effect of the throat area variation on the knee angle flexion made by the proposed actuator. A relationship between the throat area of flow control valve, that is connected to the exit port of the <b>direction</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> and angular displacement of the knee joint has been formulated.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model of a}} servoactuator and of a four-port proportional <b>direction</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> has been developed. Mechanical and hydraulic elements have been simulated in the LMS Amesim environment. The complete model has been validated {{on the basis of}} the experimental time histories of the actuator velocity and of the flow-rate controlled by the proportional valve. The validation data have been acquired on a fluid power system used to test electro-hydraulic servovalves according to ISO 10770 - 1 standard. The measurement of the instantaneous flow-rate through the valve has been performed with an innovative high-dynamics flowmeter, recently developed for high-pressure liquid flows. Furthermore, the model predicted static characteristic of the proportional valve has been compared with a corresponding experimentally derived curve and an analysis of the cause-and-effect relationships has been carried out for the valve static performance. Measured data on valve leakages have also been presented in order to complete the steadystate characterization of the tested valve. The developed model of the hydraulic system has been then applied to realize the Bode diagram of the proportional valve, which is expressed in terms of instantaneous flow-rate as a function of the sinusoidal driving command, as well as the Bode diagram of the subsystem made up of the proportional valve and of the linear actuator. The latter Bode graph is plotted in terms of piston velocity as a function of the sinusoidal driving command provided to the valve. The comparison between the two Bode diagrams has confirmed the accuracy of the ISO procedure, which is based on the assumption of negligible delay introduced by the dynamic response of the servoactuator and by the oil compressibility. A reliable and cost-saving methodology, which uses the innovative flowmeter instead of the low inertia servo-actuator, is proposed as an alternative to the ISO standard for testing the dynamic response of proportional valves...|$|E

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active surge control...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Stiction in <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> is an {{extremely}} nonlinear {{and one of the}} long-standing problems in a closed loop control system, since the controller will push the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> to move until the controlled variable reaches the desired value. Stiction moves the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> to extreme positions so that the process output will force to produce overshoot. Then, the action gets repeated as the controller output reverses its direction. The limit cycle generated, when the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> sticks and slips during a change in input signal is called stick/slip cycle, will induce vibrations. As the control loops in an industrial plant are interlinked each other; these oscillations will be propagated to the entire system. In this critical situation the only option is to go for maintenance of the faulty valves, which may be recommended / possible only during process shut down. But, shutting down the process for maintenance of defective valves is not an economical option. Hence, {{it is very important to}} provide an efficient technique to compensate the nonlinear effect of the stiction in faulty <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> especially when it is not under maintenance.

Traditional load <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> {{do not have}} the load velocity control ability and its opening feature is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle.
