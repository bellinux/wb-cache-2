40|$|More than 95 % of {{silicate}} {{minerals and}} other oxides found in meteorites were melted, or vaporized and recondensed in the Solar Nebula {{prior to their}} incorporation into meteorite parent bodies. Gravitational accretion energy and heating via radioactive decay further transformed oxide minerals accreted into planetesimals. In such an oxygen-rich environment the carbonaceous dust that fell into the nebula as an intimate mixture with oxide grains should have been almost completely converted to CO. While some pre-collapse, molecular-cloud carbonaceous dust does survive, much {{in the same manner}} as do pre-solar oxide grains, such materials constitute only a few percent of meteoritic carbon and are clearly distinguished by elevated D/H, N- 15 /N- 16, C- 13 /C- 12 ratios or noble gas patterns. Carbonaceous Dust in Meteorites: We argue that nearly all of the carbon in meteorites was synthesized in the Solar Nebula from CO and that this CO was generated by the reaction of carbonaceous dust with solid oxides, water or OH. It is probable that some fraction of carbonaceous dust that is newly synthesized in the Solar Nebula is also converted back into CO by additional thermal processing. CO processing might occur on grains in the outer nebula through irradiation of CO-containing ice coatings or in the inner nebula via Fischer-Tropsch type (FTT) reactions on grain surfaces. Large-scale transport of both gaseous reaction products and dust from the inner nebula out to regions where comets formed would spread newly formed carbonaceous materials throughout the solar nebula. Formation of Organic Carbon: Carbon dust in the ISM might easily be described as inorganic graphite or amorphous carbon, with relatively low structural abundances of H, N, O and S. Products of FTT reactions or organics produced via irradiation of icy grains contain abundant aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. aldehydes, <b>keytones,</b> acids, amines and amides [...] The net result of the massive nebular carbon cycle is to convert relatively inert carbonaceous dust from the ISM into the vital organic precursors to life such as amino acids and sugars intimately mixed with dust and ice in primitive planetesimals. Since the number of carbon atoms entering the Solar Nebula as dust exceeds the number of atoms entering the nebula as oxide grains. the formation of large quantities of complex organic molecules may represent the largest single chemical cycle in the nebula...|$|R

50|$|Hinze {{initially}} performed publicly as {{a pianist}} until the mid-1960s, {{when he began}} studying flute at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague and then at Berklee College of Music. As a pianist, he played with Boy Edgar until 1966, but by 1967 was playing flute professionally with the bassist Dick van der Capellen. His first releases as a leader were issued in 1969, and in 1970, Hinze was awarded the Best Soloist prize at the Montreux Jazz Festival. In the 1970s, he formed his own ensemble, the Chris Hinze Combination, which included players such as Gerry Brown and John Lee, and which saw some success with arrangements of Baroque music in a jazz setting. He also founded the record label <b>Keytone</b> Records in the mid-1970s.|$|E
50|$|Thermoplastic is heat-welded seams form a permanent, {{watertight}} {{bond that}} {{is stronger than}} the membrane itself. PVC resin is modified with plasticizers and UV stabilizers, and reinforced with fiberglass non-woven mats or polyester woven scrims, {{for use as a}} flexible roofing membrane. PVC is, however, subject to plasticizer migration. (a process by which the plasticizers migrate out of the sheet causing it to become brittle.) Thus, a thicker membrane has a larger reservoir of plasticizer to maintain flexibility over its lifespan. PVC is often blended with other polymers to add to the performance capabilities of the original PVC formulation, such as KEE - <b>Keytone</b> Ethylene Ester. Such blends are referred to as either a CPA - Copolymer Alloy or a TPA - Tripolymer Alloy.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a ruggedised dissolved oxygen probe, both in the laboratory and in the field, are reported. This probe is based on phase fluorometric detection of the quenched fluorescence of an oxygen-sensitive ruthenium complex. Dissolved oxygen probes {{have a number of}} different applications e. g. in bioreactors, in living systems, in industry and in waste-water treatment plants. The probe reported here has been developed specifically for waste-water monitoring. The oxygen-sensitive complex is entrapped in a porous hydrophobic sol-gel matrix that has been optimised for this application. Light emitting diode (LED) excitation and photodiode detection are employed in a dipstick probe configuration, with the oxygen-sensitive film coated on a disposable Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) disc, which in turn is designed to optimise guiding of the excitation light into the film. A key element of the design is the common mode rejection of phase between the signal and reference channels, requiring careful selection of the relevant optoelectronic components. Extensive laboratory testing has been carried out on this sensor, and it exhibited high performance with limit of detection typically 6 ppb, sensor resolution of 15 ppb at 9 ppm oxygen concentration, and excellent long term stability of 0. 1 ppm per week. A first phase of field testing at a UK waste-water treatment plant has taken place and a second is planned for 2002. Also reported here is the optimisation of films, which have Platinum Octoethylporphyrin <b>keytone</b> (PtOEPk) entrapped as the oxygen-sensitive complex. The fluorescence from the PtOEPk is quenched in the presence of oxygen, in a similar way to the ruthenium complex. The longer lifetime of PtOEPk allows for greater sensitivity at lower oxygen concentrations. Several different support matrices for the porphyrin have been investigated using a fibre optic sensor, optimised for working with PtOEPk...|$|E
