5|$|Interstellar {{space is}} the {{physical}} space within a galaxy beyond {{the influence of}} each star on the plasma. The contents of interstellar space are called the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium.</b> Approximately 70% {{of the mass of}} the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova will generate an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials. The density of matter in the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> can vary considerably: the average is around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108–1012 per m3.|$|E
5|$|Remnants of many supernovae {{consist of}} a compact object and a rapidly {{expanding}} shock wave of material. This cloud of material sweeps up the surrounding <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> during a free expansion phase, which can last {{for up to two}} centuries.

5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> {{at a speed}} of 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> at a speed of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E

Though mm-size dust grains contribute negligibly to the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium's</b> visual extinction, the signal they produce in scattered light may be detectable, especially for variable sources. Observations of light scattered at small angles allows for the direct measurement of the large grain population; variable sources can also yield tomographic information of the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium's</b> mass distribution.

The X-ray spectrum of G 292. 0 + 1. 8 consists of two type plasmas, one is in collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) {{and the other is}} in non-equilibrium ionization (NEI). The CIE plasma has nearly solar abundances, and hence would be originated from the circumstellar and <b>interstellar</b> <b>mediums.</b> The NEI plasma has super-solar abundances, and the abundance pattern indicates that the plasma originates from the supernova ejecta with a main sequence of 30 - 35 Msolar.

5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium.</b> For decades {{it was assumed}} that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium.</b> A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E

5|$|The Sun {{inherited}} its {{chemical composition}} from the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> {{out of which}} it formed. The hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and the heavier elements were produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in generations of stars that completed their stellar evolution and returned their material to the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> before {{the formation of the}} Sun. The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System. However, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the photosphere. Therefore, in today's photosphere the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). The protostellar Sun's composition {{is believed to have been}} 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|The blown-off {{outer layers}} of dying stars include heavy elements, {{which may be}} {{recycled}} during the formation of new stars. These heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets.

5|$|The {{space between}} {{the stars in the}} M87 galaxy is filled with a diffuse <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> of gas, which has been {{chemically}} enriched by the elements ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their main sequence lifetime. Carbon and nitrogen are continuously supplied by intermediate mass stars as they pass through the asymptotic giant branch. The heavier elements from oxygen to iron are primarily produced by supernova explosions within the galaxy. About 60% of the abundance of these heavy elements was produced by core-collapse supernovae, while the remainder came from Type Ia supernovae. The distribution of these elements suggests that early enrichment was from core-collapse supernovae. The contribution from these sources was much lower in abundance than in the Milky Way. Type Ia supernovae have provided a continuous contribution to the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> of M87 throughout the history of the galaxy.|$|E
40|$|We review what is {{currently}} {{known about the}} structure of interstellar material in the solar neighborhood, emphasizing how observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have improved {{our understanding of how}} interstellar gas is distributed near the Sun. The nearby ISM is not uniform but shows variations in both temperature and metal abundances on distance scales of just a few parsecs. The observations also show that nearby gas does not have a single uniform velocity vector. Instead, different components are often seen in different directions for even very short lines of sight. However, interpretation of these components remains difficult. It is uncertain whether the components represent physically distinct clouds or perhaps are just symptomatic of velocity gradients within the cloud. Finally, since it is the local <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium’s</b> interaction with the solar wind that is the primary application of ISM studies considered in these proceedings, we also review how the same HST data used to study the local ISM structure has also been used to study both the heliospheric interaction with the solar wind and also “astrospheric” interactions with the winds of other stars. 1...|$|R

5|$|Water maser {{emission}} {{is observed}} primarily at 22GHz, {{due to a}} transition between rotational energy levels in the water molecule. The upper state is at an energy corresponding to 643 kelvins about the ground state, and populating this upper maser level requires number densities of molecular hydrogen of order 108 cm−3 or greater and temperatures of at least 300 kelvins. The water molecule comes into thermal equilibrium at molecular hydrogen number densities of roughly 1011 cm−3, so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region. Water masers emission has been successfully modelled by masers occurring behind shock waves propagating through dense regions in the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium.</b> These shocks produce the high number densities and temperatures (relative to typical conditions in the <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium)</b> required for maser emission, and are successful in explaining observed masers.|$|E

40|$|Submitted to Icarus. Comments are welcome. A new {{theoretical}} hypothesis on {{the origin}} and formation of the solar and extrasolar planetary systems is summarized and briefly discussed {{in the light of}} recent detections of extrasolar planets, and studies of shock wave interaction with molecular clouds, as well as H. Alfven’s work on Sun’s magnetic field and its effect on the formation of the solar system (1962). We propose that all objects in a planetary system originate from a small group of dense fragments in a giant molecular cloud (GMC). The mechanism of one or more shock waves, which propagate through the protoplanetary disk during the star formation is necessary to trigger rapid cascade fragmentation of dense clumps which in turn collapse quickly, simultaneously, and individually to form multi-planet and multi-satellite systems. Magnetic spin resonance may be the cause of the rotational directions of newly formed planets to couple and align in the strong magnetic field of a younger star. Subject headings: solar system: formation – planets and satellites: formation – stars:planetary systems: protoplanetary disks –stars: magnetic fields – ISM: clouds 1. Summary of The New Hypothesis The lifetime of giant molecular clouds and massive stars may be short, but the impact of their birth and death on the surrounding intercloud (ICM) and <b>interstellar</b> <b>mediums</b> (ISM) is profound (Yao 2009; Portegies Zwart 2010, and reference therein).

Their relative strengths provide a powerful probe of the thermodynamic properties of the gas when confronted with observations. By adjusting the dust attenuation effect using one parameter and matching the observed size-luminosity relation of LABs using another parameter, we show that our simulations can reproduce the observed / and / ratios adequately. This analysis provides the first successful physical model to account for simultaneously the LAB luminosity function, luminosity-size relation, and the /Lyα and /Lyα ratios, with only two parameters. The physical underpinning for this model is that, in addition to the stellar component for the emission, the and emission lines due to shock heated gas are primarily collisional excitation driven and the emission line collisional ionization driven. We find that the density, temperature and metallicity of the gas responsible for each emission line is significantly distinct, in a multi-phase <b>interstellar</b> and circumgalactic <b>medium</b> that is shock-heated primarily by supernovae and secondarily by gravitational accretion of gas.
