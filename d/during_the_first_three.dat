5|$|Argentina {{possesses}} definite comparative {{advantages in}} agriculture, {{as the country}} is endowed with {{a vast amount of}} highly fertile land. Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> decades of the 20th century, Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population, total income, and per capita income. By 1913, Argentina was the world's 10th wealthiest nation per capita.|$|E

5|$|A {{major focus}} for Kenyatta <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> {{and a half}} years of Kenya's {{independence}} were the divisions within KANU itself. Opposition to Kenyatta's government grew, particularly following the assassination of Pio Pinto in February 1965. Relations between Kenyatta and Odinga were strained, and at the March 1966 party conference, Odinga's post—that of party Vice President, was divided among eight different politicians. In 1966, Odinga stepped down as state Vice President, claiming that Kenya had failed to achieve economic independence and needed to adopt truly socialist policies. Backed by several other senior KANU figures and trade unionists, he formed the Kenya Peoples Union (KPU). The KPU were legally recognised as the official opposition, thus restoring the country's two party system.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the advent}} of music downloads, only sales of {{physical}} formats—such as CD, vinyl and cassette tape—contributed towards positions on the UK music charts. The first chart to record sales of downloads was the UK Singles Downloads Chart, which was launched in September 2004 to list weekly sales of single downloads. Downloaded singles were growing considerably at this time, rising ten-fold {{in the first half}} of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. As single downloads grew in popularity, so did album downloads – 1.8million albums were downloaded in 2005; a further 825,000 were downloaded <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> months of 2006.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> {{months of}} 1944, Cicero {{supplied}} the Germans with copies of documents {{taken from his}} employer's dispatch box or his safe. Photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion, {{this led to a}} high-speed chase around Ankara as someone had taken an interest in the hand-over. Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped. Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information, the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did not know that the source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E

5|$|Eurostar's {{passenger}} numbers initially {{failed to}} meet predictions. In 1996, London and Continental Railways forecast that passenger numbers would reach 21.4million annually by 2004, but only 7.3million was achieved. 82 million passengers used Waterloo International Station from its opening in 1994 to its closure in 2007. 2008 was a record year for Eurostar, with a 10.3% rise in passenger use, which was attributed {{to the use of}} High Speed 1 and the move to St Pancras. The following year, Eurostar saw an 11.5% fall in passenger numbers <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> months of 2009, attributed to the 2008 Channel Tunnel fire and the 2009 recession.|$|E
5|$|Joss Whedon {{had wanted}} to make a musical episode {{since the start of the}} series. This was {{heightened}} during the fifth season when he hosted a Shakespeare reading at his house, to which the cast was invited. They began drinking and singing, demonstrating to Whedon that certain cast members had musical talents. Whedon knew he would have to write an entire score, which would take weeks or months. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> seasons of Buffy, he was unable to take more than two weeks off at a time, and the constraints of writing and directing the show precluded him from putting forth the effort of preparing a musical. Whedon spoke to the show's producer, Gareth Davies, about his idea; they agreed that a musical episode would be written.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Imperial County {{businessmen}} {{hoped to}} promote {{the use of this}} road over the route from Phoenix to Los Angeles, to increase tourism. Eventually, US 80 did become the most used road into Southern California from the east, but by 1947, the Highway 80 Associated was formed to increase the traffic on the road, since the war and advertising by other cities had caused it to fall again. Four years later, US 80 was reported to be the most used transcontinental highway, and there was a 40 percent increase in the out-of-state cars that traveled through the state inspection station at Yuma <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> months of that year. But in 1954, there were reports that traffic had decreased, because the road to Phoenix, Arizona from Lordsburg, New Mexico had improved.|$|E

The burgeoning timber industry provided a boost to the settlement's economy, and by 1918 there were over 500 families residing there. A fire in 1917 razed the entire village, leading to the departure of around twenty families. Ueshiba was attending a meeting over railway construction around 50 miles away, but on learning of the fire travelled back the entire distance on foot. He {{was elected to the}} village council that year, and took a prominent role in leading the reconstruction efforts. In the summer of 1918, Hatsu gave birth to their first son, Takemori.|$|E
5|$|Sales of plug-in {{passenger}} cars, excluding imports, totaled 207,380 {{units in}} 2015, making China the world's best-selling plug-in electric car country market in 2015. The plug-in electric passenger car segment market share rose to 0.84% in 2015, up from 0.25% in 2014. The top selling passenger models in 2015 were the BYD Qin plug-in hybrid with 31,898 units sold, {{followed by the}} BYD Tang (18,375). As a reflex of the explosive growth of the Chinese plug-in electric car market in 2015, BYD Auto ended 2015 as the world's best selling manufacturer of highway legal light-duty plug-in electric vehicles, with around 60,000 units sold, ahead of Tesla (50,580). <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> quarters of 2016, BYD continued as the world's top selling plug-in car manufacturer with over 74,000 units delivered in China.|$|E
5|$|The Americans, {{assigned}} {{to land at}} Utah and Omaha, were {{to cut off the}} Cotentin Peninsula and capture the port facilities at Cherbourg. The British at Sword and Gold, and the Canadians at Juno, were to capture Caen and form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the south-east of Caen to protect the American flank, while establishing airfields near Caen. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would provide a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the town of Falaise. A secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory north of the Avranches-Falaise line <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> weeks. The Allied armies would then swing left to advance towards the River Seine. Montgomery envisaged a ninety-day battle, ending when all the forces reached the Seine.|$|E
