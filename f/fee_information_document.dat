40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} {{an outgrowth of}} research performed with a data base of merged individual income tax returns and <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> Tax Year 1989 was the first year for which such a data base was created and perfected. Traditionally, the Statistics of Income (SOI) Division of the Internal Revenue Service has interpreted its mandate to produce "statistics reasonably available {{with respect to the}} operations of the internal revenue laws " [1] as meaning tabulating data shown on tax returns. In recent years, with the computerization of the millions of <b>information</b> <b>documents</b> prepared by employers, banks, stock brokers, payers of pensions, etc., data from these documents have increasingly become "reasonably available. " Data from <b>information</b> <b>documents,</b> when matched to tax returns, can be used to serve as a check on the data shown on individual income tax returns, as well as to provide an indication of how much of the income on a joint return belongs to the husband and how much to the wife. In addition, it is possible to pull a sample of <b>information</b> <b>documents</b> that do not match to tax returns, and use them to tally data about non-filers. The data base used for this paper was created as a tool to compare tax return data to data gathered from <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> It includes a sample of tax returns matched to <b>information</b> <b>documents,</b> as well as unmatched tax returns and unmatched <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> The age of each individual in the sample was determined by matching his or her social security number (SSN) to the Year of Birth file, whic...|$|R

To complete this statement, GAO relied on previous work and additional information from Labor and industry professionals regarding <b>information</b> about plan <b>fees.</b> <b>Information</b> on 401 (k) plan fee disclosure serves different functions for plan sponsors and participants. Plan sponsors need to understand a broad range of information on expenses associated with their plans to fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities. Sponsors need information on expenses associated with the investment options that they offer to participants and the providers they hire to perform plan services. Such information would help them meet their fiduciary duty to determine if expenses are reasonable for the services provided. In addition, sponsors also need to understand the implication of certain business arrangements between service providers, such as revenue sharing. Despite some disagreements about how much information is needed, industry professionals have made various suggestions to help plan sponsors collect meaningful information on expenses. Labor has also undertaken a number of activities related to the <b>information</b> on plan <b>fees</b> that sponsors should consider. Participants need <b>fee</b> <b>information</b> to make informed decisions about their investments [...] primarily, whether to contribute to the plan and how to allocate their contributions among the investment options the plan sponsor has selected. However, many participants are not aware that they pay any fees, and those who are may not know how much they are paying. Most industry professionals agree that information about an investment option 2 ̆ 7 s relative risk, its historic performance, and the associated fees is fundamental for plan participants. Some industry professionals also believe that other fees that are also charged to participants should be understood, so that participants can clearly see the effect these fees can have on their account balances...|$|R
