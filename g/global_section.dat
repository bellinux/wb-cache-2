25|$|The {{principal}} homogeneous space {{concept is}} a special case of that of principal bundle: it means a principal bundle with base a single point. In other words the local theory of principal bundles {{is that of a}} family of principal homogeneous spaces depending on some parameters in the base. The 'origin' can be supplied by a section of the bundlesuch sections are usually assumed to exist locally on the basethe bundle being locally trivial, so that the local structure is that of a cartesian product. But sections will often not exist globally. For example a differential manifold M has a principal bundle of frames associated to its tangent bundle. A <b>global</b> <b>section</b> will exist (by definition) only when M is parallelizable, which implies strong topological restrictions.|$|E
