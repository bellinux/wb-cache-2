5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he could}} buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have <b>just</b> <b>discovered</b> in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by Brasseur de Bourbourg's {{diffusion}} theories, the pseudoarchaeologist Augustus Le Plongeon {{traveled to}} Mesoamerica and performed {{some of the}} first excavations of many famous Mayan ruins. Le Plongeon invented narratives, such as the kingdom of Moo saga, which romantically drew connections to him, his wife Alice, and Egyptian deities Osiris and Isis, as well as to Heinrich Schliemann, who had <b>just</b> <b>discovered</b> the ancient city of Troy from Homer's epic poetry (that had been described as merely mythical). He also believed that he had found connections between the Greek and Mayan languages, which produced a narrative of the destruction of Atlantis.|$|E
25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During this time I was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had <b>just</b> <b>discovered</b> Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had had the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time I had wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E

25|$|When it is {{discovered}} that Richie Novak (Billy Miller), recent but former love interest of Babe, needs {{a bone marrow}} transplant, she goes {{on a mission to}} save his life. She secretly discovers that JR is the perfect bone marrow match for him. Aware that the two are enemies, she makes a deal with JR on February 19, 2008 after informing him that he is a bone marrow match for Richie. The deal {{comes in the form of}} strip poker. If Babe wins, JR will save Richie's life. If JR wins, Babe will give JR anything he wants regards to her. The two play the game at Babe's place, where Babe loses. Babe naked, and JR half naked, Babe grabs a robe just as JR surprises her by revealing that he already knew of his bone marrow status before she told him, and that he already planned to donate to Richie.

[...] They complain about the duplicity of human behavior (and then title their songs after animals – get it?). [...] They sound like they've <b>just</b> <b>discovered</b> this – their message has become pointless and tedious."

500|$|Lennon {{then started}} taking LSD {{on a regular}} basis, {{as well as his}} daily use of cannabis. After much {{encouragement}} from him, Cynthia agreed to try LSD one more time, but the adverse effects were the same. Although she said at the time she would never take the drug again, she relented and took it for the last time a few weeks later, {{on the way to a}} party at Epstein's country house in Warbleton, East Sussex. Although she hated the psychological effects of the drug, from this point she could see the change taking place in her husband: [...] "It was like living with someone who had <b>just</b> <b>discovered</b> religion ... Tensions, bigotry, and bad temper were replaced by understanding and love". In 1970, Lennon confessed he had probably taken LSD one thousand times since 1965, saying: [...] "I used to just eat it all the time". [...] In the decades ahead, Cynthia would always maintain that John's drug use was the beginning of the end for the couple.|$|E

These contacts of March 4 may have been the birth of the toponyms Yucatán and Catoche, whose surprising and amusing history [...] perhaps too amusing to be true [...] is often cited.

2500|$|The en banc Federal Circuit {{upheld the}} rejection, 9–3. The {{majority}} opinion by Chief Judge Paul Redmond Michel characterized {{the issue as}} whether the claimed method is a patent-eligible [...] "process," [...] as the patent statute (35 U.S.C. § 101) uses that term. While any series of actions or operations is a process in the dictionary sense of that term, the court explained, the Supreme Court has held that the statutory meaning is narrower than the dictionary meaning which [...] "forecloses a purely literal reading." [...] Patent-eligible processes do not include [...] "laws of nature, natural phenomena, [...] abstract ideas." [...] The limiting legal principle applies not just to processes, but to anything on which a patent is sought. As a trilogy of Supreme Court decisions on patent-eligibility from approximately three decades ago had taught, [...] "Phenomena of nature, though <b>just</b> <b>discovered,</b> mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work." [...] Therefore, the question was whether Bilski's process fell within any of the prohibited categories (that is, was a claim to a [...] "principle"), and the underlying legal question was what legal tests or criteria should govern that determination when a claim is directed to a principle.|$|E
