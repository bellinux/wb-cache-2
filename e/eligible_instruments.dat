40|$|Abstract Background The {{assessment}} of outcomes from the patient's perspective becomes more recognized in health care. Also {{in patients with}} chronic ankle instability, the degree of present impairments, disabilities and participation problems should be documented {{from the perspective of}} the patient. The decision about which patient-assessed instrument is most appropriate for clinical practice should be based upon systematic reviews. Only rating scales constructed for patients with acute ligament injuries were systematically reviewed in the past. The aim of this study was to review systematically the clinimetric qualities of patient-assessed instruments designed for patients with chronic ankle instability. Methods A computerized literature search of Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, Sport Discus and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register was performed to identify <b>eligible</b> <b>instruments.</b> Two reviewers independently evaluated the clinimetric qualities of the selected instruments using a criteria list. The inter-observer reliability of both the selection procedure and the clinimetric evaluation was calculated using modified kappa coefficients. Results The inter-observer reliability of the selection procedure was excellent (k =. 86). Four instruments met the eligibility criteria: the Ankle Joint Functional Assessment Tool (AJFAT), the Functional Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and the Functional Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM). The inter-observer reliability of the quality assessment was substantial to excellent (k between. 64 and. 88). Test-retest reliability was demonstrated for the FAOS, the FADI and the FAAM but not for the AJFAT. The FAOS and the FAAM met the criteria for content validity and construct validity. For none of the studied instruments, the internal consistency was sufficiently demonstrated. The presence of floor- and ceiling effects was assessed for the FAOS but ceiling effects were present for all subscales. Responsiveness was demonstrated for the AJFAT, FADI and the FAAM. Only for the FAAM, a minimal clinical important difference (MCID) was presented. Conclusion The FADI and the FAAM can be considered as the most appropriate, patient-assessed tools to quantify functional disabilities in patients with chronic ankle instability. The clinimetric qualities of the FAAM need to be further demonstrated in a specific population of patients with chronic ankle instability. </p...|$|E

The published materials during {{the last ten years}} demonstrate that the behavior of variability in different dimensional space scales is similar. In mathematicalstatistical aspect this convergence is defined as fractal formalism or fractal statistics. In order to determine fractal nature it is possible to use variogram property. According to Mandelbrot (B. Mandelbrot, 1982), who has introduced fractal statistics in scientific studies, fractal estimation or Hausdorff measure, it is apart its way of deriving from variogram, has local nature. Natural is a problem, what is by a way of deriving of a global estimation of variability. Whether is the possible share dependence between two types of estimations? Hurst, (1957) has experimentally established that the dependence between the maximal range of a given dataset from a given experimental population of a time series, and the standard deviation has constant value. This fundamental result evolved with the concept that the subpopulation, obtained from the times series, the so called Hurst's constants (H), can show the correlation length of the process, which if with major length of dependence, available dependences of a type: Long Range Dependence- LRD and if short length of dependence- Short Range Dependence- SRD. The range of values H ∈ (0, 5 ÷ 1, 0) put variability from long range of dependence, and at values H ∈ (0, 1 ÷ 0, 5) put variability from short length of dependence. The connection between fractal dimension D and Hurst coefficient H is define a proportion: D + H = n + 1, (1) Where n- fundamental dimension of data space examination.

40|$|In {{light of}} {{increasing}} {{division of labour}} in healthcare, the training and acquisition of both profession-specific and interprofessional competencies have been attributed growing significance, creating the need to test and establish specific teaching formats. Despite ever more complex and interconnected healthcare systems, an increase in patients’ active self-responsibility and innumerable pedagogical and technological innovations, educational systems have not reacted adequately to these new demands. Many authors, not lease the German Council of Science and Humanities, have therefore urged a rethinking of traditional medical education. Student-centred learning activities, such as problem-based and research-based learning, are becoming increasingly significant {{in view of the}} numbers of students achieving unsatisfactory levels of competence in critical thinking, communication and writing abilities and complex clinical decision making, for example. The Council of Science and Humanities arrived at a positive evaluation of the various model and reformed courses of study attempting to effectuate a comprehensive reorganisation of medical studies in content and structure as well as methods and didactics. The persistent pervasiveness of instructor-centred learning formats is not only to be found in medical education but in all of the health professions. Although alternative teaching and instruction formats have already been designed and their effectiveness deemed positive in empirical evaluation, the lecture remains the most practised means of transmitting knowledge. In its essence, however, learning {{is not a question of}} transmitting information but, moreover, a question of processing information. In traditional instruction units, referred to as “chalk and talk classes” by Becker and Watts, the teaching party presents material in the form of a lecture. As appropriate, questions may be permitted or short processing periods for the students may be integrated into the lecture. The knowledge-assimilating and most essential analysis of the lecture’s contents takes place in the subsequent self-instruction phase, in which the student works alone on concrete tasks. It is during the transfer of knowledge conveyed in the lectures, however, that most questions arise. Of further disadvantage in the traditional lecture is the low level of motivation among students to attend lectures as well as their often heterogeneous knowledge. The Inverted Classroom Model seems to be an <b>eligible</b> <b>instrument</b> for greater facilitation of student-centred and interprofessional learning. Dieser Artikel beschreibt die Inverted-Classroom-Methode(ICM) im Sinne einer Einführung in die Thematik und soll als Praxisleitleitfaden für diejenigen dienen, die diese Methode in der medizinischen Aus-, Fort- und Weiterbildung einsetzen möchten. Es handelt sich bei der ICM um einen Blended-Learning-Methode, bei dem eine Selbstlernphase (individuelle Phase) vor die Präsenzunterrichtsphase gesetzt wird. In der Online-Phase wird Faktenwissen vermittelt, das als Grundlage für die Präsenzphase dient. Die Präsenzphase soll anschließend dafür genutzt werden, das erlernte Wissen zu vertiefen und anzuwenden. Dem gegenüber stehen die traditionellen Kurskonzepte, in denen das Faktenwissen beispielsweise in Vorlesungen oder in anderen Präsenzunterricht-Formaten vermittelt wird und die Vertiefung dieses Wissens durch die Studierenden im Anschluss daran im Selbststudium stattfinden soll. Das Ziel der ICM ist die Verschiebung des passiven Lernens hin zum aktivierenden Lernen, um das Lernen auf kognitiv anspruchvollen Ebenen wie Analyse, Synthese und Evaluation zu unterstützen.

40|$|Background. A written {{investment}} {{policy is the}} single most important element in a public funds investment program. An {{investment policy}} should describe the most prudent primary objectives for a sound policy: safety, liquidity, and yield. It should also indicate the type of <b>instruments</b> <b>eligible</b> for purchase by a government entity, the investment process, and the management of a portfolio.

Recommendation. The Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) recommends that all governing bodies adopt a comprehensive written investment policy and review and update its policies, if necessary on an annual basis. The process of creating an investment policy should include: 1. Examination of state public funds investment statutes. Most states have some form of public funds investment statutes.

The models can simulate most direct taxes and benefits except those based on previous contributions as this information is usually not available from the cross-sectional survey data used as input datasets. Information on these instruments is taken directly from the original data sources. Both models assume full benefit take-up and tax compliance, focusing on the intended effects of tax-benefit systems. These assumptions create an upwards bias on the automatic stabilizer measure – especially in countries where means-tested benefits are important (e.g., Ireland, UK), as take-up rates are typically much lower than for insurance benefits. The main stages of the simulations are the following. First, a representative micro-data sample and the according, pre-crisis tax-benefit rules (as of January 1 st, 2008) are read into the model. Then for each tax and benefit instrument, the model constructs corresponding assessment units, ascertains which are <b>eligible</b> for that <b>instrument</b> and determines the amount of benefit or tax liability for {{each member of the}} unit.

Theoretical issues are outlined as they have unfolded during several decades. The principal independent variable is clinical-orientation of clinician-subjects with regard to degree of adherence to linear-mechanistic and/or ecological-systems approaches. Secondary independent variables are duration-severity and interpersonal-context of client problem/situations, described in four situational vignettes. Hypotheses predict positive correlations between measures of each independent variable, and degree of linear versus ecological weighting to clinicians' assessments and intervention plans for each vignette. Data were collected in 1980 from 152 second-year graduate students in casework and direct practice, who represented an initial pool of 1, 007 students from fourteen CSWE-approved schools which provided unrestricted cooperation, through lists of <b>eligible</b> students. Three <b>instruments</b> were utilized: (a) An informational questionnaire inquired about students' willingness to participate, and characteristics which would enable the researcher to determine eligibility, and identify extraneous effects. (b) The second sought graded measures of subjects' adherence to specific theoretical principles of linear or ecological approaches. (c) The final instrument sought repeated measures of type of assessment and intervention plan (linear or ecological), formulated in response to systematically varied vignette conditions. Findings include several positive correlations between self-rated clinical-orientation and assessment measures, and fewer positive correlations between clinical-orientation and intervention measures.

Materials and methods: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in 12 countries worldwide were identified through systematic screening of population samples. Telephone and face-to-face interviews were conducted between November 2012 and May 2013 using a structured survey that incorporated validated patient-reported outcome <b>instruments.</b> <b>Eligible</b> patients were adults aged 40 years and older who were taking regular respiratory medications or suffered with chronic respiratory symptoms and reported either 1) a physician diagnosis of COPD/emphysema, 2) a physician diagnosis of chronic bronchitis, or 3) a symptom-based definition of chronic bronchitis. The burden of COPD was measured with the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale. Results: Of 106, 876 households {{with at least one}} person aged >= 40 years, 4, 343 respondents fulfilled the case definition of COPD and completed the full survey. COPD prevalence ranged from 7 % to 12 %, with most countries falling within the range of 7 %- 9 %. In all countries, prevalence increased with age, and in all countries except the US was greater among men (range 6 %- 14 %) than among women (range 5 %- 11 %). A significant disease burden was observed when considering COPD symptoms or health status, and showed wide variations across countries. Prevalence of moderate-to-severe dyspnea (mMRC scale >= 2) ranged from 27 % to 61 %, and mean CAT score ranged from 16. 0 to 24. 8, indicating medium-to-high impairment. Conclusion: This survey, representing 12 countries, showed similar rates of estimated COPD prevalence across countries that were higher than those reported a decade ago in the original Confronting COPD International Survey.

Basel II was introduced after the various financial crises of the 1990 s (the Mexican crisis of 1994, the Asian crisis, and the Brazilian and Argentinean crisis). Despite a series of reforms, Basel II has quickly shown its limitations with the 2007 crisis that has strongly impacted the financial markets and the world economy generally. In this context, the Basel Committee has developed within Basel III a number of requirements which aim at strengthening the resilience of the banking institutions and financial system. These adjustments will be applied to the three pillars already in place and relate to capital, liquidity and systemic risks. The new Basel provisions relating to the calculation of the numerator of the solvency ratio are declined according to the triptych: strengthening the quality of prudential <b>eligible</b> own funds <b>instruments,</b> increase of the statutory deductions provided by Basel II, and higher minimum thresholds of solvency ratios. Furthermore, a limitation of the lever, calculated from the balance sheet and elements of off-balance sheet based on non-weighted by the risks, will be introduced. The Basel III criteria entering into force between 2013 and 2018 constitute one of the major challenges to which the banking sector will face. The real impact of the Basel III reform will depend on the attitude of the banks that will have to change in their strategy, their cost structure and policy of remuneration of the shareholders. A reform which will have therefore an impact on the world economy ensuring as estimated by Governors and supervisors, stability and long term economic performance. This paper will present the main adjustments proposed by the Basel Committee...|$|R

Materials and methods: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in 12 countries worldwide were identified through systematic screening of population samples. Telephone and face-to-face interviews were conducted between November 2012 and May 2013 using a structured survey that incorporated validated patient-reported outcome <b>instruments.</b> <b>Eligible</b> patients were adults aged 40 years and older who were taking regular respiratory medications or suffered with chronic respiratory symptoms and reported either 1) a physician diagnosis of COPD/emphysema, 2) a physician diagnosis of chronic bronchitis, or 3) a symptom-based definition of chronic bronchitis. The burden of COPD was measured with the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale. Results: Of 106, 876 households {{with at least one}} person aged ≥ 40 years, 4, 343 respondents fulfilled the case definition of COPD and completed the full survey. COPD prevalence ranged from 7 % to 12 %, with most countries falling within the range of 7 %– 9 %. In all countries, prevalence increased with age, and in all countries except the US was greater among men (range 6 %– 14 %) than among women (range 5 %– 11 %). A significant disease burden was observed when considering COPD symptoms or health status, and showed wide variations across countries. Prevalence of moderate-to-severe dyspnea (mMRC scale ≥ 2) ranged from 27 % to 61 %, and mean CAT score ranged from 16. 0 to 24. 8, indicating medium-to-high impairment. Conclusion: This survey, representing 12 countries, showed similar rates of estimated COPD prevalence across countries that were higher than those reported a decade ago in the original Confronting COPD International Survey. A significant burden of COPD was demonstrated by symptoms and health care-resource use, similar to that reported in the original survey.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Risk Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. South Africa will be {{implementing}} Basel II on 1 January 2008. Basel II provides {{regulatory capital}} requirements for credit risk, market risk and operational risk. The purpose of capital requirements is {{to level the}} playing field for all internationally active banks and to protect consumers against these risks. Although there is an obvious threat of liquidity risk and it is important to correctly measure and manage liquidity risk, it is almost glaringly omitted from Basel II. The result of not managing liquidity risk properly may have dire consequences for banks because a liquidity crisis may happen without warning. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore current practices and to propose guidelines for effective liquidity risk regulation in South Africa. A literature study and quantitative analysis on liquidity risk in South Africa were conducted to assess whether it is valid for regulators to require banks to hold capital for liquidity risk. This study provides conclusions and recommendations on the regulatory treatment of liquidity risk in South Africa under Basel II. Although Pillar 2 reviews a variety of other risks and not only liquidity risk, it is proposed that the liquidity risk part of such reviews is conducted on the basis of a questionnaire used to determine possible gaps between banks' practices and prescribed criteria regarding the management and measurement of liquidity risk. It is important to note that such an approach has a constraint in terms of the substantial amount of work that would have to be done on the regulation of liquidity risk by both regulators and banks. Therefore resource constraints and the cost versus the benefit of such an approach would have to be considered carefully. The all-encompassing conclusion to this study is that capital would not be an effective mitigant for liquidity risk for a number of reasons. Liquidity risk differs from bank to bank and a general capital charge for all banks may not be sensible, therefore liquidity risk should be analysed on a bank-by-bank basis. In other words, capital could be charged for liquidity risk under Pillar 2 (b) of Basel II. Such a capital charge would not serve the purpose of covering losses resulting from liquidity risk, but would instead impose a penalty on banks that are deemed to manage and measure liquidity risk imprudently. Such a penalty would typically be quite small but would serve as an incentive for banks to improve their management and measurement techniques to the desired level as set out by prescribed criteria. The criteria that should be used for determining whether banks measure and manage liquidity risk prudently should be of such a nature that the Bank Supervision Department (BSD) of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) complies with Basel Core Principle 14 : Liquidity Risk in regulating liquidity risk. In addition, it should align the criteria used to the 14 Principles for the sound management of liquidity as prescribed by the Bank for International Settlements and the Institute of International Finance. Furthermore, it is proposed that the BSD should not prescribe to banks which methods to use to report their liquidity risk, because all banks are not the same in terms of size and sophistication. For this reason, banks should be allowed to follow an internal models approach for liquidity risk whereby banks are, subject to regulatory approval, allowed to use their own internal liquidity risk measures to report liquidity risk to the BSD. This approach is similar to the approach followed by the Bundesbank in Germany. A liquidity risk questionnaire could be drafted according to which banks' liquidity risk management and measurement is assessed in terms of the sound Principles for managing liquidity risk and the Basel Core Principles. One questionnaire could be used for the purposes of assessing the quality of banks' liquidity risk management and measurement in terms of a Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) as well as for banks applying for approval of an internal models approach for liquidity risk. The same questionnaire could be used for both purposes, or the questionnaire could be divided into two clear sections whereby all banks are required to answer the SREP (or Pillar 2 (b)) section, and only banks applying for the use of an internal models approach for liquidity risk are required to complete this section. A further conclusion to this study is that the BSD should publish a framework in which its approach to regulating liquidity risk is described in detail. Some aspects that should be included in such a document include a widely-accepted definition for liquidity risk and guidelines/minimum standards for measurement and management techniques for liquidity risk and the process that will be followed under Pillar 2 of Basel II. If the BSD is concerned about the level of potential liquidity risk in the South African banking system, it should consider having the additional <b>instruments</b> that are <b>eligible</b> as collateral included as <b>instruments</b> <b>eligible</b> for liquid asset reserve requirements. An additional mitigant for liquidity risk may be that the BSD requires banks to report their liquidity risk more frequently than the current monthly basis. Master...|$|R
