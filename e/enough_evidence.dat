5|$|After {{extensive}} testimony, Justice Spicer {{ruled on}} November 30 {{that there was}} not <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> to indict the men. He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been deputized temporarily by Virgil. Though the Earps and Holliday were free, their reputations had been tarnished. The Cowboys in Tombstone looked upon the Earps as robbers and murderers and plotted revenge.|$|E
5|$|As a child William {{was educated}} in Jerusalem, at the cathedral {{school in the}} Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The scholaster, or school-master, John the Pisan, taught William to read and write, and first {{introduced}} him to Latin. From the Historia {{it is clear that}} he also knew French and possibly Italian, but there is not <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> to determine whether he learned Greek, Persian, and Arabic, as is sometimes claimed.|$|E

40|$|For {{a better}} {{understanding}} of what psychiatry is all about, the importance and stronghold of phenomenology and descriptive psychopathology in psychiatry has never been overstated. Biological psychiatry has accumulated <b>enough</b> <b>evidences</b> of mental illnesses until now {{but that does not mean}} that phenomenology and psychopathology would lose its shine. Rather psychopathology and phenomenology will afoot stronger as it is the philosophy of psychiatry...|$|R

While Detective Benson (Mariska Hargitay) {{interviews}} Deng at the hospital, Detective Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish), who has recently {{transferred from the}} Atlanta Police Department, finds <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> of the assault in Mr. DiStasio's hotel room.

5|$|In April 2010 The Guardian {{published}} {{an open letter}} from several public figures asking the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to proceed with a prosecution or explain its position. In July that year Keir Starmer, director of the CPS, announced {{that there would be}} no prosecution because of the medical disagreement between the three pathologists. Starmer said there was <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> for an assault charge, but the six-month deadline for that had expired.|$|E
5|$|On October 30, as {{permitted}} by territorial law, Ike Clanton filed murder {{charges against the}} Earps and Holliday.

40|$|The {{importance}} of integrity in {{business has been}} a popular topic for a long time. Opinions varies but can be summarized into two conflict conclusions, {{that it is necessary}} for corporation and that it is only an option.

5|$|Sampson felt, in 1995, {{that there}} was not <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> to {{conclude}} that Achelousaurus was a direct descendant of Einiosaurus. Unlike Horner, he decided to perform a cladistic analysis to establish a phylogeny. This showed an evolutionary tree wherein Achelousaurus split off between Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, as Horner had predicted. Contrary to Horner's claim, Styracosaurus albertensis could not have been a direct ancestor, as it was a sister species of Centrosaurus in Sampson's analysis.|$|E

50|$|Because every 50 {{years is}} a Jubilee year, there is a Yobel Cycle; Because every seven {{years is a}} sabbatical year, there is a seven-year Release Cycle. The {{placement}} of these cycles is controversial. Historically there are <b>enough</b> <b>evidences</b> to fix the sabbatical years in the Second Temple Period. But it may not match with the sabbatical cycle derived from the biblical period; {{and there is no}} consensus on whether or not the Jubilee year is the fiftieth year or {{the latter half of the}} forty ninth year.|$|R

5|$|Zappa {{was often}} sick as a child, {{suffering}} from asthma, earaches and sinus problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of radium {{into each of}} Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation, and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> to confirm this.|$|E
5|$|A {{small ship}} travels to a {{rotating}} space station. Aboard the station, {{a group of}} starfish-like beings discuss how to warn humans of an impending disaster, deciding on contacting Japanese scientist Dr. Kumara. Meanwhile, flying saucers are spotted over the skies of Tokyo, baffling scientists. A journalist tries to get a statement from Dr. Kumara about the sightings, but Kumara replies {{that there is not}} <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> to formulate a hypothesis. At an observatory, Professor Isobe spots an object in his telescope apparently releasing smaller objects.|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the double}} romantic concept about Arcadia (on the one hand, the Arcadia felix; on the other hand, the rough Arcadia), the historiography has {{considered}} that the polis did not develop in Arcadia {{until the end of}} the VIth century and the Vth century. Hovewer, I think that there are <b>enough</b> <b>evidences</b> (city-ethnics, civic mints, interstate relations, Pythian and Olympic victories and relations, a delimited and structured territory and urban archaeological evidence) to say that from the 7 th century there was a polis organization in Arcadia, as we can see in other Greek areas...|$|R

Vijayakanth has <b>enough</b> <b>evidences</b> to arrest the dangerous criminal Tiger Kali (Charan Raj). Vijayakanth befriends Rekha (Gouthami), a C.I.D inspector, without knowing that she is Seetha's friend. Seetha compels Rekha to live with them. Seetha has the blood cancer but she hides to her husband. When her husband and her friend know this news, they decide to go in U.S.A for the treatment but Tiger manages to kill Seetha and erases the proofs. Vijayakanth is now more determined to catch Tiger.|$|R
5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to oganesson have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is there <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better {{outcomes}} at one year but not at four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown {{to result in a}} different outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, there is not <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{evidence}} on the package eventually leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing {{that there is not}} <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that The Judge has manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy.

The study confirms that while none of customer value aspects has direct and positive relationship with customer retention, both customer satisfaction and customer loyalty positively and directly affect customer retention...|$|R
