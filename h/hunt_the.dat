5|$|In the Jataka {{tales of}} the Buddha's {{previous}} lives, there is narration related to his birth as Boddhisattva in a forest as a Sharabha, the eight-legged deer. This story is of one compassion of the deer shown towards the King who wanted to <b>hunt</b> <b>the</b> deer. The King, while trying to <b>hunt</b> <b>the</b> deer, fell into a precipice with his horse. The deer instead of abandoning the king to his fate rescued him. The King was deeply touched by the compassion shown by the deer and thereafter promulgated a decry stating that hunting was an illegal activity in his country.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels were {{originally}} bred as hunting {{dogs in the}} United Kingdom, with the term cocker deriving from their use to <b>hunt</b> <b>the</b> Eurasian woodcock. When the breed {{was brought to the}} United States, it was bred to a different standard, which enabled it to specialize in hunting the American woodcock. Further physical changes were bred into the cocker in the United States during {{the early part of the}} 20th century.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{categories}} of direct defaunation. They include subsistence hunting and commercial <b>hunting.</b> <b>The</b> most common species of animals <b>hunted</b> are typically <b>the</b> largest species in their area.

In areas with only moderate <b>hunting,</b> <b>the</b> biomass of mammalian game species decreases by 80.7%. In areas with heavy <b>hunting,</b> <b>the</b> biomass of mammalian game species can decrease by 93.7%.|$|R

5|$|Evolve is {{an action}} video {{game with a}} focus on both co-operative, and competitive, {{multiplayer}} gameplay. The game adapts a '4v1' asymmetrical structure where four players take control of the Hunters, while the fifth player controls the Monster.

40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the {{compulsory}} connection of <b>the</b> rights to <b>hunt</b> with <b>the</b> ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. <b>The</b> aim of this work is to divide and describe two kinds of hunting grounds according to the types of ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. There is also an economic analysis of revenues and expenses regarding hunting rights in these hunting grounds. It further analyses the impact of diminishing of the minimum area of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> grounds on <b>the</b> economy of <b>hunting.</b> It also tries {{to find out whether}} the diminishing would lead to hunting rights more interwoven with the ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. <b>The</b> conducted research confirmed the existence of two types of hunting grounds that differ by the kind of ownership and also revenues and expenses regarding hunting rights in these hunting lands. It was further found out that the diminishing of the minimum area of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> grounds would increase the bindingness of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> rights with <b>the</b> ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. <b>The</b> economic impact of the diminishing of the minimum area of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> ground couldn't be unequivocally determined...|$|R

5|$|A cryptozoologist named Lincoln Anderson, a {{biologist}} named Wendy Gardner, and a hunter named Cameron Caine visit {{the town and}} have a brief meeting with Overman to discuss capturing the shark. With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to <b>hunt</b> <b>the</b> shark. The shark kills each person except for Mike. Following this, Chapman, Lincoln, Wendy, and Cameron {{make their way into}} the woods, armed with a miniature crossbow, a shotgun, and a motion-sensing camera. They set up the camera on a tree and depart. At the town bar, Professor Hoffman enters, having gone into hiding and now wearing an eyepatch. Later, he and a grieving Mike drink beers.|$|E

5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between August and November 1996, Venom: The Hunger {{introduces the}} Venom symbiote's reliance on phenethylamine for survival (which requires it to eat human brains after depleting Brock's {{supply of the}} chemical) and reveals that chocolate {{is a source of}} the chemical. Brock refuses to eat human brains; the symbiote abandons him, and he is locked in an asylum under the care of the deranged Dr. Paine. Brock escapes to <b>hunt</b> <b>the</b> symbiote, which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative source of the chemical), but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. Brock frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E

Scream returns as an anti-hero after the events of Venom: Separation Anxiety to protect the hosts of the invasion symbiotes. Venom is hunted by the police, who blame it for the murders committed by the Xenophage. Venom and Scream kill the Xenophage and escape their police pursuit.|$|E

Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are sent to help the U.S. Marshals find them. The agents note that the FBI does not normally investigate prison escapes, and become suspicious as the prison is quarantined by the CDC and the National Guard.

5|$|Currently, {{the most}} stable and secure {{part of the sea}} otter's range is Russia. Before the 19th century, around 20,000 to 25,000 sea otters lived near the Kuril Islands, with more near Kamchatka and the Commander Islands. After the years of the Great <b>Hunt,</b> <b>the</b> {{population}} in these areas, currently part of Russia, was only 750. By 2004, sea otters had repopulated all of their former habitat in these areas, with an estimated total population of about 27,000. Of these, about 19,000 are at the Kurils, 2,000 to 3,500 at Kamchatka and another 5,000 to 5,500 at the Commander Islands. Growth has slowed slightly, suggesting the numbers are reaching carrying capacity.|$|E

5|$|More recently, it {{has been}} {{suspected}} that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (S.speciosus) and Pacific cicada killer (S.convallis) at Big Bend National Park in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers <b>hunt</b> <b>the</b> same cicada species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the western cicada killer contains two divergent clades, which may represent distinct species. The two clades appeared to be split by the Rocky Mountains, with one occurring mainly {{to the south and}} east, the other to the west.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} summer, Greatfoot is {{run over}} and killed while {{crossing}} a freeway during a <b>hunt.</b> <b>The</b> pups begin hearing a strange wolf howl, but when they track it they find a fresh kill and the familiar human scent.

One night when they hear the unusual howl, they are closer than usual to it and reach the kill in time to meet their benefactor, a human male. The pack stares at the man, before disappearing back into the forest, ignoring his howl. As he goes to leave, however, the six return {{to the edge of}} the clearing and howl.|$|E
