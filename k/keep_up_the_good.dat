500|$|Regarding the video, Madonna said it {{was like}} [...] "oody goody gum drops", {{referring}} to the candy-oriented theme of the album. Virginia Heffernan from The New York Times called the video heart-pounding, and compared its momentum with the music video of [...] "Thriller, [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] and [...] "Shadows of the Night". However, Eric Wilson from the same newspaper commented that the video did not yield a breakout Madonna look compared to her videos from the 1980s. Singer Miley Cyrus created her {{own version of the}} video and posted it on her YouTube channel. Madonna responded to it in her own video and said, [...] "All you {{people out there who are}} making videos to my new single, '4 Minutes,' <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> work, nice job."

The Latest Decalogue's couplet on murder, [...] "Thou shalt not kill; but needst not strive officiously to keep alive:" [...] is often quoted – usually out of context – in debates on medical ethics {{in the sense that}} it is not right to struggle to keep terminally ill people alive, especially if they are suffering.

Though Hunsdon was outnumbered, he charged Dacre's foot with his cavalry, killing 300-400 and capturing 200-300 men. Dacre escaped via Scotland to Flanders, where he died in exile.|$|R
60|$|What, for example, are {{the qualities}} in the {{citizens}} individually which conduce most to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> amount of <b>good</b> conduct, of good management, {{of success and}} prosperity, which already exist in society? Every body will agree that those qualities are industry, integrity, justice, and prudence. But are not these, of all qualities, the most conducive to improvement? and is not any growth of these virtues in the community in itself the greatest of improvements? If so, whatever qualities in the government are promotive of industry, integrity, justice, and prudence, conduce alike to permanence and to progression, only there is needed more of those qualities to make the society decidedly progressive than merely to keep it permanent.|$|R

40|$|The laser {{pretreatment}} of AlMg 3 {{has been}} conducted to investigate {{the influence of the}} fluence on the oxide properties. Therefore, the aluminum surface is pretreated by a fiber laser and subsequently analyzed by SEM, EDX, and XPS. Finally, mechanical measurements are performed on adhesively bonded specimens to study the surface properties produced. For the purpose of comparison, the two state-of-the-art pretreatment methods etching and phosphoric acid anodizing are also investigated. The results show that laser pretreatment changes the properties of the aluminum surface and especially those of the oxide layer. The latter grows in comparison to the natural oxide layer of etched surfaces but does not reach the dimensions of an electrochemically formed oxide layer. Mechanical testing showed that the laser treated specimens reach and exceed the strength values of etched and anodized surfaces, respectively. However, strength after aging does not <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with <b>the</b> <b>good</b> long-term resistance of anodized aluminum, but it exceeds by far the values obtained for etched surfaces. Overall the study showed that optimizing the oxide layer by laser pretreatment leads to improved adhesion and enhances the strength of adhesively bonded aluminum. Therefore, the laser pretreatment of aluminum is an excellent alternative to wet (electro) chemical processes...|$|R

60|$|The Tout.--The {{choice of}} articles, {{apart from their}} usefulness, is an appetising occupation, and to {{exchange}} bald, uniform shillings for a fine big, figurative knick-knack, such as a windmill, a gross of green spectacles, or a cocked hat, gives us a direct and emphatic sense of gain. We have had many shillings before, as good as these; {{but this is the}} first time we have possessed a windmill. Upon these principles of human nature, Sir, is based the theory of the Charity Bazaar. People were doubtless charitably disposed. The problem was to make the exercise of charity entertaining in itself--you follow me, Madam?--and in the Charity Bazaar a satisfactory solution was attained. The act of giving away money for charitable purposes is, by this admirable invention, transformed into an amusement, and puts on the externals of profitable commerce. You play at shopping a while; and in order to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> illusion, sham <b>goods</b> do actually change hands.

60|$|It {{began to}} strike us now, however, {{that we had}} almost {{overshot}} the mark in this matter of sanctity. We had made ourselves quite too holy. The monks, who were eager at first to cut our throats, thought so much of us now that we grew a little anxious {{as to whether they}} would not wish to keep such devout souls in their midst for ever. As a matter of fact, we spent a whole week against our wills in the monastery, being very well fed and treated meanwhile, yet virtually captives. It was the camera that did it. The Lamas had never seen any photographs before. They asked how these miraculous pictures were produced; and Hilda, to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> impression, showed them how she operated. When a full-length portrait of the chief Lama, in his sacrificial robes, was actually printed off and exhibited before their eyes, their delight knew no bounds. The picture was handed about among the astonished brethren, and received with loud shouts of joy and wonder. Nothing would satisfy them then but that we must photograph every individual monk in the place. Even the Buddha himself, cross-legged and imperturbable, had to sit for his portrait. As he was used to sitting--never, indeed, having done anything else--he came out admirably.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} World Bank’s model RONET to a strategic network level analysis of the Serbian toll road network. Tolls have been collected on these roads since the 1980 s. Despite the toll revenues, the condition of this network deteriorated considerably during the 1990 s. In recent years a more substantial part of the toll revenues {{has been applied to}} the toll roads, thus gradually improving the condition of such roads. The goals of the study are to obtain the optimum maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) strategy and related budget, estimate the impact of different funding levels on the future quality, and estimate the economic consequences of budget constraints for maintenance and rehabilitation of the toll road network. The analysis shows that a substantial part of the toll revenues can be allocated to the non-tolled part of the Serbian road network without detrimental impact on the condition of the tolled network. Application of the RONET model to the prevailing conditions on the Serbian toll road network led to an optimal M&R strategy with a good balance between rehabilitation, periodic and recurrent maintenance. Implementation of the “Optimal ” M&R strategy would <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> relatively <b>good</b> current condition of the toll road network. In other words, the current level of maintenance is close to the optimal. Implementation of higher than optimal M&R standards would lead to substantially higher road agency costs and consequently lower net benefits, while the implementation of lower than optimal M&R standards would lead to considerably worse network condition and higher vehicle operating costs.

60|$|In our own English tongue, too, we may read such poetry {{as there}} is in no other {{language}} in the world; poetry which will make us indeed see the beauty of whatsoever things are lovely and of good report. Some people have still a dislike of what they call foolish poetry books. If books are foolish, let us {{have nothing to do with}} them. But poetry ought not to be foolish; for God sent it into the world to teach men not foolishness, but the highest wisdom. He gave man alone, of all living creatures, the power of writing poetry, that by poetry he might understand, not only how necessary it was to do right, but how beautiful and noble it was to do right. He sent it into the world to soften men's rough hearts, and quiet their angry passions, and make them love all which is tender and gentle, loving and merciful, and yet to rouse them up to love all which is gallant and honourable, loyal and patriotic, devout and heavenly. Therefore whole books of the Bible--Job, for example, Isaiah, and the Psalms-- are neither more nor less than actual poetry, written in actual verse, that their words might the better sink down into the ears and hearts of the old Jews, and of us Christians after them. And therefore also, we <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> still <b>the</b> <b>good</b> old custom of teaching children in school as much as possible by poetry, that they may learn not only to know, but to love and remember whatsoever things are lovely and of good report.|$|R
