40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the feasibility of reconstructing intended arm movements from neural spike trains in real-time. Currently, research groups develop specialized environments for studying closed-loop control, and these environments typically depend on specialized hardware, multiple computers, and multiple <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> This complexity limits the transfer of neural prosthetic work to a clinical environment and the rapid implementation of new decoding algorithms or paradigms in animal studies. In order to address these issues, we have implemented TG 2, a Windows-based <b>software</b> <b>package</b> that integrates flexible behavioral control scripting with real-time neural decoding. A novel state-machine-based representation of experiments allows behavioral tasks to be developed graphically. Device-independent hardware abstractions allow experiments to be rapidly transferred among a variety of neural data acquisition systems, kinematic input devices, and neural decoding algorithms. An integrated simulation package allows offline development and debugging of real-time decoding algorithms. Although TG 2 is designed for neurophysiology, it makes use of novel features that are applicable {{to a wide variety}} of behavioral experiments. We discuss the design and implementation of TG 2, the novel software architecture and operator interface techniques that separate <b>it</b> from related <b>software</b> <b>packages,</b> and its initial use in both clinical and animal studies. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Image {{filtering}} involves {{taking a}} digital image and producing {{a new image}} from <b>it.</b> In <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> such as Adobe’s Photoshop, image filters are used to produce artistic versions of original images. Such software usually includes hundreds of different image filtering algorithms, each with many fine-tuneable parameters. While this freedom of exploration may be liberating to artists and designers, it can be daunting for less experienced users. Photoshop provides image filter browsing technology, but does not yet enable {{the construction of a}} filter which produces a reasonable approximation of a given filtered image from a given original image. We investigate here whether it is possible to automatically evolve an image filter to approximate a target filter, given only an original image and a filtered version of the original. We describe a tree based representation for filters, the fitness functions and search techniques we employed, and we present the results of experimentation with various search setups. We demonstrate the feasibility of evolving image filters and suggest new ways to improve the process. ...|$|R

Our {{goal is to}} develop novel method for visualization of simulation results and implement <b>it</b> in simulation <b>software</b> <b>package</b> equipped with the sophisticated mathematical and computational techniques for model development, verification and parameter fitting. Results We present mathematical simulation workbench DBSolve Optimum which is significantly improved and extended successor of well known simulation software DBSolve 5. Concept of "dynamic visualization" of simulation results has been developed and implemented in DBSolve Optimum. In framework of the concept graphical objects representing metabolite concentrations and reactions change their volume and shape in accordance to simulation results.
