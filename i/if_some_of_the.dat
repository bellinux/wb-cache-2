5|$|Most natural {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. <b>If</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> components are liquid {{at a given}} temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays {{a critical role in}} biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.|$|E
25|$|A finite set of k-simplexes {{embedded}} {{in an open}} subset of Rn is called an affine k-chain. The simplexes in a chain need not be unique; they may occur with multiplicity. Rather than using standard set notation to denote an affine chain, it is instead the standard practice to use plus signs to separate each member in the set. <b>If</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simplexes have the opposite orientation, these are prefixed by a minus sign. <b>If</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simplexes occur in the set more than once, these are prefixed with an integer count. Thus, an affine chain takes the symbolic form of a sum with integer coefficients.|$|E

25|$|The Fourth Buddhist {{council of}} Theravada Buddhism {{was held at}} the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya in Sri Lanka under the {{patronage}} of Valagamba of Anuradhapura in 25 BCE. The council was held in response to a year in which the harvests in Sri Lanka were particularly poor and many Buddhist monks subsequently died of starvation. Because the Pāli Canon was at that time oral literature maintained in several recensions by dhammabhāṇakas (dharma reciters), the surviving monks recognized the danger of not writing it down so that even <b>if</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monks whose duty it was to study and remember parts of the Canon for later generations died, the teachings would not be lost.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to reduce the {{concentration}} of inclusions. In order to reduce oxide formation the metal can be melted with a flux, in a vacuum, or in an inert atmosphere. Other ingredients can be added to the mixture to cause the dross to float to the top where it can be skimmed off before the metal is poured into the mold. If this is not practical, then a special ladle that pours the metal from the bottom can be used. Another option is to install ceramic filters into the gating system. Otherwise swirl gates can be formed which swirl the liquid metal as it is poured in, forcing the lighter inclusions to the center and keeping them out of the casting. <b>If</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dross or slag is folded into the molten metal then it becomes an entrainment defect.|$|E
25|$|Ordinaries {{were often}} accused on the {{newspapers}} by competing writers of criminal lives of fabricating the last dying speeches of the condemned and of manipulating their position to extract confessions from them. Paul Lorrain {{was accused of}} confessing the criminals for his economical profit and Purney was attacked for literary incompetence. Accusations of withholding the sacrament under the pretense of the criminals not being prepared but in reality with the goal to get an account {{of their lives and}} transactions were common. Even <b>if</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condemned were really compelled to confess sins which laid heavily on their conscience, most of them did so only to qualify for the sacrament, acknowledging a catalogue of general misdeeds and stopping short of admitting to more serious crimes, especially the one of which they were accused of for fear of jeopardising their chances of a reprieve.|$|E
500|$|Bayesian {{statistical}} {{techniques can}} be applied when there are several radiocarbon dates to be calibrated.

[...] Such a verdict would have meant Ney's lifelong incarceration, but would not have required his execution. When the military court refused to reach a verdict, Ney's case went to the Chamber of Peers, which was populated by a mix of old and new peers. The old peers might not have been receptive to Ney's predicament; he had been, after all, a highly visible party to Napoleon's success throughout Europe. <b>If</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new peers were sympathetic to Ney's situation, they may also have been anxious to prove their own loyalty to the new regime. Ney's penalty was a foregone conclusion.|$|E
500|$|Recorded at Henson Recording Studios, Hollywood, California, and Radley Studios, Los Angeles, California, by Justin Stanley, [...] "Army of Me" [...] was co-written by Aguilera with Jamie Hartman, David Glass and Phil Bentley.

In an interview with Andrew Hampp for Billboard, Aguilera explained how her role on The Voice has allowed her to reach a new generational audience who may not be familiar with her past work, including songs such as her 2002 single, [...] "Fighter". When asked <b>if</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs on Lotus feature themes which are similar to that of her 2002 album, Stripped, Aguilera responded by saying that [...] "Army of Me" [...] is what she describes as [...] "Fighter 2.0".|$|E

Hinckley went on to remark that [...] "Ugly Americans packs a lot into 21 or 22 minutes. Happily, its often droll and deadpan style makes it easy to watch even <b>if</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> references are whizzing by unappreciated". RedEye critic Curt Wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that it includes [...] "visual [...] ", cultural references and [...] "so-fast-you'll-miss-them jokes" [...] that it might require multiple viewings. Wagner, however, meant that this was a rather positive feature, writing: [...] "For example, you might be laughing so hard at what just happened that you miss a fun line..."
