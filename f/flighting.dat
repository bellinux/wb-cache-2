5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson at the crease. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Saggers {{came in and}} only managed five in his first Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker, who was still bowling in an attacking manner and <b>flighting</b> his deliveries, undeterred by the sixes Loxton had hit from him, rather than bowling leg theory. This left Australia at 355/8 ten minutes before tea, with only Johnston and Toshack remaining.|$|E

Trubshaw worked {{on the development of the}} Valiant V-bomber, the Vanguard, the VC10, and the BAC One-Eleven, and test flew all of these.|$|E
500|$|The third {{match was}} {{played on a}} very good pitch for batting in {{extremely}} hot weather, and England {{did not have a}} strong bowling attack in the view of Wisden. England scored 627, of which Verity scored 60 not out; Wisden commented that he batted slowly but well. Australia replied with 491 when they batted; Verity took four for 78 in 53overs and was able to prevent the batsmen scoring quickly. The match was eventually drawn. Cardus, in criticising the English bowlers in the game, wrote: [...] "Verity is apparently the only England bowler in existence at the present time—and he is not subtle on a hard wicket." [...] Poor weather prevented an English defeat in the fourth Test, as Bradman and Bill Ponsford shared a partnership of 388runs; Verity took three wickets but, in doing so, conceded 113 runs. The final, decisive game, was won by Australia, who therefore regained the Ashes. Bradman and Ponsford this time scored 451runs together as their team totalled 701; Verity was wicketless in the match and conceded 166runs. Cardus, assessing the English bowling, regretted that England did not have a bowler capable of <b>flighting</b> the ball, a role usually performed by left-arm spinners. Verity took 24wickets in the series at 24.00, finishing second in the averages. Reviewing the series, Wisden editor Sydney Southerton wrote, [...] "Verity, apart from his one amazing performance at Lord's, could be complimented upon his steadiness rather than upon his effectiveness on hard wickets". Verity also made other representative appearances in the season; Yorkshire dropped to sixth position, handicapped by the limited appearances of four players who were regularly absent at representative matches.|$|E

500|$|During the 1935 season Yorkshire {{regained the}} County Championship, and Verity passed 200wickets {{for the first}} time in his career, taking 211 at an average of 14.36 to finish third in the {{national}} averages. He took five wickets in an innings 22times and had 10 or more wickets in seven matches. South Africa played England in a five-Test series that year and won the series 1–0. Verity was selected in the first four games. In the first, his figures were three for 52 in 41overs on a pitch which assisted spin bowlers. England were in a position of dominance when rain ruined the game. Shortly afterwards, the tourists defeated Yorkshire; in the second innings, Jock Cameron hit 30runs from a single over bowled by Verity. Arthur Wood, the Yorkshire wicket-keeper, commented during the over: [...] "Go on, Hedley, you have him in two minds. He doesn't know whether to hit you for four or six!" [...] South Africa won the second Test match, their first Test win in England, although Verity took six wickets in the match. In the third game, Verity had bowling figures of two wickets for nine runs from 25overs in the match and in the fourth, he took one for 72 from 40overs. These two games were drawn, leaving England needing a victory in the final match. By now, Verity had acquired a reputation for being unable to take wickets on good batting pitches. In the report on the fourth Test, Wisden's correspondent observed: [...] "Verity again failed to worry South Africa's batsmen". With victory essential, Verity was dropped for the last match. He was replaced by off-spinner Johnnie Clay, regarded by critics as effective at <b>flighting</b> the ball.|$|E
500|$|As a bowler, Rhodes was {{recognised}} {{by critics}} {{as one of}} the greatest slow bowlers of all time. Very effective at dismissing batsmen on difficult pitches, it was difficult to score runs from his bowling even on a good batting surface. He could make the ball turn if the pitch offered the slightest assistance, particularly if it had been affected by rain. Cricket writer E. W. Swanton described how Rhodes had [...] "a beautifully controlled, economical and rhythmical action which ensured supreme accuracy of length and direction. He was a master of the stock left-hander's spin and could vary it with the ball that came on with the arm." [...] In his early years as a bowler, Rhodes was able to spin the ball very sharply, and while this ability decreased in later years, he became expert at working out a batsman's weaknesses. Critics considered him expert at <b>flighting</b> the ball; Neville Cardus wrote that [...] "Flight was his secret. Flight and the curving line, now higher, now lower, tempting, inimical; every ball like every other ball, yet somehow unlike; each over in collusion with the others, part of a plot..." [...] In the early part of his career, his bowling partnership with Hirst, who shared Rhodes's Kirkheaton birthplace, was particularly effective and established a formidable reputation. As time passed, his accuracy increased to the extent that it seemed every ball landed in exactly the same place. In his first five seasons, he was top of the national bowling averages twice and in second place three times, while in the first six seasons after the war, he was first four times and second once. In his whole career, he only fell outside the top 20 in the bowling averages in four seasons.|$|E

He was an expert in <b>flighting</b> the ball, and was capable of making it hold it back or hurry forward and added subtle variations of spin.

50|$|Steady <b>flight,</b> unaccelerated <b>flight,</b> or {{equilibrium}} <b>flight</b> is {{a special}} case in <b>flight</b> dynamics where the aircraft's linear and angular velocity are constant in a body-fixed reference frame.
