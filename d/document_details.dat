5|$|The Kaqchikel {{people were}} {{closely related to}} the K'iche', their former allies. The K'iche'an peoples (including the Kaqchikel, the K'iche' and others) had {{received}} strong influences from central Mexico since the time of the great Early Classic metropolis of Teotihuacan. The history of Iximche is largely drawn from the Annals of the Kaqchikels, a document written in the Kaqchikel language but using Latin characters soon after the Spanish Conquest. This <b>document</b> <b>details</b> the origins, history and conquest of the Kaqchikels. The Kaqchikel served as close allies of the K'iche' for many years. The Kaqchikel rulers Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' served the great K'iche' king K'iq'ab with such loyalty that he rewarded them with the royal titles Ahpo Sotz'il and Ahpo Xahil and the power to rule. The sons of K'iq'ab became jealous of the growing power of the Kaqchikel lords and led a revolt against their father that seriously damaged his authority. This revolt had serious consequences for the K'iche' as their conquered domains seized the opportunity to break free from their subjugation.|$|E

25|$|Yemenite Jews also {{experienced}} violent persecution at times. In the late-1160s, the Yemenite ruler 'Abd-al-Nabī ibn Mahdi left Jews {{with the choice}} between conversion to Islam or martyrdom. Mahdi also imposed his beliefs upon the Muslims besides the Jews. This led to a revival of Jewish messianism, but also led to mass-conversion. While a popular local Yemenite Jewish preacher called Jews to choose martyrdom, Maimonides sent what is known by the name Iggeret Teman (Epistle to Yemen), requesting that they remain faithful to their religion, but if at all possible, not to cast affronts before their antagonists. The persecution ended in 1173 with the defeat of Ibn Mahdi and conquest of Yemen by the brother of Saladin and {{they were allowed to}} return to their faith. According to two Genizah documents, the Ayyubid ruler of Yemen, al-Malik al-Mu'izz al-Ismail (reigned from 1197-1202) had attempted to force the Jews of Aden to convert. The second <b>document</b> <b>details</b> the relief of Jewish community after his murder and those who had been forced to convert reverted to Judaism.|$|E

[...] gives {{details of}} {{the progress of the}} works, including details of bridges, cuttings, raised bankings and aqueducts. [...] Much of the <b>document</b> <b>details</b> the work required to convert the canal to broad gauge. [...] A [...] length between Oldfield Lane in Salford and Giants Seat Locks in Outwood was navigable with 3ft 8in (1.12m) of water. [...] The remaining work included strengthening work to the banks, an increase of water depth to , and the gravelling of half of the towpath. [...] Between Giants Seat locks and Ringley Bridge two locks had been erected, with a small section of canal to be broadened before becoming navigable. [...] From Ringley Bridge to Prestolee Aqueduct one lock had been erected. [...] Nob End Locks were still under construction but mostly complete, although the basin at the bottom had not yet been dug. [...] The stretch to Bolton had at this time been widened, with several bridges requiring further work, incomplete embankments, construction of a weir, and gravelling of the towpath. [...] On the Bury arm, almost the entire length had been dug, and walls to support the canal along the bank of the Irwell had been built. [...] Some widening of previously narrow sections had yet to be undertaken, none of the towpath had been gravelled, and no fences had been erected along the towpath.|$|E

An analysis by the Associated Press found that Wikileaks had {{in one of its}} mass-disclosures published [...] "the personal information of hundreds of people — including sick children, rape victims and mental health patients". Wikileaks has named teenage rape victims, and outed an individual arrested for homosexuality in Saudi Arabia. Some of Wikileaks' cables [...] "described patients with psychiatric conditions, seriously ill children or refugees". An analysis of Wikileaks' Saudi cables [...] "turned up more than 500 passport, identity, academic or employment files... three dozen records pertaining to family issues in the cables — including messages about marriages, divorces, missing children, elopements and custody battles. Many are very personal, like the marital certificates that reveal whether the bride was a virgin. Others deal with Saudis who are deeply in debt, including one man who says his wife stole his money. One divorce <b>document</b> <b>details</b> a male partner's infertility. Others identify the partners of women suffering from sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C." [...] Two individuals named in the DNC leaks were targeted by identity thieves following Wikileaks' reveal of their Social Security and credit card information. In its leak of DNC e-mails, Wikileaks revealed the details of an ordinary staffer's suicide attempt and brought attention to it through a tweet.|$|E
