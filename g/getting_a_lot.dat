5|$|Bayern is one {{of three}} {{professional}} football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who were the more successful club in the 1960s, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division but lately, have settled in the second division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of extra attention from supporters of both clubs. 1860 Munich is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where the manufacturing sector is declining. Bayern is considered the establishment club, which is reflected by many board members being business leaders and including the former Bavarian minister president, Edmund Stoiber. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.|$|E
25|$|England {{lost three}} early wickets {{in their second}} innings, but their middle order rallied, and they reached 138, despite both Schwarz and Vogler <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{movement}} with their bowling. South Africa needed 256 runs in two hours and forty minutes to secure an unlikely victory. Their captain, Sherwell, announced that they would give it a go, and the opening batsmen, Sinclair and Faulkner began well, moving the score to 61 runs after 35 minutes. Three wickets from Hirst restricted the South Africans, but further attacking batting from the South Africans entertained the crowds until the match was stopped due to poor light, resulting in a draw.|$|E

[...] The evening before the season was posted, someone responsible for the @BarackObama Twitter account (which is run by Organizing for Action) tweeted a request that no spoilers be posted online.

Except sex. Sex is about power" [...] (an Oscar Wilde quote Underwood had stated during season 1).|$|E
500|$|The show {{revolved}} around the life Carey would have lived {{if he had not}} become a stand-up comedian. Carey told Helford that he thought he would have been employed in a mid-level management job, which was a relatable job for most Americans at the time. Carey wanted a show that was about regular people. He also wanted to set the show in Cleveland as it was his hometown and it was not <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of attention. Carey and Helford drove to the city together in January 1995 to do some research. They toured the local bars {{to try to get the}} right look for the show's bar the Warsaw Tavern.

Leach spoke of Dutkiewicz and recording vocals stating, [...] "I definitely hand it to Adam D. – he's the man. We're taking our time, dissecting things. It's made me push myself to my limits – <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more passion and deliver out of what I'm doing." [...] After struggling with nervousness for a while, Dutkiewicz and Leach went to Leach's home in Rhode Island to finish recording vocals. Mike Gitter was reluctant to hear of this when Killswitch Engage turned the record into Roadrunner, but was ultimately pleased with the results. Before {{the completion of the}} record, the band brought in Tom Gomes to play drums as Dutkiewicz moved to the empty guitar position. Though Dutkiewicz recorded most of the drums himself, Gomes provided additional percussion on the album, before he was an official member of the band. Backing vocals on Alive or Just Breathing were done by Leach, Dutkiewicz, as well as Dutkiewicz's sister Becka, and All That Remains singer Philip Labonte.|$|E

500|$|Mike Hale of The New York Times {{felt that}} the episode was problematic. He thought that having Kurt {{sabotage}} his own audition sent out a [...] "mixed message", and believed that actress Lauren Potter was [...] "used as a prop in the continuing humanization of Sue Sylvester." [...] Hale wrote that the storyline felt [...] "smarmy and artificial", though praised Lynch for making the scene with Sue's sister [...] "warm and real". Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson {{felt that the}} revelation about Sue's sister was [...] "a little manipulative", though wrote that he [...] "didn't care in that glorious moment." [...] He hoped that Glee writers would not humanize Sue too often, however, fearing that she would lose her [...] "dictatorial swagger". Eric Goldman for IGN rated the episode 7.5/10, commenting: [...] "I really hope that episode was about <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of 'issue' storylines {{out of the way}} all at once, because {{that was a lot of}} overkill."

500|$|During {{the first}} season, the writing staff used {{most of the}} story ideas that were in Hillenburg's series bible and they had {{problems}} on how to generate new ideas.

[...] Drymon said [...] "We didn't come up with too many ideas that day." [...] Story editor Peter Burns left, and the crew had Merriwether Williams to overtake. Hillenburg said to Williams that [...] "it was her responsibility to get us [...] to come up with new ideas." [...] Drymon said [...] " [...] is a tall order." [...] Williams gave Drymon a book called Zen in the Art of Writing, written by Ray Bradbury, that catalogs a collection of essays about writing processes. One of the ways in the book to inspire plots was [...] "to write nouns that interested him [...] on a note card and hang them in his office. He felt just having the word in his eyesight would get his mind working." [...] Williams took this scheme and made it into [...] "a writing exercise." [...] In writing meetings, the staff would all enumerate 10 nouns on strips of paper and place them in a hat. The hat would be passed throughout and a writer would have a limited time to spawn an idea based on the noun he wrote. Drymon said [...] "It would almost always start a discussion, and we wound up <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of episodes out of it." [...] Furthermore, Drymon said that Williams [...] "really came up with a great addition to the process." ...|$|E

In the plate final against Nepal he took three wickets for nine runs (3/9) and scored 24 not out. Bravo finished the 2007/08 season with two first-class matches but failed to score a substantial innings with a best of 29.|$|E
2500|$|Publishing {{the means}} of suicides, romanticized and sensationalized reporting, {{particularly}} about celebrities, suggestions {{that there is an}} epidemic, glorifying the deceased and simplifying the reasons all lead to increases in the suicide rate. People may see suicide as a glamorous ending, with the young person or elderly person <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of attention, lots of sympathy, and lots of national concern that they never got in life. The second possible factor is that vulnerable youth may feel like, [...] "If they couldn't cut it, neither can I". Increased rate of suicides has been shown to occur up to ten days after a television report. Studies in Japan and Germany have replicated findings of an imitative effect. Etzersdorfer et al. in an Austrian study showed a strong correlation between the number of papers distributed in various areas and the number of subsequent firearm suicides in each area after a related media report. Higher rates of copycat suicides have been found in those with similarities in race, age, and gender to the victim in the original report.|$|E

As of 2009 no documentary evidence from US archives or elsewhere has been provided to support the claim that the song is [...] "traditional" [...] (though Country singer Carl Smith did have a hit in 1953 with a song of the same title written by Boudleaux Bryant). Prior to Rose's recording, The Leaves, The Surfaris, Love and The Byrds had all recorded fast-paced versions of the song. Rose's version (crediting himself as author), unlike the others, was a slow, angry ballad, which received US radio airplay and became a regional hit in the San Francisco area in 1966, as well as upstate New York cities like Buffalo and Albany. Jimi Hendrix had seen Rose performing at Cafe Wha? in New York City, and released a similarly slow version in 1966 which became a huge hit, first in the UK, then worldwide.
