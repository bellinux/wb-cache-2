40|$|The German {{remote sensing}} {{satellite}} TerraSAR-X, launched in 2007, hosts a flexible X-Band {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) operating in Stripmap, Spotlight, ScanSAR, and additional experimental modes. For these various antenna beams, its active phased array antenna electronically steers and shapes the patterns in azimuth and elevation direction. The array consists of 384 radiating sub-arrays for horizontal and vertical polarisation each. Each individual array element is controlled by a transmit/receive (T/R) module to adjust phase and gain {{in a very short}} time. This paper demonstrates the excellent accuracy of this novel PN Gating technique down to accuracies of better than 0. 1 dB. During on-ground characterisation of the TerraSAR-X instrument this technique has established as a crucial diagnostic tool for <b>functional</b> <b>checks.</b> After launch, this innovative method is applied for in-flight performance monitoring of the TerraSAR-X antenna front-end.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this article is to present a case study of {{aircraft}} production customer inspection process and analyze the needs and benefits for such market practice. Enabling operators and owners to closely follow certain production process milestones contributes to a more reliable operation, compliance with customer expectations and proper detection, documentation and rectification of production discrepancies. Nevertheless, although often required by customers, few airframe manufacturers dispose of a formal production inspection program to guide operators and owners through the process. The production inspection program implemented by a large commercial aircraft manufacturer is thoroughly analysed, discussed and benchmarked for future references. The scope of such work includes observations of intermediate inspection activities throughout the aircraft final assembly line up to the end of the aircraft delivery process and consequent technical acceptance. Airframe and systems assembly processes are subject to either visual, operational or <b>functional</b> <b>checks.</b> As a result, production concessions are assessed and dealt with in such a manner to avoid future negative impacts on the aircraft operation, maintenance and airworthiness. Best practices and key tasks are discussed. A customer-oriented, flexible and thorough schedule of activities is perceived as a positive industry practice in the aviation business...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a method of}} standalone verifying sonar control system, {{which is based on}} <b>functional</b> <b>checking</b> of control system operability. The main features of realized method are a development of the valid mathematic model for simulation of sonar signals at the point of hydroacoustic antenna, a valid representation of the sonar control system modes as a discrete Markov model, providing functional object verification in real time mode. Some ways are proposed to control computational complexity in case of insufficient computing resources of the simulation equipment, namely the way of model functionality reduction and the way of adequacy reduction. Experiments were made using testing equipment, which was developed by department of Research Institute of Information Control System at Bauman Moscow State Technical University to verify technical validity of industrial sonar complexes. On-board software was artificially changed to create malfunctions in functionality of sonar control systems during the verifying process in order to estimate verifying system performances. The method efficiency was proved by the theory and experiment results in comparison with the basic methodology of verifying technical systems. This method could be also used in debugging of on-board software of sonar complexes and in development of new promising algorithms of sonar signal processing. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—System-on-a-Chip (SoC) {{design has}} {{become more and more}} complex because Intellectual Property (IP) core with {{different}} functions are integrated within a single chip. Each IPs have completed design and verification but the integration of all IPs may not work together. The bus-based architecture has become the major integration methodology for implementing a SoC. The main issue is to ensure that the IP works correctly after integrating to the corresponding bus architecture. Advanced extensible interface 4 (AXI 4) is an on chip bus architecture introduced by ARM to interact with its peripherals. A synthesizable AXI 4 protocol checker which contains a set of rules to check on-chip communication properties accuracy is proposed to ensure proper SoC integration. A prototype of AXI 4 Master and AXI Slave is also designed to generate the AXI 4 signals. The protocol checker will continuously monitor the signals from AXI 4 Master and AXI 4 Slave to check whether any rule is broken or not. The proposed AXI 4 protocol checker will check both the Write Channel and Read Channel transactions. As the AXI 4 checker is synthesizable it can be used in FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and Emulation where <b>functional</b> <b>checks</b> are difficult to detect and pin point. The AXI 4 Master, AXI Slave and AXI 4 protocol checker have been modeled using Verilog and implemented on Digilent Basys 2 Spartan 3 E FPGA board...|$|R
40|$|For {{calibrating}} {{and monitoring}} the radiometric stability, the radar instrument of TerraSAR-X hosts a passive calibration network coupling into an additional port of the T/R modules. Three {{different types of}} calibration pulses are applied, whereby sets of these pulses are needed at the start and end of each data acquisition. Additionally, TerraSAR-X has been equipped with an additional calibration mode based on the so-called "PN Gating method". The PN Gating mode allows operating the T/R modules under most realistic conditions with the advantage that all modules can be characterised simultaneously. The individual characteristics are found by assigning special calibration pulse sequences with orthogonal codes to the T/R modules. During on-ground characterisation of the TerraSAR-X instrument this technique has established as a crucial diagnostic tool for <b>functional</b> <b>checks</b> as well as T/R module drift and failure monitoring. For the first time ever, this innovative method of PN Gating measurements will be applied for in-flight monitoring of a satellite SAR instrument. Starting with the TerraSAR-X commissioning phase the instrument behaviour can be accurately characterised to guarantee the radiometric stability of the system throughout the mission lifetime. In this paper, the latest results from the in-orbit calibration of TerraSAR-X are shown and compared to on-ground measurements of pre-launch characterisations. The techniques described above are also applicable for characterisation and calibration of other advanced SAR systems coping with multiple mode radar instruments...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{requirement}} for increased speed {{in the design}} and manufacturing of new products led to a rapid evolution of the technics for fast production (rapid prototyping, machining at high speed, etc.). But a significant component did not follow this evolution, that is the dimensional and <b>functional</b> <b>checking</b> process, which is most of the time carried out in a traditional way. The use of range sensor allows very significant improvement in acquisition speed but does not equal the accuracy obtained with a coordinate measuring machine. In order to obtain a quality control close to that obtained in metrology, we suggest to improve the accuracy of the depth measurements by following an acquisition strategy. We propose in this paper such a strategy to automatically produce a sensing plan for completely and precisely acquiring the geometry of a surface or of a complete piece whenever possible. The system requires the exact position and orientation of the part and its CAD model in IGES format. There is no limitation regarding the shape of the part to be digitized. A Biris sensor was used, and for this sensor, the precision of the 3 D measured points is function of the distance and of the incident angle with which the laser beam reaches the surface. Our strategy guaranties that the viewpoint found meets the best precision conditions in the scanning process. ...|$|R
