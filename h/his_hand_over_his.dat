5|$|Tallon {{was then}} rested and Saggers {{took his place}} for the next county match against Leicestershire. Saggers scored six, took a catch in each innings and conceded only six byes as Australia won by an innings. Saggers was then rested {{for the next two}} matches, against Yorkshire and Surrey. Australia scraped home by four wickets in the former and won by an innings in the latter. Tallon batted {{steadily}} with 10, 17 not out and 50 not out, but conceded 35 byes while taking two catches. Tallon was having difficulty with the bounce and movement of the ball in English conditions, and sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the Surrey match. He was hit after placing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face for protection, and the ball ran away for four byes.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's {{childhood}} {{heart problems}} surfaced again in 1990 {{with his sister}} Marja recalling that he often placed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> heart. He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio {{had to go to}} the bathroom during the flight, and soon there was a call for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio had eaten too much of the medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow down. Once a stewardess found out what had happened, she saved Vainio's life by quickly forcing him to vomit.|$|E
500|$|The Gospel of Matthew relates {{that when}} {{told his mother}} and {{brothers}} were waiting to see him, Jesus replied, [...] "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?" [...] Stretching <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> disciples he said, [...] "Here are {{my mother and my}} brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and my sister, and mother." [...] Pope Benedict XVI stated that this dictum of Jesus brought the fourth commandment to a new and higher level. By doing God's will, any person can become part of the universal family of Jesus. Thus, the fourth commandment's responsibilities extend to the greater society and requires respect for [...] "legitimate social authorities". The Catechism specifies [...] "duties of citizens and nations", which Kreeft summarizes as: ...|$|E

500|$|Apple Records {{released}} [...] "Photograph", {{backed by}} [...] "Down and Out", on 24 September 1973 in America, and on 19 October in Britain. Starr made a promotional film for [...] "Photograph", {{in which he}} mimed to the song while walking through the grounds of Tittenhurst Park, the Berkshire estate that he had recently purchased from former bandmate John Lennon. To circumvent the BBC's ban on lip-synching, Starr placed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mouth {{for part of the}} song, thereby making it impossible to tell whether he was singing or merely miming. The single's picture sleeve consisted of a photo by Barry Feinstein that showed Starr's head poking through a large star made of silver foil. The same image, which author Bruce Spizer terms [...] "the Ringo starfish", appeared on the single's face labels and on those of the Ringo album.|$|E
500|$|Gatiss {{wrote in}} the script for the Daleks' {{redesign}} to be [...] "big buggers...bigger than we've seen them before". The eyestalk {{was designed to be}} level with Smith's eyeline. Moffat and Gatiss wanted the new Daleks to be very colourful, similar to the Daleks of films from the 60s. Gatiss originally wanted there to be a green Dalek, but he decided that green [...] "just doesn't seem to work somehow". Nick Briggs, who voiced the Daleks, planned to counter their bright colours with a more vicious voice. Moffat wanted to somehow incorporate [...] "Spitfires in space". A replica of a World War II Spitfire was used in front of a greenscreen to shoot the live action parts of the scene and the image of the Spitfire, {{while the rest of the}} scene was computer-generated. The sequence contained the line [...] "Broadsword to Danny Boy", a reference to a similar line in the film Where Eagles Dare. Gatiss provided the voice of the Spitfire pilot himself, doing one version clean and another with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mouth. In an interview in April 2010, Gatiss described how the cameo came about: ...|$|E

60|$|It was an {{argument}} the minister could not answer save by putting <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face; his distress made Babbie strong; {{she moved to}} the door, trying to smile.|$|R

60|$|He passed <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face. The {{world after}} {{all is not}} made entirely for singing-birds; {{there is such a}} thing as proportion. Singing-birds may become a luxury, an indulgence, an excess.|$|R
6000|$|He {{bent his}} head slowly, shuddered a little, drawing <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face, and said, [...] "I had never any quarrel with that man. But there were our lives {{between him and}} me." ...|$|R
