5|$|<b>Hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> {{volunteered for}} smoke jumping, showing their {{willingness}} to take great personal risks. When fire was detected by a lookout, smoke jumpers were flown directly to the site and dropped by parachute to quickly contain and extinguish the fire. From base camps scattered through the forests of Montana, Idaho and Oregon, the men were flown as many as 200 miles to fire sites, carrying firefighting tools and a two-day supply of K-rations. For larger fires, additional men, supplies and food were airdropped to expand the effort. Up to 240 CPS men served in this specialized program. One of the smokejumping schools was at Camp Paxson in Montana.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, the Whitman {{massacre}} and the Cayuse War in {{what became}} southeastern Washington raised fears among white settlers {{throughout the region}} {{and led to the}} formation of large volunteer militias organized to fight Indians. Along the Rogue, tensions intensified in 1848 at the start of the California Gold Rush, when <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> from the Oregon Territory passed through the Rogue Valley on their way to the Sacramento River basin. After Indians attacked a group of returning miners along the Rogue in 1850, former territorial governor Joseph Lane negotiated a peace treaty with Apserkahar, a leader of the Takelma Indians. It promised protection of Indian rights and safe passage through the Rogue Valley for white miners and settlers.|$|E
5|$|William Edward Forster, Chief Secretary for Ireland made {{it clear}} in a {{communication}} with the proprietor of the Dublin Daily Express {{that he would not}} allow an armed expedition of <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men,</b> as the committee was planning, and that 50 unarmed men would be sufficient to harvest the crops. He said that the government would consider it their duty to protect this group. On 10 November 1880, the relief expedition consisting of one contingent from County Cavan and one from County Monaghan left for County Mayo. Additional troops had already arrived in County Mayo to protect the expedition.|$|E

2500|$|The Chinese armies also {{benefited from}} a {{logistics}} system that could supply <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> thousands <b>of</b> <b>men</b> at a time. An important innovation by the Chinese was the introduction of an efficient horse harness in the 4th century BC,strapped to the chest instead of the neck, an innovation later expanded to a collar harness. This innovation, along with the wheelbarrow, allowed large-scale transportation to occur, allowing huge armies numbering <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> thousands <b>of</b> <b>men</b> in the field.|$|R

5|$|Seething {{beneath the}} surface of American life in the Depression was the fear of the angry mob, portrayed in panicked {{hysteria}} in films such as Gabriel Over the White House (1933), The Mayor of Hell (1933), and American Madness (1932). Massive wide shots of angry hordes, comprising sometimes <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men,</b> rush into action in terrifyingly efficient uniformity. Groups of agitated men either standing in breadlines, loitering in hobo camps, or marching the streets in protest became a prevalent sight during the Great Depression. The Bonus Army protests of World War I veterans on the capital in Washington, D.C., on which Hoover unleashed a brutal crackdown, prompted many of the Hollywood depictions. Although social issues were examined more directly in the pre-Code era, Hollywood still largely ignored the Great Depression, as many films sought to ameliorate patrons' anxieties rather than incite them.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{immediately}} after the outbreak of war, parties of white Southern Rhodesians paid their own way to England to join the British Army. Most Southern Rhodesians {{who served in the}} war enlisted in this way and fought on the Western Front, taking part in many of the major battles with an assortment of British, South African and other colonial units, most commonly the King's Royal Rifle Corps, which recruited <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> from the colony, and created homogenous Rhodesian platoons. Troopers from Southern Rhodesia became renowned on the Western Front for their marksmanship, a result of their frontier lifestyle. Some of the colony's men served in the Royal Flying Corps, one of the two predecessors of the Royal Air Force. The Rhodesia Regiment, the Rhodesia Native Regiment and the British South Africa Police served in the African theatre of the conflict, contributing to the South-West African and East African campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath {{today is}} mostly {{known for its}} {{connection}} with the Scottish fishing industry. After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who {{would be interested in}} migrating to Arbroath in order {{to take advantage of the}} new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby Auchmithie and further afield, including Shetland. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 whitefish and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath, with <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> employed directly as fishermen, hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish. There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from Aberdeen and ports further north. The fish processing sector remains one of the largest employers in the town however, but fish for processing now comes from Aberdeen, Peterhead and occasionally from Iceland, Norway and Ireland.|$|E

25|$|The Tehran {{spring of}} {{ten years ago}} has now {{given way to a}} bleak {{political}} winter. The new government continues to close down newspapers, silence dissenting voices and ban or censor books and websites. The peaceful demonstrations and protests of the Khatami era are no longer tolerated: in January 2007 security forces attacked striking bus drivers in Tehran and arrested hundreds of them. In March police beat <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> and women who had assembled to commemorate International Women's Day.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese had {{attacked}} too early. Sakurai's Twenty-Eighth Army {{was not ready}} to start the break-out until 17 July. The break-out was a disaster. The British had placed ambushes or artillery concentrations on the routes the Japanese were to use. <b>Hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> drowned trying to cross the swollen Sittang on improvised bamboo floats and rafts. Burmese guerrillas and bandits killed stragglers east of the river. The break-out cost the Japanese nearly 10,000 men, half the strength of Twenty-Eighth Army. British and Indian casualties were minimal.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate commander, Major General Richard Taylor, chose Mansfield as {{the place}} where he would make his stand against the {{advancing}} Union army under General Nathaniel Banks. Taylor concentrated his forces at Sabine Crossroads, knowing that reinforcements were nearby. Banks prepared for a fight, though his own army was not fully assembled either. Both sides were reinforced by stages throughout the day. After a brief resistance, the Union army was routed by the Confederates, consisting mainly of units from Louisiana and Texas, reportedly strengthened by <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> breaking parole.|$|E
25|$|The Incas {{never used}} wheels in a {{practical}} way, although its use in toys shows that they knew the principle.

Although police cautioned against reinforcing the existing obstacles or setting up new obstacles to enlarge the occupied area, suffragists later reinstated the barriers overnight.|$|E
25|$|At least 23 {{accidental}} deaths {{occurred during}} {{construction of the}} second section, the main causes being premature blasting, injuries from rock falls and cave-ins, and falling.

Other deaths resulted from malaria, ticks, scrub typhus (mites), dysentery, fevers, and snakes. <b>Hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> were injured, but despite {{the existence of the}} Queensland Employers' Liability Act 1886, only one worker was compensated.
