5|$|Whilst the Coronation {{class was}} {{represented}} at the 1948 British Railways locomotive exchange trials, designed {{to compare the}} performances of similar locomotives from {{all four of the}} pre-nationalised companies, the representative engine performed disastrously. Gone was any hint of the power that could be unleashed by these engines; instead, uncharacteristically low coal consumption was the target. If the trials were forgettable, other achievements of the class are certainly memorable. Firstly, No. 6220 Coronation held the British steam speed record between 1937 and 1939. Secondly, No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn holds the record to this day for the greatest British power output to be officially recorded on an attached <b>dynamometer</b> <b>car,</b> achieved in 1939. Unfortunately the most memorable event {{in the history of the}} class was the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash precipitated by 46242 City of Glasgow. This was the second worst rail crash in British history, the death toll being 112.|$|E

25|$|In 1838, Babbage {{invented the}} pilot (also called a cow-catcher), the metal frame {{attached}} {{to the front of}} locomotives that clears the tracks of obstacles; he also constructed a <b>dynamometer</b> <b>car.</b> His eldest son, Benjamin Herschel Babbage, worked as an engineer for Brunel on the railways before emigrating to Australia in the 1850s.|$|E

5000|$|Hughes {{had been}} {{influenced}} by Flamme, by his views on superheating and on the testing of locomotives {{by the use of}} <b>dynamometer</b> <b>cars.</b> Flamme's design had the novel feature of a mechanical integrator to calculate drawbar horsepower-hours directly. He was encouraged to build such a car for the L&YR.|$|R
25|$|Tractive {{effort is}} a measure of the {{heaviest}} load a locomotive can start or haul at very low speed over the ruling grade in a given territory. However, as the pressure grew to run faster goods and heavier passenger trains, tractive effort was seen to be an inadequate measure of performance because it did not take into account speed. Therefore, in the 20th century, locomotives began to be rated by power output. A variety of calculations and formulas were applied, but in general railways used <b>dynamometer</b> <b>cars</b> to measure tractive force at speed in actual road testing.|$|R
500|$|Following {{trials that}} lasted over a year, No. 36001 {{was shown to}} have several flaws, {{including}} heavy coal and water consumption, mechanical unreliability, untenable working conditions for both fireman and driver, loss of steam through the cylinder rings and uneven weight distribution on the bogies. After renewing the cylinder assembly, it was tested around Brighton and Eastleigh using an LNER <b>Dynamometer</b> <b>car,</b> where good running was experienced at high costs in fuel and {{effort on the part}} of the fireman. The Leader was tested against the performance of a U class control locomotive and indicated that the brake release was too slow in service for use on tight schedules despite the brake application being noted as the best used on a Bulleid design.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the accident, two Kand K1class engines were trialled on the London and North Eastern Railway's (LNER) Great Northern mainline {{under the supervision of}} that company's CME, Nigel Gresley, to gain an unbiased review of their riding qualities. Locomotives No.A803 (K) and No.A890 (K1), and KingArthurclass No.E782, were tested on the well-maintained LNER line between [...] and [...] in October 1927, where few problems were found with locomotive stability. On runs between Kings Cross and [...] with the LNER's <b>dynamometer</b> <b>car,</b> No.A890 was recorded at a top speed of [...] and A803 at , with no problems in riding. When these engines returned from the LNER, the Southern Railway's General Manager, Sir Herbert Walker ordered further trials to be led by Sir John Aspinall on the Western section main line near [...] These were terminated by the Southern Railway's Operating Department, as the riding of the locomotives at speeds near [...] rendered the locomotives unsafe. The instability of No.A890 at speed was attributed to the helical springs on the Bissel truck and bogie.|$|E
2500|$|Stoke Bank has a {{gradient}} {{of between}} 1:178 and 1:200. Mallard, pulling a <b>dynamometer</b> <b>car</b> and six coaches, topped Stoke Summit at [...] and accelerated downhill. The speeds {{at the end}} of each mile (1.6km) from the summit were recorded as: 87½, 96½, 104, 107, 111½, 116 and 119mph (141, 155, 167, 172, 179, 187 and 192km/h); half-mile (800 m) readings after that gave 120¾, 122½, 123, 124¼ and finally 125mph (194, 197, 198, 200 and 201km/h).

500|$|In May 1948 the BR Executive {{arranged}} {{a series of}} locomotive exchanges whereby each of the [...] "Big Four" [...] previously independent companies would submit its various locomotives for evaluation. It was intended that each locomotive would be tested not only on its own home territory, but on the tracks of its three other [...] "rivals". The aim was to ascertain the best qualities of the competing locomotives {{in order to help}} design future locomotives. In that <b>dynamometer</b> <b>cars</b> were to accompany the test trains, whilst coal consumption was to be accurately measured, it was unclear whether the aim was to test the locomotives for power or for efficiency – the two are somewhat incompatible.|$|R
5000|$|A {{suggestion}} in The Times of 10 October 1853, {{commenting on}} a rail collision near Portarlington station, Great Southern and Western Railway, on 5 October that year, {{called for a}} paper-roll recorder to be carried in a locked box on trains, recording wheel revolutions against time, the record to be removed and stored by station masters at the destination station. A similar proposal came from Charles Babbage, arising from his work for the Great Western Railway on <b>dynamometer</b> <b>cars,</b> in 1864. No action {{seems to have been}} taken in either case. The earliest event recorders were the mechanical [...] "TEL" [...] speed recorders of 1891, which recorded both time and speed. The TEL's manufacturer, Hasler Rail of Switzerland, remains a leading producer of train event recorders.|$|R
5000|$|The 1948 Locomotive Exchange Trials were {{organised}} by {{the newly}} nationalised British Railways (BR). Locomotives {{from the former}} [...] "Big Four" [...] constituent companies (GWR, LMS, LNER, SR) were transferred to and worked on other regions. Officially, these comparisons were to identify the best qualities of the four different schools of thought of locomotive design {{so that they could}} be used in the planned BR standard designs. However, the testing had little scientific rigour, and political influence meant that LMS practice was largely followed by the new standard designs regardless. However, the trials were useful publicity for BR to show the unity of the new British Railways. To record the locomotive performances, one of three <b>dynamometer</b> <b>cars</b> were included in the consist directly behind the locomotive (with a GWR, LMS and NER version being available).|$|R

Results from the <b>dynamometer</b> <b>car</b> showed that the locomotive developed around 3,300 drawbar horsepower (2,460kW) at 47.5mph (76km/h), and a starting drawbar tractive effort of 52,000lbf (230kN).

40|$|The use {{of local}} {{standards}} for performing traction analyses has been suggested, and {{a possibility of}} their application has been demonstrated; a means of a power function approximation {{of the characteristics of}} the locomotives and series models of the locomotives have been proposed; means of simulation of the locomotive control, as well as a method of a two-phase straightening of the longitudinal 100 -meter stake profile have been developed; a separate allowance for a curve resistance has been introduced, and a method of accounting the train curve location has been unified with the profile straightening means; {{it has been shown that}} the consumption of utilities for the traction can be rated by using the traction analysis methods considering the limit norms. The requirements for the software systems of the <b>dynamometer</b> <b>cars</b> and locomotive devices controlling and registering the motion parameters have been defined. The validity of the traction analyses has been enhanced; the number of the test trips has been reduced; a possibility of rating the consumption of utilities for the traction has been proved to be possible in depet shed conditions, with random factors considered; it has been shown that the effect of the external factors on the performance of the locomotives can simply be considered.

40|$|Reduction of {{maintenance}} costs without reduction {{of safety and}} reliability {{is a need for}} all railway companies. One commonly taken approach to reach this goal is the transition from the concept {{of maintenance}} activities at fixed time intervals to a state-dependent maintenance concept. Basically such a concept requires continuous availability of information about the actual status of the maintenance objects. Regarding respective boundary conditions and available measuring principles this requirement can only be partly met. Certain inspections can only be executed in running sheds or by test runs of <b>dynamometer</b> <b>cars,</b> others are completed by detectors at certain points along the track lines. A current trend is to monitor components crucial for safe and reliable railway traffic continuously. Thus investigations are undertaken to prove the feasibility and profitability of concepts to equip e. g. signalling devices and rolling stock with appropriate sensors and diagnostic systems. Beyond tha t it must be explored if at least an overall quasi-continuous inspection of the track state can be done by installing robust low-cost diagnostic systems in a larger number of standard cars for regular service. In all these cases advanced methods of information technology are powerful tools for extracting the relevant information from the huge amount of sensor data. At the same time they may help {{to reduce the amount of}} additional equipment. Examples for the application of signal analysis, pattern recognition and model-based diagnosis are given in this paper...|$|R
2500|$|Don Nicholson (May 28, 1927 - January 24, 2006) was an American drag racer from Georgia. He raced in the 1960s and '70s {{when there}} were few {{national}} events.

2500|$|The Santa Fe {{intended}} the Super Chief {{as the latest}} in a long line of luxury ChicagoLos Angeles trains wedded to the latest in railroad technology. In the 1930s these included air conditioning, lightweight all-metal construction, and diesel locomotion. In August 1935 the General Motors Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC) delivered two blunt-nosed diesel-electric units Nos. 1 and 1A, intended to pull the Super Chief. Aside from an ALCO HH600 switcher at Dearborn Station in Chicago, they were the Santa Fe's first diesels and the first diesels intended for passenger service. These locomotives made their first test run with eight heavyweight passenger cars and a <b>dynamometer</b> <b>car</b> on September 9.

2500|$|R707, which due {{to various}} defects had still not {{been put into}} service by 1954, was {{selected}} for modification for pulverised brown coal (PBC) operation in conjunction with trials of this fuel being undertaken with X class 'Mikado' X32. <b>Dynamometer</b> <b>car</b> tests with R707 showed the locomotive was able to develop approximately 1,590 [...] drawbar horsepower (...) at , roughly equivalent to the 1,605 drawbar horsepower (...) generated by a conventional R class locomotive burning second grade Lithgow black coal.

While the PBC locomotives performed well, the expense of installing storage and handling facilities became increasingly uneconomic with falling prices for fuel oil {{and the success of}} diesel-electric traction. The conversion had also reduced the water capacity of R707's tender such that there was insufficient margin for delays or bad weather running on many routes, confining the locomotive to the shorter Melbourne to Geelong and Seymour lines. The experiments were discontinued and R707 was converted back to black coal operation in 1957.|$|E
