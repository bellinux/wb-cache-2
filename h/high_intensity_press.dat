40|$|Rapid and drastic {{fluctuations}} in arterial blood pressures, {{such as those}} occurring during heavy resistance exercise pose a unique challenge {{to the maintenance of}} cerebral perfusion. During high-intensity leg cycling, regulation of cerebral perfusion is reduced by rapid decreases in beat-to-beat {{fluctuations in}} blood pressure (diastolic phase) rather than rapid increases (systolic phase). The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that rhythmic heavy resistance exercise will similarly impair the regulation of cerebral blood flow during the diastolic phase of beat-to-beat fluctuations in pressure. We studied seven healthy male subjects. Beat-to-beat finger arterial pressures, and middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) were measured during 10 repetitions (REP) of rhythmic <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> leg <b>press</b> exercise. Velocities and arterial pressures were evaluated during both the isotonic concentric and eccentric phases of each REP. The Gosling pulsatility index (PI) of MCAv of each REP was calculated as MCAv systolic-MCAv diastolic/MCAv mean. During the concentric phase, systolic arterial pressures progressively increased from REP 1 through REP 10 (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), while systolic MCAv was not different across all REPs (P 3 ̆e 0. 2). Diastolic arterial pressures during the eccentric phase also increased from REP 1 through REP 10 (P = 0. 03) however diastolic MCAv decreased during REPs 7 - 10 compared with REP 2 (P ≤ 0. 02). MCAv PI also increased during REP 7 - 10 compared to REP 2 (P ≤ 0. 02). Similar to high-intensity leg cycling, our data suggest that during rhythmic high-intensity leg press exercise, cerebral perfusion is well controlled during periods of rapid increases in blood pressure, but regulation of cerebral perfusion is impaired during the diastolic phase of beat-to-beat fluctuations in pressure...|$|R
40|$|Many sports involve {{repeated}} {{bouts of}} <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> exercise. <b>High</b> <b>intensity</b> exercise is compromised, however, {{by the early}} onset of exercise-induced fatigue.

40|$|Abstract Background Work-site {{strength}} training sessions are shown effective {{to prevent and}} reduce neck-shoulder pain in computer workers, but difficult to integrate in normal working routines. A solution for avoiding neck-shoulder pain during computer work may be to implement <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> voluntary contractions during the computer work. However, it is unknown how this may influence productivity, rate of perceived exertion (RPE) as well as activity and rest of neck-shoulder muscles during computer work. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate short-term effects of a <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> contraction on productivity, RPE and upper trapezius activity and rest during computer work and a subsequent pause from computer work. Methods 18 female computer workers performed 2 sessions of 15 min standardized computer mouse work preceded by 1 min pause with and without prior <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> contraction of shoulder elevation. RPE was reported, productivity (drawings per min) measured, and bipolar surface electromyography (EMG) recorded from the dominant upper trapezius during pauses and sessions of computer work. Repeated measure ANOVA with Bonferroni corrected post-hoc tests was applied for the statistical analyses. Results The main findings were that a <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> shoulder elevation did not modify RPE, productivity or EMG activity of the upper trapezius during the subsequent pause and computer work. However, the <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> contraction reduced the relative rest time of the uppermost (clavicular) trapezius part during the subsequent pause from computer work (p Conclusion Since a preceding <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> shoulder elevation did not impose a negative impact on perceived effort, productivity or upper trapezius activity during computer work, implementation of <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> contraction during computer work to prevent neck-shoulder pain may be possible without affecting the working routines.

In order to evaluate the links between swimming exercise intensity and cardiac adaptation by using high molecular mass proteomics, isogenic Wistar rats were divided into four groups: one control (CG) and three training groups (TG’s), with low, moderate and <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> of exercises. Results Findings here reported demonstrated clear morphologic alterations, significant cellular injury and increased energy supplies at <b>high</b> exercise <b>intensities.</b> α-MyHC, as well proteins associated with mitochondrial oxidative metabolism were shown to be improved. α-MyHC expression increase 1. 2 fold in <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> training group when compared with control group. α-MyHC was also evaluated by real-time PCR showing a clear expression correlation with protein synthesis data increase in 8. 48 fold in <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> training group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} outcome {{expectations}} of RA patients, rheumatologists, and physiotherapists regarding <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> exercise programmes compared with conventional exercise programmes. METHODS: An exercise outcome expectations questionnaire {{was administered to}} 807 RA patients, 153 rheumatologists, and 624 physiotherapists. The questionnaire consisted of four statements regarding positive and negative outcomes of <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> exercise programmes and four similar statements for conventional exercise programmes. A total expectation score for both conventional and <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> exercise was calculated, ranging from - 2 (very negative expectation) to 2 (very positive expectation). RESULTS: The questionnaire was returned by 662 RA patients (82 %), 132 rheumatologists (86 %), and 467 physiotherapists (75 %). The mean (95 % confidence interval) scores for <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> exercise programmes were 0. 30 (0. 25 to 0. 34), 0. 68 (0. 62 to 0. 74), and - 0. 06 (- 0. 15 to 0. 02), and for conventional exercise programmes were 0. 99 (0. 96 to 1. 02), 1. 13 (1. 09 to 1. 17), and 1. 27 (1. 21 to 1. 34) for RA patients, rheumatologists, and physiotherapists, respectively. In all three respondent groups, the outcome expectations of <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> exercise were significantly less positive than those of conventional exercise programme.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the reliability of an isometric force assessment (isometric bench press) across 4 standardised angles and an isoinertial force and velocity assessment (ballistic bench throw) utilising a relative load based on a percentage of one repetition maximum (1 RM) in the bench press; and to evaluate whether the use of the dynamic strength deficit (DSD) ratio can guide training and detect changes induced by training over a 5 week period. METHODS: Twenty four elite male athletes (age = 19. 9 ± 2. 7 yrs; mass = 79. 1 ± 13. 0 kg) performed the isometric bench press and a 45 % 1 RM ballistic bench throw on 2 separate days with 48 hours between testing occasions. Peak force, peak power, peak velocity, peak displacement and peak rate of force development were assessed using a force plate and linear position transducer. Reliability was assessed by Intra- Class Correlation (ICC), Percent Coefficient of Variation (%CV) and Typical Error (TE). The athletes’ DSD ratios were then calculated using the peak force values obtained during the BBT and IBP (DSD = IBP peak force/BBT peak force). Athletes were then placed in to 2 groups as matched-pairs based on their DSD ratio and their strength in the 1 RM bench press. The Bench Press (BP) Group performed <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> bench <b>press</b> while the Ballistic Bench Throw Group performed moderate intensity ballistic bench throws. Both groups trained twice a week for 5 weeks. RESULTS: All performance measures except for peak rate of force development were considered reliable (ICC = 0. 85 - 0. 97, %CV = 1. 2 - 3. 3). The DSD ratio was sensitive to the disparate training methods between groups, with the BP Group increasing their IBP peak force (p = 0. 035), the BBT Group increasing their bench throw performance (p ≤ 0. 001), and as a result, yielding a significant change (p ≤ 0. 001) in the DSD for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Performance measures such as peak force in the isometric bench press and ballistic bench throw are reliable when assessing upper body pressing strength qualities in elite male athletes. Further, the DSD can be used to detect qualities of relative deficiency and guide specific training interventions based on test results...|$|R
