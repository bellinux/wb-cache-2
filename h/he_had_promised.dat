5|$|The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury praised Æthelnoth's wisdom. A {{story of}} {{doubtful}} authenticity tells how {{he refused to}} crown King Harold Harefoot, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> Cnut to crown none but a son of the king by his wife, Emma.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund and Andrew were reconciled, and Sigismund renounced Transylvania {{in favor}} of Andrew in March 1599. Andrew was {{supported}} by Poland and the Ottoman Empire. Rudolph II persuaded Michael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, to invade Transylvania. Michael defeated Andrew's troops at the Battle of Sellenberk {{with the assistance of}} Székely commoners, to whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> to restore their freedom. Andrew wanted to flee to Poland, but Székely serfs captured and killed him.|$|E

5|$|During 1965 and 1966, {{he served}} as the Speaker of the House, {{surprising}} observers by winning that post. Gravel convinced former Speaker Warren A. Taylor to not try for the position against him by promising Taylor chairmanship of the Rules Committee, then reneged on the promise. Gravel denied later press charges that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> but not delivered on other committee chairmanships. As Speaker he antagonized fellow lawmakers by imposing his will on the legislature's committees and feuded with Alaska State Senate president Robert J. McNealy.|$|E
5|$|Governor Dayton {{formally}} {{proposed a}} state budget on February 15, calling for $37 billion in state spending, necessitating cuts of about 10 percent to most state agencies. Because {{the state was}} projected to take in only about $32 billion in taxes, {{the rest of the}} budget shortfall was covered by increases to income and property taxes for wealthier Minnesotans, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> during his campaign. Meanwhile, Republican legislators, led by House Speaker Kurt Zellers and Senate Majority Leader Amy Koch, demanded the budget be kept below $32 billion.|$|E

He leaves to help people in the First Sino-Japanese War, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> the Meiji government. When he returns to Japan, Kenshin collapses in Kaoru's arms and dies.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to gain {{increased}} support from Polish nationalists and patriots, Napoleon termed the war the Second Polish War—the First Polish War had been the Bar Confederation uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768. Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created. This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> his ally Austria this would not happen. Napoleon refused to manumit the Russian serfs because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.|$|E
5|$|The 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt {{took place}} from March to June 1937 in the Canadian {{province}} of Alberta. It was a rebellion against Premier William Aberhart {{by a group}} of backbench (not part of the cabinet) members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) from his Social Credit League. The dissidents were unhappy with Aberhart's failure to provide Albertans with C$25 monthly dividends through social credit as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> before his 1935election. When the government's 1937budget made no move to implement the dividends, many MLAs revolted openly and threatened to defeat the government in a confidence vote.|$|E
5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail for his brother, knowing he had abused Michelle. He later said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of}} the disappearance, which he was able to account for. He had planned on using it to look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively that he had never left Ohio during that period. The rape of Michelle Rogers, and gossip by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so she and her sister and mother could distance themselves from the incident.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{during the}} time when Chris and Stewie {{were lost in the}} woods, Chris {{promises}} to ask out Ellen, a school classmate with Down syndrome. After their rescue, Stewie helps prepare Chris for a date by dressing him up, and instructing him on how to act through a prolonged musical number. During the date, Ellen turns out to be pushy and demanding, and the relationship quickly falls apart. Chris admits that he had bought into a stereotype of people with Down syndrome being different, and she breaks up with him. Stewie consoles Chris by congratulating him for demonstrating courage, in asking her out on a date, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> to do.|$|E
5|$|Phips, whose motives {{continue}} to be debated by historians today, claimed this {{was a violation of}} the terms of capitulation, and consequently declared the agreement void. He allowed his troops to sack the town and destroy the church, acts that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> to prevent in the oral surrender agreement. He had the fortifications destroyed, removing all of their weaponry. Before he left, he convinced a number of Acadians to swear oaths of allegiance to the English crown, appointed a council of locals to administer the town, and then sailed back to Boston, carrying Meneval and his garrison as prisoners of war. Phips received a hero's welcome and was lavished with praise, although he was criticized in some circles (and has been vilified in French and Acadian histories) for allowing the sacking of Port Royal.|$|E
5|$|The barons of the Latin Empire then elected Peter II of Courtenay, {{a cousin}} of King Philip II Augustus of France, as the new Latin Emperor. Receiving news of his election, Peter {{assembled}} {{a small army of}} 160 knights and 5,500 foot and horse, and set out from France. After being crowned by Pope Honorius III in Rome, he set sail from Brindisi in April 1217. Peter landed at Dyrrhachium, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> to conquer and return to Venice, while his wife Yolanda of Flanders sailed on to Constantinople. As in the Norman invasion of William II of Sicily (r. 1166–89) in 1185, Peter intended (after capturing Dyrrhachium) to follow the ancient Via Egnatia to Thessalonica, wresting Albania and Macedonia from Epirote control in the process.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid {{spent his}} exile in Mercia, where {{he enjoyed the}} staunch support of King Æthelred. In 702 or 703, Aldfrith convened a council at Austerfield, on the {{southern}} border of Northumbria, which was attended by Berhtwald, Archbishop of Canterbury, and many bishops. The question of Wilfrid's return to Northumbria was hotly debated and then rejected by the bishops. According to Stephen of Ripon, King Aldfrith offered to use his army to pressure Wilfrid into accepting the decision, but the bishops reminded him that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> Wilfrid safe-conduct. After returning to Mercia, Wilfrid was excommunicated by his enemies among the bishops. He responded by journeying to Rome, where he appealed in person to Pope John VI. The Pope provided him with letters to Aldfrith ordering that Wilfrid be restored to his offices. Aldfrith refused to receive the letters, and Wilfrid remained in disfavour.|$|E
5|$|Caesar became consul in 59 BC. His colleague, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, was {{an extreme}} aristocrat. Caesar {{submitted}} {{the laws that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> Pompey to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage. Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated {{the election of the}} former patrician Publius Clodius Pulcher to the tribunate for 58 BC. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in Cato and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed a law to expand the previous partial grain subsidy to a fully free grain dole for citizens.|$|E
5|$|These {{conflicts}} are {{demonstrated by the}} varying loyalties of the main characters. Genly Ai tells Argaven after Estraven's death that Estraven served mankind as a whole, just as Ai did. During the border dispute with Orgoreyn, Estraven tries to end the dispute by moving Karhidish farmers out of the disputed territory. Estraven believes that by preventing war he was saving Karhidish lives and being loyal to his country, while King Argaven {{sees it as a}} betrayal. At {{the end of the novel}} Ai calls his ship down to formalize Gethen's joining the Ekumen, and feels conflicted while doing so because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> Estraven that he would clear Estraven's name before calling his ship down. His decision is an example of Le Guin's portrayal of loyalty and betrayal as complementary rather than contradictory, because in joining Gethen with the Ekumen Ai was fulfilling the larger purpose that he shared with Estraven. Donna White wrote that many of Le Guin's novels depict a struggle between personal loyalties and public duties, best exemplified in The Left Hand of Darkness, where Ai is bound by a personal bond to Estraven, but must subordinate that to his mission for the Ekumen and humanity.|$|E

5|$|When {{the group}} {{arrives at the}} picturesque hotel, they find an {{energetic}} young manager Sonny (Dev Patel) but a dilapidated facility, not yet what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised.</b> Overwhelmed by the cultural changes, Jean often stays inside at the hotel, while her husband Douglas explores the sights. Graham finds that the area has greatly changed since his youth and disappears on long outings every day. Muriel, despite her xenophobia, starts to appreciate her doctor for his skill and the hotel maid for her good service. Evelyn gets a job advising the staff of a call centre on how to interact with older British customers. Sonny struggles to raise funds to renovate the hotel and sees his girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae), despite his mother's disapproval. Madge joins the Viceroy Club seeking a spouse, where she is surprised to find Norman. She introduces him to Carol (Diana Hardcastle). He admits he is lonely and seeking a companion, and the two begin an affair.|$|E
5|$|Under {{mounting}} political pressure, John finally negotiated {{terms for}} a reconciliation, and the papal terms for submission were {{accepted in the}} presence of the papal legate Pandulf Verraccio in May 1213 at the Templar Church at Dover. As part of the deal, John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to the papacy for a feudal service of 1,000 marks (equivalent to £666 at the time) annually: 700 marks (£466) for England and 300 marks (£200) for Ireland, as well as recompensing the church for revenue lost during the crisis. The agreement was formalised in the Bulla Aurea, or Golden Bull. This resolution produced mixed responses. Although some chroniclers felt that John had been humiliated by the sequence of events, there was little public reaction. Innocent benefited from the resolution of his long-standing English problem, but John probably gained more, as Innocent became a firm supporter of John for the rest of his reign, backing him in both domestic and continental policy issues. Innocent immediately turned against Philip, calling upon him to reject plans to invade England and to sue for peace. John paid some of the compensation money <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>promised</b> the church, but he ceased making payments in late 1214, leaving two-thirds of the sum unpaid; Innocent appears to have conveniently forgotten this debt for the good of the wider relationship.|$|E
