Large diameter bullets provide more stability, as the larger radius provides more <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>inertia,</b> while long bullets are harder to stabilize, as {{they tend to be}} very backheavy and the aerodynamic pressures have a longer arm ("lever") to act on. The slowest twist rates are found in muzzleloading firearms meant to fire a round ball; these will have twist rates as low as 1 in 72 in, or slightly longer, although for a typical multi-purpose muzzleloader rifle, a twist rate of 1 in 48 in is very common. The M16A2 rifle, which is designed to fire the 5.56×45mm NATO SS109 ball and L110 tracer bullets, has a 1 in 7 in or 32 calibers twist. Civilian AR-15 rifles are commonly found with 1 in 12 in or 54.8 calibers for older rifles and 1 in 9 in or 41.1 calibers for most newer rifles, although some are made with 1 in 7 in or 32 calibers twist rates, the same as used for the M16 rifle. Rifles, which generally fire longer, smaller diameter bullets, will in general have higher twist rates than handguns, which fire shorter, larger diameter bullets.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis {{was to investigate the}} behaviour of rotating shaft systems which are supported on oil film bearings and which have a significant amount of <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>inertia</b> associated with the rotating parts. A computer program was written to predict the non-linear behaviour of a general rotor incorporating flexibility and <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>inertia,</b> the rotor being carried on a number of oil film bearings. The bearing characteristics were established by successive over-relaxation of a finite difference form of Reynolds’ Equation, while the characteristics of the elements of the rotor were described by classical mechanics. The dynamic stiffness matrix was built up from these characteristics using a routine and general method invented by Kron(5) and using the resultant set of equations of motion were solved by a forward integration technique. If only small amplitude movement of the journal within the clearance space is assumed, then the bearing stiffness and damping characteristics can be assumed to be linear. The stability {{of a wide range of}} systems was tested making this assumption, the stability being established by an eigenvalue analysis. It was found that the small amplitude stability was in general worsened by the presence of <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>inertia,</b> but that for some very particular combinations of system parameters, the stability could be greatly improved (relative to no <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>inertia)</b> by a very small amount of <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>inertia.</b> It was anticipated that for these cased, the stabilising effect would not operate if the amplitude of motion was large, and this was found to be the case when checked with the non-linear analysis program described earlier.

The proposed on-board rotor model is based on the Timoshenko beam finite element. It takes into account the effects corresponding to rotary inertia, <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>inertia,</b> and shear deformation of shaft as well as the geometric asymmetry of disk and/or shaft and considers six types of deterministic motions (rotations and translations) of the rotor's rigid base.

The linear equations of motion highlight periodic parametric terms due to the geometric asymmetry of the rotor components and time-varying parametric terms due to the rotational motions of the rotor rigid base. These parametric terms are considered as sources of internal excitation and can lead to lateral dynamic instability.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{of a class}} of convecting elastic media is considered. On {{the basis of an}} appropriate variational principle, the general field equation governing small oscillations is derived. The variational formulation demands (i) conservations of mass, (ii) conservation of energy, and (iii) conservation of the identity of particles. Of these, conservation of mass needs to be satisfied explicitly as a constraint. This is achieved by constraining the classical mechanical Lagrangian using a Lagrange multiplier with the continuity equation. Hamilton's principle modified for a control volume in this way then leads to the equation of motion for small oscillations of convecting gyroelastic solids. The mathematical structure of the field equation thus derived is examined. The origins of the `gyroscopic' and the `centrifugal' e®ects are traced. These can be associated with various terms in the expression for the Lagrangian density. In particular, terms in the kinetic energy density that are independent the velocity field, those that are linear in the velocity field and those that are quadratic in the velocity field are associated with the centrifugal, <b>gyroscopic,</b> and <b>inertia</b> terms in the equation of motion respectively.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2007 Micro Electro-Machnical Systems (MEMS) {{applications}} are fastest development technology present. MEMS processes leverage mainstream IC technologies to achieve on chip sensor interface and signal processing circuitry, multi-vendor accessibility, short design cycles, more on-chip functions and low cost. MEMS fabrications {{are based on}} thin-film surface microstructures, bulk micromaching, and LIGA processes. This thesis centered on developing optical micromaching inertial sensors based on MEMS fabrication technology which incorporates bulk Si into microstructures. Micromachined inertial sensors, consisting of the accelerometers and gyroscopes, {{are one of the}} most important types of silicon-based sensors. Microaccelerometers alone have the second largest sales volume after pressure sensors, and it is believed that gyroscopes will soon be mass produced at the similar volumes occupied by traditional gyroscopes. A traditional gyroscope is a device for measuring or maintaining orientation, based on the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The essence of the gyroscope machine is a spinning wheel on an axle. The device, once spinning, tends to resist changes to its orientation due to the angular momentum of the wheel. In physics this phenomenon is also known as <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>inertia</b> or rigidity in space. The {{applications are}} limited by the huge volume. MEMS Gyroscopes, which are using the MEMS fabrication technology to minimize the size of gyroscope systems, are of great importance in commercial, medical, automotive and military fields. They can be used in cars for ASS systems, for anti-roll devices and for navigation in tall buildings areas where the GPS system might fail. They can also be used for the navigation of robots in tunnels or pipings, for leading capsules containing medicines or diagnostic equipment in the human body, or as 3 -D computer mice. The MEMS gyroscope chips are limited by high precision measurement because of the unprecision electrical readout system. The market is in need for highly accurate, high-G-sustainable inertial measuring units (IMU's). The approach optical sensors have been around for a while now and because of the performance, the mall volume, the simplicity has been popular. However the production cost of optical applications is not satisfaction with consumer. Therefore, the MEMS fabrication technology makes the possibility for the low cost and micro optical devices like light sources, the waveguide, the high thin fiber optical, the micro photodetector, and vary demodulation measurement methods. Optic sensors may be defined as a means through which a measurand interacts with light guided in an optical fiber (an intrinsic sensor) or guided to (and returned from) an interaction region (an extrinsic sensor) by an optical fiber to produce an optical signal related to the parameter of interest. During its over 30 years of history, fiber optic sensor technology has been successfully applied by laboratories and industries worldwide in the detection of a large number of mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic, radiation, chemical, motion, flow and turbulence of fluids, and biomedical parameters. The fiber optic sensors provided advantages over conventional electronic sensors, of survivability in harsh environments, immunity to Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI), light weight, small size, compatibility with optical fiber communication systems, high sensitivity for many measurands, and good potential of multiplexing. In general, the transducers used in these fiber optic sensor systems are either an intensity-modulator or a phase-modulator. The optical interferometers, such as Mach-Zehnder, Michelson, Sagnac and Fabry-Perot interferometers, have become widely accepted as a phase modulator in optical sensors for the ultimate sensitivity to a range of weak signals. According to the light source being used, the interferometric sensors can be simply classified as either a coherence interferometric sensor if a the interferometer is interrogated by a coherent light source, such as a laser or a monochromatic light, or a lowcoherence interferometric sensor when a broadband source a light emitting diode (LED) or a superluminescent diode (SLD), is used. This thesis proposed a novel micro electro-mechanical gyroscope system with optical interferometer readout system and fabricated by MEMS technology, which is an original contribution in design and research on micro opto-electro-mechanical gyroscope systems (MOEMS) to provide the better performances than the current MEMS gyroscope. Fiber optical interferometric sensors have been proved more sensitive, precision than other electrical counterparts at the measurement micro distance. The MOMES gyroscope system design is based on the existing successful MEMS vibratory gyroscope and micro fiber optical interferometer distances sensor, which avoid large size, heavy weight and complex fabrication processes comparing with fiber optical gyroscope using Sagnac effect. The research starts from the fiber optical gyroscope based on Sagnac effect and existing MEMS gyroscopes, then moving to the novel design about MOEMS gyroscope system to discuss the operation principles and the structures. In this thesis, the operation principles, mathematics models and performances simulation of the MOEMS gyroscope are introduced, and the suitable MEMS fabrication processes will be discussed and presented. The first prototype model will be sent and fabricated by the manufacture for the further real time performance testing.

款牙科手機為對象，對其內部的微型渦輪轉子-軸承系統進行動態特性分析。在轉子-軸承系統數值分析方面，則利用有限元素法之理論，以MATLAB軟體為程式設計平台，撰寫分析轉子-軸承系統的數值分析程式。轉子-軸承系統中包括彈性軸、剛性圓盤以及具有阻尼和剛性的徑向軸承。軸元素的理論推導過程中將其考慮為Timoshenko樑做探討，其中包括平移慣性、轉動慣性、剪力效應與陀螺力矩的影響。 為了驗證分析程式的可靠性，文中先針對前人文獻所分析過的轉子-軸承系統，利用有限元素模型計算求取臨界轉速，並與文獻進行比對；爾後以旋轉試驗轉子(Rotor-Kit) 為對象，利用有限元素模型計算求取臨界轉速。最後再進一步分析牙科手機內轉子-軸承系統並繪出坎貝爾圖、模態振型以及臨界轉速與軸承剛性的關係圖，搭配上動態特實驗將微型渦輪轉子-軸承系統的動態特性趨勢分析出來。 本研究所使用的轉子-軸承系統有限元素分析程式，經過文獻以及試驗轉子的驗證，其誤差值都在 1 %以內，並且成功的分析出牙科手機內微型渦輪轉子的動態特性，所以在設計牙科手機內微型渦輪轉子-軸承系統時，可以藉由有限元素法精準的分析轉子的動態特性。這些分析結果將可作為牙科手機內微型渦輪轉子-軸承系統設計修改的依據，有限元素分析程式也可以作為未來設計微型渦輪轉子-軸承系統的分析工具。謝誌 [...] i
