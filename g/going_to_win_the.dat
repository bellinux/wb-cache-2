5|$|During {{the second}} season of Millionaire in the United States, the show crowned its first million-dollar winner. On November 19, 1999, John Carpenter won the show's top prize without using any lifelines, save for a phone call on the final {{question}} to tell his father he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> million dollars. After Carpenter answered the final question, which concerned Richard Nixon's appearance on Laugh-In in 1968, host Regis Philbin proclaimed Carpenter the show's (and worldwide format's) first top prize winner.|$|E
5|$|On the November 19, 1999, {{episode of}} Millionaire, Carpenter {{proceeded}} {{to advance to}} the million-dollar question without using any lifelines. He then used his Phone-A-Friend to call his father not for help, but rather to tell him he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> game. Carpenter answered the question correctly and became the show's first millionaire. His win gave him national recognition and led to multiple talk show appearances, as well as reappearances on Millionaire itself.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to its creators' expectations, Unity's {{election}} campaign {{was a huge}} success, and the party received 23.3% of the votes, considerably more than OVR's 13.3% and within one percentage point of the Communist Party's 24.3%. The popularity {{of the prime minister}} proved decisive for Unity's victory. The election results also made clear that Putin was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> 2000 presidential election, which resulted in competitors Luzhkov and Yevgeni Primakov dropping out. Yeltsin also gave Putin a boost by resigning as president on 31 December 1999.|$|E
25|$|Due to the doping scandal {{a number}} of riders did not start in the tour, among those riders were the biggest {{favorites}} to win the tour, Jan Ullrich, Ivan Basso and Alexander Vinokourov. With those riders not starting, the 2006 Tour de France did not have real favorites and opinions were hugely divided over who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> tour. Stage 7, an individual time trial, {{was going to be}} the first real test to see who was up to the task and who wasn't.|$|E

Perhaps unsuited in the conditions, fancied runners Tie the Knot (2nd in 1999), Sky Heights (3rd in 1999), and Shogun Lodge (conqueror of Sunline in the George Main Stakes) were beaten a {{combined}} margin of more than 100 lengths. In winning, Sunline became the first Australasian horse to pass $6 million in career earnings.|$|E
25|$|The {{match was}} {{predicted}} to {{be a very}} close game, with the possibility of either side winning the game being nearly even. An NCAA.com fan poll saw that 55 percent of viewers felt that Wake Forest was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> match, while 45 percent felt that Stanford would win. CollegeSoccerNews.com described the match as a likely cagey contest featuring two very evenly matched teams. Brian Radewitz at Hero Sports predicted that the match would be tightly contested, but that Stanford would prevail. Radewitz felt that Stanford would have an edge over Wake Forest, given their experience in the tournament, as well as the team's sturdy defense.|$|E

However, on 28 July 2015, the Supreme Court issued a statement in denounced the International Commission demands. In response, Guatemalan newspaper Diario La Hora reveals that the thirteen judges of the Supreme Court were designated thanks to the alliance between the official Partido Patriota and the main opposition party, Libertad Democrática Renovada.

25|$|Rum {{started to}} play an {{important}} role in the political system; candidates attempted to influence the outcome of an election through their generosity with rum. The people would attend the hustings to see which candidate appeared more generous. The candidate was expected to drink with the people to show he was independent and truly a republican. In the 1833 Mississippi state senate election, one candidate, Judge Edward Turner, poured his drinks and socialized with the people. He was more personal and it appeared as if he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> <b>The</b> other candidate, a Methodist parson named Dick Stewart, announced he would not be pouring their drinks and they could have as much as they wanted; Dick Stewart won.|$|E
25|$|Back in Sydney for {{the autumn}} of 2000, Sunline powered through the rain-affected <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> Apollo Stakes (1,400 metres) first-up. Remarkably, in her entire career, she was never beaten over the distance. She then carried the maximum topweight (60 {{kilograms}}) to win {{the first of two}} Coolmore Classics - at the time, Australia's only Group One race for fillies and mares (three years and over). At her next start, she carried 57.5 kilograms (9 st. 1lb.) in the Doncaster Handicap and was narrowly defeated by the lightly weighted three-year-old Over. Meeting again a week later, in the All-Aged Stakes, Sunline relished the return to weight for age conditions - easily accounting for Georgie Boy, with Over in third place, to make it three wins from four starts this campaign.|$|E
25|$|Murray and Allenby {{were invited}} to give lectures at Aldershot in 1931 about the Palestine Campaign. Exchanging letters beforehand, Murray asked whether it had been worth risking the Western Front to {{transfer}} troops to Palestine. Allenby avoided that question, but commented {{that it had been}} far from clear that the Allies were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> war in 1917 and into the spring of 1918. Russia had dropped out, but the Americans were not yet present in strength. France and Italy were weakened and might have been persuaded to make peace, perhaps by Germany giving up Belgium, Alsace-Lorraine, and the Trentino. In those circumstances, Germany was likely to be left in control of Eastern Europe and the Balkans, and it had been sensible for Britain to grab some land in the Middle East to block Germany's route to India. Allenby's views mirrored those of the War Cabinet at the time.|$|E

25|$|One Stone {{was placed}} at Angrenost (Isengard) in Orthanc, the great tower {{built by the}} Dúnedain in the Second Age at the {{southern}} end of the Misty Mountains. In T.A. 2759, Saruman obtained the keys of Orthanc from Beren, the ruling Steward of Gondor, possibly because Saruman desired to use the palantír to garner information on his neighbours and their activities. The stone was also partially responsible for Saruman's fall from grace, as he was using it when he came upon Sauron, and was ensnared by him, though his transformation to one of the fallen Maiar had undoubtedly begun much earlier. Saruman later used the stone to confer with Sauron through the Ithil-stone in Barad-dûr. By showing Saruman selective visions of his new armies, Sauron convinced the Wizard that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> War of the Ring, regardless of whether he actually found the One Ring.|$|E
25|$|Leeds {{finished}} 3rd in {{the league}} during the 1972–73 season, never sustaining a convincing title challenge, but they again mounted impressive cup runs domestically and in Europe reaching two finals. However, in space of two dramatic weeks, Leeds would be the victims {{of one of the}} biggest giant killings in football history and losers {{of one of the most}} controversial European finals. In the 1973 FA Cup Final, a full strength Leeds side was beaten 1–0 by second division Sunderland, and two weeks later a weakened Leeds United side were beaten 1–0 by A.C. Milan in the bad tempered 1973 European Cup Winners' Cup Final. Leeds went into the game missing Bremner, Giles, and Clarke, and also under a cloud of press speculation surrounding Revie, who had been strongly linked with the Everton managers post. This speculation and Revie's revelation one hour before the match, that he had decided to accept the job, created a despressed atmosphere inside the Leeds dressing room, but the remaining players determined they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> trophy as a tribute to their seemingly departing manager. AC Milan opened the scoring in the first few minutes and the rest of the match would be dominated by dubious refereeing decisions; numerous fouls against Leeds were ignored by the referee Christos Michas and the aggravation eventually boiled over in the closing stages, with Norman Hunter being sent off for retaliation as Leeds pushed for an equaliser. Leeds also had two penalty appeals – a handball and a trip on forward Mick Jones inside the Milan penalty area – ignored by the referee. The match ended with missiles being thrown at the Milan players and the match officials by a Greek crowd who had begun the match as neutral observers, but had ended it sympathising with the Leeds players, who gave a lap of honour around the stadium to rapturous applause. The referee Christos Michas was subsequently banned from refereeing for life by UEFA; however despite appeals from Leeds United no replay was awarded by UEFA and AC Milan were never penalised.|$|E
