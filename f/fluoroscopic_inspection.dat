40|$|Verification and {{validation}} of welding procedure specifications for X- 70 grade line pipe welding was performed as per clause 8. 2, Annexure B and D of API 5 L, 45 th Edition to check weld integrity in its future application conditions. Hot rolled coils were imported from China, de-coiling, strip edge milling, three roller bending to from pipe, {{inside and outside}} submerged arc welding of pipe, online ultrasonic testing of weld, HAZ and pipe body, cutting at fixed random length of pipe, visual inspection of pipe, <b>Fluoroscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> of pipe, welding procedure qualification test pieces marking at weld portion of the pipe, tensile testing, guided bend testing, CVN Impact testing were performed. Detailed {{study was conducted to}} explore possible explanations and variation in mechanical properties, WPS is examined and qualified as per API 5 L 45 th Edition...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: The loss of an {{instrument}} during a surgical procedure is a potentially dangerous medical event. Retained surgical needles {{are reported to}} cause chronic pain, chronic irritation, and organ injury. Surgical needles lost during minimally invasive surgery are particularly difficult to retrieve because of their dimin-utive size and the cameraâ€™s limited visual field, often prompting protracted recovery attempts that can add to surgical costs. Few detailed recommendations exist for the recovery of a misplaced needle. Methods: A survey was administered to minimally inva-sive surgeons across the United States to glean observa-tions on the incidence of lost surgical needles and recov-ery techniques. Survey results were incorporated into an evidence-based protocol designed to expedite the recov-ery of lost surgical needles. Results: Three hundred five minimally invasive surgeons from 11 surgical subspecialties completed the survey. Six-ty-four percent of participants reported having experi-enced a lost surgical needle, {{with a minimum of}} 112 needles lost during the past 1 year alone. Urologists, pediatric surgeons, and bariatric surgeons reported higher rates of needle loss than surgeons practicing other sub-specialties (P. 001). Removal of a needle through a minimally invasive port and laparoscopic suturing were the 2 most common situations resulting in lost needles. A systematic visual search, abdominal radiography, fluoros-copy, and the use of a magnetic retriever were reported as the most successful strategies for needle recovery. Conclusions: On the basis of survey results and current literature, our protocol incorporates a camera survey of the abdomen, intraoperative <b>fluoroscopic</b> radiography, port <b>inspection,</b> and a quadrant-based systematic visual search for the recovery of needles lost during minimally invasive surgery...|$|R
