25|$|Although {{software}} (hyphenation algorithms) {{can often}} automatically {{make decisions on}} when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user {{to be able to}} insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be reflowed). For this purpose, the concept of a soft hyphen (<b>discretionary</b> <b>hyphen,</b> optional hyphen) was introduced, allowing such manual specification of a place where a hyphenated break is allowed but not forced. That is, it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed.|$|E
50|$|The use of SHY {{characters}} in text {{that will be}} broken into lines by the recipient is the application context considered by the post-1999 HTML and Unicode specifications, {{as well as some}} word-processing file formats. In this context, the soft hyphen may also be called a <b>discretionary</b> <b>hyphen</b> or optional hyphen. It serves as an invisible marker used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated break is allowed without forcing a line break in an inconvenient place if the text is re-flowed. It becomes visible only after word wrapping {{at the end of a}} line. The soft hyphen's Unicode semantics and HTML implementation are in many ways similar to Unicode's zero-width space, with the exception that the soft hyphen will preserve the kerning of the characters on either side when not visible. The zero-width space, on the other hand, will not, as it is considered a visible character even if not rendered, thus having its own kerning metrics.|$|E
