5|$|The exact {{chronology}} of the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium, and {{their relation to}} <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> somewhat unclear. The chronology below represents an estimated reconstruction of the time-line, following Lazenby and Holland.|$|E
5|$|In reaction–diffusion systems modeled by the Allen–Cahn equation, the {{limiting}} behavior for fast reaction, slow diffusion, {{and two or}} more local minima of energy with the same energy level as <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> for the system to settle into regions of different local minima, with the fronts delimiting boundaries between these regions evolving according to the curve-shortening flow.|$|E
5|$|Several phylogenetic studies, {{based on}} {{morphological}} characters and mitochondrial DNA sequences, have established the sister species {{relationship between the}} porbeagle and the salmon shark (L.ditropis), which occurs in place {{of it in the}} North Pacific. The genus Lamna evolved 65–45 Ma. When its two extant species diverged from <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> uncertain, though the precipitating event was likely the formation of the ice cap over the Arctic Ocean, which would have isolated sharks in the North Pacific from those in the North Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|The {{most visible}} way for {{graduates}} of Texas A to recognize <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> by the Aggie Ring. The Aggie Ring is worn by current students and alumni, {{and is one}} of the most well-known symbols of the Aggie Network. The first Aggie Ring was designed by E. C. Jonas in 1894, and the design has remained relatively unchanged since- the only major change came when the school's name was changed from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas to Texas A University in 1963.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 16 living orders, there are 9 extinct orders and one superfamily known only from fossils. The relationship of these to living groups and to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> controversial. The extinct Arthropleuridea was long considered a distinct myriapod class, although work in the early 21st century established {{the group as a}} subclass of millipedes. Several living orders also appear in the fossil record. Below are two proposed arrangements of fossil millipede groups. Extinct groups are indicated with a dagger (†). The extinct order Zosterogrammida, a chilognath of uncertain position, is not shown.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{is divided}} into 95 {{counties}} and 38 independent cities, the latter acting in many ways as county-equivalents. This general method of treating cities and counties on par with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> unique to Virginia; only three other independent cities exist elsewhere in the United States, each in a different state. Virginia limits the authority of cities and counties to countermand laws expressly allowed by the Virginia General Assembly under {{what is known as}} Dillon's Rule. In addition to independent cities, there are also incorporated towns which operate under their own governments, but are part of a county. Finally there are hundreds of unincorporated communities within the counties. Virginia does not have any further political subdivisions, such as villages or townships.|$|E

5|$|Few {{other details}} are {{known about the}} singer's childhood. At some point he met another blind musician, Madkin Butler, who had a {{powerful}} singing and preaching style that influenced Johnson's own vocal delivery and repertoire. Adam Booker, a blind minister interviewed by the blues historian Samuel Charters in the 1950s, recalled that while visiting his father in Hearne, Johnson would perform religious songs on street corners with a tin cup tied to the neck of his Stella guitar to collect money. Occasionally, Johnson would play on the same street as Blind Lemon Jefferson, but {{the extent of the}} two songsters' involvement with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> unknown. In 1926 or early 1927, Johnson established an unregistered marriage with Willie B. Harris, who occasionally sang on the street with him and at benefits for the Marlin Church of God in Christ with Johnson accompanied on piano. From the relationship, Johnson had a daughter, Sam Faye Johnson Kelly, in 1931. The blues guitarist L. C. Robinson recalled that his sister Anne also claimed to have been married to Johnson in the late 1920s.|$|E

25|$|The {{claim that}} in late PIE times, the satem {{languages}} (unlike the centum languages) were {{in close contact}} with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> confirmed by independent evidence: the geographical closeness of current satem languages and certain other shared innovations (the ruki sound law and early palatalization of velars before front vowels).|$|E
25|$|While {{the above}} {{discussion}} has {{related to the}} convergence of a single series to a limiting value, {{the notion of the}} convergence of two series towards <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> also important, but this is easily handled by studying the sequence defined as either the difference or the ratio of the two series.|$|E

25|$|Determining {{the forces}} {{required}} to move atoms past <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> {{a challenge in}} designing nanomachines.

Using ultrahigh vacuum and nearly zero temperature (5 K), a modified atomic force microscope was used to drag a cobalt atom, and a carbon monoxide molecule, across surfaces of copper and platinum.|$|E
25|$|Like the heraldic lion, the heraldic eagle {{is seen as}} {{dominating}} the field and normally cannot brook a rival. When two eagles are depicted on a field, they are usually shown combatant, that is, facing each other with wings spread and one claw extended, {{as though they were}} fighting. Respectant, the term used for depicting domestic or game animals shown facing <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>is</b> not used because eagles are aggressive predators.|$|E

40|$|Female Belding's ground {{squirrels}} (Spermophilus beldingi), {{that had}} been reared apart from <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>were</b> observed in paired-encounter tests to determine whether exposure to nestmates' phenotypes during development had influenced their subsequent social discriminations. As a result of cross-fostering, test partners were (1) either unfamiliar sisters (reared apart) or unfamiliar, unrelated females, and were (2) either reared with <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> siblings (indirectly exposed to <b>each</b> <b>other)</b> or <b>were</b> not reared with <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> siblings (not indirectly exposed to <b>each</b> <b>other).</b> Regardless of relatedness, females that were indirectly exposed to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>were</b> significantly less agonistic during tests than females not indirectly exposed to <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> This suggests that females learned something from their nestmates' phenotypes and later recalled what they had learned in order to distinguish between their nestmates' unfamiliar kin and non-kin. Furthermore, sisters that were indirectly exposed to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>were</b> less agonistic than nonsisters that were indirectly exposed to <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> This <b>was</b> true even when the only kin phenotypes females had experienced during rearing were their own, which suggests that females may have compared unfamiliar phenotypes with their own, {{as well as those}} of their nestmates. Thus, the phenotypes that females encountered during rearing, both their nestmates' and their own, influenced their later social discriminations, probably by phenotype matching. Under this recognition mechanism, an individual forms a hypothetical `kin template' based on its own or its familiar relatives' phenotypes, and later compares the phenotypes of other conspecifics with the learned template...|$|R
