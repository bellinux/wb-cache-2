Icelandic MVV strains, which are lytic in tissue culture, {{have a wide}} species distribution of <b>functional</b> <b>receptors,</b> which includes human cells. In contrast, <b>functional</b> <b>receptors</b> for the nonlytic CAEV CO are absent from human cells. To determine if the wide species distribution of <b>functional</b> <b>receptors</b> is a common property of MVV strains or related to cytopathic phenotype, we tested the infectivity of viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of MVV K 1514, CAEV CO, and lytic and nonlytic North American MVV strains to cells of different species. Replication-defective CAEV proviral constructs lacking the env, tat, and vif genes and carrying the neomycin phosphotransferase gene in the vif-tat region were developed for the infectivity assays. Cotransfection of human 293 T cells with these proviral constructs and plasmids expressing CAEV, MVV, or vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoproteins produced infectious pseudotyped virus which induced resistance of infected cells to G 418. Using these pseudotypes, we confirmed the wide species distribution of Icelandic MVV receptors and the narrow host range of CAEV. However, <b>functional</b> <b>receptors</b> for the two North American MVV strains tested, unlike the Icelandic MVV and similar to CAEV, were limited to cells of ruminant species, regardless of cytopathic phenotype. The results indicate a differential receptor recognition by MVV strains which is unrelated to cytopathic phenotype...|$|R

2500|$|G-protein-coupled {{receptor}} oligomerisation is {{a widespread}} phenomenon. [...] One of the best-studied examples is the metabotropic GABAB receptor. This so-called constitutive receptor is formed by heterodimerization of GABABR1 and GABABR2 subunits.

[...] Expression of the GABABR2 subunit alone, meanwhile, leads to surface expression of the subunit, although with no functional activity (i.e., the receptor does not bind agonist and cannot initiate a response following exposure to agonist).

2500|$|The binding of gp120 to GalCer has {{the ability}} to start the fusion of HIV-1, but the binding of gp120 to {{sulfatide}} does not. Sulfatide is not a <b>functional</b> <b>receptor.</b> However, experiments have shown that sulfatide and GalCer compete for the ability to bind to gp120, and sulfatide has been shown to have the strongest binding affinity for recombinant gp120 of all the glycolipids tested. [...] Therefore, this suggests that when sulfatide is attached to HIV-1, it cannot interact with the chemokine co-receptor because of the instability of the complex between gp120 and sulfatide, which therefore prevents the initiation of the fusion process. This indicates that sulfatide can prevent HIV-1 infection by mediating gp120 binding, which, in turn, prevents the fusion process; consequently, it has been demonstrated that sulfatide treatments may lead to the inhibition of HIV-1 replication.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the number of <b>functional</b> {{acetylcholine}} <b>receptors</b> (AcChoRs) on chicken ciliary ganglion neurons in culture is considerably smaller than the total number of AcChoRs detected on the neurons by labeled receptor probes. Here we use patch-clamp recording to show that a cAMP-dependent process enhances the AcCho response of the neurons by a mechanism likely to involve an increase in the number of functional AcChoRs. The increase occurs without requiring protein synthesis and without involving a detectable increase in the total number of AcChoRs on the cell surface measured with a labeled receptor probe. The results imply that the neurons have functional and nonfunctional pools of AcChoRs and that <b>functional</b> <b>receptors</b> can be recruited from intracellular receptors or from nonfunctional receptors on the cell surface by a cAMP-dependent process.

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of each of the}} two interferon (IFN) systems in impeding herpesvirus replication and in stimulating virus-specific lymphocytes to control an acute systemic infection is not completely understood. To further our knowledge, pseudorabies virus, attenuated by deletion of the glycoprotein E gene to impair its neurovirulence and by deletion of the thymidine kinase gene (gE−TK−PRV), was used to infect wild-type 129 Sv/Ev and congenic mice with immune system-associated genetic deficiencies. Mice with mature B and T lymphocytes but lacking either one or both <b>functional</b> <b>receptors</b> for members of each of the two IFN families were infected with gE−TK−PRV. At 3 and 7 but not 14 days after infection, replicating gE−TK−PRV could be isolated only from livers or spleens of mice lacking the receptors for both IFN families, and these mice survived the infection. Therefore, <b>functional</b> IFN <b>receptors</b> were not required to induce a protective immune response against an acute infection with gE−TK−PRV. Furthermore, PRV-specific antibodies of all immunoglobulin G isotypes were produced in these mice. Mice without mature B and T lymphocytes and lacking either one or both <b>functional</b> <b>receptors</b> for members of each of the two IFN families were also infected with gE−TK−PRV. Three days after infection, replicating virus could be isolated only from mice lacking both mature B and T lymphocytes and <b>functional</b> IFN <b>receptors,</b> and these mice were not able to clear the virus.

40|$|In recent years, a {{role for}} AMPA receptors as {{modulators}} of presynaptic functions has emerged. We have investigated the presence of AMPA receptor subunits and the possible dynamic control of their surface exposure at the presynaptic membrane. We demonstrate that the AMPA receptor subunits GluR 1 and GluR 2  are expressed and organized in <b>functional</b> <b>receptors</b> in axonal growth cones of hippocampal neurons. AMPA receptors are actively internalized upon activation and recruited to the surface upon depolarization. Pretreatment of cultures with botulinum toxin E or tetanus toxin prevents the receptor insertion into the plasma membrane, whereas treatment with α-latrotoxin enhances the surface exposure of GluR 2, both in growth cones of cultured neurons and in brain synaptosomes. Purification of small synaptic vesicles through controlled-pore glass chromatography, revealed that both GluR 2 and GluR 1, but not the GluR 2 interacting protein GRIP, copurify with synaptic vesicles. These data indicate that, at steady state, a major pool of AMPA receptor subunits reside in synaptic vesicle membranes and can be recruited to the presynaptic membrane as <b>functional</b> <b>receptors</b> in response to depolarization...|$|R

50|$|PTP-sigma (a {{transmembrane protein}} {{tyrosine}} phosphatase) is a recently discovered receptor for CSPGs, and {{is important for}} proper CSPG function. PTP-sigma binds with very high affinity to CSPGs, specifically neurocan and aggrecan. To simulate more physiological situations, researchers looked at PTP-sigma effects on spinal cord injury sites in mice. Mice with induced spinal cord injury lacking PTP-sigma showed significantly more axon regrowth, with normal amounts of CSPG present. This suggests that without PTP-sigma, CSPGs cannot bind to anything to function properly {{at the site of}} a glial scar. Because PTP-sigma is a <b>functional</b> <b>receptor</b> for CSPGs and promotes proper function of CSPGs, drugs manipulating PTP-sigma may help patients suffering from spinal cord injury.|$|E
40|$|Mouse {{hepatitis}} virus-A 59 (MHV-A 59), a murine coronavirus, can utilize as {{a cellular}} receptor MHVR, a murine glycoprotein in the biliary glycoprotein (BGP) subfamily of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) {{family in the}} immunoglobulin superfamily (G.

Several different BGP isoforms are expressed in tissues of different mouse strains, and we have explored which of these glycoproteins can serve as <b>functional</b> <b>receptors</b> for MHV-A 59. cDNA cloning, RNA-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis, and Western immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody, CC 1, specific for the N-terminal domain of MHVR showed that the inbred mouse strains BALB/c, C 3 H, and C 57 BL/ 6 expressed transcripts and proteins of the MHVR isoform and/or its splice variants but not the mmCGM 2 isoform. In contrast, adult SJL/J mice, which are resistant to infection with MHV-A 59, express transcripts and proteins only of the mmCGM 2 -related isoforms, not MHVR. These data are compatible with {{the hypothesis that the}} MHVR and mmCGM 2 glycoproteins may be encoded by different alleles of the same gene. We studied binding of anti-MHVR antibodies or MHV-A 59 virions to proteins encoded by transcripts of MHVR and mmCGM 2 and two splice variants of MHVR, one containing two immunoglobulin-like domains [MHVR(2 d) ] and the other with four domains as in MHVR but with a longer cytoplasmic domain [MHVR(4 d) L]. We found that the three isoforms tested could serve as <b>functional</b> <b>receptors</b> for MHV-A 59, although only isoforms that include the N-terminal domain of MHVR were recognized by monoclonal antibody CC 1 in immunoblots or by MHV-A 59 virions in virus overlay protein blot assays. Thus, in addition to MHVR, both the two-domain isoforms, mmCGM 2 and MHVR(2 d), and the MHVR(4 d) L isoform served as <b>functional</b> virus <b>receptors</b> for MHV-A 59.

Infectibility was restored or enhanced by the addition of the same specific gangliosides found in earlier studies with C 6 cells.
