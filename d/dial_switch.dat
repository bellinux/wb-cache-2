50|$|The Spotmatic II (SPII) heralded {{the arrival}} of the SMC lenses.Among some {{improvements}} were better metering system (Max ASA was increased to 3200) and film transport.A hot shoe for flash was added and the synchronization (FP or X) was placed on a <b>dial</b> <b>switch</b> located below the rewind crank.|$|E
5000|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Bell System, Western Electric {{telephones}} contained {{much more}} computer technology and more plastic over metal, since advances in electronics and manufacturing processes made it possible, and there was no longer the need to produce heavy duty, long-lasting telephones. In 1985, the 2220 Trimline was heavily modified, including a touch-tone/pulse <b>dial</b> <b>switch,</b> eliminating the need for the 220 rotary phone, foreshadowing what was to come for other AT&T telephones. The 1985 Trimline, like other new telephones introduced after the AT&T breakup, was marked [...] "AT&T TECHNOLOGIES - MADE IN U.S.A." [...] IC chips, used in these updated [...] "electronic" [...] telephones used WExxx model number nomenclature.|$|E

50|$|The NCR Century 100 {{supported}} several programming languages. The {{first was}} NEAT/3 (National's Easy Auto-coding Technique) {{which was a}} later version of the NEAT/1 language that ran on the NCR 315 computer system. The second was COBOL. The third was FORTRAN, and the fourth was BASIC. If minor program logic changes were necessary, instead of recompiling the program, one {{could go to the}} control panel, stop the operation and with the <b>dial</b> <b>switches,</b> put in address/command changes with the <b>dial</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|R
50|$|What {{turned out}} to be the most popular and longest lasting {{physical}} style of telephone was introduced in the early 20th century, including Bell's 202-type desk set. A carbon granule transmitter and electromagnetic receiver were united in a single molded plastic handle, which when not in use sat in a cradle in the base unit. The circuit diagram of the model 202 shows the direct connection of the transmitter to the line, while the receiver was induction coupled. In local battery configurations, when the local loop was too long to provide sufficient current from the exchange, the transmitter was powered by a local battery and inductively coupled, while the receiver was included in the local loop. The coupling transformer and the ringer were mounted in a separate enclosure, called the subscriber set. The <b>dial</b> <b>switch</b> in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly disconnecting the line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the hook switch (in the center of the circuit diagram) disconnected the line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle.|$|E
5000|$|... 1979: Asahi Pentax ME Super (Japan): first SLR with {{primarily}} electronic {{push button}} controls. Had increase/decrease push buttons for shutter speed selection {{instead of a}} traditional shutter speed dial. As digital computerized SLR features multiplied, push button controls also multiplied and replaced analogue electromechanical <b>dial</b> <b>switches</b> in most 35 mm SLRs by the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the rest}} of the 1960s, the company {{expanded}} its infrastructure of cables and switching equipment while adding new lines to keep pace with Rochester's growth. In 1966 Rochester Telephone completed conversion of its entire system to <b>dial</b> <b>switching</b> and established a seven-digit phone number system. By the end of the decade, the company had added 200,000 new phones to its network.|$|R

5000|$|This was {{the third}} {{building}} C&P Telephone built in downtown Washington and the second in a two-year period of time. [...] This seven story structure housed the companyâ€™s new <b>dial</b> <b>switching</b> equipment {{that could not be}} accommodated in its existing facilities. It was designed with Art Deco detailing and ornamentation by the New York architectural firm of Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker. The company began its first conversion to dial telephone service on May 3, 1930 when 60,000 telephones in downtown Washington were switched over from the old manual system.|$|R

50|$|Telephone {{companies}} typically provide {{two types}} of <b>dial</b> tone <b>switched</b> circuits - ground start and loop start. Private branch exchanges (PBX) work best on ground start trunks because those trunks can give them an on hook signal allowing for timely clearing.|$|R
50|$|In 1944 Rochester Telephone sold {{stock to}} the public for the first time. Demand for {{telephone}} services continued to grow astronomically in the postwar years, and the company found itself unable to keep up with its customers' needs. Rochester Telephone struggled to raise capital to provide for expansion and conversion to more efficient <b>dial</b> <b>switching,</b> and in the meantime, urged its customers not to make nonessential calls. Rochester citizens, relatively tolerant of the company's weaknesses during the war, responded in the postwar period with frustration and criticism. Letters to local papers characterized phone service in the area as 'wretched' and 'outrageous.' Eventually, a state regulatory agency undertook an investigation of Rochester Telephone's operations.|$|R
50|$|OpenDX {{is based}} on the Motif widget toolkit on top of the X Window System. Its {{graphical}} user interface has a wide variety of interactors, both direct and indirect. Direct interactors allow the user to directly manipulate images (e.g. rotate or zoom). Indirect interactors (<b>dials,</b> <b>switches,</b> buttons, sliders) enable the user to control various aspects of her visualization. Interactors are smarter because they are data-driven. Interactors are auto-ranging and self-limiting. They examine the data and, depending on its type, will determine the minimum and maximum of the data, or create a list for an option menu based on the data. The user can even set the label of the interactor based on some aspect of the data (e.g., metadata).|$|R
5000|$|KRAK {{continued}} to broadcast into the 1990s, long after other music stations had {{switched to the}} FM band. KRAK-FM would eventually move ahead in the ratings, later becoming 105.1 KNCI through changes after purchase by CBS Radio and <b>dial</b> <b>switching.</b> Meanwhile, KRAK-AM became KHTK, first a talk station, later flipping to its current all-sports format. The call letters [...] "KRAK" [...] would make a brief return in the Sacramento media market as a country oldies station at AM 1470 before that station was sold to Radio Disney and is today KIID airing programming in Punjabi. Today the KRAK call letters are assigned to AM 910 in Victor Valley, California, also owned by CBS and airing the CBS Sports Radio Network.|$|R

50|$|The {{benefit of}} a solar dial over a {{conventional}} 'on-off' time switch {{is the ability to}} 'track' the sunrise and sunset times for a particular latitude (which is specified when the unit is purchased). The solar dial 'adjusts' itself by a fractional amount each day, thereby ensuring that street lighting is switched on and off when required throughout the year. Many dials also have an additional 'part night' facility allowing for a switch-off {{in the middle of the}} night, and then back on in the morning if needed. This 'part night' option was widely adopted in the United Kingdom for street lighting in the 1970s and 1980s in order to conserve energy. Some solar <b>dial</b> <b>switches</b> have a clockwork or battery 'reserve' to maintain time accuracy in cases of power outage. If this is lacking, the switch would have to be reset every time the power fails, a labour-intensive task.|$|R
50|$|When their radio breaks down, Jim {{orders a}} new one, {{but when it}} arrives Irene is shocked at its {{complete}} and utter ugliness. It is a large gumwood cabinet with numerous <b>dials</b> and <b>switches</b> that light up with a green light when it is plugged in. Until the new radio arrived, the Westcotts hardly ever argued and {{seemed to have a}} happy marriage.|$|R
50|$|A {{voice command}} device (VCD) is a device {{controlled}} {{by means of}} the human voice. By removing the need to use buttons, <b>dials</b> and <b>switches,</b> consumers can easily operate appliances with their hands full or while doing other tasks. Some of the first examples of VCDs can be found in home appliances with washing machines that allow consumers to operate washing controls through vocal commands and mobile phones with voice-activated dialing.|$|R
50|$|Christine Berrie is a Scottish {{illustrator}} {{and artist}} based in Glasgow.

5000|$|The prefix code [...] "9" [...] is <b>dialled</b> by <b>switched</b> voice {{customers}} {{before the}} destination number when they place calls {{from a different}} access network (France Telecom) and {{when they want to}} select Neuf Cegetel as the preferred operator. Because customers tend to forget to dial the prefix code, a reminder was included in most advertisements and the number was integrated into the brand name and logo ("9 Telecom", [...] "N9uf Telecom", [...] "N9uf Cegetel"). [...] "Neuf" [...] also means [...] "brand new".|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{computers were}} mainframes that lacked {{any form of}} operating system. Each user had sole {{use of the machine}} for a scheduled period of time and would arrive at the computer with program and data, often on punched paper cards and magnetic or paper tape. The program would be loaded into the machine, and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a control panel using <b>dials,</b> toggle <b>switches</b> and panel lights.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2009, as KNRS, {{the station}} began {{simulcasting}} its programming on FM HD Radio at 94.1 HD-2. KACP also broadcast on an FM translator in Utah County on 99.1 FM, and KJMY HD-2 up until March 2010. 99.1 switched formats to classic Country music, being {{fed by the}} HD-2 channel of KJMY 99.5. Though 99.1 is a translator, through a loophole in FCC regulations, the station can broadcast an HD-2 feed. KACP was then no longer available on the FM <b>dial,</b> until <b>switching</b> back to KNRS.|$|R
500|$|The Tornado {{features}} a tandem-seat cockpit, crewed by a pilot and a navigator/weapons officer; both electromechanical and electro-optical controls {{are used to}} fly the aircraft and manage its systems.

BAE Systems developed the Tornado Advanced Radar Display Information System (TARDIS), a [...] multi-function display, to replace the rear cockpit's Combined Radar and Projected Map Display; the RAF began installing TARDIS on the GR4 fleet in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, {{the system}} was sold by Scientific Development Corporation's [...] "Consumer Products Division", which was soon renamed as the [...] "Digital Equipment Division". The Minivac 601 was {{originally}} housed in a blue-painted wooden case. It used DPDT electrical relays as logic switches and for temporary data storage. The main board had a six-bit binary input/output array, consisting of simple DPDT slide switches, SPDT pushbutton switches, and indicator lights. A 16-position motorized <b>dial</b> rotary <b>switch</b> {{could be used to}} input decimal or hexadecimal numbers, to output numbers, or to act as a clock signal generator.|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} the use of push-buttons in {{telephony}} originated around 1887 with a device called the micro-telephone push-button, but it was not an automatic dialing system as understood later. This use even predated the invention of the rotary dial by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891. The Bell System in the United States relied on manual switched service until 1919, when it reversed its decisions and embraced <b>dialed,</b> automatic <b>switching.</b> The 1951 introduction of direct distance dialing required automatic transmission of dialed numbers between distant exchanges, leading to use of inband multi-frequency signaling within the Long Lines network while individual local subscribers continued to dial using standard pulses.|$|R
