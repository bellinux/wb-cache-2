40|$|A {{widely used}} clause in license {{contracts}} – the field-of-use restriction (FOUR) – precludes licensees from operating {{outside of the}} specified technical field. When a technology has several distinct applications, FOUR allow the licensor to slice up his rights and attribute them to the lowest-cost producer in each <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> This can improve production efficiency. However, with complex technologies, the boundaries <b>of</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> {{may be difficult to}} codify, entailing a risk of overlap of licensees’ rights.
