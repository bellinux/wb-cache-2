40|$|The {{performance}} of 2 -Mercapto- 5 -benzimidazolesulfonic acid (MBIS) in a Watts bath in crack electro-healing was investigated. Potentiostatic and galvanostatic voltammetry, current efficiency measurements were performed for electrochemical investigation. The morphology of the <b>healed</b> <b>crack</b> {{indicates that the}} healing crystals grow in a controllable manner {{with the addition of}} MBIS under forced convection with the healing crystals fill preferentially in the crack tip to the crack sidewalls. No obvious defects were observed along the interface between the substrate and the healing crystals, which is attributed the much higher current efficiency of MBIS. Annual-ring like defects are observed but with a much longer width compared with PEI. The formation mechanism of annual ring is discussed. Possible approach to get defect-free crack healing is also prospected...|$|E

In order {{to consider the}} effects of deformation degree, temperature, strain rate and holding time on the crack healing, the hot compression tests were performed on Gleeble- 1500 thermo-simulation machine under different process conditions. By in situ observation under optical microscope and scanning electron microscope, effects of process condition on crack healing and the behaviours of crack healing were revealed successfully: (1) the result of crack healing improves as the melt temperature, reduction and holding time increase, (2) the effect of crack healing decreases as the strain rate increases.

40|$|Experimental {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} that cracks can be healed in ordinary cementitious materials {{in the presence of}} water. The primary healing mechanisms are hydration of the unreacted nuclei of cement particles and the long-term formation of calcite. A mathematical model for simulating early-age autogenous healing of ordinary cement-based materials is proposed, which employs a coupled thermo-hygro-chemical (THC) framework andwhich uses a reactive water transport component to predict themovement of healingmaterials. A single concentration variable is employed for the healing component of themodel that is derived directly fromthe quantity of unreacted cement and computed using a generalised cement hydration model component. The hydration component is directly linked to an expression for capillary porosity and for the porosity of the material within a <b>healed</b> <b>crack.</b> The results from a series of model simulations are in good general agreement with experimental data from tests on autogenous healing...|$|E

To ensure the strength of the repair-welded area, this study used the direct re-melting approach, and simulated the repair welding with the filler addition, which has a chemical composition matching that of the base superalloy. As expected, different types of cracks, including the solidification crack in the weld fusion zone and various types of liquidation cracks in the heat-affected zone, were observed. Through a proper hot isostatic pressing healing process, all cracks in the weld fusion zone and the heat-affected zone of the repair-welded pieces were healed. At the same time, some nano- and micro-sized carbides tended to form discontinuously along the <b>healed</b> <b>crack</b> trace.

This study aims at assessing the performance of Portland cement mortar incorporating self-healing Bacillus Pseudofirmus bacteria using Diatomaceous earth (DE) to immobilize precursor and bacteria in mortar and lowering the pH level of mortar by using silica fume to provide a suitable growth environment for bacteria to generate limestone. The specimens were prepared at three different bacteria dosages and three DE dosages.

40|$|In this study, a {{waterproof}} material {{was used to}} fabricate microcapsule by interfacial curing reaction to encapsulate an alkaliphilic spore-forming bacterium. The technical feasibility of encapsulated spores {{and the influence of}} three kinds of curing agent on the calcium precipitation activity (CPA) of the bacterium were studied. Furthermore, micromorphology of microcapsules was observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Afterwards, the thermal stability and thermolysis temperature were determined by TGA thermal analyzer. Moreover, the CPA of broken/ unbroken microcapsules was evaluated. In addition, water resistance was evaluated by adding microcapsules in the water for 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. Finally, light microscope was applied to trace the self-healing behavior of encapsulated mineralization bacterium in cement paste specimens. The results showed that compared with unbroken microcapsules, higher CPA was achieved by breaking the microcapsule to release the bacterium, suggesting good protection for the encapsulated spores. Three curing agents showed nearly similar influence on the spores, while KH 792 performed relatively better, and thus was used to fabricate microcapsule with the core/shell weight ratio being 1 : 1. Our results also indicated that ER microcapsules could keep unbroken in the water for 2 months. Compared with the specimens without embedded bacterium, the <b>healed</b> <b>crack</b> area of specimens embedded with bacterial microcapsules was monitored, suggesting effective self-healing of concrete crack can be achieved by introducing encapsulated mineralization microorganisms into concrete structures.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of maintenance and replacement work costs {{is an important}} driving force {{in the development of}} high temperature materials (T> 800 Â°C) that can autonomously heal damage as a result of local cracks.

40|$|A lot {{of damage}} is {{reported}} for constructions in marine environments. Marine environments are very aggressive, {{because of the high}} chloride concentration in sea water. Chlorides affect durability by initiating corrosion of the reinforcement steel. When cracks appear in the concrete structures, chlorides will penetrate faster and will initiate corrosion. A possible solution is self-healing concrete. Self-healing concrete has the ability to recover without external intervention. From the literature concerning self-healing concrete, it is clear that research focuses on the general concept, the mechanical properties and water permeability. Based on the water permeability it is concluded whether harmful substances will penetrate. Specific data on degradation of self-healing concrete in aggressive environments are not available. Nevertheless, these data are important to ensure a good estimation of the service life extension. In this research, the effect of the healed cracks on the resistance against chlorides was investigated for two concrete types, namely ordinary Portland cement concrete and blast-furnace slag concrete with 50 % cement replacement. Non-steady state migration tests, based on NT Build 492, were performed with uncracked, cracked and healed concrete. In our previous research, autonomous crack healing was obtained by encapsulating polyurethane healing agents. To release the healing agents, realistic cracks were formed by means of a controlled splitting test. In the current work, as a first step, cracks (notches) were manually healed with a two-component healing agent based on polyurethane. These cracks (notches) were formed by means of steel plates with a width of 0. 1 and 0. 3 mm. The migration tests were performed at constant setup parameters, namely 30 V and 8 h. The chloride penetration front was visualized by means of the colorimetric method. By comparing the penetration depths, it seemed that concrete with a <b>healed</b> <b>crack</b> of 0. 1 mm can fully regain its resistance against chloride penetration...|$|E

In consideration with this fact, SiN/SiC nano-laminated film {{is expected to}} exhibit the self crack healing at high temperature. In this study, we investigated the self crack healing behavior of the SiN/SiC nano-laminated film including its factors such as heating temperature, heating time. The films were deposited on the silicon wafer using an ion beam assisted deposition technique. The SiN/SiC nano-laminated films with four layers were fabricated by alternative deposition of SiN and SiC. Total film thickness is approximately 1 Âµm. After the deposition, a pre-crack was introduced using a Vickers indentation. Then, the cracked film was heated using an electric furnace at temperatures ranging from 873 K to 1473 K in the air. The heating time was changed from 1 h to 72 h. The crack on SiN monolayer film was almost not healed at the temperature less than 1273 K. On the other hand, {{in the case of}} SiN/SiC nano-laminated film, crack healing occurred at even 873 K. SiO 2 was observed along the <b>healed</b> <b>crack.</b> These results indicate that SiC layer contributes to crack healing significantly. However, the crack with large opening was not healed. These results indicate that SiN/SiC nanolaminated film has an ability to heal initial small crack. The crack healing became remarkable with an increase in heating temperature and time. This result is corresponding with the tendency observed in bulk. However, at 1473 K, though the crack was healed perfectly, the laminate structure disappeared and the overall film was subjected to oxidation. This suggested that there is an upper limitation of temperature for in-situ self crack healing...|$|E
40|$|Self-healing {{concrete}} {{is regarded}} as a promising solution to reduce the high maintenance and repair cost of concrete infrastructure. Due to the limited autogenous healing capacity of concrete as such, additives are needed to enhance its self-healing properties. Among various strategies, microbial-based self-healing has gained increasing attention because of its distinct features including environmental friendliness, long-term viability and low cost. Within the framework of this strategy, bacteria and the relevant bio-reagents are pre-added into the concrete during the casting and are expected to play their role (heal cracks) when cracking occurs. Due to the high alkalinity and small pore sizes of concrete, bacteria cannot be added directly, and hence an immobilization process is required prior to incorporation into concrete. In the present work, a bio-compatible hydrogel was evaluated as the carrier to encapsulate an efficient carbonate precipitating bacteria, Bacillus sphaericus, which was selected based on previous research. As proof of concept, the activity of bacterial spores after immobilization, the carbonatogenesity of the hydrogel encapsulated spores, the influence of the bio-agents on the hydrogel swelling properties, and the crack healing efficiency were investigated. Interestingly, no significant viability loss was observed after the immobilization process. The precipitation of CaCO 3 in/on the hydrogel matrix by the encapsulated spores was demonstrated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The swelling capacity of the hydrogel was slightly increased after incorporation of the bio-agents. In addition, the specimens combined with the bio-hydrogels showed an obvious superiority in crack healing efficiency, both with respect to the healing rate as well as the maximum <b>healed</b> <b>crack</b> width. A maximum crack width of about 0. 5 mm can be healed in the specimens containing bio-hydrogels within 7 d, while no crack healing was observed in the reference specimens.

Depending on the type of damage, different healing agents can be used. In case of dynamic cracks in structures exposed to cyclic loads, elastic healing materials can be used to cope with the crack opening and closing movement.
