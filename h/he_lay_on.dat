5|$|Enquiries about insect {{pollination}} led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. In 1862 Fertilisation of Orchids gave his first detailed {{demonstration of the}} power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinismus incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} season with the Wild Ballard was hit by the New York Islanders' Matt Martin after making a pass. The hit was {{delivered}} as Ballard turned away from Martin. Ballard's head struck a glass partition and as he fell his head bounced off the ice. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the ice {{for a few minutes}} before being able to leave the ice on his own. Ballard suffered a concussion and multiple facial fractures as a result. He was taken to Regions Hospital for evaluation and observation and released the next day. There was no penalty or suspension in result of the hit.|$|E
25|$|As {{they rode}} away, Reed {{was shot by}} Bud Ledbetter; the pain from his wound grew so severe that his {{partners}} were forced to leave him behind for the night. He gave them some of his loot, and kept {{the rest of it}} in a sack to use as a pillow. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> a blanket hiding under a rock ledge until he was found by an Indian woman, who nursed him back to health.|$|E

25|$|According to the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office's autopsy report, {{which was}} {{revealed}} by journalist Jamie Kalven through a public records request, McDonald {{was shot in}} his neck, chest, back, both arms, right leg and a graze wound to his left scalp. Nine of the 16 shots hit McDonald's back, and he was shot as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the ground. His death was ruled a homicide due to multiple gunshot wounds. Toxicology reports later revealed that McDonald had PCP in his blood and urine.|$|E
25|$|On 23 July 1997, {{at around}} 4.30 pm, a sixteen-year-old boy {{discovered}} {{the body of}} a man, lying face down, at the base of an old water tower in Keillers Park, in downtown Göteborg. Called on site, the police determined that the man had been shot twice with a pistol. The first bullet hit him in the back and went right through the heart, while the second was fired to his head as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the ground. A bag and a head cap were recovered beside the body.|$|E
25|$|Richard Edmonds, at {{the time}} BNP National Organiser, was sentenced to three months in prison in 1994 {{for his part in}} a racist attack. Edmonds threw a glass at the victim as he was walking past an East London pub where a group of BNP {{supporters}} was drinking. Others then 'glassed' the man in the face and punched and kicked him as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the ground, including BNP supporter Stephen O'Shea, who was jailed for 12 months. Another BNP supporter, Simon Biggs, was jailed for {{four and a half years}} for his part in the attack.|$|E

25|$|Blackford's son {{became ill}} {{probably}} with malaria, {{the date and}} details of the sickness are unknown. Blackford took him to Lexington, Kentucky for medical treatment, but he died {{only a short time}} later. The death was an emotional blow to Blackford. He returned to Vincennes where he arrived in the night and entered the home of his friend John Coburn. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the floor and wept till morning. He then locked himself away for two weeks in a room in Coburn's home, never speaking and only coming out to receive a meal. As he recovered, he sold his Vincennes estate and invested the money in land.|$|E
25|$|Herrera {{turned his}} prisoners over to men in his squad, then started {{crawling}} {{toward the other}} machine gun, firing as he went. (“My M-1 was talking, and the Germans understood what it was saying,” he commented later.) The position was protected by a minefield; GIs were throwing rocks into the area {{in an effort to}} explode the mines. Herrera got up and charged the Germans anyway, but as he neared the machine-gun nest, he stepped on a mine. He was thrown to the ground, both of his feet blown off at the ankle. Though bleeding heavily, <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> his stomach and fired at the Germans, forcing them to stay down and thus enabling his squad to skirt the minefield, flank the enemy, and move in for the kill.|$|E
25|$|With great difficulty, Lafaille {{managed to}} climb down the 75 degree {{face to the}} pair's last bivouac site, where he found 20 metres of thin rope, {{allowing}} him to make short abseils {{down some of the}} hardest parts. With no technical equipment to use as anchors he was forced to entrust his weight to tent pegs or, on one occasion, a plastic bottle. He finally reached what should have been the relative safety of the top of a fixed rope which he and Beghin had installed on a steep rock band, but almost immediately he was struck by a falling rock, which broke his right arm. Disabled and helpless, <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> a ledge for two days in the hope that other climbers would rescue him. However, while there was a Slovenian team attempting a route on {{a different part of the}} South Face, they judged that a rescue attempt would be too dangerous to undertake, so help never came. The cruellest thing about the ordeal, Lafaille said, was being able to see life in the valley below, and by night, the flashbulbs of trekkers' cameras. In spite of this, he later agreed that the Slovenians had made the right decision in not trying to save him.|$|E

500|$|In the 1996–97 season, Wetherall played less {{regularly}} as {{new manager}} George Graham experimented with defensive combinations, though {{by the following}} season he had re-established himself in the starting eleven, sometimes acting as captain, and signed a new five-year contract. On 27 September 1997, he scored in the 1–0 victory over arch-rivals Manchester United when Roy Keane's knee was badly injured {{in the act of}} fouling Alf-Inge Håland, who then accused Keane of feigning injury. Keane later took revenge on Håland during a Manchester derby and said to Håland as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the ground: [...] "And don't ever stand over me again sneering about fake injuries, and tell your pal Wetherall there's some for him as well." [...] Later that season Wetherall was among the Leeds travelling party who escaped unhurt as their aircraft crash-landed after an engine caught fire on takeoff.|$|E
500|$|Fixtures between Manchester United and Arsenal {{had seen}} a number of {{controversial}} incidents in the previous seasons. The rivalry between the two clubs had grown more intense since {{the formation of the}} Premier League in 1992, since when all but one Premier League title had been won by Manchester United or Arsenal (Blackburn Rovers won the title in 1994–95). However, the rivalry could be traced back to Alex Ferguson's first fixture against Arsenal as United manager in 1987, when David Rocastle was sent off and a row erupted. The following season, Brian McClair missed a penalty for United in an FA Cup tie and Nigel Winterburn made a point of aggravating him. McClair got his revenge in 1990: after a lunging tackle from Winterburn on Denis Irwin, McClair and Irwin both kicked Winterburn while <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the floor, sparking a 21-man brawl. Both teams were fined and deducted points and it has often been suggested that this was a turning point in relations. The rivalry continued to intensify as [...] "hard men" [...] such as Patrick Vieira, Roy Keane and Martin Keown joined the sides.|$|E
2500|$|... 4 August: an off-duty UDR soldier (Denis Taggart) {{was shot}} dead by the IRA outside his home, Battenberg Street, Shankill, Belfast.

2500|$|... 10 March 1994: an off-duty RUC officer (John Haggan) {{was shot}} dead by the IRA at the Dunmore Greyhound Stadium, off Antrim Road, Belfast. The officer was in the lounge {{when he was shot}} in the head by an IRA {{volunteer}} and shot again as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the ground. A second IRA volunteer fired into the ceiling to cover their escape.|$|E
2500|$|After two men {{associated}} with the radical branch of Neturei Karta participated in a 2004 prayer vigil for Yasser Arafat outside the Percy Military Hospital in Paris, France, where <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> his death bed, the radical branch of Neturei Karta was widely condemned by other Orthodox Jewish organizations, including many other anti-Zionist Haredi organizations both in New York and Jerusalem. Moshe Hirsch, and what Hirsch's faction described as an [...] "impressive contingent" [...] of other members, attended Arafat's funeral in Ramallah.|$|E
2500|$|October 1958: Oliver R. Smoot, {{a pledge}} of MIT's Lambda Chi Alpha {{fraternity}} in 1958, {{was used to}} measure the length of the Harvard Bridge. As <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the sidewalk of the bridge that carries Massachusetts Avenue across the Charles River, markings were made at intervals corresponding to his height. The bridge was measured to be 364.4 Smoots (plus or minus one ear) in length. [...] During renovation of the bridge in 1964 the markings were carefully restored, and the markings remain to this day.|$|E

2500|$|One of Atwater's career {{highlights}} {{happened on}} September 17, 1990, during a Monday Night Football telecast from Mile High Stadium in Denver, Colorado. As Kansas City Chiefs massive 260 lbs. running back Christian Okoye, came {{through a hole}} in the line of scrimmage, he was met by Atwater. The resulting collision stopped Okoye in his tracks, with Atwater standing over him, taunting the proclaimed [...] "Nigerian Nightmare", while <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the ground stunned. His coach Mike Shanahan stated [...] "That's the hit people will remember him for." ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent [...] to {{his alleged}} killing of leader Billy Hanna outside {{his home in}} Lurgan {{in the early hours}} of 27 July 1975, Jackson assumed command of the Mid-Ulster Brigade. Hanna and his wife Ann had just {{returned}} from a function at the local British Legion Club. When he stepped out of the car, two men approached him. After asking them [...] "What are you playing at?" [...] one of them produced a pistol, walked over and shot him twice in the head; once in the temple and afterwards in the back of the head, execution style as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the ground. His wife witnessed the killing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{text and}} melody of Rodigast's hymn were {{published}} {{together for the}} first time in 1690 in the Nürnbergische Gesangbuch, with the composer marked as [...] "anonymous". Before that the melody with the hymn title had already been used by Pachelbel for an organ partita in 1683. Taking into account the appearance of the melody in the Klesch hymnbook and the history of the hymn given in the 1687 Nordhausen Gesangbuch, the Swiss theologian and musicologist Andreas Marti has suggested that it is plausible that, as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> his sick-bed in Jena, the cantor Severus Gastorius had the melody of Fabricius spinning [...] around in his head as an [...] "earworm" [...] and was inspired to add a second half.|$|E

50|$|Aldrich often {{works on}} gessoed panels {{with a mixture}} of oil paint, mineral spirits, and wax, which <b>he</b> <b>lays</b> <b>on</b> with a brush or palette knife. The {{combination}} of the resistant ground and viscid alloy registers his short hesitant strokes with tender congealed precision. His larger and breezier canvases have been compared to Philip Guston's transitional pictures from the mid-1960s (and also sometimes evoke Per Kirkeby or Joan Mitchell).|$|R
