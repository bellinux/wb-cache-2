50|$|The diameters of float-zone wafers are {{generally}} not greater than 150mm due to the surface tension limitations during growth. A polycrystalline rod of ultra-pure electronic grade silicon is passed through an RF heating coil, which creates a localized molten zone from which the crystal ingot grows. A seed crystal is used at one end in order to start the growth. The whole process is carried out in an evacuated chamber or in an inert <b>gas</b> <b>purge.</b> The molten zone carries the impurities away with it and hence reduces impurity concentration (most impurities are more soluble in the melt than the crystal).

40|$|LecturePg. 51 - 56 Ever since steam {{turbines}} have been built, {{contamination of the}} lube oil by water has been a persistent problem. Water contamination will result in rusting of ferrous components, accelerate sludging leading to sticking of mechanisms. In advanced cases, if water is pumped by the oil pump, immediate bearing failures result. Aeration of oil as it leaves the bearing {{is the reason why}} most forced feed (lube) turbines experience a constant in flow of air into the bearing housings. If this air has a dew point above the coolest place in the oil system, water contamination results. Raising oil reservoir temperatures and better flingers frequently help and sometimes eliminates the problem, but a dry <b>gas</b> <b>purge,</b> either dry nitrogen or dehydrated air, has been proven to be very effective.

40|$|In this study, {{local area}} water content {{distribution}} under various <b>gas</b> <b>purging</b> conditions are experimentally analyzed {{for the first}} time. The local high frequency resistance (HFR) is measured using novel micro sensors. The results reveal that the liquid water removal rate in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is non-uniform. In the under-the-channel area, the removal of liquid water is governed by both convective and diffusive flux of the through-plane drying. Thus, {{almost all of the}} liquid water is removed within 30 s of <b>purging</b> with <b>gas.</b> However, liquid water that is stored in the under-the-rib area is not easy to remove during 1 min of <b>gas</b> <b>purging.</b> Therefore, the re-hydration of the membrane by internal diffusive flux is faster than that in the under-the-channel area.

The test article design was iterated a third time before the latest series of such tests, which was performed {{in the first half}} of 2009.

50|$|In cocurrent systems, the <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> is 50 °F to 100 °F {{hotter than}} the soil {{discharge}} temperature. The {{result is that}} the <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> exit temperature may range from 400 °F to 1,000 °F and cannot go directly to the baghouse. <b>Purge</b> <b>gas</b> first enters an afterburner to decontaminate the fine particles, then goes into a cooling unit prior to introduction into the baghouse. Because of the higher temperature and volume of the <b>purge</b> <b>gas,</b> the baghouse and all other downstream processing equipment must be larger than in a countercurrent system. Cocurrent systems do have several advantages over countercurrent systems: The afterburner is located upstream of the baghouse ensuring that fine particles are decontaminated; and because the heated <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> is introduced at the same end of the drum as the feed soil, the soil is heated faster, resulting in a longer residence time. Higher temperatures and longer residence time mean that cocurrent systems can be used to treat soils contaminated with heavier petroleum products. Cocurrent systems are effective for light and heavy petroleum products including No. 6 fuel oil, crude oil, motor oil, and lubricating oil.|$|R
