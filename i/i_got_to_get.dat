In 69 games he {{averaged}} just under 30 minutes per game, averaging a new career-best 13.5 ppg to go with 10.2 rpg. An early-season article in Sports Illustrated stated of Roberson, [...] "Despite being one of the NBA's shortest centers, and perhaps its lightest, he has been the Blazer most responsible for the team's turnabout[...] [...] Roberson has already missed five entire games, plus all but three minutes of another, with a leg injury. In his absences, Portland's record is 2-4. With Roberson on full-time duty, the Blazers are 5-1, the only loss coming last week against the streaking Bulls, who made Portland their 11th straight victim. No center has scored more than 14 points against Roberson, and more important, his Dave Cowens-like quickness and agility at stepping out from the middle and pop-switching on smaller, supposedly faster men have allowed the Blazers to employ an aggressive switching defense. In games started by Roberson, Portland has given up an average of 102 points, 10.3 fewer than last season. 'I'd be bulljiving myself if I thought I could stand in the middle and block a lot of shots the way the real big dudes do,' says Roberson. 'I've got to come out and play the small guys. You know, face-to-face. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up on 'em and spread out so they can't drive by or pass around me to the big guy I've switched off.
