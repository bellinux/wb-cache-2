A new mechanistic model of PAR has been presented and validated by experimental data and results of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The model allows to quickly and accurately predict gas temperature and composition, catalyst temperature and hydrogen recombination rate. It is assumed in the model that an exothermic recombination reaction of hydrogen and oxygen proceeds at the catalyst surface only, while processes of heat and mass transport occur by assisted natural and forced convection in non-isothermal and laminar gas flow conditions in vertical channels between catalyst plates. The model accounts for heat radiation from a hot catalyst surface and has no adjustable parameters.

40|$|Operation of {{a passive}} autocatalytic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>recombiner</b> (PAR) has been {{investigated}} by means of computational fluid dynamics methods (CFD). The recombiner is a self-active and self-adaptive device used to remove hydrogen from safety containments of light water nuclear reactors (LWR) {{by means of a}} highly exothermic reaction with oxygen at the surface of a platinum or palladium catalyst. Different turbulence models (k-ω, k-ɛ, intermittency, RSM) were applied in numerical simulations of: gas flow, heat and mass transport and chemical surface reactions occurring in PAR. Turbulence was found to improve mixing and mass transfer and increase hydrogen recombination rate for high gas flow rates. At low gas flow rates, simulation results converged to those obtained for the limiting case of laminar flow. The large eddy simulation technique (LES) was used to select the best RANS (Reynolds average stress) model. Comparison of simulation results obtained for two- and three-dimensional computational grids showed that heat and mass transfer occurring in PAR were virtually two-dimensional processes. The effect of hydrogen thermal diffusion was also discussed in the context of possible hydrogen ignition inside the recombiner...|$|E

This change would allow WBN to insert Tritium Producing Burnable Absorber Rods (TPBARs) into the reactor core to support DOE in maintaining the nation's tritium inventory (Tritium Program). The proposed license amendment involves increasing the required boron concentration for both the cold leg accumulators (TS 3. 5. 1) and the refueling water storage tank (TS 3. 5. 4), removing the Region 2 burnup credit racks in the Spent Fuel Pool and clarifying fuel storage restrictions (TSs 3. 7. 15 and 4. 3. 3), adding a limit {{on the number of}} TPBARs that can be irradiated (TS Section 4. 2. 1), and the implementation of a TPBAR consolidation activity.

During the 1979 Three Mile Island accident a hydrogen bubble formed in the pressure vessel dome.

Flooding of the corium mass with water, or the drop of molten corium mass into a water pool, may result in a temperature spike and production of large amounts of hydrogen, which can result in a pressure spike in the containment vessel. The steam explosion resulting from such sudden corium-water contact can disperse the materials and form projectiles that may damage the containment vessel by impact. Subsequent pressure spikes can be caused by combustion of the released hydrogen. Detonation risks can be reduced by the use of catalytic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>recombiners.</b>|$|R

40|$|The System-Integrated Modular Advanced Reactor (SMART) {{that has}} been {{recently}} designed in KOREA and has acquired standard design certification from the nuclear power regulatory body (NSSC) is an integral type reactor with 330 MW thermal power. It is a small sized reactor in which the core, steam generator, pressurizer, and reactor coolant pump that are in existing pressurized light water reactors {{are designed to be}} within a pressure vessel without any separate pipe connection. In addition, this reactor has much different design characteristics from existing pressurized light water reactors such as the adoption of a passive residual heat removal system and a cavity flooding system. Therefore, the safety of the SMART against severe accidents should be checked through severe accident analysis reflecting the design characteristics of the SMART. For severe accident analysis, en analysis model has been developed reflecting the design information presented in the standard design safety analysis report. The severe accident analysis model has been developed using the MELCOR code that is widely used to evaluate pressurized LWR severe accidents. The steady state accident analysis model for the SMART has been simulated. According to the analysis results, the developed model reflecting the design of the SMART is found to be appropriate. Severe accident analysis has been performed for the representative accident scenarios that lead to core damage to check the appropriateness of the severe accident management plan for the SMART The SMART {{has been shown to be}} safe enough to prevent severe accidents by utilizing severe accident management systems such as a containment spray system, a passive <b>hydrogen</b> <b>recombiner,</b> and a cavity flooding system. In addition, the SMART is judged to have been technically improved remarkably compared to existing PWRs.

The main purpose of this work {{is to develop a}} numerical model of passive autocatalytic recombiner (PAR) using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS-FLUENT and tuning the model using experimental results. The REKO 3 experiment was used for this purpose. Experiment was made in the Institute for Safety Research and Reactor Technology in Julich (Germany). It has been performed for different hydrogen concentrations, different flow rates, the presence of steam, and different initial temperatures of the inlet mixture. The model of this experimental recombiner was elaborated within the framework of this work. The influence of mesh, gas thermal conductivity coefficient, mass diffusivity coefficients, and turbulence model was investigated. The best results with a good agreement with REKO 3 data were received for k-ɛ model of turbulence, gas thermal conductivity dependent on the temperature and mass diffusivity coefficients taken from CHEMKIN program.

40|$|At the Emsland {{nuclear power}} station, {{a total of}} 58 autocatalytic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>recombiners</b> were backfitted in 1999 as an {{additional}} measure of risk reduction in connection with major hydrogen releases after events going beyond the design basis.

Recombiners not meeting the inspection criterion were completely regenerated as a measure of precaution. A preventive study was conducted jointly with institutes of the Julich Research Center and the Aachen Technical University to analyze the composition of the deposits, which was then compared with the chemical characteristics of potential sources in the reactor containment. At the same time, the influence on effectiveness of the catalyst sheets was examined. On the basis of a random evaluation of the in-service inspection logs of the past few years, representative samples were taken whose startup behavior and operating characteristics were studied in a test rig alongside chemical analyses so as to allow a correlation to be established between the analytical findings and the catalytic activity of the samples. The findings made allowed internal sources of the catalyst deposits to be excluded. The impurities are introduced with the outside air.

40|$|The 5 th FWP EURSAFE Project {{highlighted}} iodine chemistry in {{the containment}} {{as one of}} the issues requiring further research in order to reduce source term uncertainties. Consequently, a series of studies was launched in the 6 th FWP SARNET Project aimed at improving the predictability of iodine behaviour during severe accidents via {{a better understanding of the}} complex chemical phenomena in the containment. In particular, SARNET has striven to foster common interpretation of integral and separate effect test data, production of new or improved models where necessary, and compilation of the existing knowledge of the subject. The work has been based on a substantial amount of experimental information made available from bench-scale projects (PARIS and EPICUR), via intermediate-scale tests (CAIMAN) to large-scale facilities (SISYPHE, THAI and PHEBUS-FP). In the experimental field, particular attention has been paid to two specific issues: the effects of radiation on both aqueous and gaseous iodine chemistry, and the mass transfer of iodine between aqueous and gaseous phases. Comparisons between calculations and results of the EPICUR and CAIMAN experiments suggest that the aqueous phase chemistry is reasonably well understood, although there are still some areas of uncertainty. Interpretation of integral experiments, like PHEBUS-FPT 2, indicated that radiation-induced conversion of molecular iodine into particulate species (IxOy) could be responsible for the gaseous iodine depletion observed in the long-term. However, the results of much simpler, small-scale experiments have shown that further improvements in understanding and modelling are still needed. Mass transfer modelling has been extended to cover evaporating sump conditions based on SISYPHE data; however, application of this model to the larger scale THAI experiments seems not to be straightforward. In addition to these two major issues, some specific studies have been carried out concerning the potential effect of passive autocatalytic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>recombiners</b> on iodine volatility. The RECI analytical experiments have shown that metal iodides (namely Csl and Cdl(2)) are not stable and yield gaseous iodine when heated, in a humid atmosphere, at temperatures representative of recombiner operation. Another important undertaking successfully carried out has been the compilation of an Iodine Data Book, which provides a critical review of the experimental data and modelling approaches that have been used in the development of iodine source term methodologies. This should assist in a proper use of such models, and inform their future development...|$|R
40|$|The {{containment}} {{of a nuclear}} reactor is the last barrier that avoid the release of radioactive material; for this reason any excessive load that could jeopardize its integrity must be avoided. In case of a severe accident, the heat up of the core and its degradation lead {{to the formation of}} hydrogen following cladding oxidation. Then, hydrogen could migrate into the containment and accumulate in the upper region, where it could exceed the concentration's limit for flame propagation. As result hydrogen explosions could occur threatening containment integrity. For this reason present containments are inertized or incude many engineering safety features preventing hydrogen accumulation. These features consist in mixing devices for homogenizing the atmosphere and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>recombiners.</b> Natural circulation could also enhance the mixing through ascending and descending flows. Thanks to the recent improvements in computer capabilities, in last decades CFD codes capable of modeling 3 D containment facilities have been developed with the aim of simulating containment scenarios and proving the safety of nuclear power plants. The aim of this work consists in understanding and solving some issues related to the modeling of gas transport and mixing inside a closed volume. Cast 3 M finite element CFD code has been adopted to perform all the simulations. In particular we have focused the attention on simple problems related to pure diffusion processes, where the fluid is expected to be at rest. CFD computations have shown some discrepancies in results since non-physical velocities appear in the computational domain altering the status of fluid. These `spurious velocities' seem to be linked to the use of an unstructured mesh coupled with a numerical method, that does not rigorously ensure incompressibility constrains. Due to the formation of a non-real flow, CFD transient simulations could be affected by transport phenomena that enhance the mixing inside the volume. As result, computed scenarios could present non-conservative situations in which hydrogen does not reach flammability limits. To decrease the magnitude of these spurious velocities the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition method has been adopted. Thanks to this method real improvements have been achieved in reducing the influence of numerical errors in the simulations. Eventually the pure diffusion process of chemical species has been coupled with a simple turbulence model. The aim is to achieve a wider comprehension on the phenomena that are responsible for the fastening of the mixing process. At the end of this analysis, a more suitable relation for the mixing-length, that allows us to better model diffusion processes, has been evaluated...|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} {{the focus has}} been on the system for {{recombination}} at Oskarshamn 2. The recombining systems have on several occasions switched paths due to low pressure before the last ejector that’s feeding the recombiner. Of the mentioned reason, events and several measuring points have been analyzed in this report since the installation of the recombining systems. In order to prove theories and demonstrate what may be the cause of this problem, we used heat balance calculations by the program Probera. Using the program, we can demonstrate that the catalytic process does not reach the desired temperature with the amount of combustible substance. We have used Oskarshamn 2 's simulator to see what happens at increased concentration of <b>hydrogen</b> in the <b>recombiner.</b> The project demonstrates how the controlsystem can be changed for a greater margin to switching paths and thus should provide a more stable process.

40|$|Remediation {{of current}} {{inventories}} of high-activity radioactive liquid waste (HALW) requires transportation of Type-B quantities of radioactive material, possibly {{up to several}} hundred liters. However, the only currently certified packaging is limited to quantities of 50 ml (0. 01 gal) quantities of Type-B radioactive liquid. Efforts {{are under way to}} recertify the existing packaging to allow the shipment of up to 4 L (1. 1 gal) of Type-B quantities of HALW, but significantly larger packaging could be needed in the future. Scoping studies and preliminary designs have identified the feasibility of retrofitting an insert into existing casks, allowing the transport of up to 380 L (100 gal) of HALW. However, the insert design and ultimate certification strategy depend heavily on the gas-generating attributes of the HALW. A non-vented containment vessel filled with HALW, {{in the absence of any}} gas-mitigation technologies, poses a deflagration threat and, therefore, gas generation, specifically hydrogen generation, must be reliably controlled during all phases of transportation. Two techniques are available to mitigate <b>hydrogen</b> accumulation: <b>recombiners</b> and getters. Getters have an advantage over recombiners in that oxides are not required to react with the hydrogen. A test plan was developed to evaluate three forms of getter material in the presence of both simulated HALW and the gases that are produced by the HALW. These tests demonstrated that getters can react with hydrogen in the presence of simulated waste and in the presence of several other gases generated by the HALW, such as nitrogen, ammonia, nitrous oxide, and carbon monoxide. Although the use of such a gettering system has been shown to be technically feasible, only a preliminary design for its use has been completed. No further development is planned until the requirement for bulk transport of Type-B quantities of HALW is more thoroughly defined...|$|R

Progress in activities dealing with the hydrogen issue was achieved by performing experiments addressing these subjects: - hydrogen combustion with defined concentration gradients, - <b>hydrogen</b> mitigation via <b>recombiners</b> and the issue of self-ignition within a recombiner, - thermal-hydraulic phenomena in the containment (steam injection, condensation, sprays), - interaction between Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners and containment atmosphere. The experimental results are being used for benchmark simulations with both lumped parameter codes and CFD codes. The modeling results were discussed in numerous workshops with focus on large scale application. The experimental progress concerning the Fuel-Coolant Interaction (FCI) issue was delayed by the relocation of the KROTOS test facility to CEA, Cadarache. Calculation work in preparation of the planned tests was performed by several partners with different CFD codes.
