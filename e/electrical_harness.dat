50|$|Following the SLC failure, an Anomaly Response Team (ART) was assembled, {{consisting}} {{of representatives from}} the USGS, NASA, and Hughes Santa Barbara Remote Sensing (the manufacturer of the ETM+ instrument).

However, the team was unable {{to rule out the}} possibility of an electrical failure, though such a possibility was deemed remote. Nevertheless, on September 3, 2003, USGS director Charles G.

40|$|One way to {{coordinate}} the efforts of workers along an assembly line that has fewer workers than work stations is to form a bucket brigade. Each worker in a bucket brigade simultaneously assembles a single item (an instance of the product) along the line.
