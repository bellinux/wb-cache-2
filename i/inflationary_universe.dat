Solutions can be found for pure scalar fields with various potentials in the absence and presence of spatial curvature and other perfect fluids. A series of generalisations of the Chaplygin gas and bulk viscous cosmological solutions for <b>inflationary</b> <b>universes</b> are found. Furthermore other closed-form solutions which provide <b>inflationary</b> <b>universes</b> are presented. We also show how the Hubble slow-roll parameters can be calculated using the solution algorithm and we compare these inflationary solutions with the observational data provided by the Planck 2015 collaboration in order to constraint and rule out some of these models.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{emergence}} of anisotropic (Bianchi IX) <b>inflationary</b> <b>universes</b> with no-boundary conditions in the path integral approach to quantum gravity. In contrast to previous work, we find no evidence for any limit to how large the anisotropies can become, although for increasing anisotropies {{the shape of the}} instantons becomes significantly different from Hawking's original no-boundary instanton. In all cases an inflationary phase is reached, with the anisotropies decaying away. Larger anisotropies are associated with a much larger imaginary part of the action, implying that the highly anisotropic branches of the wavefunction are heavily suppressed. Interestingly, the presence of anisotropies causes the wavefunction to become classical much more slowly than for isotropic <b>inflationary</b> <b>universes.</b> We derive the associated scaling of the WKB classicality conditions both numerically and analytically.

In 1982-1983, Steinhardt, Linde and Alexander Vilenkin realized that exponential expansion in the new inflation scenario, once it begins, continues without end {{in some parts of the}} universe. On the basis of this scenario, Linde proposed a model of a self-reproducing <b>inflationary</b> <b>universe</b> consisting of different parts. These parts are exponentially large and uniform, because of inflation.

This allows us to compute the primordial bispectrum for a universe which started in a non-geometric holographic phase, using perturbative QFT calculations. Strikingly, for a class of models specified by a three-dimensional super-renormalisable QFT, the primordial bispectrum is of exactly the factorisable equilateral form with f_nl^eq= 5 / 36, irrespective {{of the details of}} the dual QFT.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{properties}} and limitations {{associated with the}} existence of particle, visual, and event horizons in cosmology in general and in <b>inflationary</b> <b>universes</b> in particular, carefully distinguishing them from `Hubble horizons'. It explores to what extent one {{might be able to}} probe conditions beyond the visual horizon (which is close in size to the present Hubble radius), thereby showing that visual horizons place major limits on what are observationally testable aspects of a multiverse, if such exists. Indeed these limits largely prevent us from observationally proving a multiverse either does or does not exist. We emphasize that event horizons play no role at all in observational cosmology, even in the multiverse context, despite some claims to the contrary in the literature.

5000|$|These {{observations}} {{became the}} main ingredients {{of the first}} version of the <b>inflationary</b> <b>universe</b> theory proposed by Alan Guth in 1980. This theory, now called the [...] "Old inflation theory", was {{based on the assumption that}} the universe was initially hot. It then experienced the cosmological phase transitions and was temporarily stuck in a supercooled metastable vacuum state (a false vacuum). The universe then expanded exponentially - [...] "inflated" [...] - until the false vacuum decayed and the universe became hot again. This idea attracted much attention because it could provide a unique solution to many difficult problems of the standard Big Bang theory. In particular, it could explain why the universe is so large and so uniform. However, as Guth immediately realized, this scenario did not quite work as intended: the decay of the false vacuum would make the universe extremely inhomogeneous.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{graduate}} student, Farhi invented the jet variable [...] "Thrust" [...] {{which is used}} to describe how particles in high energy accelerator collisions come out in collimated streams.

At CERN, he and Larry Abbott proposed an (almost viable) model in which quarks, leptons, and massive gauge bosons are composite. [...] At MIT, with Robert Jaffe, he worked out many of the properties of a possibly stable super dense form of matter called ``Strange Matter" [...] and with Charles Alcock and Angela Olinto he studied the properties of ``Strange Stars", compact objects made of strange matter. His interest then shifted to general relativity and he and Alan Guth studied the classical and quantum prospects of creating a new <b>inflationary</b> <b>universe</b> in a laboratory today.

Gravitational interactions, in this case, circumvent (but do not violate) the {{first law of thermodynamics}} (energy conservation) and the second law of thermodynamics (entropy and the arrow of time problem). However, while there is consensus that this solves the initial conditions problem, some have disputed this, as it is much more likely that the Universe came about by a quantum fluctuation. Don Page was an outspoken critic of inflation because of this anomaly. He stressed that the thermodynamic arrow of time necessitates low entropy initial conditions, which would be highly unlikely. According to them, rather than solving this problem, the inflation theory aggravates it [...] - [...] the reheating {{at the end of the}} inflation era increases entropy, making it necessary for the initial state of the Universe to be even more orderly than in other Big Bang theories with no inflation phase.|$|E

40|$|One {{proposal}} for dS/CFT {{is that the}} Hartle-Hawking (HH) wave function in the large volume limit {{is equal to the}} partition function of a Euclidean CFT deformed by various operators. All saddle points defining the semiclassical HH wave function in cosmology have a representation in which their interior geometry is part of a Euclidean AdS domain wall with complex matter fields. We compute the wave functions of scalar and tensor perturbations around homogeneous isotropic complex saddle points, turning on single scalar field matter only. We compare their predictions for the spectra of CMB perturbations with those of a different dS/CFT proposal based on the analytic continuation of <b>inflationary</b> <b>universes</b> to real asymptotically AdS domain walls. We find the predictions of both bulk calculations agree to first order in the slow roll parameters, but there is a difference at higher order which, we argue, is a signature of the HH state of the fluctuations.
