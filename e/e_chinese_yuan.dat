While both central and local governments in China have significantly increased financial inputs into the two newly established health insurance schemes: new cooperative medical scheme (NCMS) for the rural population, and urban resident basic health insurance (URBMI), the cost of healthcare in China has also been rising rapidly at the annual rate of 17. 0 %% over the period {{of the past two decades}} years. The total health expenditure increased from 74. 7 billion <b>Chinese</b> <b>yuan</b> in 1990 to 1998 billion <b>Chinese</b> <b>yuan</b> in 2010, while average health expenditure per capital reached the level of 1490. 1 <b>Chinese</b> <b>yuan</b> per person in 2010, rising from 65. 4 <b>Chinese</b> <b>yuan</b> per person in 1990.
