5|$|On October 16, {{with the}} ship's coal stores running low, Captain Budington {{decided to run}} the Polaris aground near Etah. Having lost much of their bedding, clothing, and food when it was haphazardly jettisoned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> on October 12, the {{remaining}} 14 men were in poor condition to face another winter. They built a hut from lumber salvaged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> and on October 24, extinguished the ship's boilers to conserve coal. The bilge pumps stopped for good, and the ship heeled over on her side, half out of water. Fortunately, the Etah Inuit helped the men survive the winter. After wintering ashore, the crew built two boats from salvaged wood <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> and on June 3 the crew sailed south. They were spotted and rescued in July by the whaler Ravenscraig, and returned home via Scotland.|$|E

5|$|On October27, the S/V Fantome, a schooner, last {{reported}} {{its location}} {{to the south}} of Guanaja, while trying to escape the brunt of the storm.

5|$|The VOC {{authorities}} salvaged as much {{as possible}} from the beached Meermin. They recovered nearly 300 firearms, gunpowder and musket balls, compasses and five bayonets; they auctioned cables, ropes and other items <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> on the shore. Meermin was left to break up where she grounded.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Puglia {{had been}} {{assigned}} to patrol the Dalmatian coast. On 11 July 1920, men <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> became involved in the unrest in Split. During a violent confrontation with a group of Croats, the ship's captain and a sailor were shot and killed. Puglia was sold for scrapping on 22 March 1923. While the ship was being dismantled, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini donated the ship's bow section to the writer and ardent nationalist Gabriele D'Annunzio, who had it installed at his estate as part of the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{with this}} knowledge, the group, now led by Dolarhyde, prepares {{to attack the}} aliens' {{grounded}} mother ship. Meanwhile, Jake returns to his old gang and persuades them to join the fight. After the humans maneuver the aliens into a ground battle, Jake and Ella board the ship and free the captives, but Jake is captured. Dolarhyde rescues him, and both men escape <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> after killing the alien responsible for Alice's death. As the remaining aliens are taking off in their damaged craft, Ella sacrifices herself by entering the ship's core and destroying it by using Jake's wrist gauntlet as a bomb, obliterating the ship.|$|E

5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried to and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> in tenders, {{which can be used}} as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E
5|$|Bounty {{had left}} England in 1787 {{on a mission}} to collect and {{transport}} breadfruit plants from Tahiti to the West Indies. A five-month layover in Tahiti, during which many of the men lived ashore and formed relationships with native Polynesians, proved harmful to discipline. Relations between Bligh and his crew deteriorated after he began handing out increasingly harsh punishments, criticism and abuse, Christian being a particular target. After three weeks back at sea, Christian and others forced Bligh <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> Twenty-five men remained on board afterwards, including loyalists held against their will and others for whom there was no room in the launch.|$|E
5|$|Darwin made long {{journeys}} inland with travelling companions {{from the}} locality. He {{spent much of}} the time away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> returning by prearrangement when the Beagle returned to ports where mail could be received and Darwin's notes, journals, and collections sent back to England. He had ensured that his collections were his own and they were shipped back to Henslow in Cambridge to await his return. Several others on board including FitzRoy and other officers were able amateur naturalists, and they gave Darwin generous assistance as well as making collections for the Crown, which the Admiralty placed in the British Museum.|$|E

5|$|In December 1915, Tubantia again made {{news when}} the Overseas News Agency in Berlin {{released}} a report saying that the British had seized all South America mail and parcels <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> After the United States expressed concerns about related seizures from two other Dutch ships in service to the United States— and —the British Foreign Office issued a statement that reported that contraband intended for Germany—which included four packages of rubber, and seven containers of wool—had been found among Tubantias mail.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, it was {{reported}} that only 20% of the game was complete. Numerous features {{were not included in the}} final product due to time and budget constraints. The developers originally planned to add a special weapon designed to be used underwater and acquired from Chris at the end of the eight episode, but the plot of the game changed during development and the team had to discard it. Additionally, the land in the distance that can be seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> in the first episode was originally going to be the setting of the last episode, where Jill would have found something from her past.|$|E
5|$|Integrity {{set sail}} on 8 June, heading {{south along the}} New South Wales coast. A week later she {{encountered}} heavy storms and winds while passing Cape Howe {{and was unable to}} proceed. Houstoun ordered a return to Port Jackson, which was regained on 19 June. While in port, one of Integritys crew, a sailor named William Dwyre, was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> and sent to prison for having refusing to carry out his duties while aboard. There was no sign of Contest and she was presumed lost at sea.|$|E

5|$|Karl made {{landfall}} on Norway as an extratropical storm with sustained winds near 70mph (110km/h) {{and with}} wind gusts up to 89mph (144km/h). No damages or deaths were reported, and no ships came directly {{into contact with}} Karl; the strongest winds reported were <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> Rotterdam, which reported 52mph (83km/h) sustained winds in the north Atlantic while Karl was a Category1 storm in extratropical transition.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 1817, a British sloop, William and Mary, foundered {{after hitting}} the rock islands near Flat Holm known as The Wolves (Bristol Channel). The ship {{was en route}} from Bristol to Waterford and sank within fifteen minutes. The Mate, John Outridge, and two sailors made off in the only lifeboat. Fifteen {{survivors}} were later rescued, having clung to the ship's rigging, but fifty-four other passengers were lost. Fifty of the bodies were recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> and were buried on Flat Holm.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} wreck, {{when the rain}} had subsided, Captain Holland sent members of the Rifle Corps and the York and Lancaster Regiment to {{retrieve}} some baggage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> which was stuck on the rocks and had not sunk. The operation was called off at 10:00, when First Lieutenant St. John decided that the wreck was too dangerous. The baggage that had been recovered was taken to shore.|$|E
