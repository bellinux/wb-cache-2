That night, Bart, after experimentations involving the family pets, {{steps into the}} teleporter with a fly on his arm, thinking that he will become a mutant superhero. He comes out with his normal head, but with the fly's body whilst the fly has his body. Bart enlists the help of Lisa. However, she is chased by the fly and cornered in the kitchen. Bart tries to stop the fighting, but is quickly eaten by the fly. Lisa then sees {{this as an opportunity}} to undo the process and pushes the fly into the teleporter. Bart comes out the other end, now with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> on his real body. Homer then pulls out an axe and angrily chases Bart for using the device.|$|E

In addition, a piece of the upright assembly, most likely a tie rod, penetrated the helmet visor, which was a new, thinner version, above his right eye. Senna sustained fatal skull fractures, brain injuries and a ruptured temporal artery.|$|E
500|$|Elagabalus' grandmother, Julia Maesa, took {{advantage}} of the discontent of the soldiers and spent from her wealth to champion [...] Elagabalus as the rightful heir to the empire. Elagabalus, chief priest of the god Elagabal, was proclaimed emperor by the soldiers of Legio III Gallica (Gallic Third Legion) at their camp in Raphanea on 16 May 218. In response, Macrinus sent one of his generals, Ulpius Julianus, with a small cavalry force to quell the rebellious soldiers. The cavalry defected and killed Ulpius Julianus, sending <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> to Macrinus in Antioch. The decisive battle took place less than a month later.|$|E
500|$|After lunch, Harvey {{accelerated}} {{after the}} second new ball was taken, and 80 minutes into the middle session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. Harvey's knock had taken 177 minutes and included 14 fours. The partnership yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was eventually out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted sweep. His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> in disappointment. Harvey ended as the first Australian left-hander to score a century on his Ashes debut, in an innings noted for powerful driving {{on both sides of}} the wicket. The innings and the high rate of scoring helped to swing the match into a balanced position when Australia were finally dismissed for 458. In the second innings, Harvey took two noted catches, including one where he bent over to catch the ball at ankle height while running. Fingleton said that it [...] "was the catch of the season—or, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [...] ".|$|E

500|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} to find his fluency against the bowling. Yardley took the new ball {{in an attempt to}} trouble the batsmen with extra pace, but instead, Loxton began to settle in. The Australian lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and hit three fours off a subsequent Pollard over. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the middle session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. He had taken 177 minutes and hit 14 fours. Loxton then dominated the scoring in a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. The century stand yielded 105 runs in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted sweep. His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> in disappointment. Nevertheless, it was an innings noted for powerful driving {{on both sides of the}} wicket, and Harvey's fast scoring helped to wrest the match back from England's firm control. O'Reilly said the innings was one of [...] "no inhibitions...completely unspoiled by any preconceived plan to eliminate any particular shot". He added that it was [...] "the very mirror of truth in the batting art", [...] "delightfully untrammeled by the scourage of good advice or any other handicapping influence", and deemed Harvey's innings to be most pleasing he had seen since Stan McCabe's 232 at Trent Bridge in 1938.|$|E

2500|$|Producer David Puttnam viewed {{footage from}} a 1924 film of Liddell and Abrahams while researching the film with {{scriptwriter}} Colin Welland and Liddell's unorthodox running style as {{portrayed in the}} film, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> and his mouth wide open, is also said to be accurate. At an athletics championship in Glasgow, a visitor watching the 440 yard final in which Liddell {{was a long way}} behind the leaders {{at the start of the}} last lap (of a 220-yard track) remarked to a Glasgow native that Liddell would be hard put to win the race. The Glaswegian merely replied, [...] "His head's no' back yet." [...] Liddell then threw <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> and with mouth wide open caught and passed his opponents to win the race. In the 1945 report of his death The Guardian wrote [...] "He is remembered among lovers of athletics as probably the ugliest runner who ever won an Olympic championship. When he appeared in the heats of the 400m at Paris in 1924 his huge sprawling stride, his head thrown back and his arms clawing the air, moved the Americans and other sophisticated experts to ribald laughter." [...] Rival Harold Abrahams said in response to criticism of Liddell's style: [...] "People may shout their heads off about his appalling style. Well, let them. He gets there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wei Yan {{was left}} with only his son(s) and a few followers. They fled towards Hanzhong Commandery. Yang Yi ordered Ma Dai to give chase.

Yang Yi trampled on Wei Yan's head and said, [...] "You {{inferior}} slave! Now, can you still commit evil?" [...] Wei Yan's family members and close relatives were also executed. Before Wei Yan's death, Jiang Wan had led divisions of the imperial guards from Chengdu to deal with the conflict. They had travelled for about 10 li (about three miles) when they received news of Wei Yan's death, after which they returned to Chengdu.|$|E
2500|$|The Cirith Ungol stair ledge {{was built}} as a wet weather set on a squash court in a hotel in Queenstown. In November 24 1999, Sean Astin's close-ups in the Cirith Ungol set were shot in the filming of the first Return of the King shots. Andy Serkis (Gollum) had not been cast yet. The set {{remained}} standing on the squash court and it wasn't until a year later on November 30th, 2000, that Elijah Wood's first close-ups were actually shot on that ledge. This would become a general failsafe measure if the weather disrupted the shooting schedule. On Wood and the second Cirith Ungol shoot, Peter Jackson stated, [...] "A year later, we {{were back in the}} squash court, and this time the heat was on Elijah. He had to get <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> into a scene that had been half-filmed so long ago.

2500|$|The {{character}} {{first appeared}} in the Defenders of the Realm cartoon and Mythologies as a tall, bald figure wearing an teal-colored bodysuit under a black tabard adorned with ornamental spikes on the shoulders, accented by a yin-yang symbol on the sternum. Designed by Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, this style was carried over into Mortal Kombat 4, but for Deadly Alliance, the first release following Tobias' 2000 departure from Midway, Quan Chi's design was minimized with him going shirtless and revealing a well-built physique with only a black bandolier across his chest, in addition to simple black trousers and knee-high boots, with Shinnok's amulet usually attached to his belt; this has remained his primary template in all his MK appearances thereafter, while his first design returned as an alternate costume in several games. In conceptual sketches by Deadly Alliance character designer Allen Ditzig, Quan Chi was seen brandishing a [...] "mysterious living weapon"—a staff topped with a grotesque head capable of spewing green mist and flies from its mouth. Though the staff was cut from the game, its concept was used in the creation of Drahmin, one of whose offensive moves involved shooting flies at his opponent. The one element of Quan Chi's design that has remained unchanged is his albino skin tone, with simple parallel black stripes extending upward from his eyelids and extending over {{the top of his head}} in his first appearances, then enhanced in Deadly Alliance and onward with an extensive collection of red tattoo-like markings on <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>back</b> and arms, in addition to an elliptical red gem planted in the center of his forehead.|$|E
