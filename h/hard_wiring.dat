Moore studies computerese so he uses a computer's <b>hard</b> <b>wiring</b> (its fixed physical components) as a metaphor for the archetypal level of the human psyche. Personal experiences influence the access to the archetypal level of the human psyche, but personalized ego consciousness can be likened to computer software.|$|E

50|$|The {{registers}} {{were made}} entirely from discrete components. The exchange had about 20 local registers and 12 incoming registers, each register containing nine double units, which were hinged {{and could be}} lowered for easier access. These units, unlike the common control, were hard-wired. However, a unit could be changed by breaking straps at the rear and then rewiring them, {{but it was a}} lengthy process taking about an hour to change just one unit on one register. A subscriber was connected to the local register using the normal reed switching as the local registers were connected to the C switches. However, they communicated directly to the common control translator via <b>hard</b> <b>wiring.</b>|$|E
50|$|Users {{who wish}} to keep a low profile, can opt for the {{concealed}} display unit sold by Valentine Research directly on their website. Together with <b>hard</b> <b>wiring</b> the device to the vehicle fuse box (which eliminates the traditional power cord throughout the vehicle cabin) a stealth installation is achieved. The main unit still receives and process all signals, but the display is projected in the concealed display mounted discreetly anywhere in the vehicle interior. This helps, especially at night so others {{can not see the}} readout other than the driver. Some users even elect to install a kill switch so they can shut off the device without accessing the main unit. There is also a remote audio kit available that allows connection to headphones or speaker and can turn the main unit on or off as well as having a button that functions like the one on the main unit.The newest feature that can be added to the V1 unit is the V1connection which works with all V1's, but its full capability is available only from V1s with ESP. (Check for the ESP logo on the front panel below the Control Knob.) On pre-ESP V1s, or when using a Pre-ESP Concealed Display or Remote Audio Adapter, your handheld will serve as a wireless remote display of all of V1's front-panel warnings, but other functions and screens are unavailable.|$|E
30|$|Recently, {{the advance}} of {{wireless}} communication technology makes a huge contribution to road transportation. It breaks the limitation in transmitting data, flexibility, range, speed, and no <b>hard</b> <b>wiring</b> is required. Therefore, intelligent transportation systems uses the advantageous of wireless communication to improve the traffic safety and efficiency. The fully autonomous system of road transportation can be basically made in practice by integrating wireless communication with a current autonomous vehicle.|$|E

We observe {{the need for the}} application to be independent of specific services and present the WSML, a management layer placed in between the application and the world of web services. In this paper we identify the requirements for this layer to realise the dynamic selection and integration of services, client-side management of services, and support for rules that govern the selection, integration and composition. We show how dynamic AOP is ideally suited to implement the core functionality of the WSML using the JAsCo dynamic aspectoriented language to conduct the experiments...|$|E

40|$|Case {{histories}} {{of a mother}} and her two children are reported. The mother was a recovered alcoholic. She and her two children, both of whom had symptoms that are typical of autistic spectrum disorder, had dysautonomia. All had intermittently abnormal erythrocyte transketolase studies indicating abnormal thiamine pyrophosphate homeostasis. Both children had unusual concentrations of urinary arsenic. All had symptomatic improvement with diet restriction and supplementary vitamin therapy but quickly relapsed after ingestion of sugar, milk, or wheat. The stress of a heavy metal burden, superimposed on existing genetic or epigenetic risk factors, may be important in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder when in combination. Dysautonomia has been associated with several diseases, including autism, without a common etiology.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} design is established {{for a general}} purpose manipulator system {{which can be used}} interchangeably on the shuttle and station and can be transferred back and forth between them. Control of the manipulator is accomplished by <b>hard</b> <b>wiring</b> from internal control stations in the shuttle or station. A variety of shuttle and station manipulator operations are considered including servicing the Large Space Telescope; however, emphasis is placed on unloading modules from the shuttle and assembling the space station. Simulation studies on foveal stereoscopic viewing and manipulator supervisory computer control have been accomplished to investigate the feasibility of their use in the manipulator system. The basic manipulator system consists of a single 18. 3 m long, 7 degree of freedom (DOF), electrically acutated main boom with an auxiliary 3 DOF electrically actuated, extendible 18. 3 m maximum length, lighting, and viewing boom.

40|$|Wireless {{technology}} {{refers to}} signal transmission such as microwave, infrared (IR), laser beams, and radio frequency (RF) {{in which the}} transmitting medium is wireless. Until recently, wireless applications were limited to specialized cases in select industries and research laboratories. Most commercial applications today are directly associated with vast, growing industries: cellular telephones, computer local area networks (LANs), and computer wide- area networks (WANs). The rising cost of <b>hard</b> <b>wiring</b> signals in manufacturing facilities along with the significant advances in digital and communications technologies have allowed the wireless technology to emerge as an attractive and cost-effective alternative. In this paper, technical issues associated with two applications will be described in which wireless systems have been successfully developed and applied by a team from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). These wireless applications demonstrate the technical challenges and benefits realized by wireless technologies. A more comprehensive wireless concept aimed at automating large-scale manufacturing facilities in a unified approach using wireless links will also be discussed...|$|E

In contrast, PV modules are marketed with lifetimes of 20 years or more. No commitment is normally made to the lifetime of the associated dc wiring by the system supplier. In building integrated PV system's in particular a dc connection failure will often necessitate a difficult repair, usually at a prohibitive cost. Historically, to ensure a reliable dc connection, <b>hard</b> <b>wiring</b> between modules in a facade for example has been used.

40|$|The University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences Schools are {{currently}} in the planning stage of developing an Integrated Advanced Information Management System (IAIMS). The planning phase of this project attends to the unique opportunities that are found at the flagship campus of a large state university system.

Additionally, UW-Madison has an organizational culture with a strong tradition of faculty governance, which provides a very desirable and flexible decision-making environment for a cross-discipline collaborative information management initiative. Development of a shared IAIMS vision conflicts with a governance model that most directly supports intradepartmental decision-making.

40|$|International audienceWe {{examine whether}} the {{frequency}} of amino acids across an organism's proteome is primarily determined by optimization to function or others factors, such as {{the structure of the}} genetic code. Considering all available proteins together, we first point out that {{the frequency of}} amino acid in a proteome negatively correlates with its mass, suggesting that the genome preserves a fundamental distribution ruled by simple energetics. Given the universality of such distributions, one can use outliers, cysteine and, leucine, to identify amino acids that deviate from this simple rule for functional purposes and examine those functions. We quantify the strength of such selection as the entropic cost outliers pay to defy the mass-frequency relation. Codon degeneracy of an amino acid partially explains the correlation between mass and frequency: light amino acids being typically encoded by highly degenerate codon families, with the exception of arginine. While degeneracy may be a factor in <b>hard</b> <b>wiring</b> the relationship between mass and frequency in proteomes, it does not provide a complete explanation. By examining extremophiles, we are able to show that this law weakens with temperature, likely due to protein stability considerations, thus the environment is essential...|$|E
40|$|Semioticians ’ {{interests}} in non-verbal communication underlie {{their interest in}} primates. Most of the family Hominidae, and humans for much of their evolutionary time, have not been the highly verbal beings we are now. It {{is the focus of}} these lectures to argue that it is the development of human society than pushed us from highly social, interactive, but non-verbal beings into what we are today. It is not just a long slow evolutionary pilgrimage building on a foundation of genetically-based <b>hard</b> <b>wiring,</b> but the neuromuscular, cognitive, developmental interaction fostered by our intensely stimulated and complex social lives that have allowed us to develop our incredible communication system. Have you ever considered that if we share 98. point something of a chimpanzee’s DNA, how much more we share with Australopithecus who only separated from our line half as long ago? But it is unlikely that these forms were verbally successful. Semioticians study primates to look for patterns in their communicative systems that will inform us about ours. I am arguing that {{over the last two decades}}, one pattern has become increasingly evident. Complex verbal communication is based on the socializing process, and a discussion of nine books on primates published over the last two decades is providing the data to suppor...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the first}} {{electronics}} components used in an automobile was the fuse. Additional features were developed such as engine management systems. These additional features increased the amount of wiring in a wiring harness. This contributed towards the necessity to develop the bus structure in the 1980 s. The de‐facto bus structure in the automotive industry became CAN (Controller Area Network). By using a bus structure this resulted in less <b>hard</b> <b>wiring</b> being required {{in the production of}} an automobile which further lead to a reduction in production cost. CAN is an event-triggered protocol which denotes it is non‐deterministic and it has a theoretical bandwidth limit of 1 Mbit. The practical limit is nearer 500 kbit. During the 80 ’s and 90 ’s, automotive electronics development increased; this was primarily driven by increased development of safety features such as ABS (Anti‐lock Braking System). The {{increase in the number of}} features and nodes caused increased traffic on the bus. The CAN protocol will be unable to meet the requirements for the extra applications. This resulted in the development of FlexRay in 2000 by a consortium originally consisting of amongst others BMW, Daimler Chrysler, Freescale and Philips. This protocol can implement both time‐triggered and event‐triggered messages, determinism, fault tolerance, redundancy and can operate at 10 Mbit. Newly developed technologies have high initial costs therefore being initially more expensive than established technologies. This could result in it being financially unworkable to replace a complete automotive bus with FlexRay. FlexRay can possibly be used for mission critical applications such as powertrain applications, while other protocols such as CAN and LIN (Local Interconnect Network) may possibly be used for less critical applications. The aim of this research is to design and develop a framework that allows the implementation of a CAN application on the FlexRay protocol, without degrading the applications performance...|$|E
