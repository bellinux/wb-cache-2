50|$|The {{timing of}} {{flashing}} depends somewhat on temperature, but the <b>flash</b> <b>pattern</b> {{of a male}} P. carolinus is typically four to eight very bright flashes emitted over two to four seconds, followed by a dark period of eight to 12 seconds.

50|$|Photuris versicolor, is {{a species}} complex of firefly common {{throughout}} the Eastern United States. Fireflies famously use flash-based visual signalling to find mates {{at a distance}} and each species of firefly has a unique <b>flash</b> <b>pattern</b> sequence that males and females {{of the same species}} use to identify one another. Researchers have documented the ability of female P. versicolor to hunt males of other firefly species by mimicking the flash responses of female fireflies of other species. Photuris versicolor appear to target males, such as Photinus pyralis, specifically for the lucibufagin steroids that their prey produce.|$|E

40|$|When a {{light spot}} is flashed {{repeatedly}} during sac-cade, a dotted line called a phantom array (PA) is perceived. When light spots {{are placed on}} a vertical line and the <b>flashing</b> <b>pattern</b> is changed quickly during saccade, the <b>flashing</b> <b>pattern</b> is expanded to a spatial pattern by the effect of eye movement, and a two-dimensional image is per-ceived. The authors have proposed a visual information presentation method based on this phenomenon. A crucial issue in information presentation by this method is the time relation between the perceived PA and the eye movement. Consequently, this study examines the time relation be-tween the perception and the eye movement. The time course of perceived position for repeatedly flashing stimu-lus is investigated by presenting light spots in the vertical position. It is found that the locus of the perceived light spot starts to curve {{at the start of}} saccade in the direction oppo-site to the saccade, and returns to the vertical direction when the saccade ends.

50|$|Many {{existing}} installations {{that did not}} include visual signals were retrofitted with strobe plates. These retrofit plates would allow for the easy installation of a strobe without replacing the audible signal.

50|$|The {{pickerel}} frog is {{a medium}} sized gray or tan frog marked with seven to twenty-one irregular rectangular dark brown spots which are oriented in two columns down its back. The distinctive rectangular spots of the pickerel frog may blend {{together to form}} a long rectangle along the back. All leopard frogs have circular spots. In addition, pickerel frogs have prominent dorsolateral ridges that are unbroken. Another important distinguishing mark is the orange or yellow <b>flash</b> <b>pattern</b> found on the inner surface of the hind legs of pickerel frogs. The frog must be picked up to examine this, as the legs cover the coloration otherwise. The plains leopard frog (Lithobates blairi) exhibits this coloration as well, but the dorsolateral ridges are interrupted and inset medially in that species. The front toes of pickerel frogs are not webbed, a morphological characteristic for some frogs of the genus Rana and some frogs of the genus Lithobates. This allows pickerel frogs to be fit for terrestrial life.|$|E

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to identify video shots of the same scene where camera flash lights are observed, and the method has been tested by using it to detect such shots from a large TV video archive. Camera flashes are often used in impressive scenes, such as interviews of important persons. Because such scenes are broadcasted repeatedly on various TV programs, a method for detecting them is a promising ap-proach for semantic video indexing. The proposed identifica-tion method is invariant to the differences in viewpoint, illu-mination or any other visual environment because it depends on comparison between temporal occurrence patterns of flash lights. Furthermore, because each <b>flash</b> <b>pattern</b> is represented with a binary array, the comparison requires low computing cost. These advantages mean that the proposed method can be considered to provide semantic and efficient video analysis. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe decay {{kinetics}} of Y⋅Z {{have been}} detected using time-resolved EPR to obtain the half-times of the S-state transitions in the oxygen-evolving complex of spinach PSII membranes. The half-times were determined by deconvoluting the signal IIvf kinetics for the individual S-state contributions observed {{in a series of}} single turnover flashes. The Kok parameters required for deconvolution were estimated from the oxygen <b>flash</b> <b>pattern</b> measured in situ using nitroxide-based EPR oximetry. The half-times of the individual S-state transitions in PSII membranes were found to be: 70 μs for S 0 →S 1, 110 μs for Sl→S 2, 180 μs for S 2 →S 3, and 1400 μs for S 3 →S 0. Comparison of the S-state transition kinetics in PSII membranes with those of thylakoids shows that the S-state transitions are slowed in PSII membranes with the largest effect being observed for the S 3 →S 0 transition.

40|$|PURPOSE: The serial {{reaction}} time (SRT) task {{has been widely}} used to investigate whether sequence learning can occur without awareness. However, {{in most of the}} SRT tasks, the stimuli can be perceived consciously, and the question is whether people can acquire perceptual or motor sequence knowledge at the unconscious level. It remains unclear whether people can acquire perceptual knowledge when the stimuli in a sequence are invisible or subliminal. 	METHODS: In this study, we used continuous flash suppression (CFS) method to explore whether people can learn the serial order of subliminal stimuli. During the familiarization phase, distinct <b>flash</b> <b>patterns</b> were presented to the dominant eye and novel symbols of four triplets were presented to the other eye in the subliminal condition, while the <b>flash</b> <b>patterns</b> and symbols were presented simultaneously in both eyes in the visible control condition. During the test phase, a continuous stream of 12 visible symbols was presented to the same eye as in the familiarization phase in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task, and participants were asked to press a key when a target symbol was presented. 	RESULTS: The results showed that the detection latency was faster when the target was the third symbol of the triplets than it was the first symbol of the triplets in the CFS condition, but there was no such location effect in the control condition. 	CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that perceptual sequence learning can occur even when the stimuli are invisible, although people do not express sequence learning effects when the stimuli are visible. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a {{population}} based evolutionary optimization methodology called firefly algorithm (FFA) is {{applied for the}} optimization of system coefficients of the infinite impulse response (IIR) system identification problem. FFA is inspired by the <b>flash</b> <b>pattern</b> and characteristics of fireflies. In FFA technique, behaviour of flashing firefly towards its competent mate is structured. In this algorithm attractiveness depends on brightness of light and a bright firefly feels more attraction for the brighter one. For this optimization problem, brightness varies inversely proportional to the error fitness value, so {{the position of the}} brightest firefly gives the optimum result corresponding to the least error fitness in multidimensional search space. Incorporation of different control parameters in basic movement equation results in balancing of exploration and exploitation of search space. The proposed FFA based system identification approach has alleviated from inherent drawbacks of premature convergence and stagnation, unlike genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE).

40|$|This report {{describes}} a field study that {{was performed to}} provide better information about how warning lamps for emergency vehicles affect the vision and driving performance of surrounding drivers, with special emphasis on understanding any ways in which those lamps might have negative effects on safety. The situations of most concern for this study are those in which an emergency professional is standing or working near a parked emergency vehicle and is therefore {{at risk of being}} struck by passing traffic. In such situations, warning lamps on the emergency vehicle can cause glare for the drivers of passing vehicles, possibly reducing their ability to see and avoid collisions with pedestrians near the emergency vehicle. The present study was designed to address questions in three primary areas: 1. Nighttime glare from warning lamps. How do warning lamp characteristics such as intensity, color, and <b>flash</b> <b>pattern</b> affect the tendency for the lamps to reduce the visibility of pedestrians in an emergency scene? How are those effects influenced by the degree of retroreflective marking of the pedestrian? 2. Effects on driving performance.

40|$|We sampled a {{population}} of signaling Photuris versicolor quadrifulgens fireflies to quantify the variation i flash patterns emitted by males. Males produced five distinct flash patterns during their mate-searching flights. Four of the patterns consisted of two to five equal-intensity pulses and the fifth pattern type was a flicker, a group of rapid modulations in intensity. We found that the proportions of each pattern remained relatively constant from night to night throughout the season. The different flash patterns produced varied significantly with time of night; patterns having fewer pulses occurred earlier in the evening. Local den-sity, an estimate of competition, did not significantly correlate with <b>flash</b> <b>pattern</b> type. On consecutive missions, individuals changed their flash types with a mean probability of O. 12 (over all males), and they usually switched between patterns differing by a single pulse (from a two- to a three-pulse pattern, from a three- to a two-pulse pattern, etc.). The nightly temporal changes in flash patterns {{may be related to}} tradeoffs between female availability and energetic costs of signaling or the changes may be related to increased predation risk from visual predators.

40|$|Photoacoustic {{signals from}} intact leaves, {{produced}} upon excitation with single-turnover flashes, {{were shown to}} be dependent on their position in the flash sequence. Compared to the signal obtained from the first flash, all the others were time-shifted and had increased amplitudes. The signal from the third flash had the largest deviation, whereas that from the second flash deviated only minimally. The amplitude difference of the signals relative to that from the first flash was measured at a convenient time point (5 ms) and showed oscillations of period 4, similar to the O 2 -evolution pattern from algae. These oscillations were strongly damped, tending to a steady state from about the seventh flash on. The extra photoacoustic signal (relative to the first flash) was shown to be inhibited by 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea, heat treatment, or water infiltration. Its change with flash number, its saturation with increasing flash energy, and the above inhibition criteria indicate that it originates in pulsed O 2 evolution. The sound wave produced by the first flash, however, arose by a photothermal mechanism only, as shown by its linear dependence on the flash intensity and insensitivity to the above treatments. The above <b>flash</b> <b>pattern</b> demonstrates that the photocycle of the S states (i. e., positive charge accumulation before two water molecules can be oxidized in a concerted way to produce molecular oxygen) occurs in intact leaves. It proves the applicability of the photoacoustic method for mechanistic studies of O 2 evolution in leaves under physiological conditions. Water content of leaves is readily measured by this method...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{dynamic of}} courtship signaling systems {{is driven by}} the interaction between male trait distributions and female preferences. This interaction is complex because females may choose mates based on multiple components of male signals, and female preference functions may vary depending on mate availability, female reproductive state, and environmental conditions. In Photinus fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae), flying males emit bioluminescent flash signals to locate sedentary females, which reply selectively to attractive male flash signals with their own response flash. In this study, we first examined temporal variation in the paired-pulse flash patterns produced by Photinus greeni males in the field and found significant among-male variation (; 70 % of total variation) in interpulse intervals (IPIs). There was no significant relationship between male IPI and spermatophore size, suggesting that P. greeni male courtship signals do not provide females with reliable indicators of male material resources. In laboratory playback experiments, we presented P. greeni females with simulated flash signals to assess how IPI and pulse duration independently affected the likelihood of female flash response. We also examined the effects of female body mass and time during the mating season on female preference functions, hypothesizing that females would be less discriminating when they were heavier (more fecund) and when mate availability declined. We found that P. greeni females discriminated among signals within their species ’ range based primarily on <b>flash</b> <b>pattern</b> IPI. Neither the time during the mating season nor female weight altered female preference functions for IPI, although season did influence female response to pulse duration.
