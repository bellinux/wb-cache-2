25|$|Bose {{advocated}} complete {{unconditional independence}} for India, whereas the All-India Congress Committee wanted it in phases, through Dominion status. Finally {{at the historic}} Lahore Congress convention, the Congress adopted Purna Swaraj (complete independence) as its motto. Gandhi was given rousing receptions wherever <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>after</b> Gandhi-Irwin pact. Subhas Chandra Bose, travelling with Gandhi in these endeavours, later wrote that the great enthusiasm he saw among the people enthused him tremendously and that he doubted if any other leader {{anywhere in the world}} received such a reception as Gandhi did during these travels across the country. He was imprisoned and expelled from India. Defying the ban, he came back to India and was imprisoned again.|$|E
25|$|In Feb. 1992, {{he scored}} a memorable 131 against the touring West Bengal {{side in a}} 3-day match at Dhaka. Batting first the {{tourists}} scored 384/5 (decl.) left-handed No. 3 Raja Venkat scored 154, another more well known left-hander Sourav Ganguly made 129. In reply, the home side was struggling at 77/4. At this stage, Moni entered the wicket. With ever reliable Aminul Islam, he put on 104 for the 5th wicket. There was good understanding between the two, as {{they were involved in}} a number of vital partnerships down the order for Bangladesh. Aminul Islam went for 55, but Moni carried on ruthlessly demolishing the opposition bowling. Bangladesh eventually reached 302, thanks mainly to 131 by Moni. Aided by the tail enders, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>after</b> the WB bowling. He was especially harsh on the slow bowlers, lofting them for a number of sixes. As the national stadium crowd were basking in afternoon sunshine (it was early spring), they also enjoyed batting of the highest class.|$|E
25|$|Montoya {{dominated}} the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard in Indianapolis on July 26 after starting from second position. It {{was the first}} time in his NASCAR career that he scored bonus points for leading the most laps in the event, however, he was penalized with a drive-through penalty after his last pit stop for speeding in the pit lane. His healthy 5-second advantage over the rest of the field was gone and he ended up finishing 11th. After a pit lane error Montoya slipped back from his top-10 spot at the Sunoco Red Cross Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway. However, a good pit call meant Montoya pitted prior to a caution which meant he started the next restart in 4th. After slipping back to 5th he made up good ground to pass Bowyer second. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>after</b> leader Hamlin but could not catch him. The second-place finish was his first top 5 of the year and joint best on an oval. At the Carfax 400 at Michigan, Montoya posted the 3rd quickest qualifying time just 0.087 seconds off of the pole. In the race Montoya gradually slipped back and grew frustrated with crew chief Brian Pattie as the car was getting tighter and tighter, Kasey Kahne and Montoya made contact when the 9 car got loose and its splitter touched the 42's right rear tire. The contact resulted in Montoya's right rear going flat and he lost a lap on pit road fixing the minor body damage. However he shortly got the lucky dog and raced up to 20th before dropping back to 23rd, Montoya gained 4 positions on the last lap as others ran out of fuel, resulting in a 19th-place finish which at least kept Juan 7th in points.|$|E

500|$|Cornwallis was criticised for {{the slow}} pace with which <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>after</b> Humbert, and {{the large number of}} troops used to capture the {{relatively}} modest French army. [...] However, supporters pointed out that all of the French force was captured, and there was no subsequent uprising. General John Moore countered some of the criticisms, noting that Cornwallis [...] "always suspected the Shannon and Dublin to be the objects , and by guarding against them in time he prevented much mischief. [...] He showed much prudence and judgment in the service." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{extended}} twice and exceeded its fundraising goal of $35,000. Estimates {{of the proceeds}} range from $83,000 to over $158,000, but the planned visitor center was never built because the war ended shortly afterward and Berlin was never informed {{what happened to the}} money. Berlin received no financial benefit beyond his ordinary sergeant's pay, but he was well compensated in publicity. He was recognized as a Broadway star wherever <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>after</b> he returned to civilian life. Along with the acclaim, however, he also [...] "received a death threat and a kidnapping threat", which he took seriously enough to purchase a bulletproof limousine and hire a bodyguard/chauffeur.|$|E

500|$|He {{looked through}} the Yellow Pages for jobs and played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said [...] " [...] was glad to do it." [...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>after</b> that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It reminded me that I am a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would never get to play these songs again." ...|$|E

Until reading {{the statements}} I had never before known that John's destructive behavior did not stop, but rather increased, in the parish to which <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>after</b> leaving my parish.

Ward, who was in London developing Map of the Human Heart, [...] only accepted the project on the third call as he at first was uninterested in doing a sequel. Twohy's script was met with Ward's derision, so he had another idea, involving Ripley's escape pod crash landing on a monastery-like satellite. Developing this pitch on his flight to Los Angeles, once Ward got with the studio executives he saw his idea approved by the studio. Ward was hired to direct Alien 3, and writer John Fasano was hired to expand his story into a screenplay. Once Twohy discovered through a journalist friend that another script was being written concurrently to his, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>after</b> Fox and eventually left the project.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, the {{development}} of Cockburn's position on global warming seemed more consistent with views usually held by those on the Right. He believed the phenomenon has not been proven {{to be caused by}} humans. In 2008 Cockburn wrote A Short History of Fear in which <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>after</b> the subject of anthropogenic global warming and later writing in Spiked that [...] "you can account for the current warming by a number of well-known factors - to do with the elliptical course of the Earth in its relationship to the sun, the axis of the Earth in the current period, and possibly the influence of solar flares." [...] He cited the statements of Martin Hertzberg that rising CO2 levels are a symptom, not a cause, of global warming, which Hertzberg asserts is the result of natural, predictable changes in the Earth's elliptic orbit. Hertzberg is a semi-retired explosives expert who does not claim to be a climatologist. The arguments given by Hertzberg and Cockburn are the famous Milankovitch cycles.|$|E
