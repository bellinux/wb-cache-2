While facial retraining therapy is more focused on treating slight synkinetic movements, mime therapy aims to increase the overall vigor of the muscles through active exercises, while {{in the process of doing}} so, teaching the face to decrease unwanted synkinetic movements.|$|E

Some studies indicate {{that the effects of}} two active compounds in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have opposite effects with respect to psychosis. While THC can induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals, CBD may reduce the symptoms caused by cannabis.|$|E

VPH models aim to integrate physiological processes across different length and time scales (multi-scale modelling). These models make possible the combination of patient-specific data with population-based representations. The objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> systemic approach which avoids a reductionist approach and seeks not to subdivide biological systems in any particular way by dimensional scale (body, organ, tissue, cells, molecules), by scientific discipline (biology, physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioengineering) or anatomical sub-system (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, etc.).|$|E
