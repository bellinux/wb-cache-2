40|$|The European Commission has {{recently}} {{launched a new}} project intended to create a Capital Markets Union. One obstacle {{in the way of}} the Commission’s vision is the current market infrastructure for holding securities. This infrastructure is inefficient because it prevents investors from <b>exercising</b> <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> and from claiming against issuers. It also exposes investors to the risk of shortfalls, which increases with the number of custodians that operate between issuers and investors. This article also shows that the regulatory regime as it stands fails to remedy this inefficiency or to contain the risk. It points to possible avenues for law reform but concludes that these, too, are unlikely to improve the situation. The conclusion is that investors should receive information about the identity of all sub-custodians that operate between them and the issuer and about their terms...|$|E
40|$|Ethnic media, {{defined by}} the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (for the ethnic program {{specifically}}) as “one, in any language, that is specifically directed to any culturally or racially distinct group other than one that is Aboriginal Canadian or from France or the British Isles” (CRTC, 1999), are emerging to offer new communicative civic spaces to ethno-cultural citizens. Studies, however, suggest that while {{they may not be}} completely disconnected from broader society, they remain largely “distinct from the dominant public sphere” (Karim, 2002). The majority are focused on a single ethnic group and develop in isolation of each other to cater to their specific group’s interests. Such an isolationist tendency is a concern in multicultural societies in that it can potentially intensify political, socio-economic, and cultural divides among older and new populations and develop “parallel societies” (Hafez, 2007) and a fragmented citizenship. Whether or not ethnic media will lead to hindering immigrants’ civic integration by raising citizens of communities rather than citizens of the broader society needs to be empirically validated. This paper, therefore, explores the distinction between mainstream and ethnic media through a comparative content analysis on coverage of the October 14 2008 Canadian federal election in English and Korean press in British Colombia, Canada. The findings suggest that in-group orientation is in fact more distinct in English media with significantly low attention given to ethnic minorities either as candidates or voters. Ethnic media, on the other hand, undertake significant citizenship education by delivering step-by-step “how-to” information about the election to immigrants who are less familiar with the Canadian political system to assist them in <b>exercising</b> <b>voting</b> <b>rights...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates voting {{preferences}} of institutional investors using the unique {{setting of the}} securities lending market. Investors restrict lendable supply and/or recall loaned shares prior to the proxy record date to <b>exercise</b> <b>voting</b> <b>rights.</b> Recall is higher for investors with greater incentives to monitor, for firms with poor performance or weak governance, and for proposals where returns to governance are likely higher. At the subsequent vote, recall is associated with less support for management and more support for shareholder proposals. Our results indicate that institutions value their vote and use the proxy process to affect corporate governance...|$|R

30|$|Such {{decisions}} {{contributed to}} increase the number of voters (Verdeil, 2012). However, the electoral law adopted in 2013 requires all citizens to register in order to be entitled to vote, which prevented many electors to vote in 2014, especially abroad due to the lack of efficient registration campaign and greater hurdles. For example, electoral observation reports (Mourakiboun, 2014) and the author’s observations in Paris show that many electors renounced to vote because they could not find their name of the electoral rolls due to flaws in the registration process. To sum up, the above suggests that electors abroad renounce to <b>exercise</b> their <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> when the “costs” of voting are too high, like electors at home (Braconnier & Dormagen, 2007), and that restrictive and/or flawed voting procedures have a greater impact abroad than at home.|$|R
