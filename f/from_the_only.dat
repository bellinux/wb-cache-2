Giotto's Stefaneschi Triptych, 1320, illustrates recursion {{in the form}} of mise en abyme; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering. Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings such as his 1917 Great Metaphysical Interior explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.|$|E

On January 21, 1950, the jury found Hiss guilty, and Nixon received hundreds of congratulatory messages, including one <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> living former President, Herbert Hoover.|$|E
5|$|The form of {{this ancient}} Greek poetry is an elegiac couplet, {{commonly}} used for epitaphs. Some English renderings are given in the table below.

Ioannis Ziogas points out that the usual English translations are far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.|$|E

5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the atrocities that Las Casas described were exaggerated or even invented, {{but this is not}} generally considered likely as Las Casas was far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> person to be deeply worried about abuse and mistreatment of the Indians. The Dominican friars Antonio de Montesinos and Pedro de Córdoba had reported extensive violence already {{in the first decade of}} the conquest of the Indies, and throughout the conquest of the Americas there were reports of abuse of the natives by friars and priests and ordinary citizens, and many massacres of indigenous people were reported in full by those who perpetrated them. Even some of Las Casas's enemies, such as Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, reported many gruesome atrocities committed against the Indians by the colonizers. All in all, modern historians tend to disregard the numerical figures given by Las Casas, but maintain that the general picture he presented of an intensely violent and abusive conquest did represent reality.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia was {{the last}} of the Commonwealth {{countries}} to enter the Empire Air Training Scheme and the first to turn out fully qualified pilots. No.25 Elementary Flying Training School at Belvedere Air Station, Salisbury, was the first school to be opened, on 25 May 1940 by Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham. It was followed by a Service School at Cranborne. In Bulawayo, an Elementary School was established at Sauerdale, although due to the unsuitability of the ground surface, it was moved to Induna, with a Service School at Kumalo. Gwelo had an Elementary School at Guinea Fowl and a Service School at Thornhill. The Elementary Schools were equipped with Tiger Moths and the Service Schools, single-engine Harvards and twin-engine Airspeed Oxfords. At Moffat, the first gunners passed out in September 1941 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Bombing and Gunnery School in Southern Rhodesia.|$|E

5|$|Wilcox was {{dismissed}} in October 2015 after a nine-match run without a win left York 21st in the table, and was succeeded {{by the former}} Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara in November. York went on a run of one win from the last 16 fixtures, and were relegated to the National League after finishing bottom of League Two in 2015–16. This {{marked the end of}} York's four-year return in the Football League. With the team 19th in the National League, Gary Mills was reappointed manager in October 2016, shortly after he {{was dismissed}} by Wrexham. McNamara remained at the club after taking on the role of chief executive. Mills was unable to stop York being relegated to the National League North {{for the first time in}} 2016–17, although they did beat Macclesfield Town in the 2017 FA Trophy Final. Mills was dismissed in September 2017, with York seventh in the National League North and 11 points away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> automatic promotion place. He was succeeded by Darlington manager Martin Gray, with Dave Penney assisting him as sporting director.|$|E

25|$|Charles {{played his}} first twenty20 match in January 2008, {{representing}} Saint Lucia in the Stanford Twenty20. Opening the batting with Keddy Lesporis, Charles managed scores of 2 and 21 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> matches {{he played in}} the competition. Later that year he debuted for the Windward Islands in the West Indies Board Cup, the regional one-day tournament. His performances weren’t sufficient to secure a place in the team’s one-day side, and in 2009 Charles played neither List A nor twenty20 cricket. However, he made his first-class debut in January that year and played eight matches for the Windward Islands in the Regional Four Day Competition. In 16 visits to the crease he accumulated 292 runs, including a single half-century, putting him seventh in the team’s list of leading run-scorers in that year’s competition.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{development in}} the later part of the 20th century was the momentum gained by the historically informed performance practice, with forerunners such as Nikolaus Harnoncourt acquiring prominence by their performances of Bach's music. His keyboard music was again rather performed on the instruments Bach was familiar with, instead of on modern pianos and 19th-century romantic organs. Ensembles playing and singing Bach's music not only kept to the instruments and the performance style of his day, they were also reduced {{to the size of}} the groups Bach used for his performances. But that was far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way Bach's music came to the forefront in the 20th century: his music was heard in versions ranging from Ferruccio Busoni's late romantic piano transcriptions, jazzy interpretations such as those by the Swingle Singers, and orchestrations such as the one opening Walt Disney's Fantasia movie, to synthesiser performances such as Wendy Carlos' Switched-On Bach recordings.|$|E
