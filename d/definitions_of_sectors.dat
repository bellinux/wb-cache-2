40|$|The {{paper is}} based on the 8 Input – Output (I-O) tables for the Indian economy {{available}} over a period of 36 years from 1968 - 69 to 2003 - 04. The technical progress (TP) {{in the context of the}} I-O tables {{is based on}} the concept of a production function defining the relationship between gross output and material inputs as well as value added at the disaggregated sectoral level. The paper attempts to answer the following questions: (i) Was the TP substantial and continuous throughout the period?; (ii) Was the rate of TP during the inward looking and outward looking growth strategy phases of the economy the same?; and (iii) Was the rate of TP at the disaggregated sectoral level almost constant over time? In order to measure the rate of TP, the available eight national I-O tables in India are first made compatible for the number, scope and <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>sectors</b> as well as for prices by converting them at constant 1993 - 94 prices. Chenery-Watanabe coefficient is used for measuring the rate of TP for different sectors across the 8 IO tables.

30|$|Given {{that both}} the size and {{composition}} <b>of</b> public <b>sector</b> employees are important in explaining the wage gap, {{it is worth noting}} that the sign of the latter makes more sense when the private sector is more involved in Health and Education, which renders the former variable, as constructed from the broad <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the government <b>sector,</b> less accurate. In order to address this concern, we have replaced the percentage of public employees constructed from the broad definition with the percentage of public employees constructed from the restricted definition (i.e., the ratio of Public Administration employees over total employment). We found that the results were very similar. A larger amount of public employees is associated to a significantly lower wage gap, while, conditional on size, the more specialization in public goods, the larger the wage gap. Therefore, the results do not seem to be driven by the specific <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> public <b>sector</b> workers.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} time series {{behaviour}} {{of the relative}} benefits <b>of</b> <b>sector</b> and regional diversification strategies, using the notion of cross-sectional dispersion introduced by Solnik and Roulet (2000). Using monthly data over the period 1987 : 1 to 2002 : 12, four sector and four regional classifications are examined in the UK. The results indicate that sector and regional dispersion indices are highly time varying and so dwarf any lower frequency cyclical components that may be present. Nonetheless, periods of high dispersion are closely followed by periods of low dispersion, suggestive of cyclical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>sector</b> and regional diversification benefits. Then, using the HP-filter we isolated the cyclical component of the various dispersion indices {{and found that the}} sector dispersion indices are generally above the regional dispersion indices. This implies that a sector diversification strategy is likely to offer greater risk reduction benefits than a regional diversification approach. Nonetheless, we find that in some periods, certain regional diversification strategies are of equal or greater benefit than certain sector approaches. The results also appear to be quite sensitive to the classifications <b>of</b> <b>sectors</b> and regions. Hence, the appropriate <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sectors</b> and regions can have important implications for sector and regional diversification strategies...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} {{in part of}} the way {{non-profit}} institutions are defined and treated in the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), {{little is known about the}} size, scope, financial base and role of this set of institutions at the international level, even though their importance is increasingly being recognised throughout the world. To remedy this significant lack of systematic information on non-profit institutions cross-nationally, the Johns Hopkins Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project has undertaken a major analysis of the economic role <b>of</b> this <b>sector</b> in twelve countries throughout the world, utilising a more meaningful <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sector</b> and an approach that is otherwise consistent with the overall thrust of the SNA system. This paper outlines the basis of the more inclusive <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the non-profit <b>sector</b> embodied in this project, the classification system formulated to structure data-gathering on this more broadly-defined sector and the data assembly strategy developed to build up key estimates of the scale, structure and revenue sources <b>of</b> the non-profit <b>sector</b> in the project countries.

All three concepts address different aspects of present developments in the organization of the economy and new ways of governance, with great implications for the restructuring of social relations, particularly in welfare. They also share a common characteristic: they are reappraisals of historically known and recognizable trends, which are put forward with great intensity, as the articulation of unprecedented change already challenging established life strategies. From the standpoint of social policy the implications are far-reaching and, most importantly, definitions become policy tools, at local, national and international level.
