50|$|Subjunctive conditionals are {{familiar}} from ordinary language. They <b>are</b> of <b>the</b> form, if A <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then B would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> or if A had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then B would have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Counterfactual conditionals <b>are</b> specifically subjunctive conditionals whose antecedents {{are in fact}} false, hence the name.

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{distinguish}} counterfactual conditionals from material conditionals, a new logical connective '>' is defined, where A > B {{can be interpreted}} as [...] "If it <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that A, then it would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that B." ...|$|R
5|$|All modern scleractinian skeletons are {{composed}} of calcium carbonate {{in the form of}} crystals of aragonite, however, a prehistoric scleractinian (Coelosimilia) had a non-aragonite skeletal structure which was composed of calcite. The structure of both simple and compound scleractinians is light and porous, rather than solid as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in the prehistoric order Rugosa. Scleractinians are also distinguished from rugosans by their pattern of septal insertion.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{can live}} {{on a wide variety}} of {{substrates}} and uses mixed-acid fermentation in anaerobic conditions, producing lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate, and carbon dioxide. Since many pathways in mixed-acid fermentation produce hydrogen gas, these pathways require the levels of hydrogen to be low, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> when E. coli lives together with hydrogen-consuming organisms, such as methanogens or sulphate-reducing bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{may have}} {{evolved from a}} {{creature}} similar to a coral-like sea squirt, whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{appeal to}} {{probability}} (or appeal to possibility) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> logical fallacy of taking something for granted {{because it would}} probably <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> (or might possibly <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case).</b> Inductive arguments lack deductive validity and must therefore be asserted or denied in the premises.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, very {{frequent}} combinations {{are often}} written in one stroke, like ddh, kv or kś. If this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the first consonant is not {{marked with a}} hal kirīma.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the writing}} {{continues}} onto the second {{side of a}} tablet {{at the point where}} it finishes off the first, so if the first side has an odd number of lines, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with tablets K, N, P, and Q, the second will start at the upper left-hand corner, and the direction of writing shifts to top to bottom.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} acidic soils, {{there is less}} calcium available, {{potentially}} leading to thinner egg shells. In such locations, pipits {{are more likely to}} select snails and similar prey with calcium-rich shells than <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in limestone terrain.|$|E
40|$|Introduction to this volume). The tree {{method has}} a number of virtues: trees are well suited to {{computational}} applications; semantically, the tree systems presented here are no less illuminating than model theory; the metatheory associated with tree formulations is often more tractable than that required in a model-theoretic setting; and last but not least <b>the</b> tree method <b>is</b> ideal for pedagogical purposes.

5|$|Martingales {{can also}} be created from {{stochastic}} processes by applying some suitable transformations, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for the homogeneous Poisson process (on the real line) resulting in a martingale called the compensated Poisson process.

5|$|The {{combination}} of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs.
