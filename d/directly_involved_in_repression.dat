40|$|Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a {{pediatric}} tumor that arises from muscle precursor cells. RMS cells express several markers of early myogenic diferentiation, but {{they fail to}} complete both diferentiation program and cell cycle arrest, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation and incomplete myogenesis. previous studies showed that eZH 2, which is <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> both diferentiation and cancer progression, is overexpressed in RMS, but a functional binding between its expression and its functional role in tumor formation or progression {{has not yet been}} demonstrated. We hypothesized that eZH 2 is a key regulator of muscular diferentiation program in RMS cells. In this study, we demonstrated that eZH 2 directly binds muscle specifc genes in RD cells. Silencing of eZH 2 promotes the recruitment of a multiprotein complex at muscle-specifc promoters, their transcriptional activation and protein expression. Moreover, we demonstrated that eZH 2 is <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> transcriptional <b>repression</b> of MyoD, the main factor promoting myogenesis. eZH 2 ablation induces MyoD activation the recovery of its binding on muscle-specifc genes.

40|$|Covalent histone post-translational {{modifications}} such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation play pivotal {{roles in}} regulating many cellular processes, including transcription, response to DNA damage, and epigenetic control. Although positive-acting post-translational modifications {{have been studied}} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, histone modifications {{that are associated with}} transcriptional repression have not been shown to occur in this yeast. Here, we provide evidence that histone sumoylation negatively regulates transcription in S. cerevisiae. We show that all four core histones are sumoylated and identify specific sites of sumoylation in histones H 2 A, H 2 B, and H 4. We demonstrate that histone sumoylation sites are <b>involved</b> <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> transcriptional <b>repression.</b> Further, while histone sumoylation occurs at all loci tested throughout the genome, slightly higher levels occur proximal to telomeres. We observe a dynamic interplay between histone sumoylation and either acetylation or ubiquitylation, where sumoylation serves as a potential block to these activating modifications. These results indicate that sumoylation is the first negative histone modification to be identified in S. cerevisiae and further suggest that sumoylation may serve as a general dynamic mark to oppose transcription...|$|R

40|$|The INK 4 A tumour {{suppressor}} gene is negatively regulated by the Polycomb Group (PcG) complexes, which {{plays an important role}} in stem cell- and cancer biology. Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC 1) members posterior sex comb protein BMI 1 and polycomb proteins CBX 7 and CBX 8 have been shown to be <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>repression</b> of INK 4 A and delay of senescence, whereas evidence from mouse genetics suggests that polyhomeotic protein Ph 2 is also required. However, it is still unknown why the mammalian PRC 1 complex has so many possible permutations compared to the basic system in Drosphila and how this relates to the regulation of a single target gene. The aim was therefore to define the requirement and function of the three human polyhomeotic members, HPH 1, - 2 and - 3, for INK 4 A repression. It was found that depletion of all HPH proteins by shRNA-mediated knockdown in primary human fibroblasts results in derepression of INK 4 A and premature senescence. In contrast, overexpression of HPH proteins leads to activation of INK 4 A accompanied by loss of PRC 1 binding and PcG-associated histone H 3 K 27 trimethylation at the locus. These diametrically opposite findings suggest that a fine balance in HPH protein levels is required for PcG repression. Furthermore, biochemical investigation of the interaction between CBX and HPH proteins did not demonstrate any level of specificity, but emphasised the RNA binding capacity of both proteins, which was further investigated. In addition, by tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis it was found that HPH 2 interacts with both PRC 1 components and novel proteins, which were studied for involvement in INK 4 A repression. In summary, this thesis demonstrates an essential role for the HPH proteins in the regulation of INK 4 A and provides novel insights into their functional contribution to PcG repression. ...|$|E
40|$|Human {{telomerase}} {{reverse transcriptase}} (hTERT) {{is expressed in}} most cancer cells. Paradoxically, its promoter is embedded in a hypermethylated CpG island. A short region escapes to this alteration, allowing a basal level of transcription. However, the methylation of adjacent regions {{may play a role}} in the maintenance of low hTERT expression. It is now well established that methyl-CpG binding domain proteins mediate the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes. The potential involvement of these proteins in the control of hTERT expression was firstly investigated in HeLa cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that only methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD 2) associated the hypermethylated hTERT promoter. In MBD 2 knockdown HeLa cells, constitutively depleted in MBD 2, neither methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP 2) nor MBD 1 acted as substitutes for MBD 2. MBD 2 depletion by transient or constitutive RNA interference led to an upregulation of hTERT transcription that can be downregulated by expressing mouse Mbd 2 protein. Our results indicate that MBD 2 is specifically and <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the transcriptional <b>repression</b> of hTERT <b>in</b> HeLa cells. This specific transcriptional repression was also observed in breast, liver and neuroblastoma cancer cell lines. Thus, MBD 2 seems to be a general repressor of hTERT in hTERT-methylated telomerase-positive cell...|$|R
40|$|Histone acetylation/deacetylation is an {{important}} chromatin modification for epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Silent information regulation 2 (Sir 2) -related sirtuins are nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) -dependent histone deacetylases (HDAC). The mammalian sirtuin family comprises 7 members (SIRT 1 - 7) that act in different cellular compartments to regulate metabolism and aging. The rice genome contains only two Sir 2 -related genes: OsSRT 1 (or SRT 701) and OsSRT 2 (orSRT 702). OsSRT 1 {{is closely related to}} the mammalian SIRT 6, while OsSRT 2 is homologous to SIRT 4. Previous work has shown that OsSRT 1 is required for the safeguard against genome instability and cell damage in rice plant. In this work we investigated the role of OsSRT 1 on genome-wide acetylation of histone H 3 lysine 9 (H 3 K 9 ac) and studied the genome-wide binding targets of OsSRT 1. The study reveals that OsSRT 1 binds to loci with relatively low levels of H 3 K 9 ac and directly regulates H 3 K 9 ac and expression of many genes that are related to stress and metabolism, indicating that OsSRT 1 is {{an important}} site-specific histone deacetylase for gene regulation in rice. In addition, OsSRT 1 is found to also target to several families of transposable elements, suggesting that OsSRT 1 is <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> transposable element <b>repression...</b>|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic DNA {{exists in}} a complex with histone {{proteins}} and this structure is known as chromatin. Post-translational modifications of histones can influence chromatin structure and thereby regulate important processes such as transcription. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has been used as}} a model organism to study these histone modifications as they have been largely conserved from yeast to mammalian cells. ^ This thesis is divided into three main chapters representing three separate research studies. The first one represents a study on Ubp 8, a component of the SAGA co-activator complex. Here, we have provided evidence that an interaction between Ubp 8 and Sgf 11, a newly identified component of SAGA, is required for association of Ubp 8 with the SAGA complex as well as its function as an H 2 B deubiquitylating enzyme. Furthermore, our results indicate that Ubp 8 and Sgf 11 constitute a functional module which is separate from other modules within SAGA. ^ The second chapter consists of our study of histone sumoylation in yeast. Previous to this study, there had not been any histone modifications associated with transcriptional <b>repression</b> <b>in</b> S. cerevisiae. Here, we have shown that all four core histones are sumoylated in budding yeast. We have identified specific sumoylation sites on histone H 2 B and shown that sumoylated H 2 B is <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> transcriptional <b>repression.</b> Additionally, our results suggest that histone sumoylation may oppose activating mechanisms such as histone acetylation. ^ The subject of the third and final research study is a histone demethylating enzyme. Two classes of histone demethylases have recently been found in mammalian cells, the LSD 1 class and the JmjC class. Here we have provided a detailed analysis of the demethylation activity of Kdm 5, a JmjC domain containing protein in S. cerevisiae. This protein has specific in vitro activity towards all methylated states of lysine 4 on histone H 3. Our in vivo studies provide evidence for a role of Kdm 5 both in modulating the level of lysine 4 methylation during the peak of GAL 1 transcription, as well as removing the modification during repression. ...|$|R
40|$|The vitamin B 12 (B 12) -mediated {{repression}} of the metE gene in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium requires the B 12 -dependent transmethylase, the metH gene product. It has been proposed that the MetH-B 12 holoenzyme complex is <b>involved</b> <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> the <b>repression</b> mechanism. Using Escherichia coli strains lysogenized with a lambda phage carrying a metE-lacZ gene fusion, we examined B 12 -mediated {{repression of}} the metE-lacZ gene fusion. Although B 12 supplementation results in a 10 -fold repression of metE-lacZ expression, homocysteine addition to the growth medium overrides the B 12 -mediated <b>repression.</b> <b>In</b> addition, B 12 -mediated {{repression of the}} metE-lacZ fusion is dependent on a functional MetR protein. When a metB mutant was transformed with a high-copy-number plasmid carrying the metE gene, which {{would be expected to}} reduce intracellular levels of homocysteine, metE-lacZ expression was reduced and B 12 supplementation had no further effect. In a metJ mutant, B 12 represses metE-lacZ expression less than twofold. When the metJ mutant was transformed with a high-copy-number plasmid carrying the metH gene, which would be expected to reduce intracellular levels of homocysteine, B 12 repression of the metE-lacZ fusion was partially restored. The results indicate that B 12 -mediated repression of the metE gene is primarily a loss of MetR-mediated activation due to depletion of the coactivator homocysteine, rather than a direct repression by the MetH-B 12 holoenzyme...|$|R
