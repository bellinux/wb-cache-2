40|$|In this paper, I firstly, {{highlight}} {{the shortcomings of}} the idea called the 2 ̆ 7 instantaneous acquisition 2 ̆ 7 whilst also providing an interpretation to the possible grammar in Generative Grammar Theory. As for the introduction of <b>Dynamic</b> Grammar <b>Theory,</b> after a more detailed explanation about the possible grammar, limitations on the acquisition process greatly improved. Furthermore, as result of having compared the differences in <b>Dynamic</b> Grammar <b>Theory</b> and Generative Grammar Theory with {{an idea of the}} possible grammar, it was determined that <b>Dynamic</b> Grammar <b>Theory</b> is different from Generative Grammar Theory in its degree of limitation and its focus on an acquisition process. However, common points were also seen as, <b>Dynamic</b> Grammar <b>Theory</b> not only takes language acquisition as a basic problem and insist on birth characteristics of language acquisition {{in the same way as}} Universal Grammar, but also analyzes constructions based on a phrase-structure rule. Therefore, it can be determined that <b>Dynamic</b> Grammar <b>Theory</b> is one study in the extension line of Generative Grammar Theory, and not a completely different theory altogether. This point of view accords with Matsumoto （ 1999 ）. Finally, I will appropriate the workings of <b>Dynamic</b> Grammar <b>Theory,</b> to demonstrate its use in a Japanese education context...|$|R

25|$|The <b>dynamic</b> <b>theory</b> {{explains}} the monsoon {{on the basis}} of the annual shifts in the position of global belts of pressure and winds. According to this theory, the monsoon is a result of the shift of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) under the influence of the vertical sun. Though the mean position of the ITCZ is taken as the equator, it shifts north and south with the migration of the vertical sun toward the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn during the summer of the respective hemispheres (Northern and Southern Hemisphere). As such, during the northern summer (May and June), the ITCZ moves north, along with the vertical sun, toward the Tropic of Cancer. The ITCZ, as the zone of lowest pressure in the tropical region, is the target destination for the trade winds of both hemispheres. Consequently, with the ITCZ at the Tropic of Cancer, the southeast trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere have to cross the equator to reach it. However, because of the Coriolis effect (which causes winds in the Northern Hemisphere to turn right, whereas winds in the Southern Hemisphere turn left), these southeast trade winds are deflected east in the Northern Hemisphere, transforming into southwest trades. These pick up moisture while traveling from sea to land and cause orographic rain once they hit the highlands of the Indian Peninsula. This results in the southwest monsoon.|$|E

2500|$|While Newton {{explained}} the tides by describing the tide-generating forces and Bernoulli gave {{a description of}} the static reaction of the waters on Earth to the tidal potential, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>theory</b> of tides, developed by Laplace in 1775, describes the ocean's real reaction to tidal forces. Laplace's theory of ocean tides took into account friction, resonance and natural periods of ocean basins. It predicted the large amphidromic systems in the world's ocean basins and explains the oceanic tides that are actually observed.The equilibrium theory, based on the gravitational gradient from the Sun and Moon but ignoring the Earth's rotation, the effects of continents, and other important effects, could not explain the real ocean tides.Since measurements have confirmed the theory, many things have possible explanations now, like how the tides interact with deep sea ridges and chains of seamounts give rise to deep eddies that transport nutrients from the deep to the surface. [...] The equilibrium tide theory calculates the height of the tide wave of less than half a meter, while the <b>dynamic</b> <b>theory</b> explains why tides are up to 15 meters. [...] Satellite observations confirm the accuracy of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>theory,</b> and the tides worldwide are now measured to within a few centimeters. Measurements from the CHAMP satellite closely match the models based on the TOPEX data. [...] Accurate models of tides worldwide are essential for research since the variations due to tides must be removed from measurements when calculating gravity and changes in sea levels.|$|E

2500|$|Concerning the {{discipline}} of sociology, he conceived a <b>dynamic</b> <b>theory</b> of history that involved conceptualizations of social conflict and social change. He developed the dichotomy of sedentary life versus nomadic {{life as well as}} the concept of a [...] "generation", and the inevitable loss of power that occurs when desert warriors conquer a city. Following a contemporary Arab scholar, Sati' al-Husri, the Muqaddimah may be read as a sociological work: six books of general sociology. Topics dealt with in this work include politics, urban life, economics, and knowledge. The work is based around Ibn Khaldun's central concept of 'asabiyyah, which has been translated as [...] "social cohesion", [...] "group solidarity", or [...] "tribalism". This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups; it can be intensified and enlarged by a religious ideology. Ibn Khaldun's analysis looks at how this cohesion carries groups to power but contains within itself the seeds – psychological, sociological, economic, political – of the group's downfall, {{to be replaced by a}} new group, dynasty or empire bound by a stronger (or at least younger and more vigorous) cohesion.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>theories</b> of {{discourse}} interpretation seek {{to describe and}} explain antecedent-anaphor relations with the help {{of discourse}} referents. In a dynamic framework, it is the function of indefinite expressions to intro-duce new discourse referents, whilst anaphoric expressions serve to retrieve them. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>theories</b> provide a simple and intuitively appealing solu-tion to a variety of problems. For instance, they explain how it is possible for an indefinite expression to “bind ” a pronoun that isn’t c-commanded by it, as in (1 a,b), and why examples like (2 a,b) are infelicitous: (1) a. Pedro owns a donkeyi. Iti is grey. b. Every farmer who owns a donkeyi beats iti. (2) a. *Pedro doesn’t own a donkeyi. Iti is grey. b. *Every farmer who doesn’t own a donkeyi beats iti.

40|$|Summary Static versus <b>dynamic</b> <b>theories</b> as {{explanations}} for intergenerational transmission of crime. Parental criminal behaviour exerts a substantial impact on offspring criminal behaviour. Unfortunately however, {{the explanation for}} the intergenerational transmission of crime remains unclear. To compare and contrast two possible explanations, we {{address the question of}} whether the timing of a father’s criminal acts predicts the likelihood that his children commit crime. According to static theories, the total number of criminal acts rather than the exact timing influences the likelihood of offspring criminal behaviour. According to <b>dynamic</b> <b>theories,</b> timing is crucial and children are more likely to engage in criminal behaviour after fathers have committed criminal acts. Results show that the total number of delinquent acts is an important predictor, and also that the exact timing plays an important role. In the year the father has been convicted, the likelihood that the child commits crime increases substantially and decays in the following years at a slower rate the more crimes the father has committed. Our results show that the rigorous assumptions of static theories require nuancing. ...|$|R

The <b>dynamic</b> key <b>theory</b> generation scheme and key update mechanism are formally analyzed to demonstrate balance between security and performance. The theory can be applied to enhance the security and performance of cryptographic systems, especially those used in wireless networks communication.

Its length of nearly one hundred pages is suggestive of its central significance to the book as a whole and may almost be studied as an independent book in its own right complementing the other themes which Kelsen covers in this book.|$|E
