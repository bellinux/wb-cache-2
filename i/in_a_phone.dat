25|$|It {{was widely}} known that Griffin hoped {{to keep his}} job under President Barack Obama so that Constellation and NASA's other {{programs}} could maintain their steady progress. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> call on the day after the election, Senator Bill Nelson (D, FL) requested of Lori Garver, who led the incoming Obama Administration's Transition Team, that the Administration allow Griffin to remain as NASA Administrator to provide programmatic and management continuity.
