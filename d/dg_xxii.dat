The activities of ESST are financed both by the member universities and by external sources,which have included DG XII, <b>DG</b> <b>XXII</b> and the General Secretariat of the European Commission.

40|$|The European Community regards {{training}} as a priority area and has therefore developed a series of programmes {{in the field of}} vocational training. This book {{is the result of a}} pilot project selected under two of these Community Action Programmes. It was initially selected under the COMETT programme, concerned with the development of continuing vocational training in the European Community. Moreover, it was one of the few selected projects to receive further funding under a second selection in the context of the LEONARDO DA VINCI Action Programme for the implementation of a European Community Vocational Training policy. It is with great pleasure that I present the outcome of this project which embodies one of the fundamental objectives of the LEONARDO DA VINCI Programme -training for new technologies in SMEs, which make a significant contribution to economic development in Europe.
