40|$|Palynomorph <b>Darkness</b> <b>Index</b> (PDI) is {{proposed}} {{as a new}} thermal maturity indicator. PDI is calculated from measurement of the red, green and blue (RGB) intensities of light transmitted through palynomorphs, using standard palynological microscopes and digital cameras. PDIs determined by different microscope and camera combinations show excellent correlation, suggesting that the method is largely platform-independent, though calibration is required, preferably using photographic filters as standards. Investigation of PDI from experimentally heated Tasmanites reveals a progressive increase with increasing temperature, suggesting that the technique is applicable through a broad temperature range encompassing {{the whole of the}} oil window and {{at least part of the}} zone of dry gas generation. Potential applications of this inexpensive method include the estimation of thermal maturity of rocks deficient in vitrinite, such as the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of Arabia and the Upper Devonian black shales of North America...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} fully trainable {{binarization}} solution for degraded document images. Unlike previous attempts that often used simple features {{with a series of}} pre- and post-processing, our solution encodes all heuristics about whether or not a pixel is foreground text into a high-dimensional feature vector and learns a more complicated decision function. In particular, we prepare features of three types: 1) existing features for binarization such as intensity [1], contrast [2], [3], and Laplacian [4], [5]; 2) reformulated features from existing binarization decision functions such those in [6] and [7]; and 3) our newly developed features, namely the Logarithm Intensity Percentile (LIP) and the Relative <b>Darkness</b> <b>Index</b> (RDI). Our initial experimental results show that using only selected samples (about 1. 5 % of all available training data), we can achieve a binarization performance comparable to those fine-tuned (typically by hand), state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the trained document binarization classifier shows good generalization capabilities on out-of-domain data. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|Poland is {{considered}} the most prospective country for shale gas production in Europe. Hydrocarbon generation/expulsion scenarios, drawn in the latest intensive exploration phases, tend to overestimate maturation levels when compared with brand new data acquired after recent drillings. We tested an integrated workflow to correlate published and original thermal maturity datasets for the Paleozoic to Jurassic successions cropping out in the Holy Cross Mountains. These successions, when preserved in subsurface, host the major source rocks in the area. The application of the workflow allowed us to highlight the burial and thermal evolutionary scenarios of the two tectono-stratigraphic blocks of the Holy Cross Mountains (Łysogory and Kielce blocks) and to propose this approach {{as a tool for}} reducing levels of uncertainty in thermal maturity assessment of Paleozoic successions worldwide. In particular, published datasets including colour alteration indexes of Paleozoic microfossils (conodont, acritarchs) and vitrinite and graptolite reflectance data, show differences in levels of thermal maturity for the Łysogory (mid mature to overmature) and Kielce (immature to late mature) blocks. Original data, derived from optical analysis, pyrolysis, and Raman spectroscopy on kerogen, and X-Ray diffraction on fine grained sediments, mostly confirm and integrate published data distribution. 1 D thermal models, constrained by these data, show burial and exhumation events of different magnitude, during the Late Cretaceous, for the Łysogory (maximum burial depths of 9 km) and Kielce (burial depths of 6 km) blocks that have been related to the Holy Cross Fault polyphase activity. In the end, Palynomorph <b>Darkness</b> <b>Index</b> and Raman spectroscopy on kerogen, for Llandoverian and Cambrian rocks, turned out to be promising tools for assessing thermal maturity of Paleozoic organic facies devoid of vitrinite macerals...|$|E

IRIS tubes were recently added to the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils Technical Standards as an approved method for identifying anaerobic conditions in soils. Research on the effectiveness of IRIS tubes has been positive but limited geographically. The objectives of this study were to assess water table dynamics and evaluate IRIS tubes as an effective method for hydric soil identification in northeastern Illinois. The hydric soil indicators in addition to magnetic susceptibility measurements and the calculation of a <b>darkness</b> profile <b>index</b> will serve as methods used to further evaluate the hydric status of soils sampled for this study. Results showed that only one of eight soils along a transect were confirmed hydric by IRIS tubes, despite hydric morphology exhibited by all eight soil cores. Repeated IRIS tube trials over several growing seasons are necessary to capture the annual variability in water table dynamics, and research is ongoing in 2009...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Memory and {{learning}} {{play an important}} role in human"s life that will become problematic in case disability is weak for any reason. There are many factors that facilitate process of mamory {{and learning}} of which accumbens nucleus plays an important role. Accumbens nucleus, which is a part of the limbic system, is one of many nuclei found of the septum in the mesencephalon. This study was performed to determine the effects of reversible Inactivation of a accumbens nuclei by lidocaein on memory storage in rat. &# 13; Method s. Male wistar rats were surgically implancted with cannulae at the accumbens nuclei (Acb) bilaterally one weak later they recived one trial PAL (1 mA 1. S sec) and exactly at times zero, 60 and 120 minutes after posttraining, lidocaine was infused into the Acb. Retention was tested two days after training. Latency period before entering into the dark part of the shuttle box and duration of time in <b>darkness</b> were <b>index</b> for evaluation of retention. &# 13; Results. A significant impaired retention performance was at zero and 60 minutes after posttrianing infusion of lidocaine into the Acb. Infusion administered 120 minutes after training had no effect. &# 13; Discussion. This study has shown that Accumbens nucleus plays major role in praimary learning and memory and it is probable that by blocking this nucleus dopamine release is diminished which causes the learning process to be delayed consequently...|$|R

40|$|Sympathetic {{function}} was studied in 101 diabetic children and 102 {{age and sex}} matched control children, {{as part of a}} longitudinal study of the evolution of microvascular disease in the population of diabetic children and adolescents in Avon County. The median (range) age of the diabetic population was 13. 5 (6. 0 - 17. 2) years, the duration of diabetes was 4. 0 (0. 4 - 13. 9) years, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1) was 10. 9 (7. 0 - 18. 1) %. Pupillary adaptation in <b>darkness,</b> as an <b>index</b> of sympathetic neuropathy, was measured using a Polaroid portable pupillometer. Diabetic children had a significantly smaller median pupillary diameter, measured as the pupil/iris ratio and expressed as a percentage, than control children (median (range) 62. 9 (50. 3 - 72. 1) v 65. 9 (52. 2 - 73. 8)). Pupillary diameter was significantly related to diabetes duration (r = - 0. 22), HbA 1 (r = - 0. 34), systolic blood pressure (r = - 0. 25), diastolic blood pressure (r = - 0. 49), and mean albumin/creatinine ratio on random urine samples (r = - 0. 26). Pupillary diameter was not related to age (r = - 0. 1). Eight (7. 9 %) diabetic and four (3. 9 %) control children were identified as having abnormal pupillary dilation in darkness. In comparison {{with the rest of the}} diabetic population, these diabetic children had longer diabetes duration and poorer glycaemic control. Polaroid pupillometry has demonstrated subclinical autonomic neuropathy in a population of diabetic children and adolescents. These abnormalities were related to poor metabolic control, long diabetes duration, and also to other indices of microvascular disease...|$|R
