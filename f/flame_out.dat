25|$|On 20 December 2005, an MU-2B-36 crashed near Terrace, British Columbia. The {{pilot and}} first officer were killed. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada {{investigation}} {{concluded that the}} left engine combustion chamber plenum split open during take-off due to a fatigue crack, causing the engine to <b>flame</b> <b>out.</b> The crew were unable to safely land the disabled aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Me 262 was {{difficult}} to counter because its high speed and rate of climb {{made it hard to}} intercept. However, as with other turbojet engines at the time, the Me 262's engines did not provide sufficient thrust at low air speeds and throttle response was slow, meaning in certain circumstances such as takeoff and landing, the aircraft became a vulnerable target. Another disadvantage that pioneering jet aircraft of the World War II era shared, was the high risk of compressor stall and if throttle movements were too rapid, the engine(s) could suffer a <b>flame</b> <b>out.</b> The coarse opening of the throttle would cause fuel surging and lead to excessive jet pipe temperatures. Pilots were instructed to operate the throttle gently and avoid quick changes. German engineers introduced an automatic throttle regulator later in the war but it only partly alleviated the problem.|$|E
25|$|The second prototype, No. 02, {{made its}} 50-minute first flight in September 1978 at the {{controls}} of Maurourd. The aircraft was tasked with the testing {{of some of the}} avionics systems and the carriage of weapons. Due to a <b>flame</b> <b>out</b> while on a landing approach, the aircraft was lost in May 1984. No. 03 would make its first flight in April 1979; equipped with a complete weapons system, it was tasked with radar and weapons trials. After 400 hours of flight, they were sent to CEV (Centre d'Essais en Vol, Flight tests centre). Although three prototypes were ordered in December 1975, Dassault constructed an additional fourth single-seat demonstrator for its own purposes, which embodied lessons on the earlier aircraft, namely the reduction in fin height and an increased fin sweep, redesigned air inlets and FBW system. The only dual-seat Mirage 2000B of the test programme first flew on 11 October 1980.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{landed at}} Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, at midnight in snow conditions and was then parked heading directly into moderate to strong surface winds for approximately 17 hours. Because no protecting plugs were put inside the engine intakes, the wind drove {{a significant amount}} of snow into the intakes. The intake plugs were not carried as part of the aircraft's onboard equipment and they were not readily available at Edinburgh Airport. Information concerning freezing weather conditions in the aircraft manufacturer's maintenance manual had not been including in the airline's Short 360 Operations Manual and was therefore not complied with. The AAIB discovered that large volumes of snow or slush could have accumulated where {{it would not have been}} readily visible to the crew during a pre-flight inspection (the engine intakes on a Short 360 are about 2.8m (9ft) above the ground). On takeoff this snow changed the engine intake air flow, causing both engines to <b>flame</b> <b>out</b> after both engines' anti-ice vanes were simultaneously opened as per the standard operating procedure. It was noted by the investigators that selecting engine anti-ice 'on' sequentially with a time interval between would have prevented a simultaneous dual engine flameout.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{polarized}} critical opinions. Carey Bodenheimer of CNN [...] {{wrote that}} Instead of dropping the mic and resting on its collective laurels, [...] kicked off season 26 with a staggering, Don Hertzfeldt directed intro sequence {{and then went}} on to prove that, in a world where shows can <b>flame</b> <b>out</b> after just a few episodes, 'The Simpsons', which premiered in 1989 still has plenty of jokes left in their comedic arsenal. Time wrote [...] "If 'Clown in the Dumps' is not a classic on the level of season three's 'Like Father, Like Clown', it was still a fitting, sweet conclusion to the story of Hyman and Herschel".|$|E
500|$|At 21:32:38, {{the cockpit}} voice {{recorder}} (CVR) recorded a temporary interruption in power. A second later, Flight Engineer Moyano exclaimed, [...] "Flame out <b>flame</b> <b>out</b> on engine number four." [...] The CVR recorded another interruption in power one second after that, and Moyano said, [...] "Flame out on engine number three essential on number two or number one." [...] The captain acknowledged. At 21:32:49, Klotz radioed the controller, informing him that the flight had [...] "just ah lost two engines and...we need priority please." [...] The controller instructed the flight to fly southwest to intercept the localizer. Klotz acknowledged this. The flight crew selected the ILS. At 21:33:04, the controller informed the flight that they were fifteen miles from the outer marker and cleared them for an ILS approach on runway 22L. Klotz acknowledged. That was the final radio transmission from Flight 52. Caviedes asked if the ILS had been selected. Klotz replied, [...] "It is ready on two" [...] at 21:33:23. One second later, the CVR stopped recording. At 21:34:00, the controller tried to radio the flight, asking, [...] "You have enough fuel {{to make it to}} the airport?" [...] There was no response.|$|E

500|$|Another {{prototype}} {{equipped with}} RD-21 engines and a pressurized cockpit {{was completed in}} June 1947. It was known internally as the I-307 (izdeliye FR) and was given the service designation of MiG-9M. The armament was rearranged in another attempt to ameliorate the gun gas ingestion problem with the N-37 being mounted on the starboard side of the fuselage and the two NS-23s on the port side, well aft so that the gun barrels did not protrude beyond the air intake. This caused the cockpit to be moved forward slightly which gave the pilot a better view when landing. The number of fuel tanks was reduced to five, but the aircraft's total capacity remained the same. It made its first flight in July, but the factory flight tests were not completed until early 1948. Despite {{a top speed of}} [...] at , it failed its state acceptance tests. The reasons given were that the engines continued to <b>flame</b> <b>out</b> if they were run at low rpm at altitudes above , the mounts for the cannon were not fully developed and the workmanship of the pressurized cockpit was low. The real reason was that the aircraft was inferior to the MiG-15 already in flight testing.|$|E
500|$|After the film's {{release and}} unusually strong box office {{performance}} over {{its first two}} weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing Titanics worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts. Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing Titanic, such as 2008's The Dark Knight, but Avatar was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. [...] "Most films {{are considered to be}} healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of," [...] said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. [...] "This is just unprecedented. I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation." [...] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing Titanic because [...] "Today's films <b>flame</b> <b>out</b> much faster than they did when Titanic was released." [...] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, [...] "While Avatar may beat Titanics record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." [...] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to [...] "try to topple Titanic off its perch" [...] because it [...] "just struck some kind of chord" [...] and there had been other good films in recent years. He changed his prediction by mid-January. [...] "It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time," [...] he said.|$|E

The Armenians do not celebrate the Nativity on 25 December, but on 6 January, and thus their {{date of the}} feast is 40 days after that: 14 February. The night before the feast, Armenians traditionally light candles during an evening church service, carrying the <b>flame</b> <b>out</b> into the darkness (symbolically bringing light into the void) and either take it home to light lamps or light a bonfire in the church courtyard.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with the}} main {{combustor}} in a gas turbine, the afterburner has both a case and a liner, serving the same purpose as their main combustor counterparts. One major difference between a main combustor and an afterburner is that the temperature rise is not constrained by a turbine section, therefore afterburners {{tend to have a}} much higher temperature rise than main combustors. Another difference is that afterburners are not designed to mix fuel as well as primary combustors, so not all the fuel is burned within the afterburner section. Afterburners also often require the use of flameholders to keep the velocity of the air in the afterburner from blowing the <b>flame</b> <b>out.</b> These are often bluff bodies or [...] "vee-gutters" [...] directly behind the fuel injectors that create localized low speed flow in the same manner the dome does in the main combustor.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1952 show season, fuel control {{problems}} grounded the team's Grumman F9F Panthers leaving the Cutlasses to put on the primary demonstration between March and June. During a show at Saufley Field in Florida, Feightner experienced a total loss of hydraulics on a full afterburner takeoff and steep climb. While trying to gain enough altitude for ejection he was able to stay with the aircraft until the back up control system engaged. He clipped trees {{on the end of the}} runway, causing the left engine to <b>flame</b> <b>out.</b> With hydraulic fluid streaming back in a bright flame, he made a hard turn and got the plane back on the runway, much to the excitement of the crowd. Feightner and Macknight performed maneuvers that showed off the best attributes of the F7U. The two solos would approach each other from opposite ends of the runway and, after passing each other, would roll the aircraft, deploy speed brakes, and light afterburners. In Feightner's opinion, [...] "There just is not an airplane like it anywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite having {{achieved}} {{a circulation of}} 670,000 Talk magazine's publication was abruptly halted in January 2002 {{in the wake of}} the advertising recession following the 9/11 attacks. It was Brown's first very public failure but she had no regrets about embarking on the project. She told Charlotte Edwardes of The Telegraph in 2002: [...] "My reputation rests on four magazines – three great successes, one that was a great experiment. I don't feel in any way let down.

[...] Talk Media was founded in July 1998 by Miramax Films, Tina Brown and Ron Galotti to publishing books and Talk magazine and produce television programs. Talk Media formed a joint venture with Heart Magazines for the magazine only in February 1999. Brown worked with the book division's editor-in chief Jonathan Burnham. She recalled in October 2017 at the time of allegations of sexual assault being made against Harvey Weinstein: [...] "Strange contracts pre-dating us would suddenly surface, book deals with no deadline attached authored by attractive or nearly famous women".|$|E
