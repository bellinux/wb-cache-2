25|$|By 1953, {{however, the}} {{property}} had become neglected and fallen into serious disrepair. Some {{of the local}} families <b>got</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> restored it, raising money through a Grange fair. They were able to repaint the interior and exterior and replace the roof. In {{the process of the}} latter work they removed the chimney completely; a pile of bricks was found in the nearby woods during a later renovation. A neighboring couple cleaned up the landscaping and gravestones. Six years after this restoration, Thomas Miller's granddaughter Ruth was married to Ernest Pinckney, another descendant of an old West Somers family, in the church. It was the last ceremony held in the building; the last burial in the graveyard took place in 1977.|$|E
25|$|After {{the demise}} of their {{previous}} band, At the Drive-In, drummer Tony Hajjar and bassist Paul Hinojos <b>got</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> talked about forming a new band. Hinojos contacted former At the Drive-In guitarist and back-up vocalist Jim Ward to take the role of lead vocalist. After a brief stint with Erick Sanger, the three recruited Matt Miller, a native to El Paso and then bassist of the band Belknap to permanently fill the position of bassist, with Hinojos switching to guitar. The band then scored a deal with Dreamworks in 2001. The band released their first EP entitled Austere in early 2002 under the name Sparta. The EP met with mixed reviews, with most believing that the group had talent and the ability, but had yet to find their voice.|$|E

25|$|In the beginning, a {{difference}} between hardware and software did not exist. The user and programmer of a computer were one and the same. When the first commercial electronic computer was introduced by IBM in 1952, the machine was hard to maintain and expensive. Putting {{the price of the}} machine aside, it was the software that caused the problem when owning one of these computers. Then in 1952, a collaboration of all the owners of the computer <b>got</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> created a set of tools. The collaboration of people were in a group called PACT (The Project for the Advancement of Coding techniques). After passing this hurdle, in 1956, the Eisenhower administration decided to put restrictions on the types of sales AT could make. This did not stop the inventors from developing new ideas of how to bring the computer to the mass population. The next step was making the computer more affordable which slowly developed through different companies. Then they had to develop software that would host multiple users. MIT computation center developed one of the first systems, CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System). This laid the foundation for many more systems, and what we now call the Open Source Movement.|$|E
25|$|Flight day 6 was {{dedicated}} to transferring supplies from the MPLM Leonardo and the space shuttle mid-deck. The crews transferred the Windows Observational Research Facility (WORF) to the Destiny lab. Mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki, along with flight engineer Soichi Noguchi also transferred the Express Rack 7 (ER7) to its final location. During the crews morning, a smoke alarm sounded in the Russian segment of the station, which prompted the joint crew to move into emergency procedures. However the alarm was false and was cleared {{within a couple of}} minutes and all normal work resumed. Mission specialists Clay Anderson, Rick Mastracchio and Stephanie Wilson conducted in-flight interviews with Nebraska Public Radio, CBS Newspath and Radio Network and KETV-TV in Omaha, Nebraska. Later in the day commander Alan Poindexter, pilot Jim Dutton and mission specialist Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger talked with students at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. At the end of the crews work day, the joint crew <b>got</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> reviewed the procedures for the second spacewalk. After the procedures review spacewalkers Clay Anderson and Rick Mastracchio entered the Quest airlock, closed the hatch and lowered the inside pressure to 10.2 psi. The pair also breathed pure oxygen for an hour while the pressure was being lowered.|$|E
25|$|From the 1880s onwards {{there had}} been no central body to {{co-ordinate}} the Inter-Colonial Tournaments and matches, select composite West Indian XIs for tours and against touring sides and to organise the West Indian tours of England, Canada and the United States. Such organisation as there was, was done by an informal coalition of the major clubs in the region. West Indian cricketers however had felt the need for the establishment of such an organisation although geography and culture were to make such a task difficult. However, with the help of one influential Marylebone Cricket Club member, R. H. Mallet (the manager of the 1906 and 1923 West Indian tours and future manager of the 1930–31 West Indian tour to Australia), representatives of the various territories finally <b>got</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> ultimately formed the West Indies Cricket Board of Control. The preliminary meeting was in Bridgetown, Barbados, from which the informal West Indies Cricket Conference was founded in 1926. The West Indies Cricket Conference held its first official meeting on 22 January 1927 at the Bridgetown Club in Barbados attended by Mallett and representatives from the Windward Islands, Trinidad & Tobago, Barbados and Demerara (British Guiana). Delegates from Jamaica and the Leeward Islands were invited by unfortunately were unable to attend. At this January meeting the delegates present decided to form the West Indies Cricket Board of Control (WICBC) which would be composed of a president, a secretary and two delegates each from Barbados, Demerara, Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago and one delegate each from the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands. The WICBC's first meeting was held on 17 and 18 June 1927 in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad with Harold Austin (the former captain of the 1906 and 1923 West Indian tours of England) serving as the first president. The Board as constituted was enlarged in 1982 when the Leeward and Windward Islands were given the same representation as the other full Members. The President was appointed by the Board at an Ordinary General Meeting and had to be a person resident in the West Indies who had shown a keen and active interest in West Indies cricket. His term of office was for two years (and eligible for re-election) or until his successor was appointed. Board members were also thenceforce to be appointed by their Cricket Associations although in British Guiana the Georgetown Cricket Club held this responsibility until 1943, and in Trinidad the Queens Park Oval Club until 1981 when their respective Cricket Associations were given recognition. There was a provision for Associate Members who would be entitled to attend Meetings but not to move resolutions or vote. Bermuda and Belize had been the only members in this category prior to their cessation as Associate Members. According to Ram Hiralal, former President of the Suriname Cricket Association, up until 2002 when Suriname applied for and gained affiliate membership of the ICC, it was also an associate member of the West Indies Cricket Board.|$|E

500|$|To {{explore and}} create a new sound, Mars {{enlisted the help of}} Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker and Paul Epworth. The singer {{described}} this encounter as inviting [...] "master chefs into the kitchen with no master plan" [...] or any kind of outcome, [...] "either a complete disaster or something outstanding". Previously, Benny Blanco, Emile Haynie, Diplo, Supa Dups, as well as Mars' production team The Smeezingtons, have been confirmed to have worked on the album. The first song written for Unorthodox Jukebox was [...] "Gorilla", which [...] "set the tone for the entire project"; Mars explained in an interview granted to MTV News that it became its mascot hence the reason it ended up as the album cover. In an interview for the Rolling Stone, Blanco confessed, [...] "I got a really cool song with him. Me and Paul [...] just <b>got</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> Bruno wrote an amazing song on top of it. It kind of all came together".

I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we <b>got</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E
