5|$|Shinji Mikami, {{the creator}} of the Resident Evil franchise, {{released}} his new survival horror game The Evil Within, in 2014. Mikami stated that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to bring survival horror back to its roots (even though this is his last directorial work), as he was disappointed by recent survival horror games for having too much action.|$|E
5|$|Antón, as expected, {{was named}} as the squad {{leader for the}} Vuelta a España. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> overall success. He was joined in the squad by fellow Giro d'Italia stage winner Nieve, Martínez, Verdugo, Txurruka, Oroz, Isasi, Azanza and Cazaux. Nieve commented a day into the Vuelta that he would ride solely to support Antón, {{despite the fact that}} both had won Giro stages and he (Nieve) had {{actually}} finished the race higher overall.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{stated that}} <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> {{to win at}} least 5 percent of the vote, as winning 5 percent would allow Libertarian Party {{candidates}} equal ballot access and federal funding during the next election cycle. In a national Gallup poll of likely registered voters conducted June 7 through June 10, 2012, Johnson took 3% of the vote, while a Gallup poll conducted September 6 through September 9, 2012, showed Johnson taking 1% of likely voters.|$|E

5|$|After a {{successful}} trial Heskey signed for Championship club Bolton Wanderers on a short-term contract on 24 December 2014. He made his debut {{two days later}} as a half-time substitute for Robert Hall with Bolton 1–0 down at home to Blackburn, but after scoring the equalising goal in the 59th minute Bolton {{went on to win}} 2–1. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> set up by another 36-year-old forward who the club had re-signed that month, Eiður Guðjohnsen, who had played for them 14 years earlier. Heskey was released by Bolton when his contract expired at the end of 2015–16. He subsequently retired from playing.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} was announced, NBA Commissioner David Stern stated that he was opposed to a relocation, as no NBA {{franchise}} had moved since 1985, when the Kansas City Kings relocated to Sacramento, California. He stated that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> that the Grizzlies remain in Vancouver and succeed there. The NBA Board of Governors' Finance Committee also made negative statements, as the purchase agreement was structured with incentives to move the team. The deal was then renegotiated before the board could vote on the issue. On 21 January 2001, Laurie {{announced that he had}} paid McCaw an undisclosed amount {{to walk away from the}} deal.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E

5|$|Bjarne Sortland was {{appointed}} managing director. The first helicopter was delivered in May, {{with a new}} helicopter being delivered each month. They were named Havsulen, Havhesten, Havørn and Havsvale. Owner Bjørn G. Braathen stated that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> that the airline would reach a 50% market share. In 1990, another challenger, Mørefly, had also established themselves in the market. For the start of operations, Braathens Helikopter hired 22 pilots, most of them previously working for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The company had 70 employees in total. Services started on 1 September 1990, where the initial contract involved flying 10,000 passengers per year.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Beebe {{traveled}} to Georgetown {{in pursuit of}} his earlier goal of establishing a permanent field research station in Guiana. After following several leads which came to nothing, <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> realized when George Withers, who owned a rubber plantation on the Mazaruni River, offered him {{the use of a}} large house on his property for this purpose. Soon after Beebe and his researchers moved into the plantation house, which was known by the name of Kalacoon, they were paid a visit by Theodore Roosevelt and his family. Roosevelt subsequently wrote an article about the station for Scribner's Magazine, which helped to build public support for the station.|$|E
5|$|Leopard Trek {{came to the}} Tour de France with, per season-long expectations, a squad {{centered}} around overall victory. The leader was probably Andy Schleck, entering as runner-up {{in the past two}} Tours de France and three-times running winner of the young rider classification, an award for which he was no longer eligible. Brother Fränk said <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to have Andy win the Tour, with Fränk himself also there on the podium with him. The remaining squad members were Cancellara, Gerdemann, Monfort, Fuglsang, Voigt, O'Grady, and Posthuma. Every rider on the squad had ridden the Tour de France before, and all but Monfort, Fuglsang, and Posthuma had previously worn the yellow jersey. Pre-race analysis speculated Cancellara could aim for a few days in the race lead before the course shifted to the high mountains.|$|E

Ngwat-Mahop scored his first goal with Iraklis, by opening his club's tally in an 1–2 away win against Panserraikos. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> scored after an assist by teammate Karim Soltani and helped Iraklis to record its first away win in eleven months.|$|E
5|$|Once interested, Soichiro Honda began {{developing}} the Super Cub {{on his return}} to Japan. The following year Honda displayed a mockup to Fujisawa that finally matched {{what he had in}} mind, Fujisawa declaring the annual sales would be 30,000 per month, half again as many as the entire monthly two-wheeler market in Japan. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to export motorcycles on a scale yet unseen in the economic disorder of postwar Japan, when most companies' halting trade efforts were handled through foreign trading companies. Honda would have to establish its own overseas subsidiary to provide the necessary service and spare parts distribution in a large country like the United States. To this end American Honda Motor Company was founded in 1959. In 1961 a sales network was established in Germany, then in Belgium and the UK in 1962, and then France in 1964.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} firm Ellerbe Becket, {{in association with}} Loschky Marquardt & Nesholm Architects of Seattle, designed the 1,500,000sqft(140,000m2) project. Allen was closely involved during the design process. While growing up he attended games at the University of Washington's outdoor Husky Stadium. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to create a similar experience and atmosphere at the new venue. The exhibition center portion {{of the project was}} designed over a period of 14months by Loschky Marquardt & Nesholm Architects while First & Goal managed the construction. Town meetings were held to discuss the impact on the public, and the company created a $6million mitigation fund for nearby neighborhoods. In accordance with a program established by the building team, contracts totaling $81million were awarded to minority- and women-owned businesses. Union apprentices made up 19% of the workforce through another program with local trade unions.|$|E

5000|$|Dan Rather's U.S. {{cable channel}} HDnet's {{television}} news magazine Dan Rather Reports, interviewed Rigi and showed {{a video of}} Rigi personally cutting off his brother in-law Shahab Mansouri's head. In the same interview, Rigi described himself as [...] "an Iranian" [...] and denied that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to form a separate Baluch state. He claimed that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to [...] "improve conditions for ethnic Baluchis", and that his group is [...] "fighting exclusively {{for the rights of}} Sunni Muslims in Iran".|$|R

5|$|The {{drawing up}} {{of a regular}} season {{schedule}} had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's inception. The crux {{of the problem was}} the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team's win-loss record. The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league's schedule. He utilized this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{passages}} {{of the match}} were tentative. Faced with a hostile atmosphere, Liverpool were content {{to sit back and}} frustrate Roma. Despite this tactic, Liverpool took the lead in the 15th minute. Souness and Sammy Lee exchanged passes before passing to Craig Johnston on the right hand side of the pitch. Johnston played a high cross into the Roma penalty area, which was challenged for by Roma goalkeeper Franco Tancredi and Ronnie Whelan. The result was that Tancredi dropped the ball, Roma defenders tried to clear the ball, but Michele Nappi's attempted clearance bounced off Tancredi's back and fell to Liverpool defender Phil Neal who scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Two minutes later, Souness volleyed the ball into the Roma goal from close range, but <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> disallowed for offside.|$|E
5|$|Three {{months after}} the {{creation}} of the Primera Junta, Manuel Belgrano was appointed Chief Commander of an army sent to gather support at Corrientes, Santa Fe, Paraguay, and the Banda Oriental. A few days later <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> made more specific: he must aim for Paraguay. The Junta had been informed that the patriotic party was strong, and a small army would suffice to take control. Trusting this information, Belgrano went to Paraguay with two possible goals: get acknowledgment for the Junta in Paraguay or promote a new government that would stay on friendly terms with Buenos Aires. Belgrano was unaware that on 24 July a general assembly in Paraguay discussed the Junta of Buenos Aires, and decided to reject it and pledge allegiance to the Regency Council of Spain.|$|E
