5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> part of the Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades {{on the condition that}} he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

I heard the little sparrows chattering; <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> them. <b>I</b> saw a little worm wriggling across my path; I stepped over it; I didn’t want to hurt any living thing. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> dogs, <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> horses, <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> little urchins on <b>the</b> street, <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> strangers who hurried past me, <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> heathen, <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> whole world. This experience would become his life's focus as he taught and admonished believers to seek 'the blessing' on an international level.|$|R
