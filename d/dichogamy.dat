60|$|<b>Dichogamy,</b> which {{prevails}} so extensively {{throughout the}} vegetable kingdom, much increases {{the chance of}} distinct individuals intercrossing. With proterandrous species, which are far more ccommon than proterogynous, the young flowers are exclusively male in function, and the older ones exclusively female; and as bees habitually alight low down on the spikes of flowers in order to crawl upwards, they get dusted with pollen from the uppermost flowers, which they carry to the stigmas of the lower and older flowers on the next spike which they visit. The degree to which distinct plants will thus be intercrossed depends {{on the number of}} spikes in full flower at the same time on the same plant. With proterogynous flowers and with depending racemes, the manner in which insects visit the flowers ought to be reversed in order that distinct plants should be intercrossed. But this whole subject requires further investigation, as the great importance of crosses between distinct individuals, instead of merely between distinct flowers, has hitherto been hardly recognised.|$|E
60|$|It {{has already}} been shown {{that there is no}} close {{relation}} between the number of seeds produced by flowers when crossed and self-fertilised, {{and the degree to which}} their offspring are aaffected by the two processes. I have also given reasons for believing that the inefficiency of a plant's own pollen is in most cases an incidental result, or has not been specially acquired for the sake of preventing self-fertilisation. On the other hand, there can hardly be a doubt that <b>dichogamy,</b> which prevails according to Hildebrand in the greater number of species (10/23. 'Die Geschlecter Vertheiling' etc. page 32.),--that the heterostyled condition of certain plants,--and that many mechanical structures--have all been acquired so as both to check self-fertilisation and to favour cross-fertilisation. The means for favouring cross-fertilisation must have been acquired before those which prevent self-fertilisation; as it would manifestly be injurious to a plant that its stigma should fail to receive its own pollen, unless it had already become well adapted for receiving pollen from another individual. It should be observed that many plants still possess a high power of self-fertilisation, although their flowers are excellently constructed for cross-fertilisation--for instance, those of many papilionaceous species.|$|E
60|$|It {{is a more}} {{difficult}} problem why some plants and apparently all the higher animals, after becoming hermaphrodites, have since had their sexes re-separated. This separation has been attributed by some naturalists to the advantages which follow from a division of physiological labour. The principle is intelligible when the same organ has to perform {{at the same time}} diverse functions; but it is not obvious why the male and female glands when placed {{in different parts of the}} same compound or simple individual, should not perform their functions equally well as when placed in two distinct individuals. In some instances the sexes may have been re-separated for the sake of preventing too frequent self-fertilisation; but this explanation does not seem probable, as the same end might have been gained by other and simpler means, for instance <b>dichogamy.</b> It may be that the production of the male and female reproductive elements and the maturation of the ovules was too great a strain and expenditure of vital force for a single individual to withstand, if endowed with a highly complex organisation; and that at the same time there was no need for all the individuals to produce young, and consequently that no injury, on the contrary, good resulted from half of them, or the males, failing to produce offspring.|$|E
60|$|We {{may feel}} sure that {{plants have been}} {{rendered}} heterostyled to ensure cross- fertilisation, for {{we now know that}} a cross between the distinct individuals of the same species is highly important for the vigour and fertility of the offspring. The same end is gained by <b>dichogamy</b> or the maturation of the reproductive elements of the same flower at different periods,--by dioeciousness--self-sterility--the prepotency of pollen from another individual over a plant's own pollen,--and lastly, by the structure of the flower in relation to the visits of insects. The wonderful diversity of the means for gaining the same end in this case, and in many others, depends on the nature of all the previous changes through which the species has passed, and on the more or less complete inheritance of the successive adaptations of each part to the surrounding conditions. Plants which are already well adapted by the structure of their flowers for cross-fertilisation by the aid of insects often possess an irregular corolla, which has been modelled in relation to their visits; {{and it would have been}} of little or no use to such plants to have become heterostyled. We can thus understand why it is that not a single species is heterostyled in such great families as the Leguminosae, Labiatae, Scrophulariaceae, Orchideae, etc., all of which have irregular flowers. Every known heterostyled plant, however, depends on insects for its fertilisation, and not on the wind; so that it is a rather surprising fact that only one genus, Pontederia, has a plainly irregular corolla.|$|E
60|$|There is weighty and {{abundant}} {{evidence that the}} flowers of most kinds of plants are constructed {{so as to be}} occasionally or habitually cross-fertilised by pollen from another flower, produced either by the same plant, or generally, as we shall hereafter see reason to believe, by a distinct plant. Cross-fertilisation is sometimes ensured by the sexes being separated, and in a large number of cases by the pollen and stigma of the same flower being matured at different times. Such plants are called dichogamous, and have been divided into two sub-classes: proterandrous species, in which the pollen is mature before the stigma, and proterogynous species, in which the reverse occurs; this latter form of <b>dichogamy</b> not being nearly so common as the other. Cross-fertilisation is also ensured, in many cases, by mechanical contrivances of wonderful beauty, preventing the impregnation of the flowers by their own pollen. There is a small class of plants, which I have called dimorphic and trimorphic, but to which Hildebrand has given the more appropriate name of heterostyled; this class consists of plants presenting two or three distinct forms, adapted for reciprocal fertilisation, so that, like plants with separate sexes, they can hardly fail to be intercrossed in each generation. The male and female organs of some flowers are irritable, and the insects which touch them get dusted with pollen, which is thus transported to other flowers. Again, there is a class, in which the ovules absolutely refuse to be fertilised by pollen from the same plant, but can be fertilised by pollen from any other individual of the same species. There are also very many species which are partially sterile with their own pollen. Lastly, there is a large class in which the flowers present no apparent obstacle of any kind to self-fertilisation, nevertheless these plants are frequently intercrossed, owing to the prepotency of pollen from another individual or variety over the plant's own pollen.|$|E

50|$|Leea {{flowers are}} visited {{by a variety}} of {{potential}} insect pollinators, including flies, wasps, bees, butterflies, and beetles. Some species may have evolved synchronized <b>dichogamy</b> as a mechanism to prevent self pollination.|$|E
50|$|Herkogamy is {{a common}} {{strategy}} employed by hermaphroditic angiosperms to reduce sexual interference between male (anthers) and female (stigma) function. Herkogamy differs from other such strategies (e.g. <b>dichogamy)</b> by supplying a spatial separation of the anthers and stigma.|$|E
50|$|Self-incompatibility (SI) is {{a general}} name for several genetic {{mechanisms}} in angiosperms, which prevent self-fertilization and thus encourage outcrossing and allogamy.

50|$|With {{regard to}} the dinosaurs' breeding, it {{eventually}} transpires that using frog DNA to fill gaps in the dinosaurs' genetic code enabled a measure of <b>dichogamy,</b> in which some of the female animals changed into males {{in response to the}} same-sex environment.|$|E
50|$|Pecan trees {{may live}} and bear edible seeds {{for more than}} 300 years. They are mostly self-incompatible, because most cultivars are clones derived from wild trees which show {{incomplete}} <b>dichogamy.</b> Generally, two or more trees of different cultivars must be present to pollinate each other.|$|E
50|$|During {{his life}} there, {{he brought out}} a {{pioneering}} manual on crop rotation and elaborated an innovative system of pomology which included more than 600 cultivars of apple and pear. Always interested in plant breeding, Bolotov discovered <b>dichogamy</b> of apple-trees and pointed out to the advantages of cross-pollination.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichogamy</b> {{can have}} both conservation-related {{implications}} for humans, as mentioned above, {{as well as}} economic implications. For instance, groupers are favoured fish for eating in many Asian countries and are often aquacultured. Since the adults take several years to change from female to male, the broodstock are extremely valuable individuals.|$|E
50|$|Thousands of {{attempts}} to cross the American elm with the Siberian elm U. pumila failed. Attempts at the Arnold Arboretum using ten other American, European and Asiatic species also ended in failure, attributed to the differences in ploidy levels, and operational <b>dichogamy,</b> although the ploidy factor has been discounted by other authorities.|$|E
50|$|Homogamy {{refers to}} the {{maturation}} {{of male and female}} reproductive organs at the same time, which is also known as simultaneous or synchronous hermaphrodism and is the antonym of <b>dichogamy.</b> Many flowers appear to be homogamous but some of these may not be strictly functionally homogamous, because for various reasons male and female reproduction do not completely overlap.|$|E
50|$|Environmental sex {{determination}} or ESD is any sex-determination {{system in which}} sex is established by a nongenetic cue (e.g. nutrient availability) experienced within a discrete period after conception. In contrast, genotypic {{sex determination}} (GSD) occurs when sex is established by genetic factors (e.g. sex chromosomes) at conception. Environmental sex determination should also {{not be confused with}} some forms of hermaphroditism in which the sex is determined flexibly after birth, such as <b>dichogamy.</b>|$|E

50|$|In several {{different}} groups of fish, such as wrasses, parrotfish and clownfish, <b>dichogamy</b> — or sequential hermaphoditism — is normal. This can cause a discrepancy in the sex ratios as well. In the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, {{there is only one}} male for every group of 6-8 females. If the male fish dies, the strongest female changes its sex to become the male for the group. All of these wrasse are born female, and only become male in this situation. Other species, like clownfish, do this in reverse, where all start out as non-reproductive males, and the largest male becomes a female, with the second-largest male maturing to become reproductive.|$|E
50|$|Sprengel {{identified}} that flowers were essentially organs designed to attract insects that aided in pollination. He observed that nectar was an attractant {{and that the}} petals had markings that guided insects to the nectar. He also observed <b>dichogamy,</b> both protogyny and protrandry and pointed out that this helped prevent self-pollination. He also noticed self-incompatibility. He classified insects as generalists and specialists and identified the principle of buzz pollination in Leucojum. He noticed that some flowers were nectarless, especially those that were wind-pollinated. He also observed that some flowers such as orchids attracted insects but did not have nectar {{but he did not}} fully understand the nature of the deception. He also recognized nectar theft by certain insects.|$|E
50|$|Sequential {{hermaphroditism}} (called <b>dichogamy</b> in botany) {{is a type}} of hermaphroditism {{that occurs}} in many fish, gastropods, and plants. Sequential hermaphroditism occurs when the individual changes sex at some point in its life. It can change from a male to female (protandry), or from female to male (protogyny) or from female to hermaphrodite (protogynous hermaphroditism), or from male to hermaphrodite (protandrous hermaphroditism). Those that change gonadal sex can have both female and male germ cells in the gonads or can change from one complete gonadal type to the other during their last life stage. Individual flowers are also called sequentially hermaphrodite, although the plant as a whole may have functionally male and functionally female flowers open at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Sequential hermaphrodites (<b>dichogamy)</b> {{occur in}} species {{in which the}} {{individual}} is born as one sex, but can later change into the opposite sex. This contrasts simultaneous hermaphrodites, in which an individual may possess fully functional male and female gonads. Sequential hermaphroditism is common in fish (particularly teleost fish) and some jellyfish, many gastropods (such as the common slipper shell), and some flowering plants. While some sequential hermaphrodites can change sex multiple times, most can only change sex once. Sequential hermaphroditism can best be understood in terms of behavioral ecology and evolutionary life history theory, as described in the size-advantage mode first proposed by Michael T. Ghiselin which states that if an individual of a certain sex could significantly increase its reproductive success after reaching a certain size, it would be to their advantage to switch to that sex.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{groups of}} flowering plants among the Magnoliids {{and the families}} Choranthaceae, Ceratophyllaceae, Nymphaeaceae, Annonaceae, and Aristolochiaceae are bisexual with {{both male and female}} parts present and functional within the usually large floral structure. The main pollinators of these flowers were beetles, flies and thrips. They evolved mechanisms to reduce self-pollination by changing the timing of maturity of the male and female parts. This altered timing mechanism or <b>dichogamy</b> was principally expressed by protogyny or the early maturation of the female parts and only rarely by protandry or the early maturation of the male parts. The early flowers were principally flat and dish-like with the evolution of deeper corolla tubes being a later innovation and principally associated with long-tongued pollinators such as moths. There are a large number of other mechanisms that enhance cross-pollination and prevent self-pollination. The forces that lead to the evolution of such systems as bearing male and female flowers on separate kinds of plants is still unclear.|$|E
50|$|The fruit {{production}} tends to occur irregularly with some years producing larger crops than others (see mast year). Fruiting may begin when {{the tree is}} 4-6 years old, however large crops take 20 years. Total lifespan of J. nigra is about 130 years. Black walnut does not leaf out until late spring when the soil has warmed and all frost danger is past. Like other trees of the order Fagales, such as oaks, hickories, chestnuts, and birches, it is monoecious, with wind-pollinated catkins. Male and female flowers are in separate spikes, and the female flowers typically appear before the male on a single tree (<b>dichogamy).</b> As a consequence, self-pollination is unlikely. However, individual trees usually are not self-sterile; {{if they are not}} pollinated by neighboring trees, they may set self-fertilized seeds. For maximum seed germination, the seeds should be cold-moist stratified for 3-4 months, although the exact time depends on the seed source. The seedlings emerge in April or May and typically grow 90 cm their first year and even more in the 2nd year. Black walnut often loses its leaves earlier than other deciduous trees growing in the same area after having a growing period of 115-135 days.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dichogamy,</b> the {{temporal}} separation {{of male and}} female function, is widespread among angiosperms, yet its causes and consequences are not well understood. Two forms of <b>dichogamy</b> exist: protandry, in which pollen dispersal precedes stigma receptivity, and protogyny, in which the reverse occurs. Species-level comparative studies show that protandrous species tend to be pollinated by bees or flies, whereas protogynous species tend to be windor beetle-pollinated. This suggests a functional role for pollinators in the evolution of <b>dichogamy.</b> We mapped <b>dichogamy</b> and pollination characters onto a phylogeny of angiosperm species. Using the program Discrete, two models of evolutionary change (one allowing only for independent evolution and the other allowing correlated evolution of the two traits) were fit to the phylogeny to test for correlations. Log-likelihood ratio tests and Monte Carlo simulations support a correlated model for the evolution of the type of <b>dichogamy</b> and the form of pollination, demonstrating that the previously reported correlations are robust to phylogenetic correction. However, pollination mode was not found to affect transitions between protandry and protogyny. Rather, an examination of transition rates revealed that the rate of transitions between biotic and abiotic pollination depends on whether a species is protandrous or protogynous. Additionally, we found more support for a role of pollination in the evolution of protogyny from non-protogyny than in the evolution of protandry from non-protandry. This study calls into question some previous findings regarding the role of pollinators in the evolution of <b>dichogamy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Apiaceae {{subfamily}} Apioideae is characterised by intra- and interfloral <b>dichogamy.</b> There are {{two distinct}} patterns: multicycle protandry and multicycle protogyny. Protogyny is almost completely restricted to New World genera. We determined {{the form of}} floral <b>dichogamy</b> for 198 species representing 36 of the 49 genera of Apioideae native to North America north of Mexico. We also examined variation in sex expression (proportions of perfect and staminate flowers) within and among plants in populations of 16 species. The form of <b>dichogamy</b> was constant among congeners, {{with the exception of}} a few adichogamous selfers. The 17 protandrous genera included 11 native to both the Old and New Worlds and six endemic to the Americas. The protandrous genera were characterised by white flowers, the presence of stylopodia, decreasing proportions of staminate flowers in sequentially blooming umbels, wetter habitats, later flowering times, and eastern or transcontinental distributions. The 19 protogynous genera were all New World endemics characterised by mostly yellow or purple flowers, the absence of stylopodia, increasing proportions of staminate flowers in sequentially blooming umbels, drier habitats, earlier flowering times, and western distributions. The transition from protandry to protogyny probably occurred in the late Pliocene, coincident with adaptation to newly forming dry grassland and cold desert habitats. The evolutionary forces involved may have included selection for reproductive assurance, pollinator specialisation, or both. The distinctive patterns of within plant variation in sex expression associated with protandrous and protogynous apioids probably evolved in response to floral <b>dichogamy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Plant {{species have}} several {{mechanisms}} to avoid selfing such as <b>dichogamy</b> or a self-incompatibility response. <b>Dichogamy</b> {{in a single}} flower may reduce autogamy but, to avoid geitonogamy, plants must show flowering synchronization among all their flowers (i. e. synchronous <b>dichogamy).</b> It is hypothesized that one species would not simultaneously show synchronous <b>dichogamy</b> and self-incompatibility because they are redundant mechanisms to reduce selfing; however, {{this has not been}} accurately assessed. Methodology/Principal Findings: This expectation was tested over two years in two natural populations of the closely related Mediterranean spurges Euphorbia boetica and E. nicaeensis, which completely avoid autogamy by protogyny at the cyathia level. Both spurges showed a high population synchrony (Z, 79), and their inflorescences flower synchronously. In E. nicaeensis, there was no overlap among the cyathia in anthesis of successive inflorescence levels and the overlap between sexual phases of cyathia of the same inflorescence level was uncommon (4 – 16 %). In contrast, E. boetica showed a high overlap among consecutive inflorescence levels (74 – 93 %) and between sexual phases of cyathia of the same inflorescence level (48 – 80 %). The flowering pattern of both spurges was consistent in the two populations and over the two successive years. A hand-pollination experiment demonstrated that E. nicaeensis was strictly self-compatible whereas E. boetica was partially self-incompatible. Conclusions/Significance: We propose that the complex pattern of synchronized protogyny in E. nicaeensis prevents geitonogamous crosses and, consequently, avoids selfing and inbreeding depression. In E. boetica, a high probability of geitonogamous crosses may occur but, alternatively, this plant escapes selfing through a self-incompatibility response. We posit that synchronous <b>dichogamy</b> and physiological self-incompatibility do not co-occur in the same species because each process is sufficiently effective in avoiding self-fertilization.

An Endaeus species (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is shown to be the major pollinator of both species, with Carpophilus plagiatipennis (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) as the secondary pollinator of P. coffeoides. Both Polyalthia species show intrafloral <b>dichogamy</b> (protogyny) with a reproductively inactive phase between the pistillate and staminate phases, {{although there is no}} evidence of interfloral <b>dichogamy.</b> A pollination chamber is formed by the inner petals throughout the reproductively active phases. Thermogenesis occurs in P. korinti, with internal floral temperatures up to 6 °C above ambient levels. The heat is presumably an energy reward for the beetles. Although most pollination systems are regarded as diversified and opportunistic, specialized pollination systems are typical of the Annonaceae. Although P. coffeoides and P. korinti have overlapping distributions, habitats, and flowering seasons and share the same pollinators, the extent of competition for pollinators is likely to be lessened due to the abundance and nonspecificity of the beetles. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

Xylopia championii has an essentially xenogamous breeding system, promoted by protogyny. Although X. championii possesses numerous clear adaptations for cantharophily, there is no evidence for a species-specific interaction. The beetles are attracted to the flowers by strong scents; rewards offered to the beetles include heat energy and protection from predators.
