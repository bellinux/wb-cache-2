2500|$|Speaking at the 2015 Shangri-La Dialogue, the Indian Minister of State for External Affairs Gen.(Rtd)V. K. Singh, opined : [...] "It's been an {{interesting}} {{year for the}} MEA. The increased emphasis on our immediate neighbourhood was long overdue. Most importantly, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> message that has gone out to our own people is that Indian lives, wherever they may be, are of paramount importance. I also like to believe our missions and embassies across the globe are far more accessible to our own people than they were before. We live in a changing world where the challenges are endless. MEA {{is the face of}} this new India {{for the rest of the}} world. We have excellent people fully committed to looking after our interests in every corner of the world. The message to all Indians should be loud and clear – we are always there to look after their interests. The foreign policy has been tweaked to further the interests of India." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the album's creation, Sugababes {{signed a}} US record deal with Jay-Z's label Roc Nation. The album was {{recorded}} by Sugababes mostly in Los Angeles and New York {{but as a}} producer liked them so much they {{did a couple of}} sessions in London. The group primarily worked with RedOne, Ryan Tedder, Stargate, Fernando Garibay, up-and-coming production team the Smeezingtons (Phillip Lawrence and Bruno Mars). One of the album's tracks, [...] "No More You", was written by Ne-Yo. Keisha Buchanan compared the song to Rihanna's [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow". The group also collaborated with Sean Kingston. Sugababes also joked that [...] "Rihanna's been like our fourth member, listening to all our songs and saying what she liked and what she didn't like." [...] Buchanan told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat, the album has [...] "definitely got the British feel throughout the album - we've not gone away and gone 'All American' on our fans." [...] Buchanan continued, [...] "I think it's given us a fresh energy again. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing we wanted to do was come back with something different." [...] She also admitted the girls had become [...] "complacent" [...] around the time of Catfights and Spotlights but they also said that they are very proud of that album.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was not wilful," [...] he said; [...] "it came {{of honest}} truth-seeking. And, Rachel, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing is now gone that kept that honesty from finding its way." ...|$|E
60|$|MR. ROBERTS (timidly {{indicating}} a berth). <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>the</b> <b>one.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{short film}} is Marion Cotillard's third {{appearance}} in a Dior promotional project. Of Cotillard, Lynch stated: [...] "She has got that modern quality and old quality that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> great <b>ones</b> have always." ...|$|R
3000|$|... ‘From {{that very}} first session when we watched that video and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing I’ve picked up most from this club is {{understanding}} how you doctor what you watch unintentionally’ (Teacher N) [...]...|$|R
60|$|Ukridge {{preserved}} {{a gloomy}} silence. Of all the disasters of that stricken field, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that came home most poignantly {{to him was}} {{the loss of the}} whisky. It seemed to strike him like a blow.|$|E
60|$|The track from Vera Cruz to Mexico City runs {{persistently}} uphill; indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> {{place is}} 7000 {{feet above the}} level of the other. First, there is the hot zone, where the women by the wayside sell you pineapples and cocoanuts; then the temperate zone, where they offer you oranges and bananas; then the cold country, in which you are expected to drink a filthy liquid extracted from aloes called pulque, that in taste and appearance resembles soapy water.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, madam," [...] said I, [...] "you must {{be aware}} that every volume of a {{narrative}} turns less and less interesting as the author draws to a conclusion,--just like your tea, which, though excellent hyson, is necessarily weaker and more insipid in the last cup. Now, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> {{is by no means}} improved by the luscious lump of half-dissolved sugar usually found at the bottom of it, so I am of opinion that a history, growing already vapid, is but dully crutched up by a detail of circumstances which every reader must have anticipated, even though the author exhaust on them every flowery epithet in the language." ...|$|E
50|$|At dusk when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who is {{no longer}} here, I am happy to choke on the smoke of the burning {{brushwood}} twigs. It is a memento of <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who I can not forget.|$|R
60|$|<b>One</b> of <b>the</b> bankers subscribed five {{thousand}} dollars, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> other <b>one</b> subscribed half as much, but I {{do not remember}} with certainty now whether that was the figure or not. We got designs made--some of them came from Paris.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> other <b>one's</b> {{child is}} going to trouble us much. [...] But I wish Bonaparte himself had been sent farther away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see all that, doctor, {{but of the}} two evils <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> {{we propose}} is the least. My wife says she {{could not bear to}} see this woman about the children, and I have {{a good deal of the}} same feeling myself. At any rate in her present state of health I wish to spare her all trouble and anxiety as much as I can, and {{therefore}} it is better to buy this woman off for the present, even though we may have to run the risk of trouble with her afterwards. Anyhow, something must be done at once. The children have both been squalling for the last hour, though I believe that they have had some milk or something given to them. So I had better send across for Humphreys, the sooner the matter is got over the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{now comes}} a {{question}} which I find some difficulty in answering. Are the Zu-Vendi a civilized or barbarous people? Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one,</b> sometimes the other. In some branches of art they have attained the very highest proficiency. Take for instance their buildings and their statuary. I {{do not think}} that the latter can be equalled either in beauty or imaginative power anywhere in the world, and as for the former it may have been rivalled in ancient Egypt, but I am sure that it has never been since. But, on the other hand, they are totally ignorant of many other arts. Till Sir Henry, who happened to know something about it, showed them how to do it by mixing silica and lime, they could not make a piece of glass, and their crockery is rather primitive. A water-clock is their nearest approach to a watch; indeed, ours delighted them exceedingly. They know nothing about steam, electricity, or gunpowder, and mercifully for themselves nothing about printing or the penny post. Thus they are spared many evils, for of a truth our age has learnt the wisdom of the old-world saying, 'He who increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so. Of {{course it}} will be more {{difficult}} getting up there in the dark; but I shall make a detour of three or four miles, and come up on the other side, and we should be {{much more likely to be}} questioned if we were on foot than on horseback. Should we come upon any party of armed Boers, remember we have just arrived from Standerton, and finding when we got to Newcastle that the force had moved on, and were to take up their station at Talana Hill, we rode on to overtake them. When we get fairly there among them, we will dismount; Field and Peters will stand by the four horses, Horrocks and I will go on. If you hear a row, you will mount and wait a minute or two, and then if we do not come, you will ride off with our horses as well as your own. We shall try and make our way to the edge of the hill, and ought to be able to slip away in the darkness if we can get there before we are shot down or overtaken. However, I don't think there is much chance of our being recognized. Indeed, I expect most of them will be lying down for a sleep before the time comes for action. If there is one thing a Boer hates it is being kept awake at night. I will take one of the Kaffir boys with us. They can see in the dark a great deal better than we can; and as the Boers are sure to have some natives with them, he is quite as likely to pick up news as we are--more so, perhaps, for the natives will sit and talk all night while their masters are snoring. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> we call Jack is the sharpest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose we'll get {{acquainted with}} them {{as soon as they}} begin going to school," [...] mused Faith. [...] "I hope the girls are nice. I don't like most of the girls round here. Even <b>the</b> nice <b>ones</b> are poky. But the Blythe twins look jolly. I thought twins always looked alike, but they don't. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> red-haired <b>one</b> is <b>the</b> nicest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No, I’m {{sure it was}} no joke,” {{broke in}} our hero. “Wait, I’ll try that little side-door. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>the</b> {{watchman}} generally uses.” ...|$|R
30|$|People {{come here}} and they do better work, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{environment}} is <b>one</b> piece of it. We call the green carpet “The Green Carpet of Candor.” That helps quite a bit.|$|R
5000|$|Force {{also told}} CBS 4 St. Louis that, [...] "There's four {{segments}} to his plan ... I {{think the most}} effective one {{has to do with}} what you lose when you go to prison. He talks about losing your freedom and losing your reputation and your self-respect but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that hits home most with people is losing your family." [...] On November 21, 2013 Congressman Bill Posey recognized the Reality Check program and Lawton's honorary police officer status in an open session of the US Congress, making Lawton the first ex-con to be recognized {{on the floor of the}} US Congress.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} game of the 2011 season, the Red Sox had a playoff berth on the line in Baltimore. During a rain delay, Shaugnessy declared, [...] "I think the Rays are not going to win tonight. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing we've {{eliminated}} tonight is the Red Sox season is not going to end tonight. They live to play another day." [...] At the time, the Tampa Bay Rays were trailing the New York Yankees 7-0 in the 8th inning, but won 8-7 in 12 innings. The Red Sox were leading the Baltimore Orioles 3-2 but lost 4-3 and were eliminated from the postseason.|$|E
5000|$|During a panel {{discussion}} on Red Hat Summit in Boston in June 2008 Microsoft's national technology officer Stuart McKee said that [...] "ODF has clearly won". He made also a following statement:We found ourselves so far down {{the path of the}} standardisation process with no knowledge. We don't have a standards office. We didn't have a standards department in the company. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing that we would acknowledge and that we were frustrated with is that, by the time we realised {{what was going on and}} the competitive environment that was underway, we were late and there was a lot of catch-up. It was very difficult to enter into conversations around the world where the debate had already been framed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{writing of}} <b>one</b> act would finish me. Yes, I {{can see that}} would be {{exciting}} business; but what's all this about your engagement to some big actress?" ...|$|R
60|$|This action, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> was <b>the</b> only <b>one</b> {{that looked}} like a defeat given the enemy at this siege. We killed them near 300 men, as I have said, and lost about sixty of our troopers.|$|R
6000|$|... "If we are {{to climb}} that, Macumazahn, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> only <b>one</b> who will live {{to get to the}} top will be that little yellow monkey of yours," [...] and he pointed with his axe at Hans.|$|R

5000|$|In 2010, mutual acquaintances of Moose editor, Robert J. Sherman, and Saving Mr. Banks {{producer}} Alison Owen (Ruby Films) {{arranged a}} meeting in London. (Owen's associate, Josh Davis, represented Owen at the meeting.) Excerpts from {{an early version of}} the Kelly Marcel/Sue Smith screenplay were given to Sherman to bring to his father, Robert B. Sherman, for his review. (The scenes given to Sherman were ones which specifically featured the Sherman Brothers as characters. After reviewing the script sides, Robert B. Sherman agreed to provide an advance copy of the chapter in Moose which specifically dealt with the lead up to and making of Walt Disney's film Mary Poppins. The chapter was entitled, [...] "'Tween Pavement and Stars". [...] In exchange for their help, Owen agreed to list the book and author in the final credits of the film. This was the only compensation the Robert Shermans received. In the summer of 2012, a few months after Robert B. Sherman died, Robert J. Sherman (serving at that point in the capacity of [...] "Trustee" [...] of the Robert B. Sherman Estate) met again with the Saving Mr. Banks creatives including producer Alison Owen, director John Hancock and writer Kelly Marcel. A few days prior to the meeting, Sherman had been given a revised version of the full script. (Principal photography was to commence in two weeks' time.) Elements of the Moose excerpt had been incorporated into the new script. One important contribution is apparent in the scene in between Tom Hanks (as [...] "Walt Disney") and Emma Thompson (as [...] "Pamela Travers") during which Disney derides Travers for insisting that there is [...] "No Red In London". Although the characters speaking the dialogue are different than those portrayed in the book, the dialogue is nearly identical. [...] About the [...] "No Red In London" [...] sequence, scriptwriter Kelly Marcel later blogged, [...] "Anything that shocked me and surprised me went in, because that's how you make drama, you know? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that freaked me out the most, that I could not believe, was that she wouldn't allow the color red to be in the film." ...|$|E
60|$|I mean to {{go again}} and again, many times more, {{and will take}} each day some one department, and so {{endeavor}} to get some real use and improvement out of what I see. Much that is most valuable must be immitigably rejected; but something, according to the measure of my poor capacity, will really be taken into my mind. After all, it was an agreeable day, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> next <b>one</b> will be more so.|$|R
5000|$|... "For years Storm Cat {{has been}} very aware of who he is," [...] said {{stallion}} manager Wes Lanter.

60|$|The Swiss, as {{is natural}} from their greater antiquity, richer recollections, and perhaps from their {{geographical}} position, are more national than the Americans.

The Swiss moreover is pressed upon by his wants, and is often obliged to tear himself from his native soil, in order to find the means of subsistence; and yet very few of them absolutely expatriate themselves.|$|R
