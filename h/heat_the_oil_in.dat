40|$|Transportation of very viscous fluids through {{pipelines}} {{is a real}} challenge. With {{the depletion}} of light <b>oils</b> <b>in</b> reservoirs, it becomes economically favourable to harvest heavy crude oils to contribute to meeting the ever growing energy demand. A suitable candidate for the transportation of these very viscous oil is by means of core-annular flow. Core-annular flow is a flow regime of liquid-liquid two-phase flow, where a low viscous fluid in the annulus (water) is used to lubricate a high viscous fluid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> core (<b>oil).</b> <b>The</b> pressure drop is considerably reduced compared to single phase <b>oil</b> flow at <b>the</b> same <b>oil</b> flow rate. <b>In</b> this study the influence of <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> viscosity on oil-water core-annular flow through a horizontal pipe is investigated experimentally. <b>The</b> fixed <b>oil</b> flow rate is set at 0. 35 l/s at which the watercut is varied between 9 % and 25 % and <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> kinematic viscosity is altered by <b>heating</b> up <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> a range from 3000 cSt at 20 °C to 400 cSt at 50 °C.

At the highest considered viscosity ratio, the scaled pressure drop is almost independent of the watercut.

They {{are at the}} base of the resource triangle because cutting edge technology and higher fuel prices are required to economically produce them. Technologies for oil shale production include surface and in-situ retorting. This study focuses on in-situ oil shale production methodologies. <b>The</b> process of <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> shale to <b>the</b> pyrolysis temperature can be achieved by direct or indirect heating. Direct <b>heating</b> geometries include <b>the</b> Shell in-situ conversion process (ICP) using down hole electric heaters in vertical holes and the ExxonMobil Electrofrac (EF) approach using longitudinal vertical fractures created from horizontal wells and propped with electrically conductive material such as calcined coke. Indirect heating approaches propose injection and circulation of steam or a non-condensable gas like CO_(2). These include the Chevron CRUSH concept of creating horizontal fractures from vertical wells or the Texas A&M University (TAMU) concept using multiple vertical transverse fractures penetrated by horizontal wells (MTFH). The objective of this study is to compare energy efficiency of various in-situ retorting technologies for different heating schemes and well configurations using the commercial adaptive-implicit thermal simulator, STARS of Computer Modelling Group Ltd. (CMG). STARS is a three phase multi-component thermal simulator and is based on vapor-liquid distribution ratio of a component, K values to perform phase equilibrium calculation instead of using the Equation of state (EOS). Shell has applied CMG ?STARS to model its in-situ upgrading project, but is yet to publish details on the input parameters used for modeling. As such, the various thermo-physical parameters like thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, porosity, permeability needed for the numerical simulation are obtained by extensive literature survey of various <b>oil</b> shale deposits <b>in</b> Green river formation of USA. Using CMG ?STARS, we have built and validated simulation model to replicate Shell?s in-situ Conversion Process (ICP) in the Mahogany Demonstration Project South (MDPS).

The machines’ consumption of electrical power in the observed period was derived from the measuring results by numerical integration, based on which the average electrical power was then determined. Regarding the results of measuring carried out on four groups of electromotors, the highest consumption of electrical power has been measured during pressing, and then on electromotor group for the preparation of chips for pelleting.

The energy consumed for <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> is much less as compared with <b>the</b> crude <b>oil</b> recovered from <b>the</b> earth.|$|R
40|$|A method, system, and {{device for}} {{separating}} oil from oil sands or oil shale is disclosed. <b>The</b> method includes <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> sands, spinning <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> <b>oil</b> sands, confining <b>the</b> sand particles mechanically, and recovering <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> substantially {{free of the}} sand. The method can be used without the addition of chemical extraction agents. The system includes a source of centrifugal force, a heat source, a separation device, and a recovery device. The separation device includes a method of confining the sands while allowing <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> to escape, such as through an aperture...|$|R
