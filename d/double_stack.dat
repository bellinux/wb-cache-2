25|$|The Glock 30S is {{a version}} of the Glock 30 that {{features}} a thin slide (same slide as the G36), a Short Frame lower, and a <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> magazine. Like the G30, G30S magazines holds 10 rounds.|$|E
25|$|CSX is {{the only}} class I {{railroad}} serving the Boston area, which it reaches by its Boston Subdivision line to Springfield, and by trackage rights over the Northeast Corridor. CSX also has trackage rights {{over much of the}} southern half of the MBTA's commuter rail network. In February 2013, CSX moved freight operations from its Beacon Park Yard in Allston to a newly refurbished <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> intermodal yard in Worcester and a new transload facility in Westborough.|$|E
25|$|The Glock 17 feeds from staggered-column or <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> {{magazines}} {{that have a}} 17-round capacity (which can be extended to 19 with an optional floor plate) or optional 33-round high-capacity magazines. For jurisdictions which restrict magazine capacity to 10 rounds, Glock offers single-stack, 10-round magazines. The magazines are made of steel and are overmolded with plastic. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. After the last cartridge has been fired, the slide remains open on the slide stop. The slide stop release lever {{is located on the}} left side of the frame directly beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the right-handed shooter.|$|E

25|$|The last {{regularly}} scheduled passenger train {{passed through the}} tunnel in 1958. As of 2012, the tunnel is part of Pan Am Railways, formerly the Guilford Rail System, with trains operated by subsidiary Springfield Terminal Railway, and the property and infrastructure owned by subsidiary Boston and Maine Corporation. The route is currently used to transport freight, but sees rare excursion trains for some special occasions. It was converted to single track in 1957. Clearances were increased in 1997 and 2007, the former by lowering the track, the latter by grinding 15inches off the roof, allowing {{trailer on flat car}} (TOFC) and tri-level automobile carriers to pass. In March 2012, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded a $2 million grant to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation for preliminary engineering on further increasing clearance in the tunnel to allow <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> container trains to use the tunnel.|$|E
2500|$|A City University of New York study, {{published}} in 2011, {{pointed out that}} [...] "no current demand for a containerized truck-rail facility has yet been demonstrated" [...] on Long Island, in part because long distance trucks, including intermodal containers, generally must be unloaded at major distribution centers which typically serve an entire metropolitan area. Few such distribution centers are located on Long Island. The study also noted that standard <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> rail equipment is too wide to run on tracks where third rail is used, {{as it is on}} much of the Long Island Rail Road's passenger routes.ibid.p.19 ...|$|E
2500|$|As noted above, the {{cartridge}} {{was designed to}} be 100% compatible with the M4 platform.

In [...]223/5.56 caliber, cartridges stack in a staggered (<b>double</b> <b>stack)</b> fashion. However, with the much larger [...]458 SOCOM, rounds [...] "single stack" [...] without any modification to the standard GI magazine feed lips or follower, making it the most versatile and cost effective big bore offering in an AR-15 platform.

2500|$|Many ecstasy users {{describe}} {{the potency of}} various ecstasy pills {{in terms of their}} stack such as <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> or triple stack pills. These claims are dubious as {{there is no way to}} verify potency objectively without proper testing. The term [...] "stack" [...] is not intended to measure potency of ecstasy pills, but it is used as a measurement of mass. Single stacks weigh in at 0.20grams, doubles at 0.40grams, and triples at 0.60grams. Furthermore, a high percentage of what is sold as [...] "ecstasy" [...] may contain a combination of MDMA and one or more other substances or may in fact contain no MDMA at all (see [...] "MDMA impurity" [...] above). For these reasons, the [...] "stack" [...] system of strength description is not necessarily trustworthyâ€”as is commonly the case in the underground drug market.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, {{the company}} started StackTrain service, an idea {{following}} {{on from the}} successful LinerTrain venture. This involved using double-stack rail cars that could carry containers stacked {{one on top of}} another rather than carrying just a single level of containers. Each rail car had a well that held the bottom container, thereby lowering the two stacked containers to reduce their combined height to fit within rail line clearances, hence the common name for <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> cars: [...] "well cars." [...] Double-stacking containers in well cars was developed in the late 1970s and first deployed in 1981, but APL was the first shipping line to fully embrace and exploit the concept. APL's cars were developed and manufactured by Thrall Car, while line-haul rail service was initially provided by the Union Pacific Railroad and Chicago and North Western Railway, and eventually by Conrail once track clearances were enlarged.|$|E
2500|$|The first Omni {{dispensed}} with the [...] Browning 1911-style swinging link {{in favour of}} the Browning 1935-type fixed cam to lock the breech. Apart from the method of locking the breech, other features of the pistol were highly innovative. Three new magazine designs were tried. Omni I was a [...]45 ACP pistol with a single stack 7-round [...] magazine. [...] Omni II was a 9mm parabellum pistol with a single stack 9-round [...] magazine. Omni III was a 9mm parabellum pistol with a <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> 13-round [...] magazine, however the first five rounds fed into the action in a single column to {{reduce the likelihood of}} jamming. Another feature was the two-piece ball-jointed firing pin, which was designed to never break. Additionally the Omni had [...] dual sear bars for improved trigger pull; a trigger safety; finger-contoured trigger guard and a decocking manual safety lever. [...] The wealth of features meant the Omni was an expensive pistol to make compared to previous models, and together with its radical appearance, this discouraged commercial sales. Production of the Omni therefore ceased in 1986.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the early}} part of the 20th century, {{commuter}} rail service was provided east of Worcester, with intercity rail continuing on west. [...] The intercity trips were taken over by Amtrak on May 1, 1971, and, on January 27, 1973, the MBTA acquired the line east of Framingham. [...] Service beyond Framingham was discontinued October 27, 1975, as the state did not subsidize it. [...] Conrail took over Penn Central on April 1, 1976. [...] On September 26, 1994, some rush hour trains started to serve Worcester on Conrail trackage (which became CSX trackage on June 1, 1999), extending to other times beginning on December 14, 1996. [...] The MBTA acquired the rest of the line from Framingham to Worcester as part of an agreement announced in 2009. [...] As part of the deal, clearances on the line west of Interstate 495 will be improved, permitting full <b>double</b> <b>stack</b> service from Selkirk Yard in New York to an expanded CSX intermodal freight facility in Worcester and a transload facility near I-495. [...] The deal was closed on June 17, 2010. [...] CSX's Boston Subdivision retains the right to use certain MBTA-owned track.|$|E
