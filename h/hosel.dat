50|$|Putters are {{a special}} class of clubs with a loft not {{exceeding}} ten degrees, designed primarily {{to roll the}} ball along the grass, generally from a point on the putting green toward the hole. Contrary to popular belief, putters do have a loft (often 5° from truly perpendicular at impact) that helps to lift the ball from any indentation it has made. Newer putters also include grooves on the face to promote roll rather than a skid off the impact. This increases rolling distance and reduces bouncing over the turf. Putters are the only class of club allowed to have certain features, such as two striking faces, non-circular grip cross-sections, bent shafts or <b>hosels,</b> and appendages designed primarily to aid players' aim.|$|R
50|$|Under Erich <b>Hösel,</b> {{who became}} {{head of the}} {{modelling}} department in 1903, old styles were revived and reinterpreted. <b>Hösel</b> also restored eighteenth century models. Some appealing work in the Art Nouveau style was produced, but Meissen's mainstay continued to be the constant production of revived eighteenth-century models.|$|E
50|$|The trim ring, usually black (It {{may have}} {{additional}} trim colors), that is found directly {{on top of}} the <b>hosel</b> on many woods and irons. The ferrule is mostly decorative, creating a continuous line between the shaft and the wider <b>hosel,</b> but in some cases it can form part of the securing mechanism between <b>hosel</b> and shaft. Ferrules of differing weights can fine-tune the center of mass of the overall club head, but for these minute adjustments, screw-in weighted inserts at specific points on the club head are usually used instead.|$|E
50|$|The SureFit <b>Hosel</b> {{design is}} a new idea that is {{beginning}} to become a norm in the driver industry. This tool {{is a new}} <b>hosel</b> (neck of the club) that allows the head to come completely off the shaft. This in itself allows for an easier exchange between driver heads and shafts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hosel</b> is {{the portion}} of the club head to which the shaft attaches. Though largely ignored by players, <b>hosel</b> design is {{integral}} to the balance, feel and power of a club. Modern hosels are designed to place as little mass as possible {{over the top of the}} striking face of the club, which lowers the center of gravity of the club for better distance.|$|E
50|$|Traditional woods had a {{very thick}} <b>hosel,</b> often wrapped with thin cord, which {{provided}} a very secure joint between shaft and head {{at the cost of}} a higher center of gravity. Modern metalwoods have largely done away with the <b>hosel</b> altogether, instead anchoring the shaft within the clubhead. This allows as much mass as possible to be contained in the clubhead, lowering the center of gravity.|$|E

5000|$|For irons, the <b>hosel,</b> an {{undefined}} {{part of the}} iron, is very noticeable, {{forming a}} barrel shape on the inside face of the club and the [...] "heel" [...] of the sole of the club. Many modern irons have a more offset <b>hosel,</b> integrated into the clubhead at a lower point and further from the hitting area of the club. This, combined with the perimeter weighting of modern irons, gives a club with the lowest possible center of gravity and the highest possible usable club face.|$|E
5000|$|A {{stroke in}} which the ball comes {{directly}} off the <b>hosel</b> {{is known as a}} [...] "shank", and the ball will usually veer off almost at right angles to the intended target line.|$|E
5000|$|A shank {{occurs when}} the ball is struck on the <b>hosel</b> of the club, and thus flies at a sharp angle {{to the right of}} the {{intended}} direction (or vice versa for a left-handed player).|$|E

50|$|Velbert {{also used}} to have a tram service, and was the meeting point of tramlines from Heidhausen, Neviges, Wülfrath and <b>Hösel</b> with Heiligenhaus. Nowadays a number of bus routes connect Velbert to the {{surrounding}} cities. The city belongs to the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr.|$|E
50|$|The Titleist Drivers always {{feature the}} ability to further {{customize}} the club to fine tune it to the golfer's swing. This is done through {{many aspects of the}} club: the variable extra weight {{in the back of the}} head, the loft of the driver face, and the SureFit <b>Hosel</b> design.|$|E
5000|$|Newer {{designs of}} wedges, {{especially}} the sand wedge, {{have changed the}} shape of the sole slightly to reduce the bounce along the heel (<b>hosel</b> side) and provide a more curved leading edge. This newer shape allows for the golfer to [...] "open" [...] the clubface for short, high-backspin chip shots that [...] "stick" [...] on the green or even roll backwards, without the wide heel lifting the bottom edge of the club at address or the additional angle providing too much bounce.|$|E
50|$|From 1954 to 1977, Chipman {{was with}} the Australian Antarctic Division, Melbourne where {{she worked as a}} typist, {{information}} officer and scientific administrator. During the summers of 1966-67, 1971-72 and 1975-76, she visited Macquarie Island with the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE). In 1975, she was assigned to the Antarctic mainland where she worked as an information officer. She was accompanied by two other women: the photographer Jutta <b>Hösel</b> and Shelagh Robinson, a welfare officer. She was the first woman member of the ANARE Club.|$|E
50|$|Homberg-Meiersberg as a {{municipality}} only {{lasted for}} a short time and was split according to the restructuring law of 10 September 1974 effective 1st January 1975. Counties of the area of Mönchengladbach/Düsseldorf/Wuppertal were affected. Homberg village (both north and south area) was joined into Ratingen (together with the municipalities of Breitscheid, Eggerscheidt, <b>Hösel</b> und Lintorf) to be the new city of Ratingen in Mettmann County. Hofermühle was {{to be part of the}} city of Heiligenhaus, while some areas of Oberheide came to county-city Mettmann.|$|E
50|$|There is one S-Bahn line (S1) {{connecting}} Düsseldorf-Angermund station southbound with Düsseldorf Airport and Düsseldorf Hbf {{as well as}} with Duisburg Hbf and the Ruhrgebiet, northbound. In {{addition to}} the railway service, there are two bus lines (728, 751) connecting Angermund with Ratingen <b>Hösel</b> and Düsseldorf Kaiserswerth. Two Autobahns are accessible via Duisburg Rahm and Ratingen Lintorf, as well as a southbound highway going straight downtown. Subway service is accessible via Düsseldorf-Kaiserswerth, and the airport railway station is one S-Bahn stop south of Angermund.|$|E
5000|$|In 1903, Hackbarth {{was playing}} out of Oconomowoc Country Club {{when he was}} a {{contestant}} in the Western Open in Milwaukee that year. He worked as a golf professional at the Hinsdale Golf Club in Chicago and also in St. Louis, Missouri, but his longest posting—from 1916 through 1951—was at Cincinnati Country Club. An expert club maker, he was known for his patented putter design called [...] "the Hackbarth" [...] that he created circa 1910. The putter was hickory-shafted and had a forked <b>hosel.</b> One example of the collectible putter sold for a hammer price of $5,000 in a Sotheby's auction in 2007. The great amateur, Chick Evans, used the putter as did prolific tournament winner Arthur Bartlett from Iowa.|$|E
50|$|The {{main line}} of the Ruhr Valley line was opened in 1872, from Oberbilk BME (now Düsseldorf-Oberbilk), through Düsseldorf BME (now Düsseldorf Hbf), Düsseldorf-Derendorf, Düsseldorf-Rath and Ratingen Ost, passing through a tunnel through the <b>Hösel</b> {{mountain}} and across a bridge over the Ruhr valley—now {{the site of the}} Kettwig Reservoir (Kettwig Stausee)—to Kettwig, running on the northern side of the Ruhr to Essen-Werden to Essen-Heisingen and crossing the river again to Kupferdreh. From there as far as Essen-Überruhr it combined with the Wuppertal-Vohwinkel-Essen-Überruhr line opened in 1847, which was extended in 1863, after its takeover by the BME, over a new bridge over the Ruhr at Steele via Steele station to connect with the Witten-Dortmund-Oberhausen-Duisburg and the Steele-Dahlhausen lines. In 1874, the Ruhr Valley line was extended {{on the south side of}} the Ruhr via Altendorf to a new bridge over the Ruhr to Dahlhausen. In 1877, a line was opened from Werden to Essen.|$|E
5000|$|The {{striking}} {{face of a}} putter {{is usually}} not perpendicular to the ground: putters have {{a small amount of}} loft, intended to [...] "lift" [...] the ball out of any depression it has made or settled into on the green, which reduces bouncing. This loft is typically 5-6°, and by strict rules cannot be more than 10°. The putter is the only club that may have a grip that is not perfectly round; [...] "shield"-like cross-sections with a flat top and curved underside are most common. The putter is also the only club allowed to have a bent shaft; often, club-makers will attach the shaft to the club-head on the near edge for visibility, but to increase stability, the shaft is bent near the clubhead mounting so that its lie and the resulting clubhead position places the line of the straight part of the shaft at the sweet spot of the subhead, where the ball should be for the best putt. This increases accuracy as the golfer can direct their swing through the ball, without feeling like they are slightly behind it. Many putters also have an offset <b>hosel,</b> which places the shaft of the club in line with the center of the ball at impact, again to improve stability and feel as, combined with the vertical bend, the shaft will point directly {{into the center of the}} ball at impact.|$|E
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{was created}} using LS-DYNA® {{to determine the}} acoustical properties of a golf ball and golf driver head impact. LS-DYNA® has a coupled finite element analysis (FEA) and boundary element method (BEM) solver that uses the integral form of Helmholtz’s acoustic wave equation to deliver predicted sound pressure levels at predetermined acoustic points. Validation of the modeling was done on a simple plate donated by Titleist Golf. The plate was modeled and meshed using TrueGrid and impacted by a three layer golf ball model derived from “Tanka’s” paper on multilayered golf balls. The final converging model consisted of 10, 900 solid fully integrated elements between the ball, plate, and plate support structure. The result was compared to experimental data taken by an air cannon and anechoic chamber that housed strain and acoustical measurement equipment. The sound level predictions from the model showed a promising correlation with experimental data and the focus switched to a golf driver head response during impact. The same ball developed from Tanaka’s paper was used to impact a 350 cc generic golf driver head. The driver head consisted of 3300 fully integrated shell elements throughout the model. The top of the <b>hosel</b> was fixed during the simulation to simulate the connection to the golf shaft. The ball was fired {{at the center of}} the driver’s face and the predicted sound was determined for a point two feet behind the driver head. The BEM prediction of the driver head model showed little correlation with actual recorded impact sounds provided by Cleveland Golf when comparing frequency response functions. These differences could arise from assumptions and simplifications made to speed up the impact simulation. The sound produced from the golf ball after impact was one such factor was not included. Due to the complex shape of the driver head and the total number of elements involved, the numerical solution took upwards of 100 hours to finish. Adding the golf ball sound would greatly increase computational time and not contribute significantly to the overall predicted sound. Although the BEM solution can be used to characterize different driver heads, the impact is too complicated to efficiently and accurately predict the true impact sounds...|$|E
