5000|$|<b>Mast</b> aft <b>rigs</b> {{are viewed}} as unconventional, and since {{recreational}} sailors often choose boats based on what [...] "looks" [...] right, <b>mast</b> aft <b>rigs</b> face resistance in the recreational market.

6000|$|... "A bark is {{a vessel}} with three masts.

50|$|The Freedom 36 Cat Ketch {{is a small}} {{recreational}} keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, {{with wood}} trim. It has a free-standing ketch rig, with the aft mast slightly shorter than the fore mast and both <b>masts</b> <b>rigged</b> with cat sails, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder and a fixed fin keel. With the standard keel it displaces 13400 lb and carries 6500 lb of ballast.|$|R

50|$|A <b>mast</b> aft <b>rig,</b> {{alternately}} {{referred to}} as aft-mast rig, is a sailboat sail-plan that uses a single mast set in the aft half of the hull. The mast supports fore-sails that may consist of a single jib multiple staysails, or a crab claw sail. The mainsail is either small or completely absent. <b>Mast</b> aft <b>rigs</b> are uncommon, but are found on a few custom, and production sailboats.|$|R
2500|$|Under {{the command}} of her first Captain, John Borg, she ran the route to Düsseldorf which {{required}} the ship to have a telescopic smoke stack and <b>folding</b> <b>masts.</b> The Captain changed in September 1914 to Captain G. Flygare. [...] After World War I she sailed the Baltic/North Sea routes.|$|R
50|$|The aircraft's 29 ft {{diameter}} Rotordyne rotor has a chord of 8 in. The Side-By-Side has {{an empty}} weight of 485 lb and a gross weight of 926 lb, giving a useful load of 441 lb. Optional equipment available includes a <b>folding</b> <b>mast,</b> hydraulic wheel brakes and an electric trim system.|$|R
50|$|Pahi {{were the}} {{traditional}} double-hulled sailing watercraft of Tahiti. They were large, two <b>masted,</b> and <b>rigged</b> with crab claw sails.|$|R
5000|$|By {{reducing}} the mainsail in size or eliminating it altogether, the aft <b>mast</b> <b>rig</b> squarely minimizes or completely solves {{the problems associated}} with battens. Battens enable designers to increase the size of mainsails by pushing the mainsail away from the mast. However, the forces of the battens pushing against the mast {{make it more difficult to}} raise or lower the mainsail. On larger rigs, [...] "batten cars" [...] are needed to overcome these forces.|$|R

25|$|Beginning in May 1853, work on {{assembling}} the timbers commenced, as the shipyard workers prepared to start {{construction of the}} new sloop-of-war. The vessel's keel was laid down on 25 June 1853, using material from the oak stockpile; her sternpost was erected on 27 August, and her stem followed {{a couple of weeks}} later. She was launched on 26 August 1854 at 11:45. Fitting-out work then commenced, which included the installation of her <b>masts,</b> <b>rigging,</b> and armament.|$|R
50|$|Architect Ray Wallace was {{commissioned}} in 1957 {{to work with}} Fowler in creating the construction plans. The ships <b>masts,</b> <b>rigging,</b> spars and sails were constructed at Todd Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California, where the Mark Twain s hull was built a few years earlier. After Fowler told Disney that it was customary to put a silver dollar under each mast before it was set, Disney personally put one under each of the Columbias three masts.|$|R

25|$|Potential restorers {{of older}} boats {{who wanted to}} race were {{potentially}} faced with a dilemma of whether to restore a boat to its original specification or make modifications to make an older design competitive with a newer design. For example, a yacht designed under the First International Rule would have a wooden <b>mast,</b> gaff <b>rig,</b> and sails made of cotton; whereas yachts designed under the Third International Rule, such as Vim, had a metal <b>mast,</b> Bermuda <b>rig,</b> and sails made from Dacron.|$|R
5|$|Swiftsure {{had taken}} {{significant}} damage to its <b>masts,</b> <b>rigging</b> and sails during {{the exchange of}} fire, a deliberate ploy by the French captains to limit the ship's movement and prevent its escape. This had minimised casualties on deck by distracting the gunfire, {{and as a result}} only two men were killed and eight wounded, two of whom subsequently also died. French losses were more severe, with four casualties on Indivisible and six killed and 23 wounded on Dix-Août, although neither ship was significantly damaged in the action.|$|R
5000|$|The Society printed {{the first}} Register of Ships in 1764 {{in order to}} give both {{underwriters}} and merchants an idea of the condition of the vessels they insured and chartered: ship hulls were graded by a lettered scale (A being the best), and ship's fittings (<b>masts,</b> <b>rigging,</b> and other equipment) were graded by number (1 being the best). Thus the best classification [...] "A1", from which the expression A1 or A1 at Lloyd's is derived, first appeared in the 1775-76 edition of the Register.|$|R
5000|$|If a boat has two masts, {{it may be}} a {{schooner}}, a ketch, or a yawl, if it is rigged fore-and-aft on all masts. A schooner {{may have}} any number of masts provided the second from the front is the tallest (called the [...] "main mast"). In both a ketch and a yawl, the foremost mast is tallest, and thus the main mast, while the rear mast is shorter, and called the mizzen mast. The difference between a ketch and a yawl is that in a ketch, the mizzen mast is forward of the rudderpost (the axis of rotation for the rudder), while a yawl has its mizzen mast behind the rudderpost. In modern parlance, a brigantine is a vessel whose forward <b>mast</b> is <b>rigged</b> with square sails, while her after <b>mast</b> is <b>rigged</b> fore-and-aft. A brig is a vessel with two <b>masts</b> both <b>rigged</b> square.|$|R
50|$|A Houario {{is a small}} two <b>masted</b> lateen <b>rigged</b> coastal, litoral, or {{riverine}} {{craft of}} Mediterranean origin and use. These boats are often used as pleasure craft.|$|R
50|$|Exclusive of {{the seven}} merchants captured, two of the gunboats were {{destroyed}} and another seven had run on shore by the fire from the two British frigates and brig. The merchants contained ship timber, gunpowder and weapons. The cost to the British was one dead and two slightly wounded on board the Grasshopper. The damage to the latter, however, were extremely severe, as well in hull, <b>masts,</b> <b>rigging</b> and sails. With the exception of an anchor shot away from the Mercury, {{the damage to the}} two frigates was confined to their sails and rigging.|$|R
50|$|Chief Quartermaster R. Broun {{designed}} the boats {{and made the}} first model (still existing, at the Central Naval Museum). The dubel boat was a shallow draft rowing and sailing galley with 18 pairs of oars and two <b>masts</b> <b>rigged</b> with lateen sails. They were designed {{to be able to}} pass the Dnieper rapids and also serve as bridge pontoons to move armies across the Dnieper or other rivers. The boats were armed with six two-pounder falcon guns mounted on swivels. They were capable of transporting 50 soldiers and two small battalion guns.|$|R
