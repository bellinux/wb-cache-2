50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{that produces the}} psychedelic and <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of 2C-T-7 {{is most likely to}} result from action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines.|$|R
5000|$|... 2C-I is a {{psychedelic}} phenethylamine of the 2C family. It {{was first}} synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and described in his 1991 book PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story. The drug is used recreationally for its psychedelic and <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects</b> and is sometimes confused for the analog 25I-NBOMe, nicknamed [...] "Smiles," [...] in the media.|$|R
5000|$|... 4-Fluoroamphetamine (4-FA; 4-FMP; PAL-303; [...] "Flux"), {{also known}} as para-fluoroamphetamine (PFA) is a psychoactive {{research}} chemical of the phenethylamine and substituted amphetamine chemical classes. It produces stimulant and <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects,</b> and is described subjectively as being between amphetamine and MDMA. As a recreational drug, 4-FA is sometimes sold along with related compounds such as 2-fluoroamphetamine and 4-fluoromethamphetamine.|$|R
50|$|An {{analogue}} of amphetamine, iofetamine {{has shown}} to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine {{as well as}} induce the release of these neurotransmitters and of dopamine with similar potencies to other amphetamines like d-amphetamine and p-chloroamphetamine. In addition, on account of its high lipophilicity, iofetamine rapidly penetrates the blood-brain-barrier. Accordingly, though not {{known to have been}} reported in the medical literature, iofetamine likely possesses psychostimulant and possibly <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects.</b> However, based on structure-activity relationships, it may also be highly neurotoxic to serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons similarly to most other para-halogenated amphetamines.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect on}} {{serotonin}} {{may explain the}} similar <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of MDMA and MDA. However, (S)-MDA has higher potency as an agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor than (R)-MDMA; thus MDA tends to cause more psychedelic-like effects, such as visual hallucinations. MDMA can also produce psychedelic-like visual effects, though these are generally less pronounced than those of MDA or require higher doses to become apparent. Relative to MDMA, MDA is also a more potent releasing agent of norepinephrine and dopamine and hence is more stimulating in comparison. In addition, MDA is notably several-fold more neurotoxic to serotonergic neurons in comparison to MDMA.|$|R
50|$|The {{recreational}} drug MDMA ("ecstasy") {{and a variety}} of related drugs have been described as empathogen-entactogens, or simply as entactogens. These agents possess serenic and empathy-increasing properties in addition to their euphoriant effects, and have been associated with increased sociability, friendliness, and feelings of closeness to others as well as emotional empathy and prosocial behavior. The <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of these drugs are thought to be related to their ability to temporarily increase the levels of certain brain chemicals, including serotonin, dopamine, and, particularly, oxytocin. Certain other serotonergic drugs, such as 5-HT1A receptor agonists, also increase oxytocin levels and may possess serenic properties as well. The phenylpiperazine mixed 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor agonists eltoprazine, fluprazine, and batoprazine have been described based on animal research as serenics.|$|R
5000|$|... 2C-T-7 is a {{psychedelic}} phenethylamine of the 2C family. In {{his book}} PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story, Alexander Shulgin lists the dosage range as 10 to 30 mg. 2C-T-7 is generally taken orally, and produces psychedelic and <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects</b> that last 8 to 15 hours. Up until Operation Web Tryp and three deaths, {{two of which}} involved the use of other drugs in addition to 2C-T-7, and one which involved an excessive insufflated dose, 2C-T-7 was sold commercially in Dutch and Japanese smartshops and online. It is known on the streets as Blue Mystic or 7th Heaven. There has been little real research done on this chemical other than Shulgin's comments in PiHKAL and a few small animal studies mostly aimed at detecting metabolites.|$|R
5000|$|... 5-Methoxy-alpha-ethyl{{tryptamine}} (5-MeO-α-ET) is a {{psychoactive drug}} {{and member of}} the tryptamine chemical class. It produces psychedelic, <b>entactogenic,</b> and stimulant <b>effects.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 5-MeO-α-ET {{produces}} <b>entactogenic</b> and stimulant <b>effects</b> {{that can}} last 4-6 hours. However, little information {{exists on the}} psychopharmacological effects of this compound, thus considerable variation with regard to dosage and effects can be expected.|$|R
50|$|Metaescaline, or 3,4-dimethoxy-5-ethoxyphenethylamine, is a lesser-known {{psychedelic}} drug. It is {{an analog}} of mescaline. Metaescaline was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved), the dosage range {{is listed as}} 200-350 mg, and the duration listed as 8-12 hours. Metaescaline produces mental insights, <b>entactogenic,</b> MDMA-like <b>effects,</b> and TOMSO-like activation. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of metaescaline.|$|R
40|$|Our insight {{regarding}} {{the effects of}} oxytocin on our brain and behaviour is growing at an astronomical pace. Oxytocin is principally known for its regulatory roles in birth, lactation, and social behaviours. Recent evidence suggests that oxytocin may also be an important modulator of endogenous mood, {{as well as the}} rewarding and <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of some drugs of abuse. The special issue was built on the research presented in a plenary session at the 2012 Annual Conference of the International Behavioral Neuroscience Society in Hawaii chaired by Femke T. A. Buisman-Pijlman and Jillian H. Broadbear. This special issue will highlight recent developments in our understanding of the role of oxytocin in drug and social rewards and other behaviours related to drug abuse. Additionally, it highlights potential roles for the endogenous oxytocin system, how these might be affected by drug use and how this could affect the susceptibility to drug abuse and dependence. The special issue will present research findings, from animal and human studies, along with current reviews. Together these provide a comprehensive overview of how interactions between oxytocin, neurotransmitters and the stress axis may produce long-term effects on behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{recreational}} drug ecstasy {{is widely used}} among dance clubbers for its acute euphoric and <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects.</b> Ecstasy exerts its acute effects by increasing the extracellular concentration of monoamines in the brain by reversing the functions of reuptake mechanisms. These elevations in extracellular monoamine concentrations result in wake promoting effects, body hyperthermia and reductions in local cerebral blood flow. However, on the long-run, ecstasy reduces serotonin concentration and density of serotonergic markers in several brain areas. Functional deficits, like sleep disturbances, anxiogenic- and aggressive behavioral responses and mood disorders also may occur. However, {{one of the most}} prominent adverse effects is related to the cognitive functions. Following ecstasy use attenuated retro- and prospective memory and defective higher order cognitive functions can be observed, especially in heavy users. Several studies indicated the involvement of the endocannabinoid system, the sleep regulating centers and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis based on or parallel to serotonergic damage in these processes. Recent evidence, however, also showed that changes in one of the latter systems can influence the functions of each other. In this review we summarize the related literature, and propose a complex mechanism for the long-lasting cognitive deficits following heavy ecstasy use...|$|R
50|$|BDB {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Alexander Shulgin. In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved), the dosage range {{is listed as}} 150-230 mg and the duration is listed as 4-8 hours. BDB produces <b>entactogenic,</b> MDMA-like <b>effects.</b> While pleasant and euphoric, BDB is also fairly sedating and some users feel {{that the lack of}} stimulant effect makes it less enjoyable than other similar drugs. Additional side effects associated with BDB include nystagmus and dizziness. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of BDB.|$|R
40|$|Mephedrone is a {{synthetic}} cathinone {{and one of}} the most popular recreationally used new psychoactive substances. The aim of the present study was to characterize the in vitro pharmacology of novel analogs of mephedrone and related newly emerged designer stimulants.; We determined norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin transporter inhibition potencies and monoamine release in transporter-transfected human embryonic kidney 293  cells. We also assessed monoamine receptor and transporter binding affinities.; Mephedrone analogs potently inhibited the norepinephrine transporter and, with the exception of 3 -methylmethcathinone (3 -MMC), inhibited the serotonin transporter more potently than the dopamine transporter. Similar to classic amphetamines, mephedrone analogs were substrate-type monoamine releasers. 5 -(2 -Aminopropyl) indole (5 -IT) was a highly potent monoamine transporter inhibitor and a releaser of dopamine and serotonin. 4 -Methylamphetamine (4 -MA) mediated efflux of all three monoamines and inhibited the serotonin transporter more potently than the dopamine transporter, unlike amphetamine. N-methyl- 2 -aminoindane (N-methyl- 2 -AI) was a selective norepinephrine transporter inhibitor and norepinephrine releaser, whereas 5 -methoxy- 6 -methyl- 2 -aminoindane (MMAI) was a selective serotonin transporter inhibitor and serotonin releaser. All of the drugs interacted with monoamine receptors.; The predominant actions on serotonin vs. dopamine transporters suggest that dimethylmethcathinones, 4 -MA, and MMAI cause <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects</b> similar to 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine, whereas 3 -MMC, 5 -IT, and N-methyl- 2 -AI have more stimulant-type properties like amphetamine. Because of pharmacological and structural similarity to mephedrone, similar health risks can be expected for these analogs...|$|R
40|$|Clinical outcome {{following}} 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) intake {{ranges from}} mild <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects</b> to a life-threatening intoxication. Despite ongoing research, the clinically most relevant mechanisms causing acute MDMA-induced adverse effects remain largely unclear. This complicates the triage {{and treatment of}} MDMA users needing medical care. The user's genetic profile and interactions resulting from polydrug use are key factors that modulate the individual response to MDMA and influence MDMA pharmacokinetics and dynamics, and thus clinical outcome. Polymorphisms in CYP 2 D 6, resulting in poor metabolism status, as well as co-exposure of MDMA with specific substances (e. g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) can increase MDMA plasma levels, but can also decrease the formation of toxic metabolites and subsequent cellular damage. While pre-exposure to e. g. SSRIs can increase MDMA plasma levels, clinical effects (e. g. blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) can be reduced, possibly due to a pharmacodynamic interaction at the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT). Pretreatment with inhibitors of the dopamine or norepinephrine reuptake transporter (DAT or NET), 5 -HT(2 A) or α-β adrenergic receptor antagonists or antipsychotics prior to MDMA exposure can also decrease one or more MDMA-induced physiological and/or subjective effects. Carvedilol, ketanserin and haloperidol can reduce multiple MDMA-induced clinical and neurotoxic effects. Thus besides supportive care, i. e. sedation using benzodiazepines, intravenous hydration, aggressive cooling and correction of electrolytes, it is worthwhile to investigate the usefulness of carvedilol, ketanserin and haloperidol {{in the treatment of}} MDMA-intoxicated patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and aims: Mephedrone (4 -methylmethcathinone, 'Meow') is a {{drug that}} has rapidly {{increased}} in popularity in recent years. Users report mephedrone as having the stimulant-like qualities of methamphetamine and cocaine, combined with the prosocial, <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of MDMA. The toxicity of mephedrone is uncertain and requires study. Design and methods: Experiments were undertaken in rats to assess the effects of mephedrone. These include biotelemetry studies (to assess effects on body temperature and cardiovascular parameters), self-administration studies (to examine rewarding properties), Fos immunohistochemistry studies (to examine brain activation), and behavioural studies of acute and long-term effects. Results: Mephedrone was intravenously self-administered by rats across a wide dose range. Rats given mephedrone showed increased locomotor activity with extreme hyperactivity and tachycardia observed with high doses. At normal ambient temperatures mephedrone caused few body temperature changes but at ambient temperatures of 30 °C a potentially lethal hyperthermia was observed (body temperatures > 40 °C). Patterns of brain activation obtained with mephedrone resembled a mixture of MDMA and methamphetamine, and were consistent with an effect of the drug on dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin systems. Weeks after repeated exposure to mephedrone rats showed impaired object recognition memory but few signs of long-term neurotransmitter depletion. Discussion and conclusions: These results confirm user reports of MDMA/cocaine like properties of mephedrone and suggest compulsive patterns of use may emerge. They also flag the possible danger of using the drug in hot environments. Finally the possibility that long-term memory impairment may occur with mephedrone is of concern, and warrants study in user populations. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Although use of 2 ̆ 7 ecstasy 2 ̆ 7 (drugs sold as {{containing}} 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is prevalent, it {{is typically}} infrequent, and treatment presentations involving ecstasy {{as a principal}} problem drug are relatively rare. Human case reports and animal literature suggest dependence potential, although {{there may be some}} unique aspects to this syndrome for ecstasy in comparison to other substances. The Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) was examined to determine whether this could usefully identify 2 ̆ 7 dependent 2 ̆ 7 ecstasy consumers. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1, 658 frequent (at least monthly) ecstasy consumers across Australia, assessing drug use, associated harms and risk behaviours. Dependence was evaluated with the SDS, using a cut-off of ≥ 4 to identify potential 2 ̆ 7 dependence 2 ̆ 7. Results: One fifth of the participants were screened as potentially dependent. These individuals used ecstasy more frequently, in greater amounts, engaged more extensively in risk behaviours and reported greater role interference than other participants. These findings were independent of methamphetamine use or dependence. The underlying structure of the ecstasy SDS was bifactorial. Conclusions: The SDS has demonstrated construct validity as a screening tool to identify ecstasy users at elevated risk of experiencing adverse consequences, including features of dependence. The underlying structure of dependence symptoms differs for ecstasy compared to other drug classes, and some dependent consumers use the drug infrequently. The unique neurotoxic potential and <b>entactogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of ecstasy may require a distinct nosological classification for the experience of dependence associated with the drug. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Mephedrone is a {{synthetic}} stimulant drug causing <b>entactogenic</b> and hallucinogenic <b>effects.</b> A systematic review of all existing empirical research and literature from 2009 - 2012 {{on this new}} psychoactive drug was conducted. This paper aims to report on that review. Design/methodology/approach – The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Electronic databases were utilised using the search terms “mephedrone” and product nomenclature; “Plant Food”, “Feeder”, “Meow Meow”, “Miaow”, “Drone”, “Meph” “Bubbles”, “Charge”, and “MCat”. The search was restricted to publications from 2009 - 2012, and produced 702 results. Data were collected by {{one member of the}} research team and cross checked by another. A primary screening was carried out to exclude inaccurate search results and drugs other than mephedrone. The results were studied and duplicates removed; 598 results were discarded, with 104 deemed suitable for inclusion. Findings – The review underscores mephedrone's popularity despite legislative controls. Drug displacement patterns from illicit to licit were observed prior to controls, with blending of mephedrone and other substitute cathinones with street drugs thereafter. User consumptive choices are grounded in availability, perceptions of legality and safety, curiosity and perceived quality of drug outcomes within poly drug taking repertoires. Clinical reports indicate that mephedrone has high abuse potential and toxicity, with several dependence symptoms. Risk assessment, detection, diagnosis and treatment of mephedrone use are difficult due to polydrug use and associated mental health disorders. Research limitations/implications – The review points to the need for further research into the pharmacology and toxicity of mephedrone in order to better equip clinicians with assessment, diagnosis and treatment strategies to reduce morbidity. Practical implications – The increasingly diversified new psycho stimulant market where mephedrone is a major player poses unprecedented challenges for drug surveillance, policy, community and clinical practice. Social implications – Stricter legislative controls including internet vendor responsibility for supply of mephedrone have been suggested, along with raising public awareness on an international level through coordinated efforts. Originality/value – The last review was published in 2009 by the Psychonaut Webmapping Group. This review brings together a comprehensive new set of data sources as they relate to this drug...|$|R
