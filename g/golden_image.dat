5|$|Though {{the tale}} of Maya Sita told in the Ramayana adaptations is absent from the original, the concept of Maya Sita first appears in the epic itself. In the battle between Rama and Ravana, Indrajit – the son of Ravana – creates an {{illusion}}ary Sita (Maya Sita) and kills {{her in front of}} Rama's monkey general Hanuman, as a war tactic to dampen the spirits of Rama's army. The fooled Hanuman reports it to Rama, who is also dejected by the news. However, they soon realise that it must be an illusion of Indrajit. Another surrogate Sita appears in a later interpolation of the epic. At the end of the Ramayana, a <b>golden</b> <b>image</b> of Sita is subsisted for the real Sita to be on side of Rama in sacrifices, after Sita's abandonment by Rama when her chastity is questioned by his subjects.|$|E

Inside, a single <b>golden</b> <b>image</b> of Amida (circa 1053) is installed on a high platform. Raigo (Descent of the Amida Buddha) paintings on the wooden doors of the Hō-ō-dō are often considered an early example of Yamato-e, Japanese-style painting, because they contain representations of the scenery around Kyōto.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{approach}} for vessels extraction edge-based image segmentation is proposed. Vessels segmentation and extraction {{play an important role}} in supporting computer assistance for diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). Diabetic Retinopathy is a severe and widely spread eye disease. The algorithms to detect and extract vessels from retinal images are mainly based on morphological filtering and segmentation methods. We proposed an image segmentation algorithm by integrating mathematical morphological edge detector with TopHat technique. In this paper, theoretical backgrounds and procedure illustrations of the proposed algorithm are presented. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on several images of publicly available database. The results are compared with those obtained by other known methods as well as with the <b>golden</b> <b>images.</b> It is shown that the proposed method can yield a specificity value as high as 82 %, which is comparable to the results obtained by other known methods...|$|R
30|$|In {{both cases}} image {{construction}} is required {{prior to the}} application deployment scenario which is realised {{as a collection of}} Virtual Machines (VMs) containing application components. To the best of our knowledge, no current software solution provides capabilities to both generate base images that contain a functional operating system and install and configure a cloud application automatically. This therefore provides the opportunity to create multiple different configurations of an application, where these different deployment configurations can be exploited, by selecting the most appropriate configuration to serve the required system load while saving energy. For comparison, a tool such as Packer [4] can be used to create <b>golden</b> <b>images</b> for multiple platforms from a single source configuration but does not provide support for the automated installation of software into these images. Another example tool such as Vagrant [5] enables software development teams to create identical development environments but does not provide a mechanism to automate the deployment of software into these environments.|$|R

Only the three children would not bow: it was necessary that some should show that there was a God in heaven, and that divine worship was due alone to him (Dan 3:10-12). But they run the hazard of being turned to ashes, in a burning fiery furnace, for so doing. But necessity has a loud voice, and shrill in the ears of a tender conscience: this voice will awake jealousy and kindle a burning fire within, for the name, and cause, and way, and people, of the God of heaven.|$|E

The Ark was set up in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and the Beth-shemites offered sacrifices and burnt offerings (1 Sam. 6:1-15). Out of curiosity the men of Beth-shemesh gazed at the Ark; and as a punishment, seventy of them (fifty thousand and seventy in some translations) were smitten by the Lord (1 Samuel 6:19). The Bethshemites sent to Kirjath-jearim, or Baal-Judah, to have the Ark removed (1 Samuel 6:21); and it was taken to the house of Abinadab, whose son Eleazar was sanctified to keep it. Kirjath-jearim remained the abode of the Ark for twenty years. Under Saul, the Ark was with the army before he first met the Philistines, but the king was too impatient to consult it before engaging in battle. In 1 Chronicles 13:3 it is stated that the people were not accustomed to consulting the Ark in the days of Saul.|$|R
