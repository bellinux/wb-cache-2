25|$|<b>Human</b> <b>Capital</b> is the {{backbone}} of Human Development and economic development in every nation. Mahroum (2007) suggested that at the macro-level, <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> management is about three key capacities, the capacity to develop talent, the capacity to deploy talent, {{and the capacity to}} draw talent from elsewhere. Collectively, these three capacities form {{the backbone}} of any country's <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> competitiveness.
