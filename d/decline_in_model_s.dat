30|$|In {{regard to}} the deeper part of the {{northern}} segment, both models allow for the propagation of the rupture and exhibit the largest amounts of slip, simply because the stress drop is largest there. The contrast between the shallow and deeper parts tends to be bigger <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> <b>S</b> than <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> C, because of the suppression of slip <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> <b>S</b> from {{the existence of the}} shallow gap as well as the negative interactions between the overlapped branch Faults B 1 and B 2. It appears that Faults H 1 on the deeper part of the northern segment was not ruptured <b>in</b> both <b>Models</b> <b>S</b> and C. This is understandable because the potential stress drop computed from the initial tractions shows negative values (Fig.  6). We discuss this aspect later. Similarly, Fault H 2 tends not to slip, while the smaller confining pressure at the shallower depth caused small slip.|$|R
30|$|We {{observed}} in Fig.  9 b {{that the larger}} slip occurs on Faults B 1 than B 2 in both of the <b>Models</b> <b>S</b> and C. This is expected from the lower dip angle of Fault B 1, which {{is closer to the}} optimal orientation. However, we find that the slip on Fault B 1 in Fig.  9 appears to be larger <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> C than <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> <b>S</b> that is expected from the existence of the gap <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> <b>S</b> reducing the slip amount. Moreover, as we focus on the slip amount on Fault B 2, we find that <b>Model</b> <b>S</b> displays a larger value than Model C. This different distribution in slip on Fault B 2 is explained in terms of the difference in the stress shadowing effect caused by Fault B 1; the stress shadow effect appears to affect more significantly than the transient rupture velocity or the propagation directions, because there exists the time difference of each rupture, where Fault B 2 is ruptured {{under the influence of the}} stress shadow caused by Fault B 1. The stress shadow effect is spatially limited by the existence of the gap <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> <b>S</b> that reduces its area of influence, while it influences a larger area <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> C because the slip continues to the central segment. In fact, we can observe the slip being suppressed <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> C on the left half of Fault B 2 (Fig.  9 c), while the slip on Fault B 1 or on the primary fault displays a larger value (Fig.  9 d). Consequently, the amount of the ground surface breaks tends to be smaller <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> <b>S</b> since the slip is distributed over several branches, while it becomes larger <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> C where the slip is localized to a single fault.|$|R
40|$|We present two new in situ core {{accretion}} {{simulations of}} Saturn with planet formation timescales of 3. 37 Myr (<b>model</b> <b>S</b> 0) and 3. 48 Myr (<b>model</b> <b>S</b> 1), consistent with observed protostellar disk lifetimes. <b>In</b> <b>model</b> <b>S</b> 0, we assume rapid grain settling reduces opacity due to grains from full interstellar values (Podolak 2003). <b>In</b> <b>model</b> <b>S</b> 1, {{we do not}} invoke grain settling, instead assigning full interstellar opacities to grains in the envelope. Surprisingly, the two models produce nearly identical formation timescales and core/atmosphere mass ratios. We therefore observe a new manifestation of core accretion theory: at large heliocentric distances, the solid core growth rate (limited by Keplerian orbital velocity) controls the planet formation timescale. We argue that this paradigm should apply to Uranus and Neptune as well. Comment: 4 pages, including 1 figure, submitted to ApJ Letter...|$|R

40|$|Phenomenological {{models for}} {{evolution}} of dusty galaxies and E/S 0 galaxies, respectively, are developed to address two major questions concenring galaxy populations in deep infrared (IR) surveys: (1) Do normal late-type galaxies or starburst galaxies (including galaxies with obscured AGNs) dominate among sources in deep IR surveys?

Overall, the shapes of the largest peaks look similar to each other, but the simulation results lack the secondary peak seen in the inversion result, which is likely produced by the slip on the deeper part of the northern segment in the inversion result. In the current simulations, the gap only assumed on the shallow depth <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> <b>S,</b> but if the gap extended to the deeper depth as separating the northern segments from the central segment <b>in</b> <b>Model</b> <b>S,</b> then the timing of the slip of the deeper part of the northern segment would be delayed more significantly and would be recognized as an isolated peak.
