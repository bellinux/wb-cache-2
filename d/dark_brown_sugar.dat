5000|$|Muscovado, panela, piloncillo, chancaca, jaggery {{and other}} natural <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugars</b> have been {{minimally}} centrifuged or not at all. Typically these sugars are made in smaller factories or [...] "cottage industries" [...] in developing nations, where they are produced with traditional practices that do not make use of industrialized vacuum evaporators or centrifuges. They are commonly boiled in open pans upon wood-fired stoves until the sugar cane juice reaches approximately 30% of the former volume and sucrose crystallization begins. They are then poured into molds to solidify or onto cooling pans where they are beaten or worked vigorously to produce a granulated <b>brown</b> <b>sugar.</b> In some countries, such as Mauritius or the Philippines, a natural <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> called muscovado is produced by partially centrifuging the evaporated and crystallizing cane juice to create a sugar-crystal rich mush, which is allowed to drain under gravity to produce varying degrees of molasses content in the final product. This process approximates a slightly modernized practice introduced in the 19th century to generate {{a better quality of}} natural <b>brown</b> <b>sugar.</b> A similar Japanese version of uncentrifuged natural cane sugar is called kokuto (黒糖 kokutō). This is a regional specialty of Okinawa and is often sold in the form of large lumps. It is sometimes used to make shochu.|$|R

5000|$|In {{following}} a modern recipe that specifies [...] "brown sugar", one usually may {{assume that the}} intended meaning is light brown sugar, but which one prefers is largely a matter of taste. Even in recipes such as cakes, where the moisture content might be critical, {{the amount of water}} involved is too small to matter. More importantly, adding <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> or molasses will impart a stronger flavor, with more of a suggestion of caramel.|$|E
5000|$|A Zeeuwse bolus (...) or Zeeuwse bolussen is a sweet pastry of Jewish origin {{from the}} Dutch {{province}} of Zeeland. They {{are made by}} baking a white bread dough rolled in <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> in a spiral shape, lemon zest( [...] rare and only at {{some parts of the}} region) and cinnamon.

5000|$|The Codex Alimentarius {{requires}} {{brown sugar}} to contain at least 88% of sucrose plus invert sugar. Commercial brown sugar contains from 4.5% molasses (light brown sugar) to 6.5% molasses (<b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar)</b> based on total volume. Based on total weight, regular commercial brown sugar contains up to 10% molasses. The product is naturally moist from the hygroscopic {{nature of the}} molasses and is often labelled as [...] "soft."

Three quarters of optional dried fruit must be added followed by {{one and a half}} cup of water. Two tablespoons of butter are also recommended.|$|E
5000|$|Caramel {{sauce is}} made by mixing {{caramelized}} sugar with cream. Depending on the intended application, additional ingredients such as butter, fruit purees, liquors or vanilla are often used. Caramel sauce is used {{in a variety of}} desserts, though most notably as a topping for ice cream. When it is used for crème caramel or flan, it is known as clear caramel and only contains caramelized sugar and water. Butterscotch sauce is made with <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> butter and often a splash of whiskey. Traditionally, butterscotch is a hard candy more in line with a toffee, with the suffix [...] "scotch" [...] meaning [...] "to score".|$|E
50|$|Breakfast {{and lunch}} differ little in Dutch cuisine and both consist of bread {{with a wide}} variety of cold cuts, cheeses and sweet toppings; such as hagelslag, vlokken, muisjes, gestampte muisjes, {{chocolate}} spread, treacle (a thick, <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> syrup called stroop), apple butter and peanut butter.The Dutch are famous for their dairy products and especially for their cheeses. The vast majority of Dutch cheeses are semi-hard or hard cheeses. Famous Dutch cheeses include Gouda, Edam, and Leyden. A typically Dutch way of making cheese is to blend in herbs or spices during the first stages of the production process. Famous examples of this are cheeses with cloves (usually the Friesian Clove), cumin (most famously Leyden cheese), or nettles.|$|E

5000|$|Although <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> {{has been}} touted as having health {{benefits}} ranging from soothing menstrual cramps to {{serving as an}} anti-aging skin treatment, there is no nutritional basis to support <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> as a healthier alternative to refined sugars despite the negligible amounts of minerals in <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> not found in white sugar.|$|R
50|$|At this period, sugar {{cultivation}} {{and manufacture}} in Queensland was still experimental. In the late 1860s the principal sugar-growing area extended from Tingalpa and Cleveland {{south to the}} Redland Bay, Logan and Albert districts. The red clay soil on Macleay and Russell Islands in southern Moreton Bay {{was similar to that}} at Redland Bay, and the islands had the additional advantage of being free from frosts. On the mainland a number of small sugar crushing mills and distilleries were erected, employing an open pan system which produced a coarse, <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar.</b> With the introduction in the mid-1870s of the more expensive vacuum pan system, which produced a finer white sugar, and increasing competition from the Mary and Burnett River districts, sugar cultivation and manufacture {{in the southern part of}} the colony declined. Some mills survived, but by the 1880s, farmers at Cleveland, Redland Bay and the Bay islands were growing mainly bananas, fruits and vegetables.|$|E
50|$|The {{ingredients}} {{often include}} butter or margarine, molasses, sugar, and sometimes white vinegar. The molasses {{is the critical}} ingredient, for it is less sweet than sugar and has a slightly bitter flavour that gives bonfire toffee its unique taste. One recipe calls for 230 g of butter, 230 g of treacle, and 450 g of brown sugar. The mixture is cooked {{over medium heat until}} melted, and allowed to boil (while constantly stirring rapidly) for 15 minutes. The hot mixture is then poured into buttered forms (such as a cake pan or special forms). Recipes calling for the use of vinegar vary these ingredients. For example, one recipe from 1922 calls for 550 g of <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> 280 ml of molasses, one tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, one tablespoon (15 ml) of butter, and one teaspoon (5 ml) of sodium bicarbonate (or baking soda). White vinegar gives the toffee a slightly sharper taste, and alters the chemistry of the toffee so that it is not so brittle. It also helps the toffee to set. Other recipes call for about 5 imppt L of water, and vary the amount of the other ingredients. Some recipes call for the use of golden syrup (In the US this is light molasses mixed with corn syrup) instead of molasses/treacle.|$|E
