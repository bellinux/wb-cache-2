60|$|TANNER. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> {{suggesting}} anything discreditable. In fact, I am {{a bit of}} a Socialist myself.|$|E

60|$|LEXY (huffily). <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of intruding, <b>I</b> am sure, Mr. Burgess. Good morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Under these circumstances, sir," [...] said I, [...] "you will {{be rather}} {{relieved}} {{to hear that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of becoming a builder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed, my dear, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> saying so,' said Lady Merton; 'yourself {{and your}} mamma {{can be the}} only judges in such a matter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} for it. I {{remember}} to have observed her, {{for a few}} moments only, in the street. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> frightening her." ...|$|E
60|$|PERCIVAL. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> being offensive. Surely {{there is}} nothing that can wound any lady in--[He hesitates, not quite convinced]. At least--er--I really didnt mean to be disagreeable.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{document}} {{received in}} this surreptitious fashion," [...] he pronounced, [...] "is presumably a treasonable document. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of returning it to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said R. Jones. [...] "Yes. [...] . Miss Valentine, may I {{begin by}} begging you {{to realize that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of {{insulting}} you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I perceive. Well, well, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{taught you}} enough, my friend. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of <b>having</b> an {{assistant}} who {{is superior to}} myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True--true," [...] I replied; [...] "and, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> {{alarming}} you unnecessarily--but {{you should}} use all proper caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mille pardons! Ma'm'selle!" [...] replied Monsieur De Kock, thus addressed--"a {{thousand}} pardons! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> offending. Ma'm'selle Laplace--Monsieur De Kock will do {{himself the}} honor of taking wine with you." ...|$|E

60|$|STEPHEN. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of {{becoming}} a man of business in any sense. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> capacity for business and no taste for it. I intend to devote myself to politics.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} he is dead," [...] he said, [...] "certainly <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> killing him. I thought {{of nothing but}} {{preventing}} him repeating his shot, which {{he was on the}} point of doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it {{from reading}} the Trial," [...] I answered. [...] "The lawyer who cross-examined you spoke almost in the very words which I have just used. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> {{offending}} you, Mr. Dexter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you knew}} the coercion,' muttered Gilbert. 'I protest, as I would to my dying day, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> going near the stables when I set out, and would never have consented could I have helped it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} an execrable joke; {{therefore}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of regarding it as one. You shall be held to your offer, Agatha. Are you in love with me?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am {{indifferent}} as to {{the money}} matters of other people, sir. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> marrying Miss Waddington for her money before I {{knew that she was}} your granddaughter; nor have I now that I do know it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed! I {{considered}} it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked of his future wife dying with him. What did he mean by such a pagan idea? <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> dying with him--he might depend on that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Winston {{glanced down}} deprecatingly at his attire. [...] "I must explain that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> {{trespassing}} on your hospitality," [...] he said.

6000|$|... "Don't look serious, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> {{of falling}} {{into the hands of}} Montcalm's savages. Still, there is no doubt the {{expedition}} is a risky one, and it is just as well to be prepared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{girl has}} nothing to do with it, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of picking a quarrel. I am not a bully nor a fire-eater. I simply wish to make a point that a gentleman must." ...|$|R

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> {{trying to}} force the reply from her which she had {{hitherto}} withheld; but she appeared to put that interpretation on what I had said.

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> making Mr. angry, {{but he did}} get angry. He {{left off}} {{speaking}} {{to me by my}} Christian name; he called me by my surname.

6000|$|... "Friends, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> {{saying a}} word when I came here, but, God forgive me, I have {{committed}} a sin, which seems to force me to speak and warn you against giving way to strong drink. I had--nay, I have--a dear friend who once put on the Blue Ribbon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear Miss Robarts, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> {{whatever}} {{of putting}} the burden of my family {{on the shoulders of}} another person. They must return to their own home immediately--that is, as soon as they can be brought back." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> to {{describe}} the fight between Myles Falworth and Walter Blunt. Fisticuffs of nowadays are brutal and debasing enough, but a fight with a sharp-edged broadsword was not only brutal and debasing, but cruel and bloody as well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] said Harry, [...] "I {{acknowledge}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been hasty, but I must disclaim {{the charge of}} disrespect to you, sir. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> whatever of broaching the subject to-day, but my feelings, unhappily, carried me away, and--and--in fact--" ...|$|R
