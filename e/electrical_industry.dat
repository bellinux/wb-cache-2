25|$|A railway {{air brake}} is a {{conveyance}} braking system which applies {{the means of}} compressed air which modern locomotives use to this day. George Westinghouse, a pioneer of the <b>electrical</b> <b>industry,</b> invented the railroad air brake in 1872.|$|E

25|$|The two commercially {{important}} micas, used in {{a variety}} of applications, are Muscovite, the principal mica used by the <b>electrical</b> <b>industry,</b> thermally stable to 500°C, is used in high frequency and radio frequency capacitors. The second is Phlogopite, which remains stable up to 900°C and is {{used in a}}pplications in which a combination of high-heat stability and electrical properties is required.|$|E
25|$|During the Industrial Revolution the <b>electrical</b> <b>industry</b> {{exploited}} {{direct current}} (DC) and low frequency alternating current (AC), {{but not much}} was known about frequencies above 20kHz, what are now called radio frequencies. In 1887, four years previously, Heinrich Hertz had discovered Hertzian waves (radio waves), electromagnetic waves which oscillated at very high frequencies. This attracted much attention, {{and a number of}} researchers began experimenting with high frequency currents.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{commercial use}} of Bakelite in the <b>electrical</b> <b>industry</b> was the molding of tiny insulating bushings {{the size of}} mustard seeds, made in 1908 for the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation by Richard W. Seabury of the Boonton Rubber Company. Bakelite was soon used for non-conducting parts of telephones, radios and other electrical devices, including bases and sockets for light bulbs and electron tubes, supports for any type of electrical components, automobile distributor caps and other insulators.|$|E

25|$|In the North American <b>electrical</b> <b>industry,</b> {{conductors}} {{larger than}} 4/0 AWG are generally {{identified by the}} area in thousands of circular mils (kcmil), where 1kcmil = 0.5067mm2. The next wire size larger than 4/0 has {{a cross section of}} 250kcmil. A circular mil is the area of a wire one mil in diameter. One million circular mils is the area of a circle with 1000mil (1inch) diameter. An older abbreviation for one thousand circular mils is MCM.|$|E
25|$|With {{respect to}} industry, the plateau {{is the most}} {{important}} region of Switzerland. The traditional textile industries are situated especially in the central and eastern regions. During the last decades, however, it lost importance. Today's most important industries are the machine industry, the automotive industry, the <b>electrical</b> <b>industry,</b> the fine & micro mechanical, watch & electronic industries, next to the optical and metal construction's. The food industry processes domestic as well as foreign produces. Furthermore, wood processing and paper converting are also important.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Henry Sutton was an {{inventor}} from Ballarat. Sutton designed an electric continuous current dynamo with a practical ring armature. This design {{could be used}} as an electric motor and the rapid incline of the <b>electrical</b> <b>industry</b> followed. Sutton was involved in devising and constructing different telephone designs. Sutton interacted closely with Bell (the inventor of the telephone), Bell came to visit Sutton in order to see a complete telephone system that was set up in Sutton's family warehouse.|$|E

25|$|The {{definitions}} of potential difference (volt), electric current (ampere), electrical resistance (ohm) were {{defined in terms}} of metric units, international agreement having been reached at a series of IEC Congress in Chicago between 1881 and 1906 when the <b>electrical</b> <b>industry</b> was in its infancy. At that time the metric system had become established in continental Europe while in the United Kingdom metrication was an active issue. Similarly, the units of measurement used in the radiological industry were {{defined in terms of}} metric units, agreement first having been reached at the second International Congress of Radiology at Stockholm (1928).|$|E
25|$|Feiker put {{together}} a group of local civic organizations to erect the tree {{in the center of}} the Ellipse and decorate it, and the U.S. <b>electrical</b> <b>industry</b> donated $5,000 worth of electrical cables (which were buried under the Ellipse and provided the tree with electricity). The site for the tree was personally approved by Grace Coolidge. Arrangements were also made to have 3,000 city school children present to sing Christmas carols and the United States Marine Band to play music. The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) agreed to broadcast the event on radio. The tree was decorated with more than 2,500 electric bulbs in red, white, and green donated by the Electric League of Washington.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} decorated, outdoor {{national}} Christmas tree {{originated with}} Frederick Morris Feiker. Feiker was a highly educated engineer {{who had been a}} technical journalist for General Electric from 1906-1907 and editor of Electrical World and Electrical Merchandising from 1915 to 1921. In 1921, Feiker joined the personal staff of United States Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover as a press aide. The Society for Electrical Development (an <b>electrical</b> <b>industry</b> trade group) was {{looking for a way to}} encourage people to purchase more electric Christmas lights and use electricity, and Feiker suggested that President Calvin Coolidge personally light the tree as a way of giving Christmas lights prominence and social cachet. Vermont Republican Senator Frank L. Greene accompanied Feiker to the White House, where they successfully convinced Coolidge to light the tree.|$|E

25|$|Hydro-Québec's {{expertise}} {{at building}} and operating {{a very high}} voltage electrical grid spreading over long distances has long been recognized in the <b>electrical</b> <b>industry.</b> TransÉnergie, Hydro-Québec's transmission division, operates the largest electricity transmission network in North America. It acts as the independent system operator and reliability coordinator for the Québec interconnection of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation system, and {{is part of the}} Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC). TransÉnergie manages the flow of energy on the Quebec network and ensures non-discriminatory access to all participants involved in the wholesale market. The non-discriminatory access policy allows a company such as Nalcor to sell some of its share of power from Churchill Falls on the open market in the State of New York using TransÉnergie's network, upon payment of a transmission fee.|$|E
25|$|Many {{vegetable}} oils {{are used to}} make soaps, skin products, candles, perfumes and other personal care and cosmetic products. Some oils are particularly suitable as drying oils, and are used in making paints and other wood treatment products. Dammar oil (a mixture of linseed oil and dammar resin), for example, is used almost exclusively in treating the hulls of wooden boats. Vegetable oils are increasingly {{being used in the}} <b>electrical</b> <b>industry</b> as insulators as {{vegetable oils}} are not toxic to the environment, biodegradable if spilled and have high flash and fire points. However, vegetable oils are less stable chemically, so they are generally used in systems where they are not exposed to oxygen, and they are more expensive than crude oil distillate. Synthetic tetraesters, which are similar to vegetable oils but with four fatty acid chains compared to the normal three found in a natural ester, are manufactured by Fischer esterification. Tetraesters generally have high stability to oxidation and have found use as engine lubricants. Vegetable oil is being used to produce biodegradable hydraulic fluid and lubricant.|$|E
