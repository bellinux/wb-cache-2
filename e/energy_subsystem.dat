40|$|A major {{constraint}} of {{sensor network}} deployments is their power supply: batteries {{have a limited}} lifetime and must be replaced when depleted. Recent advances {{in the field of}} energy harvesting mean that sensor nodes can now be powered by environmental energy such as light, vibration, or temperature differences; however, the variety of environments that sensor nodes are deployed into, and their varying levels of power consumption which is dependent on their operation, dictates the type of power supply which must be fitted to the node. This demonstration includes the work done at the University of Southampton in developing a plug-and-play energy architecture for sensor nodes that can accommodate a range of power sources and stores, and agent-based coordination which allows sensor nodes to negotiate between one another to allocate sensing tasks.

To do this, we apply an additive multiplier decomposition methodology to the Andalusian Social Accounting Matrix for the year 1995. The method implemented allow us disaggregate the Andalusian energy sector’s revenue-generating process into different effects depending on the source of the demand. To gain a better understanding of the behaviours of the different branches of the economy, we divide Andalusian productive activities into two groups, which we call subsystems (<b>energy</b> <b>subsystem</b> and complementary subsystem). We then apply the multiplier decomposition methodology to each one separately. This way, we can identify the influence that the final demand of each of these groups has on income generation and energy sector emissions in the Andalusian economy.
