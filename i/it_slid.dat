5|$|The Cunard White Star Line's RMS Queen Elizabeth {{was named}} after her. She {{launched}} the ship on 27 September 1938 in Clydebank, Scotland. Supposedly, the liner started to slide into the water before Elizabeth could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner's bow just before <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> out of reach. In 1954, Queen Elizabeth sailed to New York on her namesake.|$|E
5|$|On lap 43 of the race, Bianchi {{lost control}} {{of his car and}} veered right towards the run-off area {{on the outside of the}} Dunlop Curve (turn seven) of the Suzuka Circuit. He {{collided}} with the rear of a tractor crane tending to the removal of Adrian Sutil's Sauber after Sutil had spun out of control and crashed in the same area a lap before. Spectators' video footage and photographs of the accident revealed that the left side of Bianchi's Marussia car was extensively damaged and the roll bar destroyed as <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> under the tractor crane. The impact was such that the tractor crane was partially jolted off the ground causing Sutil's Sauber, which was suspended in the air by the crane, to fall back to the ground. The race was stopped and Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi {{collided}} with {{the rear of the}} tractor crane, which caused extensive damage to his car; its roll bar was destroyed as <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> underneath. The impact jolted the tractor crane off the ground, causing Sutil's car (suspended in the air by the crane) to fall to the ground. Marshals moved away from the scene to avoid being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of 254 g0 (2,490m/s2), and data from the FIA's World Accident Database—which sources information from racing accidents worldwide—indicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of 123km/h (76mph) and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding to a team radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extracted from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's medical centre. Transport by helicopter was impossible due to the weather; Bianchi was taken by ambulance with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, about 15km (9.3mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.|$|E
50|$|Each dial is {{associated}} with a one-digit display window located directly above it, which displays the value of the accumulator for this position. The complement of this digit, in the base of the wheel (6, 10, 12, 20), is displayed just above this digit. A horizontal bar hides either all the complement numbers when <b>it</b> is <b>slid</b> to the top, or all the direct numbers when <b>it</b> is <b>slid</b> {{toward the center of the}} machine. It thereby displays either the content of the accumulator or the complement of its value.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the series, the {{residence}} {{was one of}} the chief sets for the television series. The set was last seen in the series finale [...] "Chosen", and <b>it</b> possibly <b>slid</b> in the crater when the hellmouth was destroyed.|$|R

25|$|Flight 703 pancaked onto {{a hilltop}} and broke up as <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> along the ground, killing the flight {{attendant}} instantly. Passenger Reginald John Dixon tried to free two others trapped near the wing root as the wreckage caught fire. He failed to free them and a flash fire critically burned him. He died from his injuries two weeks later. Thus three passengers also died and many others sustained injuries.|$|E
25|$|On 24 December 2002 a Swearingen Metroliner III (OY-BPH) of Danish {{operator}} North Flying crashed after {{take off}} from Aberdeen on a positioning flight to Aalborg in Denmark. Immediately after take-off the aircraft was suspected to have suffered a major power loss in its right engine and crashed into a field just {{to the south of}} the airport. <b>It</b> <b>slid</b> along the field and through a fence onto Dyce Drive, a main road into the airport, where it hit a moving car and then came to rest. The two crew and driver of the car survived the accident, with only one crewmember sustaining minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|During {{the later}} {{part of the}} 18th century, {{fundamental}} internal reforms were attempted in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> into extinction. The reform activity, initially promoted by the magnate Czartoryski family faction known as the Familia, provoked a hostile reaction and military response from neighboring powers, but it did create conditions that fostered economic improvement. The most populous urban center, {{the capital city of}} Warsaw, replaced Danzig (Gdańsk) as the leading trade center, and the importance of the more prosperous urban social classes increased. The last decades of the independent Commonwealth's existence were characterized by aggressive reform movements and far-reaching progress in the areas of education, intellectual life, art and the evolution of the social and political system.|$|E
60|$|Kim nodded. Lurgan Sahib, {{fifteen feet}} off, laid {{one hand on}} the jar. Next instant, it stood at Kim's elbow, full to within half an inch of the brim--the white cloth only showing, by a small wrinkle, where <b>it</b> had <b>slid</b> into place.|$|R
60|$|Lute {{looked about}} her. She stood {{alone on the}} world. Her lover was gone. There was naught to show of his existence, save the marks of Comanche's hoofs {{on the road and}} of his body where <b>it</b> had <b>slid</b> over the brink.|$|R

25|$|After <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> off the runway, {{parts of}} the {{aircraft}} caught on fire. This reached high intensity and centered around the middle section of the fuselage and the right wing. The fire was not started when the aircraft left the runway, but commenced no later than 13 seconds afterwards. Forty-five seconds after the overrun the first fire engine arrived at the scene, the second five seconds after that. By 1 minute and 45 seconds after overrun, most of the fuselage was on fire. The tail collapsed at 3 minutes and 30 seconds after overrun, and 5 minutes and 45 seconds inside left engine stopped running. One fire engine left to resupply with water at 8 minutes, returning at 13 minutes. The first municipal fire engine came to the scene after 18 minutes. The fire crew initially did not see anyone near the wreckage and presumed all the passengers had perished. Only later did they realize that people standing near by were actually survivors. The fire was extinguished at 09:30.|$|E
500|$|The U-20 class {{boats were}} armed with two [...] torpedo tubes {{located in the}} front and carried a {{complement}} of two torpedoes. They were also equipped with a 66mm/26 (2.6in) deck gun and an [...] machine gun. The first of the class to be launched was U-21, when <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> down the ways on 15 August 1916; the final boat launched was U-22 on 27 January 1917. The boats entered service between August and November 1917.|$|E
2500|$|The {{remainder}} of the fuselage and wings rotated counter-clockwise approximately 330 degrees, as <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> westward. Video showed it pivoting about the wing and the nose while sharply inclined to the ground. It came to rest {{to the left of}} the runway, [...] from the initial point of impact at the seawall.|$|E

Installer inverts ring with pliers before <b>it</b> is <b>slid</b> over cable, then returns {{it to its}} original position after installation. Ring is in correct orientation, and coils are tightly compressed for high reliability fastening...|$|R
60|$|The {{undulations}} of the sea, {{which had}} rocked them hitherto so softly, had {{by that time}} assumed a decided form and force, so that the boat rose on the oily back of each billow that passed under <b>it,</b> and <b>slid</b> back into a watery hollow, to be relifted by each successive wave.|$|R
2500|$|The {{plane was}} {{cleared to land}} at 16:01 EDT on Runway 24L, which, at [...] in length, is the {{shortest}} runway at Pearson Airport.

2500|$|The {{song was}} {{modestly}} successful, charting in the US and the UK. In the UK, [...] "Balmes" [...] debuted on the Official Singles Chart at number 65, {{on the chart}} dated November 8, 2001. The following week, <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> to number 95, then off of the chart completely. Upon its release, the song became Esthero's only charting single in the UK, and Ian Pooley's second-highest-peaking single. It remains his third highest peaking single in that country; his only higher-peaking singles are [...] "900 Degrees," [...] which reached number 57, and [...] "Piha," [...] which reached peaked at number 53.|$|E
2500|$|The {{airplane}} {{slid off}} {{the left side of}} the runway, bouncing into the air as it struck a parked airplane (identified in newspaper reports only as [...] "an old Army Air Force trainer") and set it ablaze. [...] The airliner's left wing cut through the wall of a hangar, causing the roof to partially collapse, and then exploded into flames as its right wing tore through the Dallas Aviation School. The craft then struck the ground, broke into several pieces, and turned sideways as <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> across Love Field Drive, finally coming to rest after plowing into a building owned by the American Magnaflux Corporation.|$|E

5000|$|Front-loading {{refers to}} observing the hole card as <b>it</b> is <b>slid</b> under the upcard. [...] Newer methods of hole-carding {{concentrate}} on observation before the down card is {{placed under the}} upcard. This provides information about the card even if the dealer upcard is not a ten or an ace. The advantage varies depending on the rules, the percentage of cards seen, and the strategies used.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was off course and at too low an altitude. This {{was discovered by}} the pilots prior to impact and they attempted to pull the aircraft up, but hit a field with its starboard wing tip and landing gear. It succeeded at ascending slightly, but continued to fly nearly at ground level. Eighty meters (260ft) later it collided with the overhead lines of the West Coast Railway Line, knocking off two concrete posts. It continued for another [...] before hitting ground, at which point it inverted. <b>It</b> <b>slid</b> for another [...] before coming to a halt, [...] from a house. Fire broke out {{in some of the}} wreck parts, although not in the main section of fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|Clydebank {{also became}} Cunard Line's {{preferred}} shipbuilder, building its flagship liners [...] and [...] Prior to construction commencing on the Lusitania in 1904 [...] the shipyard was reorganized to accommodate {{her so that}} she could be launched diagonally across the widest available part of the river Clyde where it met a tributary, the ordinary width of the river being only [...] compared to the [...] long ship. The new slipway took up the space of two existing ones and was built on reinforcing piles driven deeply into the ground to ensure it could take the temporary concentrated weight of the whole ship as <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> into the water. In addition the company spent £8000 to dredge the Clyde, £6,500 on new gas plant, £6,500 on a new electrical plant, and £18,000 to extend the dock and £19,000 for a new crane capable of lifting 150 tons as well as £20,000 on additional machinery and equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Hannah Montana 3 debuted and {{peaked at}} number {{two in the}} United States's chart, Billboard 200, selling 137,000 copies with a good amount being {{purchased}} online due to it charting at number 5 in the Top Digital Albums and number 18 in Top Internet Albums. On other charts in the US, such as Top Kid Audio and Top Soundtracks, the album debuted in the top spot. In Top Soundtracks, the franchise replaced herself at number 1, [...] was previously in the top slot and descended to number 2. Cyrus was at the first two positions for several weeks. In its second week, Hannah Montana 3 slid down one spot, to number 3 with 73,000 copies sold (down 47%) in Billboard 200, meanwhile it stayed at number 1 for Top Kid Albums and Top Soundtracks; in {{the third week of}} it charting, Hannah Montana 3 fell to number 5. In its fourth week on the charts <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> down to number seven with 41,000 copies sold.|$|E
5000|$|Like many in {{the avant-garde}} environment, Podlipny began flirting with socialism, and played some part in the European {{revolutions}} of the 1910s. As historian Victor Neumann writes, [...] "his political orientation had been left-wing, and <b>it</b> sometimes <b>slid</b> into the far left". Art critic Pavel Șușară completes the image: young Podlipny was [...] "moved by the suffering of others, fascinated by risk and hunted by police".|$|R

2500|$|At one point, The Edge of Nights {{audience}} {{was estimated to}} be more than 50% male, largely due to the show's crime format and its late start time of 4:30 PM (3:30 Central). In July 1963, the show was moved to the 3:30/2:30 time period after CBS gave the 4:30/3:30 slot back to the affiliates. The Edge of Night dominated the 3:30 slot even over otherwise-hit programs like NBC's You Don't Say! and ABC's Dark Shadows and One Life to Live. However, when the show moved to 2:30 PM (1:30 Central) on September 11, 1972, as per Procter and Gamble's insistence upon running all of its shows in a continuous daily marathon, <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> from a solid #2 in the Nielsen ratings to near-last; it has been hypothesized that the show suffered this sudden and drastic ratings plummet because many male viewers and teenagers were unable to make it home from work or school earlier in the afternoon to watch. (This was not the only time that Procter & Gamble's insistence on a certain timeslot for one of their soaps caused a significant drop in ratings; the same problem affected the long-running Search for Tomorrow a decade later.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 8 May 1951. It involved a Hunting Air Travel Vickers 639 Viking 1 (registration: G-AHPD) operating an international scheduled passenger flight from Bordeaux Mérignac to RAF Bovingdon. Following an uneventful takeoff from Mérignac, the no. 1 engine suddenly {{began to lose}} power when the aircraft climbed through [...] and the pilot in command throttled down to initial climbing speed. The pilot then shut down the malfunctioning engine, feathered the propeller and applied full power to the no. 2 engine {{to compensate for the}} loss of engine no. 1. However, this was insufficient to maintain altitude and led to the flightdeck crew's decision to execute a gear-up landing. When the aircraft touched the ground, <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> for about [...] before coming to a halt. There were no fatalities among the 32 occupants (five crew and 27 passengers). Accident investigators established the probable cause as the disconnecting of the articulated control rod of the propeller governor {{due to the lack of}} a split pin on the governor spindle, and due to the nut of the ball joint of the control spindle having been unscrewed by force.|$|E
2500|$|A two-storey {{rectangular}} {{tower was}} built on the motte and was the main residence. [...] The first floor held the lord's hall, with a latrine and bed chambers. [...] The ground floor was the main storage space and also accommodated the lord’s household. [...] The tower was built as a defensive structure with a small number of narrow windows. [...] There was only the one entrance on the ground floor which also housed a portcullis. [...] On the second floor, two doors exited onto the walkway of the curtain wall. This wall completely enclosed the bailey. The put-log holes built into the curtain wall indicate the presence of a number of buildings. [...] On the north side a later building was erected that housed a kitchen, a great hall with reception room and the great chamber bedroom. [...] It is possible that this building was constructed by the Sutherlands. It is not known when the serious subsidence took place but evidence of repairs to the tower are evident before <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> down the motte. The tower shows no further repairs and may have collapsed early on but the newer hall became the main residence. [...] This building shows continued alterations over time. In 1689, John Graham, 1st Viscount of Dundee was a guest of Lord Duffus just before the battle of Killiecrankie and {{would be one of the}} last important visitors before the castle’s abandonment.|$|E
50|$|The would-be assassins {{supposedly}} {{rolled a}} large wooden log onto the tracks {{when it was}} dark and wedged it into place. According to retired Detective Superintendent Cliff McHardy, it was meant to de-rail the train and, if it did, it would have smashed into an embankment. It failed because, at the time, the train was travelling unusually slowly when it struck the blockage, though <b>it</b> still <b>slid</b> for 700 metres before coming to a stop.|$|R
60|$|This {{was not so}} easy. The batter up tried a {{sacrifice}} hit, but the ball rolled down well towards the pitcher, who landed it at first in a twinkling.
