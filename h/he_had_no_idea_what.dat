25|$|Shortly after Blue Star, Parmar {{visited the}} auto {{mechanic}} and electrician Inderjit Singh Reyat, {{who lived in}} Duncan, British Columbia, a small community north of Victoria on Vancouver Island. He asked him to construct a bomb; Reyat later claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> it would be used for. Reyat asked various {{people in the community}} about dynamite, saying he wanted to remove tree stumps on his property. Reyat also discussed explosives with a co-worker, while expressing anger at the Indian government and Indira Gandhi in particular.|$|E

500|$|Adelina Poerio {{was cast}} as the {{fleeting}} red-coated figure after Roeg saw her photo at a casting session in Rome. Standing at only 4'2" [...] tall, she had {{a career as a}} singer.

500|$|Completing his {{training}} in June 1941, Pilot Officer Waddy was posted to the North African theatre with No.250 (Fighter) Squadron RAF, operating P-40 Tomahawks and, later, Kittyhawks. He was befriended and mentored by the RAAF's top-scoring ace, Clive [...] "Killer" [...] Caldwell, who became godfather to Waddy's daughter. Waddy's first operational sortie was as Caldwell's wingman; {{he found the}} ensuing dogfight so fast and confusing that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> was happening and afterwards had to ask the more experienced pilot how things had gone. On 9December, he registered his first victory—in a Tomahawk {{that had previously been}} Caldwell's personal mount—when he shared in the destruction of a Messerschmitt Bf110 twin-engined fighter near El Adem.|$|E
500|$|Pelé {{was born}} on 23 October 1940, in Três Corações, Minas Gerais, Brazil, the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born João Ramos do Nascimento) and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of two siblings. He was named after the American {{inventor}} Thomas Edison. His parents decided to remove the [...] "i" [...] and call him [...] "Edson", {{but there was a}} mistake on the birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as [...] "Edison", not [...] "Edson", as he is called. He was originally nicknamed [...] "Dico" [...] by his family. He received the nickname [...] "Pelé" [...] during his school days, when it is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favorite player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bilé, which he misspoke but the more he complained the more it stuck. In his autobiography, Pelé stated <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> the name means, nor did his old friends. Apart from the assertion that the name is derived from that of Bilé, and that it is Hebrew for [...] "miracle" [...] (פֶּ֫לֶא), the word has no known meaning in Portuguese.|$|E

500|$|When {{the pair}} {{decided to make}} [...] "This Was a Real Nice Clambake" [...] into an {{ensemble}} number, Hammerstein realized <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> a clambake was like, and researched the matter. [...] Based on his initial findings, he wrote the line, [...] "First came codfish chowder". [...] However, further research convinced him the proper term was [...] "codhead chowder", a term unfamiliar to many playgoers. [...] He decided to keep it as [...] "codfish". [...] When the song proceeded to discuss the lobsters consumed at the feast, Hammerstein wrote the line [...] "We slit 'em down the back/And peppered 'em good". [...] He was grieved to hear from a friend that lobsters are always slit down the front. [...] The lyricist sent a researcher to a seafood restaurant and heard back that lobsters are always slit down the back. [...] Hammerstein concluded that there is disagreement about which side of a lobster is the back. [...] One error not caught involved the song [...] "June Is Bustin' Out All Over", in which sheep are depicted as seeking to mate in late spring—they actually {{do so in the}} winter. [...] Whenever this was brought to Hammerstein's attention, he told his informant that 1873 was a special year, in which sheep mated in the spring.|$|E
500|$|... "Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood" [...] {{was written}} by Dan McGrath and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. The episode was recorded at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles. Ernest Borgnine guest starred in the episode as himself. The staff liked {{his work on the}} films Marty and From Here to Eternity, so they asked him to do a guest appearance on the show. Borgnine felt he could not say no to the offer because his grandchildren were fans of the show. In the final scene of the episode, Borgnine plays a guitar and sings campfire songs with the children. Borgnine was a guitar player in real life, so he brought his own guitar with him to the recording studio. Borgnine apologized because he felt that he was not being able to sing very well, but Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart, thought his voice [...] "added to the authenticity of his character". The Simpsonss creator Matt Groening thought the recording sessions with Borgnine were [...] "so much fun". Hank Azaria, who provides the voice of Apu, commented that Borgnine [...] "had no idea what the hell he was doing. He's a good actor, and he read his lines just fine, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> the show was, no idea what we were doing." ...|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{commented that}} [...] "Gaga {{has created a}} world that, while oppressive, also looks great." [...] In a {{separate}} piece Montgomery added that [...] "... she may have finally reached the point in her career where not even she can top herself." [...] Rolling Stones Daniel Kreps called the video a [...] "cinematic epic." [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly, liked the video; however, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> was going on: [...] "I can’t wait to hear Lady Gaga explain her latest video, “Alejandro.” Mostly because after watching it (twice!), I have absolutely no clue what’s going on beyond the obvious." [...] Anthony Benigno from Daily News felt that [...] "the shock songstress' new music video [...] is chock full of bed-ridden S imagery that makes it look like the softcore answer to The Matrix. Randall Roberts from Los Angeles Times said [...] "the clip reinforces the notion that no one understands the convergence of image and music right now better than Gaga." [...] Jed Gottlieb from the Boston Herald said that [...] "The plot [...] is hard to decipher, but it’s clearly not a story that ends happily ever after." [...] Jen Dose from National Post commented [...] "Gaga’s new vid for 'Alejandro' certainly brings the crazy we’ve all come to expect from her. It’s like an 8+ minute homage to Madonna—with some gay Nazis thrown in for good measure". Amy Odell of New York said the video's outfits were not as [...] "intense" [...] as those of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] or [...] "Telephone." [...] Nate Jones of Time Magazine disliked the song, but felt the video [...] "looks fantastic... the self-conscious ballsiness of Gaga and director Steven Klein works here." [...] Jennifer Cady from E! liked the video, but {{did not think it}} was as good as Gaga's previous work. Julie Moult from Daily Mail said [...] ", no-one could accuse Lady Gaga of being the shy and retiring type." ...|$|E

2500|$|On the pitch, a {{combination}} of niggling injuries {{and the rise of}} an in-form and up-and-coming Shaun Wright-Phillips saw him lose his preferred right midfield position. When McManaman did play, he failed to rediscover his old form and speed, only occasionally demonstrating the ability he had shown in his earlier career. Part of the problem stemmed from the fact that in order to find a role at Madrid he had changed his playing style, cutting down on the flair play (as Madrid had a surfeit of flair players) and instead focusing on being a holding player and making short, simple passes of the ball in central midfield, where he was known for his one touch passing and ability to never give the ball away. Youngsters Wright-Phillips, Joey Barton, Stephen Ireland and Lee Croft cited McManaman as a major motivating influence on them. McManaman was criticised by Sir Alex Ferguson after an FA Cup Manchester derby at Old Trafford for [...] "intimidating Gary Neville" [...] to get him sent off in a headbutt incident in 2004, adding a derogatory comment that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> other role McManaman had in the game [...]|$|E
2500|$|For 11 months, Abagnale {{impersonated}} a chief resident pediatrician in a Georgia hospital {{under the}} alias Frank Williams. He chose this course {{after he was}} nearly arrested disembarking a flight in New Orleans. Afraid of possible capture, he retired temporarily to Georgia. When filling out a rental application he impulsively listed his occupation as [...] "doctor", fearing that the owner might check with Pan Am if he wrote [...] "pilot". After befriending a real doctor {{who lived in the}} same apartment complex, he agreed to act as a supervisor of resident interns as a favor until the local hospital could find someone else to take the job. The position was not difficult for Abagnale because supervisors did no real medical work. However, he was nearly exposed when an infant almost died from oxygen deprivation because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> a nurse meant when she said there was a [...] "blue baby." [...] He was able to fake his way through most of his duties by letting the interns handle the cases coming in during his late-night shift, setting broken bones and other mundane tasks. He left the hospital only after he realized he could put lives at risk by his inability to respond to life-and-death situations.|$|E
2500|$|Michaels {{states in}} Heartbreak & Triumph that during {{planning}} {{he was told}} [...] "'This cannot be discussed with anyone. Pat can't know, nobody can know about this but {{the three of us}} right now'", [...] "We had the meeting, and as everyone was leaving, Vince asked me, Hunter, and Jerry Brisco, a longtime agent and close confidant of Vince's, to stay. We sat down and talked", and [...] "Pat was in the room with us, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> was going to happen. He had a strong relationship with Bret. He wouldn't have done it, and Vince knew that. That's why he didn't tell Pat...". However, in Dave Meltzer's online account of events before, during, and after the Screwjob, he states [...] "Vince McMahon held a meeting at the hotel with Jim Ross, Jim Cornette, Pat Patterson and Michaels. Reports are that {{at least two of the}} aforementioned names looked extremely uncomfortable leaving the meeting" [...] which suggests that Patterson may in fact have been in on the Screwjob. This is corroborated by a Pro Wrestling Torch article from November 15, 1997 by Wade Keller which states, [...] "However, a two-hour meeting was held on the second floor of the Montreal Marriott on Saturday night with McMahon, Jim Ross, Pat Patterson, Jim Cornette, and Michaels. Bret was wrestling that night in Detroit. There is some belief that at this meeting McMahon proposed the idea of the finish to whoever of that group wasn't already in on it. Ross and Patterson entered the meeting in a good mood and when they were seen in the hotel lobby afterwards, were said to be irritable, forlorn, and shaken." ...|$|E

2500|$|Layne {{had read}} of similar {{hypnotic}} cures by the Marquis de Puységur, {{a follower of}} Franz Mesmer, and was keen to explore {{the limits of the}} healing knowledge involved with the trance voice. He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> he was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, [...] "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance." [...] Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the newspapers, which inspired many postal inquiries. Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and [...] location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed [...] "the entity," [...] and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as [...] "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him. [...] Few people knew what he was up to. [...] There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered. Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.|$|E
2500|$|Raging Bull {{came about}} when De Niro read the [...] {{on the set}} of The Godfather Part II. Although {{disappointed}} by the book's writing style, he became fascinated by the character of Jake LaMotta. He showed the book to Martin Scorsese {{on the set of}} Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in the hope that he would consider the project. Scorsese repeatedly turned down the opportunity to sit in the director's chair, claiming <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> Raging Bull was about, even though he had read some of the text. Never a sports fan, when he found out what LaMotta used to do for a living, he said, [...] "A boxer? I don't like boxing...Even as a kid, I always thought that boxing was boring... It was something I couldn't, wouldn't grasp." [...] His overall opinion of sport in general is, [...] "Anything with a ball, no good." [...] The book was then passed onto Mardik Martin, the film's eventual co-screenwriter, who said [...] "the trouble is the damn thing has been done a hundred times before—a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him". The book was even shown to producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler by De Niro, who were willing to assist only if Scorsese agreed. After nearly dying from a drug overdose, Scorsese agreed to make the film, not only to save his own life but also to save his career. Scorsese began to relate very personally to the story of Jake LaMotta, and in it he saw how the boxing ring can be [...] "an allegory for whatever you do in life”, which for him paralleled moviemaking, “you make movies, you’re in the ring each time.” ...|$|E
