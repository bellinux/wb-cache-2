40|$|This study empirically explores {{whether the}} {{propensity}} to offshore affects the total <b>domestic</b> <b>employment</b> {{at the firm}} level. The analysis {{is based on a}} Finnish weighted sample of 652 firms and screens the effect of offshoring different kinds of tasks. Two main channels of offshoring tasks are taken into account : offshore outsourcing and in-house offshoring. The main conclusion is that offshoring can significantly affect the total <b>domestic</b> <b>employment</b> but that the significance and the direction of the effect depend on which kind of offshoring is involved. Our results offer evidence that in both the manufacturing and service sectors offshore outsourcing of services has a positive effect on employment. In addition {{it was found that the}} effect of R&D offshoring on the probability to anticipate an increase of total <b>domestic</b> <b>employment</b> depends on the offshoring channel. Offshore outsourcing of R&D has a positive effect on the anticipated <b>domestic</b> <b>employment,</b> whereas in-house offshoring of R&D has a negative effect. Specific for the manufacturing sector is that offshore outsourcing of production also has a negative significant effect. A final conclusion is that only in the service sector does in-house offshoring of services have a negative effect on the probability to anticipate an increase of <b>domestic</b> <b>employment.</b> By dissecting offshoring by tasks and channels the above empirical findings contribute to a better understanding of the aggregate effects of offshoring on <b>domestic</b> <b>employment.</b> globalization, internationalization, outsourcing, offshoring, job loss, domestic effects, home country effects...|$|R

Interviews also revealed that speech patterns between employer and employee are directive and instructive in nature and reflect the unequal relationship between the two indiiduals, that domestic workers insist their children learn English in school, and that workers perceive English as a social indicator and an instrument of change.

The results of the simulation were then crosschecked with the data provided by BPS, field survey, and others preliminary research. The results of this research show that in general, the economic crisis has a negative impact on industry performance. The negative impact consists of the increasing domestic prices, decreasing value added and export volume, lower production for domestic market, and lower rate of employment. Howewer, domestic resources-based and/or export oriented industries (such as food and beverages, plywoods, chemicals and non-ferrous industries) have better negative impacts compared to import resource-based and domestic-oriented industries (such as iron and steel, and machinery industries) ...|$|E

40|$|Most {{existing}} empirical papers {{concerned about}} multidimensional poverty use the house- hold as {{the unit of}} analysis, meaning that multidimensional poverty status of the household is equated with the multidimensional poverty status of all individuals in the household. This assumption, nonetheless, overlooks important within-household features and ignores the intra-household inequalities. Besides, by definition, households containing both a female and a male cannot contribute to a gender gap, so gender differentials cannot be estimated. But, the Sustainable Development Goals have put special emphasis on gender equality along their targets; therefore, new measures able to capture the gender differences are needed. Consequently, in this paper, we propose an individual-based multidimensional poverty mea- sure in order to estimate the three Is of multidimensional poverty (incidence, intensity, and inequality) in Nicaragua {{as well as the}} gender differentials. We also estimate logit regres- sions to better understanding the determinants of multidimensional poverty in this country. Overall, we find that there are statistically significant gender differences in multidimensional poverty in Nicaragua; but, they are estimated to be small and lower than 5 %. However, the gender differential in inequality is larger than 10 %, and it suggests that multidimensional poor women are living in very intense poverty when compared with multidimensional poor men. We also find that the elderly and children are the most vulnerable people in terms of multidimensional poverty in this country; furthermore, when information on <b>employment,</b> <b>domestic</b> work, and social protection is considered in the analysis, the gender gaps become more substantial, and {{women are more likely to}} be poor than men...|$|E
40|$|Material efficiency, {{reducing}} the amount of new material inputs per given level of service or output, can improve both the resource efficiency of an economy and reduce demand for energy and GHG emissions intensive materials. It requires a change in the way materials, components and final products are used along the supply chain with associated impacts on <b>employment.</b> <b>Domestic</b> policy support for material efficiency can be hindered by concerns that reducing demand for new materials will impact on employment. A multi-method approach for evaluating the employment impacts of material efficiency strategies across different products and regions is presented. It is applied to two case studies that could reduce demand for new steel in the UK: car clubs and re-using steel sections. Industry interviews supplemented by a literature review reveal how sector labour intensity, product prices and sales volumes might change along the mobility and construction supply chains in the short-term as a consequence of introducing these strategies. A static multi-regional input-output model is used to estimate the immediate direct and indirect supply chain employment impacts of increasing the material efficiency of steel use in the UK. The principal finding of this paper, based on industry expectations of feasible rates of deployment, is that the initial, immediate consequences of these actions would not adversely affect employment prospects in the UK. This is partly because car clubs can stimulate demand for new vehicles and deconstructing rather than demolishing buildings is labour intensive, substituting domestic labour for imported steel. These initial findings should motivate further research on the opportunities for material efficienc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: in {{the rural}} {{community}} of Iran, there are gaps between the ruling class (capital owners) and villagers, between literate and illiterate, and between men and women. Especially in villages women have fewer possibilities in terms of investment and less power and credit. Role of rural women, over of men, is more influenced with different economic, social, cultural and ecologic factors. Rural women are considered as a noticeable potential in the community either directly (crops production, livestock, handicrafts, cottage industries) or indirectly by helping the agricultural sector (as labor). About 5. 6 million women are involved in agricultural production, and activities related to planting [...] . harvesting, preparation of animal food, {{and taking care of}} livestock and poultry and some certain activities related to trading and marketing are all different fields of rural women’s role and participation. Based on current statistics, women in rural area participate about 50 % in conversion industries, 22 % in producing crops and livestock, 75 % in handicrafts and in areas related to planting…harvesting, respectively, 25, 24 and 4. 26. And also in activities related to livestock, they handle 23 % of livestock grazing, 42 % of animal care and 100 percent of total poultry in the village. Therefore their role in achieving food security is undeniable. But, like most developing countries, this crucial role in society and in process of rural development, is not obvious.
