25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done better.|$|E

500|$|Evelyn Waugh, who {{reviewed}} the early novels {{as they appeared}} at two-year intervals, found Widmerpool particularly compelling. He wrote to Powell after reading At Lady Molly's (fourth volume): [...] "In the opening pages I felt the void of Widmerpool really aching – <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> borne another page's delay for his entry. Did you intend him to dominate the series?" [...] After reviewing Casanova's Chinese Restaurant Waugh complained of a [...] "sad disappointment – only three pages of Widmerpool".|$|E

His widow, Eliza, began working to sell the family's slaves. Tubman refused {{to wait for the}} Brodess family to decide her fate, despite her husband's efforts to dissuade her.

500|$|During {{his time}} in Nelson, Constantine made a deep {{impression}} and remained a [...] celebrity there even after leaving the town; [...] his general community involvement was such [...] that a regional historian described him as a [...] "local champion". He appreciated the greater freedom he enjoyed in Nelson as compared with Trinidad, where racial issues predominated. Although Nelson suffered {{from the effects of}} the Depression, Constantine's high earnings were never a source of resentment; of {{his time in}} Nelson he wrote: [...] "If I had not come... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been the person I am today... I am a better citizen for the time I have spent in Nelson." ...|$|E

500|$|Yeats had {{a life-long}} {{interest}} in mysticism, spiritualism, occultism and astrology. He read {{extensively on the}} subjects throughout his life, {{became a member of}} the paranormal research organisation [...] "The Ghost Club" [...] (in 1911) and was especially influenced by the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. As early as 1892, he wrote: [...] "If I had not made magic my constant study <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> written a single word of my Blake book, nor would The Countess Kathleen ever have come to exist. The mystical life is the centre of all that I do and all that I think and all that I write." [...] His mystical interests—also inspired by a study of Hinduism, under the Theosophist Mohini Chatterjee, and the occult—formed much of the basis of his late poetry. Some critics disparaged this aspect of Yeats's work; W. H. Auden called it the [...] "deplorable spectacle of a grown man occupied with the mumbo-jumbo of magic and the nonsense of India." ...|$|E
500|$|They reached Tierra del Fuego on 18 December 1832 and Darwin {{was taken}} aback at what he {{perceived}} as the crude savagery of the Yaghan natives, {{in stark contrast to}} the [...] "civilised" [...] behaviour of the three Fuegians they were returning as missionaries (who had been given the names York Minster, Fuegia Basket and Jemmy Button). He described his first meeting with the native Fuegians as being [...] "without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle I ever beheld: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilised man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement." [...] In contrast, he said of Jemmy that [...] "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here." [...] (Four decades later, he recalled these impressions in The Descent of Man to support his argument that just as humans had descended from [...] "a lower form", civilised society had arisen by graduations from a more primitive state. He recalled how closely the Fuegians on board the Beagle [...] "resembled us in disposition and in most of our mental faculties.") ...|$|E
2500|$|The ever-modest Altham, however, {{provided}} his own verdict (in the book's fourth edition in 1948): [...] "This not-inconsiderable labour <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{undertaken by}} myself, but I {{was fortunate enough}} to secure the collaboration of Mr. E. W. Swanton whose broad shoulders readily sustained by far the greater part of the burden." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What good? The good it did him was that, it gratified me. At {{the time}} he took it {{he would have made}} any promise under the sun. It was a {{condition}} I exacted just at the very last, before the marriage took place. There was nothing at that moment he would have refused me; there was nothing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> <b>have</b> made him do. He was in love to that degree--but I don't want to boast," [...] said Georgina, with quiet grandeur. [...] "He wanted--he wanted--" [...] she added; but then she paused.|$|R

2500|$|Cahill later reflected: [...] "They {{asked if}} I would take part, even though I was only 14 {{at the time}} and it was an under-20 tournament. I saw it simply as a chance to go on holiday because my {{grandmother}} was ill at the time in Samoa. It was a chance to go back and see her on expenses as the Samoans were paying for all my flights, accommodation and living expenses. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> cared less about playing for them. It was a men's tournament and I never expected to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{line between}} {{impartiality}} and questionable behavior {{was a thin}} one. When a female student, Amelia Van Buren, asked about {{the movement of the}} pelvis, Eakins invited her to his studio, where he undressed and [...] "gave her the explanation as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done by words only". Such incidents, coupled with the ambitions of his younger associates to oust him and take over the school themselves, created tensions between him and the Academy's board of directors. He was ultimately forced to resign in 1886, for removing the loincloth of a male model in a class where female students were present.|$|E
2500|$|In 1886, Carte raised Helen's {{salary to}} £1,000 a year plus a 10% {{commission}} {{on the net}} profits of all business at his theatres. [...] According to historian Jane Stedman, [...] "When she demurred, he wrote, 'You know very well, and so do all those who know anything about my affairs, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done the business at all, at any rate on nothing like the same scale, without you'". Carte's first wife had died in 1885, and Helen married Richard on 12 April 1888 in the Savoy Chapel, with Sir Arthur Sullivan acting as Carte's best man.|$|E

6000|$|How well I {{remember}} the delight, and wonder, and pleasure with which I read [...] "Jane Eyre," [...] {{sent to me}} by an author whose name and sex were then alike unknown to me; the strange fascinations of the book; and how with my own work pressing upon me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> <b>having</b> taken the volumes up, lay them down until they were read through! Hundreds of those who, like myself, recognized and admired that master-work of a great genius, will look with a mournful interest and regard and curiosity upon the last fragmentary sketch from the noble hand which wrote [...] "Jane Eyre." ...|$|R

2500|$|Malone {{was picked}} in that season's Australian squad {{to play the}} West Indies for the third Test at Adelaide, {{replacing}} Terry Alderman, but was 12th man. He was discussed as a possibility for the 1982 tour of New Zealand. He did not tour, and announced his retirement from first class cricket. His final game was a one day match against Victoria where Malone took 3-19 off seven overs. Malone said [...] "I felt I was struggling {{to get into the}} Shield team and I just thought it was time to retire. I have no qualms about my decision and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> finished off on a better note by getting a wicket on the last ball I bowled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hatshepsut {{claimed that}} she was her father's {{intended}} heir and that he made her the heir apparent of Egypt. Almost all scholars today view this as historical revisionism, or prolepsis, on Hatshepsut's part since it was Thutmose II—a son of Thutmose I by Mutnofret—who was her father's heir. Moreover, Thutmose <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> foreseen that his daughter Hatshepsut would outlive his son within his own lifetime. Thutmose II soon married Hatshepsut and the latter became both his senior royal wife and the most powerful woman at court. Biographer Evelyn Wells, however, accepts Hatshepsut's claim {{that she was}} her father's intended successor. Once she became pharaoh herself, Hatshepsut supported her assertion that she was her father's designated successor with inscriptions {{on the walls of}} her mortuary temple: ...|$|E
2500|$|After being {{spotted by}} Geoff Cook, Durham's coach, Onions made his second XI debut {{for the club}} {{at the age of}} 18. He was offered a {{contract}} with the club and opted to become a professional cricketer rather than take a sports science choice at university, which was his other option. Onions started in the team as the fourth bowler. Looking back on his early career, he felt that he tried too hard early on. On one occasion he recalled how [...] "I remember being thrown the ball at an important stage of a game at Scarborough, and Phil Jaques hit me for four successive fours. I was thinking 'I'm not sure I can do this.' But Dale Benkenstein was a huge influence as captain, and you have to learn from all those experiences. Otherwise <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done what I did in my first season of Test cricket. I often went for 15 to 20 runs in my first three overs, but always came back strongly." [...] In 2006, Onions regularly opened the bowling for Durham with Ottis Gibson.|$|E

6000|$|... "There is {{one thing}} to be thankful for at any rate, Miss Oliver, dear," [...] said Susan, [...] "and that is that Cousin Sophia did not come in today. <b>I</b> really <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> endured her on top of all the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I replied, {{in a tone}} of studied indifference: but as {{to whether}} it was ancient or <b>not</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> say;--I <b>had</b> never heard its name before, and knew nothing about it: doubtless it was characteristic-- [...] "That weary word," [...] she murmured.|$|R
2500|$|In October 1868, {{with the}} {{rebuilding}} of the lodge largely complete: [...] "Reached the Glassalt Sheil at half past 6. It looked so cheerful & comfortable, all lit up & the little rooms are so cosy & nice. The Dining room is {{on the one side}} of the little entrance hall, my sitting room, on the other & my bedroom [...] – beyond. In it stands the old bed & wardrobe in our former little bedroom at Alt na Guithasach. Upstairs the rooms are equally comfortable. Felt sad & lonely, thinking of the blessed happy past with dearest Albert, who always had wished to build here, in this favourite spot. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> lived again at Alt na Guithasach now, alone, & it is far better to have built a totally new house, but the sad thought struck me, that it was the first widow's house, – not blessed by him." [...] With five of her children and her Lady of the Bedchamber Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill, Victoria held a house warming party and then they stayed for the night.|$|E
2500|$|The {{slaughter}} of the headquarters guard corps shocked and angered the other Tianxiong troops, despite Luo's {{attempt to explain}} to them the reasons. [...] A group of soldiers supported the officer Shi Renyu (史仁遇), who took over Gaotang (高唐, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong) and claimed the title of acting military governor. [...] He sought aid from Hedong and Yichang. [...] However, he was quickly defeated and killed by Zhu's officers Li Zhouyi (李周彝) and Fu Daozhao (符道昭), before those circuits could aid him. [...] Still, even with Zhu's aid, it took Luo half a year to quell all of the mutinies. [...] During that period, with the Xuanwu army present and Luo forced to supply it well, the Tianxiong supplies were exhausted. [...] It was aid that the destruction of the headquarters guard corps ended much of the threat against Luo's rule, but the fighting abilities of the Tianxiong army was thereafter permanently damaged. [...] Luo, in regret, stated, [...] "Even with all the iron from the six prefectures and 43 counties of this circuit, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> forged a greater error." ...|$|E
2500|$|Through their {{interactions}} and their critiques of each other, Darcy and Elizabeth come to recognise their own faults {{and work to}} correct them. Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36: [...] "How despicably have I acted!" [...] she cried; [...] "I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust. How humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on {{the very beginning of}} our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."Other characters rarely exhibit this depth of self-reflection—or, at least, are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development. Tanner notes that Mrs. Bennet in particular, [...] "has a very limited view of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects." [...] Mrs. Bennet's behaviour reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they don't get married: [...] "The business of her life was to get her daughters married: it's solace was visiting and news." [...] This proves that Mrs. Bennet is only aware of [...] "material objects" [...] and not of her own feelings and emotions.|$|E
