25|$|Nolan is {{also noted}} for his command and {{problems}} during the Buffalo Soldier tragedy of 1877. This was {{also known as}} the Staked Plains Horror and was a tragic series of events in the hot dry Llano Estacado region of north-west Texas and eastern New Mexico. This was during the 100 degree heat in July of a barren desert. Four soldiers and one buffalo hunter would die from the hot horror of the desert.

A majority of both men and women agreed, but support was higher among women (67%) than men (55%).

Prime Minister H.H. Asquith ordered the Navy to fall in with the Army’s plans to deploy an Expeditionary Force to France.|$|E

25|$|Socially, {{the upper}} classes of Lisbon were now a mix of {{conservative}} nobles who were forced to accept, albeit reluctantly, some liberal ideas, and the newly entitled bourgeois who held many conservative ideas. They were joined by the Brazilians, many of them formerly poor and uneducated immigrants who had immigrated to Brazil and grown rich, {{then returned to the}} city, eager to find acceptance in higher social circles. Lisbon was the industrial centre of the country, despite its industrialisation being minimal compared to that of England or Germany. The poorer strata of Lisbon society grew exponentially {{with the arrival of the}} first workers to man the new factories. They often lived in miserable slums, amidst raging epidemics of cholera and other diseases, working all day <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> enough to eat.|$|E
25|$|Henzell also shot some footage {{for what}} was planned as his next film, No Place Like Home, in Harder's aftermath, but he went broke before he could finish the film. Fed up by this, {{and the lack of}} finance for further production, he {{went on to become a}} writer, {{publishing}} his first novel, Power Game, in 1982. Both were meant to complete a planned trilogy of films centring on Ivanhoe Martin. The footage for No Place Like Home was lost. Years later, he came across editing tapes in a lab in New York. <b>Just</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a sense of completion, he worked on the project. When he showed it to a few friends, their response was enthusiastic. He eventually was able to retrieve the original footage. No Place Like Home was screened for the public at the 31st annual Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006 at the Cumberland Theatre; it was sold out. Film leads Carl Bradshaw (The Harder They Come, Smile Orange, Countryman) and Susan O'Meara attended and answered audience questions with Henzell after the screening. The film was scheduled to be screened at the Flashpoint Film Festival at the beginning of December 2006 in Negril.|$|E
500|$|It was in New Hampshire where Huntsman adopted his new [...] "Country First" [...] {{campaign}} slogan. The slogan was {{borrowed from}} John McCain's 2008 campaign, though {{the context of}} the slogan was different. Huntsman, who, as Governor of Utah at the time, endorsed McCain over Mitt Romney in the 2008 Republican presidential primary, had hoped McCain would return the favor; however, McCain endorsed Romney in a rally at Manchester's Manchester Central High School on January 4. Huntsman later characterized McCain's endorsement of his main rival as a [...] "petty betrayal". He told McCain [...] "I don't care if you support Romney, that's great – but <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> given me the dignity of waiting until after the New Hampshire primary." [...] McCain replied, [...] "I didn't mean to offend. I hope your family is well." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1982, Gittings remembered, [...] "I {{joined the}} {{movement}} in 1958, when the subject of homosexuality was still shrouded in complete silence. There were no radio talk shows or TV documentaries. In all the United States, there were maybe a half dozen groups, two hundred people active in all." [...] The Daughters of Bilitis served as a social alternative to bars for lesbians, but took great care to deny that they were [...] "arranging for 'immoral contacts'." [...] While president of the DOB in New York, attending members numbered between ten and forty per meeting. They met twice a month and often invited doctors, psychiatrists, ministers and attorneys to address their meetings, even if the message was clearly disparaging to lesbians. Gittings recalled, [...] "At first we were so grateful <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> people— anybody— pay attention {{to us that we}} listened to and accepted everything they said, no matter how bad it was...anything that helped to break the silence, no matter how silly or foolish it may look to us today, was important." ...|$|E
500|$|All {{songs on}} Is This It were mixed using 11audio tracks or less. According to Valensi, the album {{contains}} [...] "no gimmicks, no tricks" [...] {{to try to}} get the listener to like the compositions. It opens with the title track, which features a simple, metronomic drum line, a recurring feature in the rest of the record. Containing one of the slowest tempos, [...] "Is This It" [...] is the Strokes' attempt at a ballad. [...] "The Modern Age" [...] follows and includes a guitar riff accompanied by a complementary drum line. Its staccato verse is followed by an upbeat, singalong chorus and a guitar solo. Discussing the album's simplicity and measured approach, Valensi has commented, [...] "We don't put in a guitar solo <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> one." [...] "Soma" [...] incorporates jerky rhythms and starts and ends with the same guitar and drum chimes, while [...] "Barely Legal" [...] contains some of the album's softer guitar melodies inspired by Britpop as well as drumming patterns that evoke the sound of primitive 1980s drum machines.|$|E
500|$|While {{the editor}} of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a {{chimpanzee}} with the machine above the strapline [...] "Editor benchtests the ZX81". (The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question about that, and I suspect that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a bit of fun." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{began working}} on the track in 2011, with vocalist and guitarist Win Butler noting, [...] "We {{recorded}} {{a little bit in}} Louisiana with the Haitian percussionists [...] and we kind of lived with that. It's an incredibly long process." [...] Regular Arcade Fire collaborators Owen Pallett and Colin Stetson provided instrumental parts, alongside English musician David Bowie who provided vocals for the song. Regarding Bowie's guest appearance on the track, multi-instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry noted, [...] "It was just after The Next Day had come out. He basically just came by the studio in New York while we were mixing, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a listen to the stuff we were doing. He offered to lend us his services because he really liked the song. In fact, he basically threatened us – he was like, 'If you don't hurry up and mix this song, I might just steal it from you!' So we thought, well why don't we go one better, why don't you sing on our version? Thankfully he obliged, and we were really happy about that." ...|$|E
500|$|For DeLonge, he had {{developed}} an [...] "itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was." [...] According to DeLonge, Box Car Racer was not [...] "meant {{to be a real}} band," [...] but rather [...] "something to do in some spare time that was really only expected to be on the low list of the totem pole of priorities in my life, and <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an experimental creative outlet." [...] The project was at first solely acoustic guitar-based; he considered it in its earliest stages to be a [...] "Violent Femmes-esque acoustic record". The unnamed project went through other names, such as The Kill, and the album was initially titled Et tu, Brute?. He eventually settled on the name Box Car Racer, which was actually the name of a band Barker was in just after high school that DeLonge liked. He began writing songs {{about the end of the}} world, and connected it thematically with the biblical Book of Revelation and World War II. When reading about the war, DeLonge was [...] "freaked out" [...] to learn that Fat Man, the atomic bomb that was detonated over Nagasaki, was dropped from the B-29 bomber Bockscar (commonly misspelled Boxcar).|$|E
500|$|Blood and Palicki {{returned}} as principal cast members {{for the third}} season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In August 2015, the spin-off series received new life, reworked as Marvel's Most Wanted and given a pilot order. Bell and Zbyszewski were again developing the series, writing the pilot and executive producing. The pair were set to serve as showrunners for the series, if it was picked up. Loeb and Jim Chory were also attached as executive producers. The series would still focus on Morse and Hunter, with Palicki and Blood both attached, and was described as [...] "a new take focusing on the same duo and their continuing adventures." [...] In January 2016, Lee stated that the pilot was [...] "absolutely" [...] moving forward, praising the script and saying production would begin [...] "in the next few months." [...] In the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode [...] "Parting Shot", the two characters were written off that series, having them leave and [...] S.H.I.E.L.D. Bell explained that Palicki and Blood had to leave to film the pilot, and [...] "it didn't make sense" [...] to have the story explain their absence for several episodes <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the pair leave again soon after to begin production {{on the rest of}} Most Wanted if it was picked up to series.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Music began in January 2000 at Sarm West Studios, Notting Hill, London. The first song that Madonna and Ahmadzaï worked on was [...] "Impressive Instant", {{since it was}} the most complete among all the demos that he had sent to the singer. The song was an instrumental and was not supposed to be included in Ahmadzaï's own album, Production. But Madonna had different ideas for the track and its lyrics, which she explained to the producer. Feeling that Madonna's vision about the song's composition would be difficult to create in Sarm West, Ahmadzaï wanted to return to Paris and work there on his own computer. [...] "There are a lot of chopped vocal tracks on 'Impressive Instant'...That was impossible to do in the studio. It doesn't make sense to rent a place like Sarm <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> me work on ten seconds of music all day, using only the one computer," [...] he added. Within the first ten days, they had recorded the backing vocals, acoustic guitars etc. on a Sony 48-track and transferred it to Logic Audio workstation, using the converters of the TC Electronic Finalizer; Ahmadzaï then went back to Paris with the recordings.|$|E
500|$|Coghill told Australian Times {{that the}} final tour is [...] "going to be great fun, but it's {{also going to be}} sad". He {{confirmed}} that he had no plans to start a new band or for a solo project.

I don't think I'd be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a chance to keep playing. I'm just not keen to be off touring the world anymore". Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was [...] "These Days". On 25 January 2011 the band issued a previously unreleased track, [...] "I'm on Your Side", as a fundraiser for the Premier's Flood Appeal as a result of major flooding in Queensland from December the previous year into January. The song was available via the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause. On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, , containing two new tracks. There was also a 2-disc release, Fingerprints & Footprints – The Ultimate Collection, combining both Fingerprints and Footprints in one set. Also in November, Dino Scatena and the band, published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band. Scatena, a rock music journalist, had started writing the book in the previous October during the Sunsets Farewell Tour.|$|E
500|$|After Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix was released, Nomura {{wanted to}} expand Roxas' {{role in the}} series to explain the events between his birth and his {{disappearance}} from Organization XIII. For Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, the staff thought that Roxas' role {{as a member of}} the group would be a suitable theme for the plot. Roxas was chosen as the game's protagonist as the staff thought that having a main character besides Sora would help to introduce gamers to the series' first Nintendo DS title. Co-director Tomohiro Hasegawa explained that Roxas' was originally shorter, and the staff decided he should grow taller as the game continued to develop. Nomura wanted to portray Roxas' activities differently from Sora's. In Sora's games, he is on a journey around the world, while Roxas always returns to Organization XIII after each mission. The staff constructed Roxas' interactions with the Disney characters differently from Sora's, as the Organization was meant to be secret in the game's story. Nomura told the writers that he wanted Roxas to learn something from each of his missions or <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> something to think about. Nomura later clarified that Roxas' personality was different from the one portrayed in Kingdom Hearts II, as he does not actively attempt to come into contact with other characters. With Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, Nomura wanted to reveal why Roxas left Organization XIII. Although Nomura found it a sad story, he considered Zack Fair's ending in [...] to be more tragic. Nomura felt Roxas' last words in the game were also the title's most significant, as he wanted them to connect to Kingdom Hearts IIs first scene, which is actually the same scene. Uchiyama expressed sadness when the game's development ended as he would not play the character for a long time.|$|E
