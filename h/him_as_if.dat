5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} of a powerful and alert patriarch. The painting is set at a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in respect. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid across his upper body to suggest physical presence.|$|E
5|$|Mary is {{presented}} as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel. The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just momentarily paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> embodiments of his prayer.|$|E
25|$|After beating Mars Bar in a foot {{race and}} goading him into {{crashing}} Piper's birthday {{party at the}} McNabs' house, Jeffrey is homeless again. He moves back into the buffalo pen, and runs for miles every morning before Two Mills wakes up. Before long, Mars Bar starts running with <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> by coincidence, and they never {{say a word to}} each other. One day they come across a hysterical Piper McNab, who frantically leads them to Russell, stuck on the trolley trestle where Jeffrey's parents died. He walks away silently, nearly unconscious and stunned by fear, while Mars Bar rescues Russell, becoming a hero in his eyes. Jeffrey retreats once again to the buffalo pen, where Mars Bar leads Amanda to it. She brings him to her house in a huff, with Jeffrey and Mars Bar following her.|$|E

25|$|Each day Hilde visits Anton's grave mentally {{talking to}} <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{he is still}} alive. One evening, as she is {{returning}} home, Hilde discovers that a black cat seems to be following her. The cat causes her to remember two distinct experiences from her past. The first is a memory from {{when she was a}} small child and had attempted to hide a stray cat in her bedroom. Her family was very poor and could not afford a pet, but she saved her table scraps for it anyway. One day as she was coming home, her father met her drunk in the doorway. After telling her he had snapped the cat's neck, he beat her harshly with a fly swatter. This first memory seeped into the second: her daughter, Erika, begging to keep a stray cat she had found. Anton had granted her wish, but the cat ruined the neighbors' gardens and Hilde was forced to drown it in the river.|$|E
25|$|Having said that, {{he moves}} the log a little forward and throws a coin into the fire. The {{woman of the}} house puts a woolen blanket on the polazniks back, and seats him on a low stool by the fireplace. In {{the moment when he}} sits down, they try to pull away the stool beneath <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to make him fall on the floor. The polaznik goes out into the yard, and throws grain inside a circle made with the rope with which Christmas straw has been tied, calling chickens. When they gather in the circle he catches a rooster, whose head is then cut off by him or the head of {{household}} on the house's threshold. The rooster will be roasted on a wooden spit as part of Christmas dinner. The polaznik usually stays for dinner with the family. He receives a gift {{in the form of a}} round cake with an embedded coin, and a towel, shirt, socks, or some other useful thing.|$|E
500|$|According to Jazz Police, Taborn is [...] "basically shy" [...] and {{prefers to}} [...] "let his music do the talking", {{which is why}} he [...] "doesnt have, or want, his own website". He also has a minimal social media {{presence}} and controls all of his US bookings personally. Some of his friends told The New York Times author of a 2017 profile piece on Taborn [...] "how relieved they were that someone, at last, was profiling <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were being forced out of hiding".|$|E

500|$|Barrow {{was known}} as [...] "Uncle Egbert" [...] to his friends; {{according}} to writer Tom Meany, Babe Ruth referred to him as [...] "Barrows," [...] treating <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were [...] "a butler in an English drawing room comedy." [...] He resided in Rye, New York. He first married in 1898, but did not discuss it in any of his writings. His second marriage was to Fannie Taylor Briggs in January 1912; he raised her five-year-old daughter from her previous marriage, Audrey, as his own daughter.|$|E

McNeery was depicted as having gone home to Ireland, and the bereft McKenna, seeking companionship, enters the Bridgeport saloon of Martin J. Dooley, located on Archer Avenue (to become famous as [...] "Archey Road"), {{in which he had}} not been in some years, but where Mr. Dooley greets <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had parted the day before. Dooley serves him two drinks and an earful on local affairs—McKenna speaks only two brief sentences, one of which is his greeting. Dunne later stated that at first, he viewed the Dooley pieces as just another weekly feature, done hurriedly in an hour without much attempt at polish.|$|E
500|$|Balzac {{sought to}} present his {{characters}} as real people, neither fully good nor fully evil, but completely human. [...] "To arrive at the truth", {{he wrote in the}} preface to Le Lys dans la vallée, [...] "writers use whatever literary device seems capable of giving the greatest intensity of life to their characters". [...] "Balzac's characters", Robb notes, [...] "were as real to <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were observing them in the outside world". This reality was noted by playwright Oscar Wilde, who said: [...] "One of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of [...] Lucien de Rubempré.... It haunts me in my moments of pleasure. I remember it when I laugh".|$|E

500|$|Miller and Lindwall {{formed an}} opening {{partnership}} that {{was regarded as}} one of the greatest of all time. Hutton said that the pair was the most hostile that he faced during his career. Alan Davidson, a bowling all rounder who supported Lindwall and Miller for New South Wales and Australia, said that [...] "Ray Lindwall was the best bowler I ever saw of any type; his control was just perfect. At the other end you had Miller, who was unpredictable...It really was a perfect team." [...] He was an acrobatic slips fielder, who would take freakish catches with nonchalant ease, often immediately returning to his discussion with those around <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> nothing was unusual.|$|E
500|$|Derek Malcolm in The Guardian {{disliked the}} film, {{saying it was}} [...] "too long... and pretty boring between the stunts", {{although}} he admitted that the stunts were of a high quality. According to Malcolm, Bond [...] "inhabits a fantasy-land of more or less bloodless violence, groinless sex and naivety masked as superior sophistication", with Moore playing <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in a [...] "nicely lubricated daze". Although Malcolm tipped the film for international box office success, he observed that he [...] "can't quite see why the series has lasted so long and so strong in people's affections." [...] Writing in The Observer, Philip French commented that [...] "not {{for the first time}} the pre-credits sequence is the best thing about the film." [...] French was dismissive of Moore's Bond, saying that Bond was [...] "impersonated by Moore" [...] and referred to Moore's advancing years.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the episode, Crosetti {{discusses}} with Lewis various {{conspiracy theories}} about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the 16thpresident of the United States. Crosetti disputes the accepted theory that actor John Wilkes Booth killed Lincoln and instead theorizes that Jefferson Davis, {{the president of the}} Confederate States of America, organized the murder. Crosetti's assassination theories about Lincoln would be a recurring theme {{throughout the rest of the}} first season. Crosetti's fascination with the Lincoln assassination was based on Tom Fontana's real-life obsession with it. During an early scene in which a suspect tries lying to Munch, the detective berates the suspect for treating <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were Montel Williams instead of Larry King. King is a long-time television journalist and host of CNN's Larry King Live, whereas Williams is a more tabloid-style television show host. Williams is also a Baltimore native, which becomes a point of discussion between Munch and Bolander. Munch tells a lying suspect that his false story has an [...] "Elmore Leonard quality", a reference to an American novelist and screenwriter.|$|E

500|$|According to Vladimir's life in Church Slavonic, {{he succeeded}} his father Petrislav as {{the ruler of}} Serbian lands; he ruled {{from the town of}} Alba. He was {{captured}} and imprisoned by the Bulgarian ruler Samuel. After marrying Samuel's daughter Kosara, he returned to his country. Emperor Basil, having overcome Bulgaria, attacked the Serbian lands, but Vladimir repulsed him. Basil advised the new Bulgarian ruler, Vladislav, to kill Vladimir by trickery. Vladislav invited Vladimir to visit <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to discuss the needs of their peoples. When Kosara came to him instead, Vladislav received her with apparent kindness; therefore Vladimir came as well. Vladislav was able to cut off his head only after Vladimir gave him his own sword. The saint then carried his severed head to the church he had built near Alba, and died there; it was AD1015. He was buried in the church. During Vladislav's siege of Dyrrachium, Vladimir appeared before his murderer when he dined, and slew him while he cried for help. The saint's relics then gushed myrrh, curing various illnesses. The kontakion which is contained, among other hymns, in the Church Slavonic akolouthia published as part of Srbljak, praises the saint: ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, Horner is {{confident}} that he can seek out the married women {{who are willing to}} have affairs because {{they are the ones who}} do not care about their honor. Horner seems to believe he is in a position of power over the women because their extramarital affair is with him, but his power wanes during the duration of the play. In Act 5, Scene 4, Lady Fidget, Dainty Fidget, and Mistress Squeamish barge into Horner’s lodgings despite his protest, conveying “his lower position that alludes to his disguise: a lowly eunuch.” [...] They talk about <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he was not present, referring to him as a ‘beast,’ ‘toad,’ and eunuch. Cohen says, “As the ladies grow in aggressive self-confidence, Lady Fidget also ‘claps him on the back’ thereby revealing the altered socio-sexual roles that are now presented.” [...] While Horner thinks he is manipulating the women, he has “exhausted his sexual resources and has, in reality, become that impotent and useless object with the world publicly recognizes him to be.” [...] Horner’s true power is not in relationship to the women, but to the men. He shows his dominance over the men he cuckolds.|$|E
500|$|Kelefa Sanneh wrote a lukewarm {{review of}} the album in The New York Times, believing that Jay-Z's {{reluctance}} to indulge in the gangsta rap lyricism of his past resulted in wavering, equivocal songs such as [...] "No Hook" [...] and [...] "Say Hello". [...] "Once, words just seemed to flow out of <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he couldn't help himself", Sanneh wrote. [...] "Now it's clearer than ever that he's choosing them carefully." [...] Louis Pattison of NME was more critical and called it a regression from the [...] "slightly bloated" [...] Kingdom Come, lamenting the shortage of [...] "don't-give-a-fuck attitude" [...] highlighted on [...] "Success" [...] in favor of less effective raps exploiting Jay-Z's entrepreneurial personage. In MSN Music, Robert Christgau cited [...] "Say Hello" [...] and [...] "Blue Magic" [...] as highlights while humorously using sampled film dialogue from the latter track to frame his lukewarm opinion of the album: [...] "Jay-Z, that's a brand name, like Pepsi, that's a brand name – he stands behind it, he guarantees it, even if you don't know him {{any more than you}} know the chairman of Universal Music".|$|E

500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{decides to}} throw a garden party at Schrute Farms to impress his parents and Robert California (James Spader), and exhaustively {{explains}} party manners to the office workers. Andy is jealous {{at the amount of}} attention his younger brother Walter Bernard, Jr. (Josh Groban) receives from his father, and thinks that by throwing an elaborate party he can ensure his father's blessings. At first, the party goes along smoothly. Andy makes a toast to Robert in order to get his fellow employees to toast <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to show to his parents and California that he is valued by his employees. His plan backfires, however, and instead more people toast Robert. To get everybody's mind off of Robert, Andy decides to sing [...] "More Than Words" [...] as a duet with his father. This too goes awry as his father corrects his playing and singing, and ultimately decides to sing a duet with Walter Jr. instead of Andy. Upset, Andy takes his guitar and storms off. His father confronts him privately about his outburst, and when Andy admits to trying to win his father's affection, he reacts with annoyance. This conversation is overheard by the other staff on the baby monitor Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) brought for their daughter, and Pam quickly turns off the monitor to let Andy save face. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) confide to the camera that they now understand why Andy feels he needs to prove himself to everyone. After his family leaves, a dejected Andy, feeling unwanted by his family and co-workers, says goodbye to the office staff as they turn the garden party into a barbecue. Darryl and Oscar, however, convince Andy to stay with a cheeseburger and a beer.|$|E
500|$|Little else is {{recorded}} about Ealdorman Ælfhelm's career before his death. Notice of the latter, with the blinding {{of his two}} sons, comes in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which related under the year 1006:In this year Archbishop Ælfric died and Bishop Ælfheah succeeded him to the archiepiscopal see. In the same year Wulfgeat was deprived of all his property, and Wulfheah and Ufegeat were blinded and Ealdorman Ælfhelm killed. The Worcester Chronicle, which for this period consists of entries taken from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle supplemented with extra information, gives an expanded saga-like version of this account, attributing Ælfhelm's death to Eadric Streona:The crafty and treacherous Eadric Streona, plotting to deceive the noble ealdorman Ælfhelm, prepared a great feast for him at Shrewsbury at which, when he came as a guest, Eadric greeted <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were an intimate friend. But on {{the third or fourth}} day of the feast, when an ambush had been prepared, he took him into the wood to hunt. When all were busy with the hunt, one Godwine Porthund (which means the town dog) a Shrewsbury butcher, whom Eadric had dazzled long before with great gifts and many promises so that he might perpetrate the crime, suddenly leapt out from the ambush, and execrably slew the ealdorman Ælfhelm. After a short space of time his sons, Wulfheah and Ufegeat, were blinded, at King Æthelred’s command, at Cookham, where he himself was then staying. This material in the Worcester Chronicle seems to have been part of a lost saga about Eadric Streona, not extant but used by various surviving 11th- and 12th-century sources. Kapelle thought Ælfhelm's murder, conducted without King Æthelred's displeasure, was the result of suspect loyalty in the face of Scandinavian invasions.|$|E
500|$|In October 1971, Dyer {{accompanied}} Bacon to Paris for {{the opening}} of the artist's retrospective at the Grand Palais. The show was the high point of Bacon's career to date, and he was now being described as Britain's [...] "greatest living painter". Dyer was now a desperate man, and although he was [...] "allowed" [...] to attend, he was well aware that he was [...] "slipping", in every sense, out of the picture. To draw Bacon's attention he earlier planted cannabis in Bacon's flat, then phoned the police, and he had attempted suicide on a number of occasions. Dyer committed suicide, via an overdose of barbiturates, {{on the eve of the}} Paris exhibition in their shared hotel room. Bacon spent the following day surrounded by people eager to meet him. In mid-evening he was informed that Dyer had taken an overdose of barbiturates and was dead. Though devastated, Bacon continued with the retrospective and displayed powers of self-control [...] "to which few of us could aspire", according to Russell. Bacon was deeply affected by the loss of Dyer, and he had recently lost four other friends and his nanny. From this point on, death haunted his life and work. Though he gave a stoic appearance at the time, he was inwardly broken. He did not express his feelings to critics, but later admitted to friends that [...] "daemons, disaster and loss" [...] now stalked <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his own version of the Eumenides. Bacon spent the remainder of his stay in Paris attending to promotional activities and funeral arrangements. He returned to London later that week to comfort Dyer's family. The funeral proved to be an emotional affair for all, and many of Dyer's friends, including hardened East-End criminals, broke down in tears. As the coffin was lowered into the grave one attendant screamed [...] "you bloody fool!". Although Bacon remained stoic throughout, in the following months Dyer preoccupied his imagination as never before. To confront his loss, he painted a number of tributes on small canvasses and his three [...] "Black Triptych" [...] masterpieces.|$|E
