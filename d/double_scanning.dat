40|$|Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a metal {{additive}} manufacturing process wherein {{a laser beam}} is used to melt and fuse metal powder layer by layer to create a part. This technique involves the interaction of various process parameters such as laser power, scanning speed, powder layer thickness and scan strategy. In this study, the effects of two different scan strategies were investigated and the 17 - 4 PH stainless steel samples fabricated using these strategies, both in as-fabricated and heat-treated conditions, were characterized in terms of relative density, microstructural phase composition and micro-hardness. It {{was found that the}} samples printed with <b>double</b> <b>scan</b> strategy showed improvement in the relative density as compared to that printed with single scan strategy. Moreover, it was observed that the samples fabricated using the <b>double</b> <b>scan</b> strategy showed higher hardness than the samples printed using single scan strategy which was attributed to the high phase distribution of martensite than the retained austenite in these samples. In addition, the heat treatment of the as-fabricated samples produced uniform distribution of tempered martensite-dominant phase with negligible retained austenite, resulting in improved hardness as comparable to the heat-treated wrought sample...|$|R
40|$|Hospital {{waiting lists}} are {{a feature of}} public health care {{services}} that result when demand appears to exceed supply, and serve as mechanisms to ration health care resources. While waiting lists are usually conceptualised as rational queues, the dynamics of waiting lists, especially radiology waiting lists, are more complex and still poorly understood. The present study has attempted to better understand a problematic waiting list by adopting a systems approach known as boundary critique. A case study of an ultrasound waiting list was undertaken in which in-depth and semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} a variety of stakeholders. Viewing the ultrasound waiting list systemically highlighted the role that a radiologist boundary surrounding the detection and confirmation of abnormal pathology played in constructing the ultrasound waiting list as a problem. This boundary was enacted through the process of <b>double</b> <b>scanning,</b> a symbol of radiologist expertise. General practitioners and patients employed a wider boundary, which focused on the management of clinical uncertainty. When the system in focus was widened to include this boundary, the process of <b>double</b> <b>scanning</b> became problematic. <b>Double</b> <b>scanning</b> contributed to the growth of the ultrasound waiting list and exacerbated the difficulty faced by general practitioners and waiting patients in managing diagnostic uncertainty. To manage the tension created between radiologist and general practice boundaries, non-radiologist stakeholders undertook unrecognised and under-valued work that helped maintain the radiologist-centred systems of process and structure. Radiologists also employed a discourse of inappropriateness that downplayed the significance of delayed general practitioner referrals, which served to reinforce the primacy of the radiologist boundary. Conflicting boundaries highlighted that the ultrasound waiting list was managed in a way that did not act in the interests of non-radiologist stakeholders such as general practitioners and waiting patients. Stakeholders proposed a number of interventions to manage the growing ultrasound waiting list. However, these primarily served to further strengthen the radiologist boundary and viewed as such represented a narrow improvement in terms of the interests of non-radiologist stakeholders. The process of boundary critique helped to reframe the ultrasound waiting list in terms of radiologist dominance. Interventions based on the boundary judgements of general practitioners, waiting patients and sonographers were developed. The present study argues that the ultrasound waiting list can be better understood in terms of the role that boundary judgements play in constructing notions such as expertise, illness and appropriateness, which underlie a common-sense understanding of need, demand and supply...|$|E

A {{procedure for}} visualization of radiolucent objects in CT scan images is proposed and applied to endosseous oral implant surgery planning. Many of these patients have a removable prosthesis, and visualisation of this prosthesis proves to be advantageous during planning. Such a prosthesis is usually quite radiolucent and thus not distinguishable on CT. The technique glues small markers on the prosthesis, and then scans it, giving a first image set. A second image set of the patient with the intraoral marked prosthesis is then acquired. From the first set, a surface rendered model of the prosthesis can be constructed. From the second set, a surface model of the bone can be made, and the markers indicate {{the position of the}} prosthesis in the mouth of the patient. The prosthesis model is then orthogonally transformed so that it fits the bone model. The views obtained are clinically very relevant since they indicate where the teeth of a later fixed prosthesis will come, and the planner can orient the axes of the implants towards the occlusal plane of the teeth.

40|$|Due to the {{limitation}} of the lens effect of the optical fibre and the inhomogeneity of the laser fluence on different cores, it is still challenging to controllably inscribe different fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) in multicore fibres. In this article, we reported the FBG inscription in four core fibres (FCFs), whose cores are arranged {{in the corners of}} a square lattice. By investigating the influence of different inscription conditions during inscription, different results, such as simultaneous inscription of all cores, selectively inscription of individual or two cores, and even <b>double</b> <b>scanning</b> in perpendicular core couples by diagonal, are achieved.

A detailed {{visualization of}} the dental occlusion in 3 D image-based planning environments for oral and maxillofacial planning is important. With CT imaging however, this occlusion is often deteriorated by streak artifacts caused by amalgam fillings. Moreover, more detailed surface information {{at the level of}} the dental cuspids is often desired. In this paper, a <b>double</b> <b>scan</b> technique is introduced to image the dental occlusion by means of a newly designed 3 D splint. The patient wears this splint between the upper and lower teeth during CT-scan. In a second step, the splint is positioned between the plaster casts of the upper and lower jaw, and this setup is scanned. Based on markers in the 3 D splint, both data sets are fused and a combined visualization is possible. The accuracy, robustness and applicability in clinical routine is shown.

40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} {{understanding}} of the processes involved in the laser treatment of cutaneous blemishes. The current treatment protocol for the treatment of vascular lesions - <b>double</b> <b>scanning</b> with transient blanching used at St George's Hospital is shown to give excellent results. The protocol takes advantage of the precise control provided by the SCANALL automatic scanner and the 5 W, 578 nm output of the copper vapour laser. The clinical endpoint - transient blanching - is shown to be due to a temporary halting of blood flow (probably by vasoconstriction) rather than coagulation necrosis of overlying tissues. Various models of the laser treatment of vascular lesions are presented and examined. A histological study of the <b>double</b> <b>scanning,</b> transient blanching protocol shows that tissue damage is confined to vascular and perivascular tissue. Cosmetic lightening is due to a reduction in both the number and size of the vessels in the upper dermis. The protocol is also investigated by interview and postal survey. The incidence of adverse effects is small. For example, there are only two 1 cm² adverse skin texture changes in 64000 cm² of treated area. Patients receiving treatment for telangiectasia and spider naevus are satisfied with the outcome after one or two treatments, but many with port-wine stain cease treatment after four sessions when government funding runs out. Patient perception of the success is compared with the surgeon's perception. Patients often needed to be reminded of the size and severity of their original lesion with a photograph. The thesis reports on a parallel investigation of the use of millisecond scale pulses of white light for the treatment of tattoos. A xenon flash-lamp system is designed, constructed, and used in a clinical trial. This includes building pulse forming networks to produce rectangular current pulses of differing lengths. During the clinical trial the system produced a strong inflammatory response in the skin adjacent to the pigment, and lightening of the tattoo. Modelling, histology and other literature studies lead {{to the conclusion that the}} pulse length is too long to cause the explosive rupture of pigment-containing cells observed after Q-switched laser treatment, and too short to cause sufficient necrosis and phagocytosis of the pigment-containing cells for it to be useful clinically.

In this study, the in vitro availability of chloramphenicol in the presence of Pb and Cd was evaluated. These studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice (0. 1 M HCl) and intestinal pH (pH 9) at 37 °C over period of 180 minutes. A <b>double</b> <b>scanning</b> UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Helios Zeta, Model 164617) was used to analyze drug content by measuring absorbance at 278 nm. An overall chloramphenicol availability of 89, 88. 6 and 86 % was achieved in simulated gastric juice for chloramphenicol alone, in the presence of Pb, and of Cd respectively. The corresponding availabilities observed in simulated intestinal pH were 82. 5, 63. 2 and 63. 2 %.

40|$|Abstract Background Osteoporosis creates {{brittle bones}} {{susceptible}} to fracture, with resulting {{high levels of}} morbidity and mortality. Poor access to bone densitometry services for the residents of North Wales led to the Welsh Assembly Government offering capital to purchase a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner, used to diagnose osteoporosis, for the region. The commissioning question for the six Local Health Boards across North Wales was where to site the new scanner. This decision needed to reflect current inequalities in access to services and concerns over inappropriate prescribing relative to Welsh norms. Methods Epidemiological, corporate and comparative healthcare needs assessments were performed. In addition, two cross-sectional surveys were conducted to determine the views of general practices and users of bone densitometry services resident in North Wales. An option appraisal and sensitivity analysis of 13 costed options for DXA scanning was conducted. Results We estimated that only 31 % {{of the people in}} North Wales who met national guidelines were receiving DXA scans. There was definite inequity of access to the current service provided by area of residence. There was also evidence of inequity of access by age and sex. The most suitable option identified in the option appraisal was a bone densitometry service based in the central location of Llandudno. Conclusion The assessment identified significant unmet need for DXA scanning. A recommendation was made to improve access through the introduction of a new bone densitometry service based at Llandudno. This would <b>double</b> <b>scanning</b> provision provided and reduce travel costs and time for many North Wales residents.

40|$|Evidence {{of healing}} of {{secondary}} hyperparathyroidism in chronically hemodialyzed uremic patients treated with long-term intravenous calcitriol. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the effect of a long-term course of high-dose i. v. pulses of calcitriol (CLT) on hyperparathyroid bone disease (HBD) and functional mass of parathyroid glands of chronically hemodialyzed uremic (CHU) patients. We prospectively studied nine CHU patients treated with CLT, 30 ng/kg/body wt, i. v., thrice weekly over a period of eight months. Plasma concentrations of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), bone GLA protein (bGLA) and bone isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (biALP) were sampled throughout. Transiliac bone biopsies were made before and after the start of CLT therapy. <b>Double</b> <b>scanning</b> scintigraphy of the neck with 201 Tl- 99 Tc was made before, during and eight months after the start of the treatment. All patients but one, who later responded to higher than planned CLT doses, had significant decreases of plasma iPTH (F = 76; P < 0. 0001; ANOVA). The mean pretreatment value of PTH was 966 ± 160 (mean ± SE) pg/ml and it had decreased significantly by the first week (T = 2. 4, P < 0. 04), and had fallen an average of 80 % by the 35 th week. Ionized plasma calcium concentration was 1. 19 ±. 01 mmol/liter which rose significantly (F = 13. 5; P < 0. 0001) by the 14 th week to maximal peak levels, averaging 1. 34 ±. 02 mmol/liter. Changes in biALP were parallel to those of iPTH, while bGLA tended to increase immediately after the start of the therapy and to significantly decrease thereafter (T = 3. 2; P < 0. 01). There were significant decreases in all histomorphometric indices of HBD: the osteoid volume from 12 ± 1. 8 to 4. 8 ± 0. 5 % (P < 0. 001), the osteoid surface from 45. 7 ± 3. 2 to 27 ± 5. 2 % (P < 0. 001), the osteoblastic surface from 11. 8 ± 1. 7 to 4. 8 ± 1. 08 % (P < 0. 001), the eroded surface from 6. 6 ± 1. 2 to 4. 3 ± 0. 9 (P < 0. 002), and the osteoclast surface from 2. 2 ± 0. 3 to 1. 2 ± 0. 3 % (P < 0. 009); there was even renormalization in some individual patients. The bone formation rate was measured in six of the nine patients and was found to be lowered in all subjects who had had significant PTH decreases. The median of intensity of 201 Tl uptake before therapy scored 7. 8 (range 4 to 9. 2) arbitrary visual units and decreased significantly (P < 0. 001; Wilcoxon test) to 0. 4 (0 to 8. 25) after eight months of CLT treatment, suggesting significant decreases of the mass of the parathyroid glands. Thus, this study demonstrates that long-term therapy with high-dose i. v. pulses of CLT in CHU with proven HBD is able to consistently decrease their circulating iPTH to levels comparable with those of subjects with mild or no HBD and also to decrease the functional mass of their parathyroid glands. Further studies will ascertain what dose of CLT is required to maintain this state of euparathyroidism once the hyperparathyroidism has been reversed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe main {{intention}} of {{wireless sensor network}} is to provide {{the information about the}} spatiotemporal characteristics of the observed physical world. In many wireless sensor network applications, namely forest fire detection, animal tracking etc., it is important to locate the sensor with accuracy.

This is valid only in few networks which has location sensing devices, such as GPS receivers are available at all nodes. In real time, equipping GPS with all sensor nodes are rare due to its cost, power. To overcome these limitations various path have been proposed to derive approximated locations of all nodes using the mobile beacon.

METHODS: The EPP software was evaluated for different imaging conditions using standardized phantom experiments. Additionally, 51 patients with prostate and breast cancer were prospectively included and underwent bone scintigraphy using a standard and half-time protocol. Independent reading was performed on three image types (standard, half-time non-processed, and half-time EPP) by three observers, scoring the number and anatomical location of lesions, image quality, and diagnostic confidence by which the definitive diagnosis was made. RESULTS: EPP images had improved contrast and lower noise levels compared to the non-processed half-time images.
