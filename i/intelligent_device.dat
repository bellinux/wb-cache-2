MONs {{are a kind of}} wireless networks, which consist {{of a large number of}} stationary or mobile nodes (i.e., mobile <b>intelligent</b> <b>devices</b> carried by people). In MONs, nodes can conduct Device-to-Device (D 2 D) message transmission in a self-organizing and multi-hop manner via Bluetooth or WiFi [8, 9, 31]. Additionally, by utilizing the opportunities of nodes’ encounter and the short-distance wireless communication capability of mobile <b>intelligent</b> <b>devices,</b> nodes can establish temporary communication links between them and then exchange messages with higher transmission rate [21]. Furthermore, the entire transmission process does not require the support of the communication infrastructures and the phased multi-hop message forwarding is implemented in a “store-carry-forward” paradigm, which can effectively alleviate the current pressure of mobile big data faced by the communication infrastructures [3, 4, 12, 15]. Therefore, MONs will have broad application and can be widely deployed and applied in many fields, such as the intelligent transportation, intelligent medical treatment, and disaster rescue in the near future [1].|$|R

30|$|In smart substation, {{multicast}} transmission is adopted for SMV and GOOSE messages. Namely, switch will broadcast and transmit SMV and GOOSE messages, and all <b>intelligent</b> <b>devices</b> will receive related messages, {{which will be}} filtered by network card and then be transmitted to application module, thus the network load of SMV and GOOSE will have influences on the <b>intelligent</b> <b>devices</b> in the whole network. In present smart substation, the SMV flow and GOOSE flow of one bay do not exceed 8  Mbps and 0.1  Mbps respectively. For a substation with 30 bays, the load of process level network in the whole substation won’t exceed 240  Mbps. If Gigabit LAN is adopted, the load of process level network won’t exceed 25 %. This flow is relatively small for switch, but not so for <b>intelligent</b> <b>devices</b> like protection devices and BCU, etc., and the load of process level network needs to be reduced by proper means. Process level messages may be isolated in one bay through {{virtual local area network}} (VLAN), static multicast management or GARP multicast registration protocol (GMRP), in order to control the flow of process level data. By proper means, the influences of process level data on <b>intelligent</b> <b>devices</b> may be greatly lowered, and the shared-network of SMV and GOOSE will be possible.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} on {{investigation}} {{and implementation of}} embedded EPICS controllers {{by the use of}} micro-ITRON to overcome many disadvantages caused by the advent of Ethernet-based device controllers. 　　At present almost all accelerator control systems are kind of DCS (Distributed Control Systems) on the basis of so called the standard model. In the standard model, the control system consists of three layers: the presentation layer, the device control layer and the interface layer. 　　Another trend of accelerator control systems at present is to use a free toolkit for its middle-ware. Among a few toolkits, EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) is the most widely used. EPICS was first developed in 1991. EPICS’s open, free and full DCS-based features have made it to be adopted in many control systems of scientific facilities, such as accelerators, telescopes, and large high-energy experiments. 　　EPICS is designed {{on the basis of the}} standard model. The first two layers, namely, the presentation layer and the device control layer, are divided functionally, but connected with each other through a high-speed network such as FDDI. The presentation layer which is called OPI (Operator Interface) layer in the EPICS terminology is typically composed of several workstations and X-terminals that are used as operator consoles. The device control layer consists of VME IOCs (Input/Output Controller) and/or other kinds of computers to accomplish the data processing and control logic. The interface layer is composed of I/O modules on IOC or other field bus modules that interface devices. 　　Recent rapid development of Ethernet has made it de fact international standard as the network in accelerator control systems. More and more device controllers with Ethernet interface have been widely used, such as PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller), to replace old field bus interface device controllers. These Ethernet-based device controllers are equipped with more CPU power and memory capacity, and have become intelligent enough to process the control logic that was originally accomplished by IOCs. 　　Now due to the advent of Ethernet-based device controllers, the standard EPICS 3 -Layer model becomes redundant and show some disadvantages: 　・ Lacking of real-time response: IOCs communicates with <b>intelligent</b> <b>device</b> 　　controllers through Ethernet, while, Ethernet, as defined in IEEE 802. 3, is 　　unsuitable for strict real-time industrial applications because its 　　communication is non-deterministic. 　・ Ineffective use of hardware: in EPICS, when we use <b>intelligent</b> <b>device</b> 　　controllers, a complicated device driver called “asynchronous driver” is put 　　on IOCs to drive <b>intelligent</b> <b>device</b> controllers. Expensive VME machine are 　　only used as “protocol transformer” that translates the manufacture’s 　　proprietary protocol to EPICS CA (Channel Access) protocol. 　・ Duplication of programs: we have put runtime database on IOCs and also 　　similar programs at <b>intelligent</b> <b>device</b> controllers such as Ladder on PLCs. 　　One way to avoid these disadvantages and maximally use the benefit of using <b>intelligent</b> <b>device</b> controllers is to implement integrating control software (IOC core program named as iocCore in EPICS) on these <b>intelligent</b> <b>device</b> controllers, thus making existed <b>intelligent</b> <b>device</b> controllers to work as separated IOCs. We call this type of controller embedded EPICS controller. 　　From EPICS base 3. 14. x, iocCore supports can run not only on VxWorks but also recent versions of RTEMS, Solaris, Linux, HPUX, Darwin and Windows, and there have been some implementations of embedded EPICS controllers running on VxWorks and Linux. But they all have some shortages. For example, embedded EPICS controller running on Linux does not have any good real-time response, and embedded EPICS controller running on VxWorks lacks BSP (Board Support Package) support from the hardware manufacturer. 　　Many <b>intelligent</b> <b>device</b> controllers available on the market in Japan use micro-ITRON, a kind of Japanese domestic real-time kernel. The advantage of micro-ITRON is that these <b>intelligent</b> <b>device</b> controllers have BSP for micro-ITRON. We have investigated the use of micro-ITRON as a kernel on Ethernet-based device controllers and also implemented embedded EPICS Controllers on micro-ITRON. 　　After implementing embedded EPICS Controllers running on micro-ITRON, the redundant device control layer can be omitted. EPICS architecture can be recovered back to the standard 3 -Layer model and the disadvantages mentioned before can be eliminated. Also running iocCore on micro-ITRON allows us to apply embedded EPICS concept to smaller devices that could not be supported by previous solution. This thesis also discusses the performance of the embedded EPICS Controllers and shows that it can be used for real applications...|$|E

Minimizing the time and effort needed to communicate our intent will allow us to concentrate on tasks in which we excel, including creative thought and problem solving. An intuitive method to minimize human communication effort with <b>intelligent</b> <b>devices</b> is to take advantage of our existing interpersonal communication experience. Recent advances in speech, hand gesture, and facial expression recognition provide alternate viable modes of communication that are more natural than conventional tactile interfaces. Use of natural human communication eliminates the need to adapt and invest time and effort using less intuitive techniques required for traditional keyboard and mouse based interfaces. Although {{the state of the art}} in natural but isolated modes of communication achieves impressive results, significant hurdles must be conquered before communication with devices in our daily lives will feel natural and effortless. Research has shown that combining information between multiple noise-prone modalities improves accuracy. Leveraging this complementary and redundant content will improve communication robustness and relax current unimodal limitations. This research presents and evaluates a novel multimodal framework to help reduce the total human effort and time required to communicate with <b>intelligent</b> <b>devices.</b> This reduction is realized by determining human intent using a knowledge-based architecture that combines and leverages conflicting information available across multiple natural communication modes and modalities. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated using dynamic hand gestures and simple facial expressions characterizing basic emotions. It is important to note that the framework is not restricted to these two forms of communication. The framework presented in this research provides the flexibility necessary to include additional or alternate modalities and channels of information in future research, including improving the robustness of speech understanding. The primary contributions of this research include the leveraging of conflicts in a closed-loop multimodal framework, explicit use of uncertainty in knowledge representation and reasoning across multiple modalities, and a flexible approach for leveraging domain specific knowledge to help understand multimodal human expression. Experiments using a manually defined knowledge base demonstrate an improved average accuracy of individual concepts and an improved average accuracy of overall intents when leveraging conflicts as compared to an open-loop approach...|$|R
