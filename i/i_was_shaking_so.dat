6000|$|... "Not if {{you leave}} me! You must come with me," [...] I said, still {{dreading}} that he would leave me in church, send a fly, and fall a victim at the [...] "Boar;" [...] and, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>so,</b> {{that he would not}} withdraw his arm, and said, soothingly, [...] "I'm coming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{cried the}} king, his love shining in his eyes, [...] "how could I {{for an instant}} doubt her! And yet <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>shaken</b> by the others! Francoise is as true as steel. Was it not a {{beautiful}} letter, Louvois?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> so {{disappointed}} {{by the appearance of}} these wretched interlopers at the moment it was about to be decided whether my life--should it last for years, or but for a few minutes--was to be black or bright, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>shaken</b> and startled by the manner of their entry upon the scene, that I could not immediately shape the words necessary to inform Agnes what had happened. But, collecting my faculties, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about to speak, when suddenly, with the force of the hind leg of a mule, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> pushed away from the aperture, and the demoniac Italian clapped his great mouth {{to the end of the}} tube and roared through it a volume of oaths and supplications. I attempted to thrust aside the wretched being, but I might as well have tried to move the ice barrier itself. He had perceived that some one outside was talking to me, and in his frenzy he was imploring that some one should let him out.|$|R
60|$|The banker's clerk took up {{the lamp}} and led the way. But he paused in the passage outside the door, and his hand <b>was</b> <b>shaking,</b> <b>so</b> that the light flickered {{up and down the}} high, bare walls.|$|R
5000|$|In , {{the group}} arms {{themselves}} with Kill-o-Zap guns against the Krikkiters. Arthur [...] "fumbled {{to release the}} safety catch and engage the extreme danger catch as Ford had shown him. He <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>so</b> much that if he'd fired at anybody at that moment {{he probably would have}} burnt his signature on them." ...|$|R
60|$|Gorman made an effort. The knife was dull. He was weak. Besides, {{his hand}} <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>so</b> violently that he nearly dropped the knife. The three boys were {{crouched}} apart, in a huddle, crying and sobbing. With {{the exception of}} Mahoney, the men were gathered about the victim, craning their necks to see.|$|R
50|$|Vibratory feeders {{rely on the}} {{mechanical}} behaviour of a part, such that when gently shaken down a conveyor chute that is shaped to fit the part, they will gradually <b>be</b> <b>shaken</b> <b>so</b> that they <b>are</b> all aligned. They thus leave the feeder's conveyor one-by-one, {{all in the same}} orientation. This conveyor then leads directly to the following assembly or packing machine.|$|R
60|$|Up {{on the top}} of {{the stairs}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> with excitement. <b>I</b> heard Lord Cheisford speak, and his voice was hoarse.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Stone, who <b>was</b> indeed <b>shaking</b> <b>so</b> that {{he could}} hardly stand, allowed Hilary to assist him into bed and tuck the {{blankets}} round him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shaken! Yes, in {{one sense}} <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>shaken.</b> <b>I</b> don't know quite what you mean. <b>I</b> shall never <b>be</b> <b>shaken</b> in the other way." ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{we reached}} the White House and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> hands with the President, he started to say something, but I {{interrupted}} him and said: ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. JONES. But {{of course}} when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> out my husband's coat the cigarette-box fell out {{and all the}} {{cigarettes}} were scattered on the bed.|$|R
60|$|He helped Ned to {{his feet}} and held the glass to his lips, for the boy's hand <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>so</b> that he could not have held it. After {{drinking}} it Ned stumbled upstairs and threw himself on the bed, and there cried silently for a long time; but the first passion of grief had passed, and he now struggled with his tears, and in an hour rose, bathed his flushed and swollen face, and went downstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But {{it may not}} <b>be</b> so. <b>I</b> own to you, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>shaken,</b> Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's {{not having}} {{had the power to}} prevent this arrest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never," [...] I answered, {{notwithstanding}} my pity of {{the brave}} girl, and then while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> lest he should go in to visit Nanny, I heard the echo of the Auld Licht bell.|$|R
6000|$|... "'It <b>is</b> a surrender,' <b>I</b> said. And <b>I</b> {{remember}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> {{her wrists}} <b>I</b> held apart in my hands. 'But it's more than talk. Your {{father told me}} to go on in God's name.' ...|$|R
60|$|I endured it stoutly, but {{inwardly}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken,</b> as <b>I</b> {{wrote to}} Philip, giving him full {{details of what}} had been said and what answers I had returned, what bitter draughts <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> forced to swallow.|$|R
6000|$|... "The mate {{pointed to}} starboard, but as ’is ’and <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>so</b> that one minute it was {{pointing}} to the sky an’ the next to the bottom o’ the sea, it wasn’t much of a guide to us. Even when he got it steady we couldn’t see anything, till all of a sudden, about two miles off, something like a telegraph pole stuck {{up out of the}} water for a few seconds, and then ducked down again and made straight for the ship.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Lavender went along, {{not sorry}} to have the {{protection}} of that stalwart form, for his nerve <b>was</b> <b>shaken,</b> not <b>so</b> much by physical suffering as by the revelation he had received.|$|R
60|$|I crept {{close to}} {{him and told him}} in a breathless undertone, and I knew that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> the while. He listened gravely, and when I had {{finished}} laid a firm hand on my head.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{shall have}} a {{fortnight}} {{to pick up}} on board the steamer,' Captain Hampton said. 'I have just had a bout of illness, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>shaking</b> it off, and it will be at least three weeks before <b>I</b> <b>am</b> at Omaha.' ...|$|R
60|$|Of course I saw the trick. This was {{the real}} parson upon whose outer man Colonel Clay had {{modelled}} his little curate. But the jury <b>was</b> <b>shaken.</b> And <b>so</b> <b>was</b> Charles for a moment.|$|R
5000|$|White {{fled the}} scene as Feinstein entered the office where Milk lay dead. She grabbed his wrist for a pulse, her finger {{entering}} Milk's bullet wound. Horrified, Feinstein <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>so</b> badly she required support from the police chief after identifying both bodies. Feinstein then announced the murders to a stunned public, stating: [...] "As President of the Board of Supervisors, it's my duty to make this announcement. Both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed. The suspect is Supervisor Dan White." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> nervous. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> and didn't {{know what}} to do. And all the time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mumbling strange words. At first the {{audience}} was surprised of the idiot that, sweating like a pig, stood before them. But after a while they started to laugh." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, mind how you put it, Bucket," [...] {{cried the}} old man anxiously with his hand at his ear. [...] "Speak up; none of your {{brimstone}} tricks. Pick me up; I want to hear better. Oh, Lord, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>shaken</b> to bits!" ...|$|R
50|$|Bobby Sherman and David Soul were {{propelled}} to pop stardom as Jason's brothers, Jeremy and Joshua. Jeremy took {{a prominent}} role, {{not only as}} the boyfriend of Candy Pruitt (Bridget Hanley), the beautiful, unofficial leader of the brides, {{but also as a}} young man struggling with a conversation-stopping stammer. In one episode, he is temporarily cured of his impediment, following coaching by a traveler who has come to Seattle. Upon discovering that his benefactor is actually a con artist, his faith <b>is</b> <b>shaken</b> <b>so</b> deeply that the stammer returns.|$|R
60|$|On {{the night}} of the 15th the gale broke out again with redoubled fury, and the stage at the mission station <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> <b>so</b> much by the {{violence}} of the waves and wind that fears were entertained of its stability, despite its great strength. The water rose six inches during that night, and when the vast extent of the floods is taken into account, this rise was prodigious. The current was also so strong that it was feared the church itself, with the property and people in its loft, would be swept away.|$|R
60|$|There is a {{grain of}} superstition in the most level-headed man. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not {{particularly}} level-headed, and I {{have more than a}} grain in me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken.</b> Ever since <b>I</b> had asked Cynthia to marry me, {{it seemed as if the}} ghost of Audrey had come back into my life.|$|R
60|$|In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured no longer; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{obliged to}} yield, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> {{from head to}} foot with acute distress. When I did speak, it was only to express an impetuous wish that <b>I</b> had never <b>been</b> born, or never come to Thornfield.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your mother {{saw that}} I meant what I said; it isn't {{everybody}} that does me the honour to perceive that. She saw that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> {{from head to}} foot. I could only say three words--I couldn't have spoken more! What a power--what a power, Miss Tarrant!" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "The {{doctors said}} it was all due to the {{pressure}} of the show and the diet <b>I</b> <b>was</b> eating. Hours later <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting a boardroom grilling from Sir Alan after the wedding task. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> with nerves convinced <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about to throw up all over Sir Alan and his sidekicks, Nick and Margaret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, Alda,' said Wilmet earnestly, 'you {{must not}} talk without knowing. Till I went there, I never {{understood}} how much goodness and principle {{there could be}} without my stiffness and particularity. I know <b>I</b> have often <b>been</b> very unnecessarily disagreeable and disapproving, and <b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>shaken</b> out of it in time.' ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{voice was}} cold and measured; her manner strangely formal and hard. It {{seemed to me that}} she was {{absolutely}} resolved not to be drawn into any argument or explanation. As for me, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> with agitation, and I turned my face aside, so ashamed <b>was</b> <b>I</b> that she should see my want of control.|$|R
6000|$|Inwardly, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken.</b> Not--in {{orthodox}} {{language from}} any [...] "conviction of sin." [...] Yet {{it was my}} first intimation that my part in the legislation referred to was known to any save a select few. I blamed Krebs, and a hot anger arose within me against him. After all, what could they prove? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My experience," [...] he said, [...] "has {{included}} many melancholy duties, and has tried my composure in terrible scenes; but I have never yet {{found myself in}} the presence of an unrepentant criminal, sentenced to death--and that criminal a woman and a mother. I own, sir, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>shaken</b> by the prospect before me." ...|$|R
60|$|There came {{a climax}} {{when she tried}} to jump out of a window, and he had to save her by some perfunctary, unmeant wooing. Even <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> by the depths of the {{absorbing}} affection she showed. Home, friends, traditions, creeds went up like thistle-down in the scale against her love. It was really discomposing.|$|R
