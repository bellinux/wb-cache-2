A ten-second instrumental of the recording was featured on the 4 February 1998 episode of Dexter's Laboratory.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 23 reviews. Jody Rosen, writing for Entertainment Weekly, {{commented that the}} album's songs [...] "arrive in huge gusts of rhythm and emotion, with Beyoncé's voice rippling over clattery beats". Jonah Weiner of Blender commented that [...] "sweaty up-tempo numbers prove the best platform for Beyoncé's rapperly phrasing and pipe-flaunting fireballs". Andy Kellman of Allmusic felt that, despite [...] "no songs with the smooth elegance" [...] of [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] or [...] "Be with You", the album is [...] "lean in a beneficial way". The Boston Globes Sarah Rodman commented that the production team helped Beyoncé [...] "focus on edgier, up-tempo tracks that take <b>her</b> <b>sweet</b> soprano to new places". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that, [...] "apart from a few pop-R space-fillers, there's not much to dislike about B'Day". Robert Christgau from MSN Music said [...] "on most of [...] she's wronged yet still in control because she's got so much money" [...] and felt that Beyoncé [...] "earns her props" [...] if [...] "opulence can signify liberation in this grotesquely materialistic time, as in hip-hop it can".|$|E

The Lodi News-Sentinel dubbed [...] "A Change in Me" [...] one of the musical's [...] "new favorites". Tamara Ikenberg of the Alaska Dispatch News described the song as [...] "a gorgeous, revelatory piece". The New Jersey Monthly called the ballad a musical highlight. Individual performers are often commended for their renditions. Bob Curtright of The Wichita Eagle complimented actress Jillian Butterfield's [...] "clear soprano" [...] for [...] "captur the right moods" [...] on musical numbers such as “A Change in Me".

500|$|Casting for {{the film}} began as soon as Madonna had signed up for it. Griffin Dunne was signed to play the part of Loudon Trott, a lawyer whose job was to help Nikki get on a bus, after she was released. Initially Madonna had thought of asking Penn to play the part of Detective Bellson, but Penn was serving a 60-day jail term, having {{violated}} the probation he received in 1986, for assaulting a friend of Madonna and attacking an extra {{on the set of}} At Close Range. The part went to Robert Swan, followed by the signing of John McMartin, Haviland Morris and Bibi Besch as Trott's father-in-law, fiancée, and mother-in-law [...] respectively. Madonna herself commented that she had a lot in common with the character Nikki. [...] "She's courageous and sweet and funny and misunderstood. But she clears her name in the last, and that's always good to do. I'm continuously doing that with the public. I liked Nikki's tough side and <b>her</b> <b>sweet</b> side. The toughness is only a mask for the vulnerability she feels inside." [...] Madonna was also offered the lead role in the Blake Edwards comedy film Blind Date opposite to Bruce Willis, but she refused it in favor of Slammer. She said, [...] "The thing I had planned to do after Shanghai Surprise was Blind Date at Tri-Star. I was supposed to have the approval of the director and the leading man, but they didn't tell me they'd already hired Bruce Willis. That... just didn't work out. But I was really excited about doing a real physical, screwball comedy, so when Jamie brought this up, it was like my reward." [...] Coati Mundi, member of Kid Creole and the Coconuts, and Madonna's long-time friend joined the cast {{to play the role of}} Raoul, Nikki's enemy. Costume designer Deborah Scott was signed to create the wardrobe {{for the film}}. Madonna, who visualized the character of Nikki as a dizzy screwball blond, started watching the screwball comedies of the sixties, especially the work of actors like Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and Judy Holiday. She asked Scott to create comical rah-rah and ballet tutu skirts for the character, with fishnet tights and loud make-up. Scott also designed a glamorous Monroe-esque dress for the love scene between her and Dunne.|$|E
2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Like Gaston pointed out, Belle has a {{knack for}} finding monsters. Flashbacks showed how <b>her</b> <b>sweet</b> nature has been a benefit and how it's caused {{problems}} for her. The trip backwards was so-so, but Germann's performance and Hades' machinations made the episode." [...] Ratcliffe gave the episode a 7.0 rating out of 10.|$|E

Sarah-Louise James from the Daily Star gave a positive review, saying, [...] "Fans of <b>her</b> <b>sweet,</b> soaring vocals and power ballads won't be disappointed." [...] Chris Elwell-Sutton of the Evening Standard said that Spirit will be [...] "a very successful album with some much-needed grit." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, claiming that although Lewis had a pallet of different producers working with her, they managed to prevent her from sounding [...] "too fusty or old-fashioned." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said [...] "Lewis can hit those big notes but make it seem easy, never straining her voice and building nicely to the climax. Unlike most divas, there is a human quality to her voice, as she's singing to the song, not singing to her voice." [...] He compared it to Mariah Carey's debut album, but criticised the old-fashioned sound. Popjustice's review was brief, summing up that [...] " [...] has four absolutely blinding tracks on it, three far better than average tracks on it, and some others which are quite good. There are no totally chronic songs on Spirit apart from 'A Moment Like This'." [...] The Boston Globes Sarah Rodman praised Lewis's ability to make unremarkable songs sound impressive, saying [...] "The tracks are impeccably manicured, super-tuneful, and offer lyrics about the various agonies and ecstasies of love that are unremarkable in and of themselves but reach nuclear-threat levels of desperation thanks to Lewis's voice." ...|$|E
