The report’s findings stated that the loss of life occurred due to faulty directions being given, lack of fire-fighting training, and an inadequate rescue and fire-fighting service. It also noted inadequate training of staff in <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>evacuation,</b> both at the orphanage and local fire service.|$|E
40|$|AbstractReferring to the performance-based <b>fire</b> {{protection}} <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>evacuation,</b> safety evacuation {{ability in}} a college library was analyzed. The fire loads <b>and</b> <b>evacuation</b> crowds of reading rooms was statistically analyzed with the on-the-spot Survey. The 4 th reading room was considered as the most unfavourable <b>evacuation</b> area, <b>and</b> then it was reasonably simplified. The RSET (Required Safety Evacuation Time) was calculated according to experiential formulas, <b>and</b> ASET (Available <b>Safety</b> <b>Evacuation</b> Time) was determined by simulating room fire with field model FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator). Then the evacuation ability of the 4 th Reading-Room can be confirmed if RSET<ASET. Based on the analysis above, the <b>fire</b> protection <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>evacuation</b> performance in the college library can be affirmed...|$|R
40|$|Evacuation {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} investigate the walking speed and the behaviour in smoke filled road tunnels. Three types of wayguidance systems, namely flashing lights, rows of flashing lights and floor markings, were tested in the experiments. A thermal imaging infrared camera was used to observe human behaviour during evacuation. The results show {{a relationship between the}} walking speed and the extinction coefficient. The study also reveals that persons who follow a wall without emergency exits in a smoke filled tunnel may not notice exits at the opposite side, which may be devastating during a real tunnel fire. Based on the experiments recommendations are given on how tunnels can be designed to improve the <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> make <b>evacuation</b> through smoke easier...|$|R
40|$|The changed global {{security}} {{situation in the}} last eight years has shown the importance of emergency management plans in public buildings. Therefore, the use of computer simulators for surveying <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> design <b>and</b> <b>evacuation</b> process is increasing. The aim of these simulators is to have more realistic evacuation simulations. The challenge is, firstly, to realize the virtual simulation environment based on geometrical and material boundary conditions, secondly, to considerate the mutual interaction effects between different parameters and, finally, to have a realistic visualization of the simulated results. In order to carry out this task, an especial new software method on a BIM-platform has to be developed which can integrate all required simulations and will be able to have an immersive output BIM ISEE (Immersive Safety Engineering Environment). The new BIM-ISEE will integrate the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) for fire <b>and</b> <b>evacuation</b> simulation in the Autodesk Revit which is a BIM-platform and will represent the simulation results in the immersive virtual environment at the institute (CES-Lab). With BIM-ISEE the <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> engineer will be able to obtain more realistic visualizations in the immersive environment, to modify his concept more effectively, to evaluate the simulation results more accurately and to visualize the various simulation results. It can also give the rescue staff the opportunity to perform <b>and</b> evaluate emergency <b>evacuation</b> trainings...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effects of escape route design and specification, and time taken on evacuation process in high-rise residential buildings in Malaysia. The aim is to produce a <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> model on how <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> standards in high-rise residential buildings {{can be achieved by}} investigating the relationship between human behaviour and structural design, particularly escape route design and specification. In Malaysia, research on <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> is very new, particularly research on provision of <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> in high-rise residential buildings. The number of fire cases involved residential buildings is significantly high compared to other building types. Thus, escape routes in high-rise residential buildings should be designed and constructed to enable the occupants to evacuate the building as soon as fire has been detected. Mixed methodologies i. e. quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted in this research. There are three research methods adopted i. e. observation, simulation and questionnaire. Observations were carried out to identify any problems encountered and to develop the study models for further analysis. Investigations of {{the effects of}} escape route design <b>and</b> specification on <b>evacuation</b> process were carried out using specialist software, i. e. Simulex, which simulates the evacuation of people from the building. The aim is to study escape route specifications i. e. staircase, fire door and corridor. Questionnaire surveys were than carried out to investigate the occupant’s characteristics, behaviours, perceptions and motivation factors to evacuate the building. From this research, <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> models proposed for high-rise residential buildings as follows, (1) <b>Fire</b> <b>safety</b> model to achieve <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> standard in high-rise residential buildings, (2) Escape route designs and specifications, and, (3) Human behaviour model. There are five <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> components that need to be enhanced i. e. (1) <b>Fire</b> <b>Safety</b> Awareness, (2) <b>Fire</b> <b>Safety</b> Design, (3) <b>Fire</b> <b>Safety</b> Equipments <b>and</b> <b>Evacuation</b> Skill, (4) <b>Fire</b> <b>Safety</b> Audit, <b>and</b> (5) <b>Fire</b> <b>Safety</b> Enforcement. Besides, there are four factors which highly influence the <b>evacuation</b> process, fire <b>and</b> casualty risk i. e. : (1) People behaviour – knowledge and experience, (2) building element and escape routes design, (3) active fire protection system, and (4) legislation and enforcement.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the topic of <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> {{security}} measures and their mutual in-teraction. A designer or stakeholder may be confronted with conflicting objectives regarding life <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> object security. Often, escape routes pass via areas that are under non-emergency condi-tions subject to access control, accessible only to members of staff, contractors, etc. When fire alarm is activated, {{it is necessary to}} provide fast <b>and</b> unhindered <b>evacuation</b> from the premises, which may involve using restricted-access back-of-house areas. On a case study – section of a shopping centre – the concepts of both <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> security are presented. Firstly, the areas are analysed in terms of their importance from life <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> property security points of view and subsequently solutions are proposed to address any issues. In certain cases a balance between <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> security requirements must be found, i. e. {{it is not possible to}} fully satisfy both objectives at the same time, whereas in other <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> security systems have been found mutually complementary...|$|R

40|$|There the {{conception}} of <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> explosion <b>safety</b> of prerepairs <b>and</b> <b>fire</b> works at the tanks has been formulated for the first time. The principles of <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> have been substantiated. The mechanisms of heat and mass exchange, the critical conditions of ignition have been ascertained. The fire-technical requirements for the prerepair operations, the new increase manners of level of <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> explosion <b>safety</b> of prerepairs (including the non-cleared tanks) have been developed; the classification of <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> explosion <b>safety</b> of <b>fire</b> works has been presented.
