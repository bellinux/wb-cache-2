5|$|On 4 July 2009, Mills {{opened a}} vegan {{restaurant}} called VBites at Hove Lagoon, Hove, Sussex. Mills {{is quoted as}} saying that she intends it to be the first in a worldwide chain of vegan restaurants. Whilst promoting the restaurant, Mills gave an interview to the BBC, stating that she'd been very proactive in the building stages and now that it was open, would give as much time to it as she could – working <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> charity work. In May 2013 she sold the restaurant premises to local record producer Fatboy Slim and opened a new, enlarged VBites in East Street in Brighton.|$|E
2500|$|Norris was {{released}} from the Atascadero State Hospital in 1975, with five years' probation, having been declared by doctors as an individual who was of [...] "no further danger to others". Just three months after his release, Norris approached a 27-year-old woman walking home from a restaurant in Redondo Beach and offered her a ride on his motorcycle. When she declined, Norris parked his motorcycle and grabbed the woman's scarf, twisting <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck, before informing her he intended to rape her and dragging her into nearby bushes. Fearing for her life, the woman did not resist the rape.|$|E
2500|$|She and her men {{continued}} their activities {{for several months}} and stashed their cargo in several hiding spots until they could be gradually disposed of through fences and pawn shops along the Hudson and East Rivers. By {{the end of the}} summer, the farmers had begun resisting the raids, attacking landing parties with gunfire. The group abandoned the sloop and Sadie returned to the Fourth Ward, where she was now known as the [...] "Queen of the Waterfront". She then is claimed to have made a truce with Gallus Mag, who then returned Sadie's ear. Mag had displayed it in a pickled jar in the bar. Sadie kept the ear in a locket and wore <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
50|$|Some artists depict Sooraya's abaya incorrectly, having <b>it</b> tightly cinched <b>around</b> <b>her</b> body, which disregards {{the purpose}} of wearing an abaya.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Traquair {{began working}} {{one day a week}} at a press agency fitting <b>it</b> in <b>around</b> <b>her</b> studies. During this work placement, Traquair wrote a front page story in a {{national}} paper about job losses due to the beef crisis.|$|R
60|$|Again Bradley's arm seemed {{necessary}} to her safety, {{but this time}} <b>it</b> closed <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> strong and resolute, yet he dared not say a word. He was not sure of her. It seemed impossible that this wonderful, beautiful, and intellectual woman should care for him; and yet, when he was speaking, her eyes had pleaded for him.|$|R
60|$|Aynesworth {{found her}} rug and wrapped <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> She {{leaned back and}} closed her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Slone started violently. Abashed, shamed {{to realize}} he had {{forgotten}} she was half nude, he blindly tore off his coat, blindly folded <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob {{from the}} top of an andiron, and passed <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> so that she could see it, and said: ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{wears the}} popularized turban, with a scarf rapped <b>around</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Her</b> collar is heavy with lace, and her crimson {{petticoat}} is trimmed in fur, 1785.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] she answered, with patient sweetness. [...] "You may gag me {{in any way}} you please. I am {{perfectly}} {{sure you}} can secure the proof you want." [...] Upon this hint I acted. Taking a large kerchief from my pocket, I tied <b>it</b> tightly <b>around</b> <b>her</b> mouth, knotting <b>it</b> at the back, and then, in growing excitement, challenged the ghostly voice: [...] "Now, 'Wilbur,' let's hear from you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Brown's {{hair was}} 34 in long {{and had never}} been cut, {{chemically}} treated or heated with irons. It was her most prized possession. She washed it with [...] "pure soap" [...] twice weekly and combed it twice a day; it stretched down to her knees when she combed it out. She normally wore <b>it</b> wrapped <b>around</b> <b>her</b> head in a braid, {{and as a result}} was known as the [...] "lady with the crown".|$|R
60|$|Jean saw Ellen {{catch the}} blouse {{and try to}} wrap <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> while she sagged {{against the wall and}} stared at the door. The hoof beats pounded to a solid thumping halt just outside.|$|E
60|$|De Chavasse {{would again}} have interposed. He stooped {{and picked up}} Sue's cloak which had fallen to the ground, and as {{he went up to}} her with the obvious {{intention}} of replacing <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> shoulders, she checked him, with a slight motion of her hand.|$|E
60|$|Lawrence {{was quite}} sure, from {{what had been}} told him, that Aunt Patsy's demise had taken place before they left the church, {{but he did not}} say so to Annie. He merely took his arm from the back of her chair, and placed <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Illustrated by Tara McPherson. Fourteen pages long, <b>it</b> {{revolves}} <b>around</b> Snow, <b>her</b> sister Rose, and Frau Totenkinder, {{and includes}} the first visual look at Snow and Bigby's first meeting. Also {{used as a}} framing story for the [...] "The Witch's Tale".|$|R
5000|$|Carl Rosenthal is a son to a {{competing}} corporation of the Burnsworth enterprise {{and therefore a}} third husband candidate in Kajika's game with her father. He is claustrophobic because when he {{was six years old}} he fell in a well. Carl falls in love with Kajika and says <b>it</b> feels comfortable <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cecilia's exact date {{of birth}} is not known, {{although}} <b>it</b> is <b>around</b> 1785. <b>Her</b> father was Arthur Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran; her mother, Elizabeth née Underwood. She was styled Lady Cecilia Gore at birth, the courtesy title of a daughter of an earl.|$|R
60|$|She took a white apron {{from the}} peg near the {{fireplace}} and tied <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist. Then she placed another bowl {{on the table for}} Tot, and busied herself about the work while the boy lay on the soft carpet and stroked the silk-like fur of the two gray kittens.|$|E
60|$|Dorothy obeyed. She ran at once {{behind the}} Nome King, {{who was still}} trying to free his eyes from the egg, and in a {{twinkling}} she had unbuckled his splendid jeweled belt and carried it away with her to her place beside the Tiger and Lion, where, because she did not {{know what else to do}} with it, she fastened <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> own slim waist.|$|E
60|$|One {{of these}} {{seafaring}} men the shipmaster, indeed, who {{had spoken to}} Hester Prynne was so smitten with Pearl's aspect, that he attempted to lay hands upon her, with purpose to snatch a kiss. Finding it as impossible to touch her as to catch a humming-bird in the air, he took from his hat the gold chain that was twisted about it, and threw it to the child. Pearl immediately twined <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck and waist with such happy skill, that, once seen there, it {{became a part of}} her, and it was difficult to imagine her without it.|$|E
50|$|Rolex {{still use}} Gleitze's {{achievement}} (2010) in their publicity. In 2010 the Rolex company was running adverts featuring swimming the channel, their watch, {{and the figure}} of a woman in a swimming costume. The advert does not mention Gleitze, nor does it mention that she did not complete a channel swim whilst wearing the watch. The advert shows the swimmer wearing the watch on her wrist although when Gleitze attempted to carry the watch across the channel she had <b>it</b> tied <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck.|$|R
50|$|The casemate of Texas {{was roughly}} octagonal, {{rather than being}} a sloped, rectangular, armored box, as on earlier Confederate ironclads; during construction, it was {{shortened}} due to critical war materials shortages. <b>It</b> fitted snugly <b>around</b> <b>her</b> eight gunport positions, six of which were {{to be used with}} two pivot cannons, each firing from three forward or aft positions.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} face proudly for her friend Mrs. Fink to see. One eye was nearly closed, with a great, greenish-purple bruise <b>around</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Her</b> lip was cut and {{bleeding}} a little and there were red finger-marks {{on each side of}} her neck.|$|R
60|$|While speaking, she had unconsciously laid aside her fan, {{lifted her}} {{mantilla}} {{from her head}} with both hands, and, drawing <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> shoulders and under her lifted chin, had crossed it over her bosom with a certain prim, automatic gesture, {{as if it had}} been the starched kerchief of some remote Puritan ancestress. With her arms still unconsciously crossed, she stooped rigidly, picked up her fan with three fingers, {{as if it had been}} a prayer-book, and, with a slight inclination of her bared head, with its accurately parted brown hair, passed slowly out of the corridor.|$|E
60|$|For Eve, {{with the}} taste that nature moulded into her composition, {{has taken a}} remnant of {{exquisite}} silver gauze and drawn <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> forms, with an effect that gives Adam his first idea of the witchery of dress. He beholds his spouse {{in a new light}} and with renewed admiration; yet is hardly reconciled to any other attire than her own golden locks. However, emulating Eve's example, he makes free with a mantle of blue velvet, and puts it on so picturesquely that it might seem to have fallen from heaven upon his stately figure. Thus garbed they go in search of new discoveries.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lower her down," [...] said Mr. Chipperton, from below. He did {{not seem}} flurried at all, but I saw that no time was to be lost, for a man was trying to cut or untie a rope which still held the boat to the steamer. Then she would be off. There was a light line on the deck near me--I had caught my foot in it, a minute before. It {{was strong enough to}} hold Corny. I got hold of one end of it and tied <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> under her arms. She had a great shawl, as well as a life-preserver, tied around her, and looked dreadfully bundled up.|$|E
40|$|Regina {{waved the}} bee {{from her face}} and watched <b>it</b> circle <b>around</b> <b>her</b> in a dizzy path. When {{she could no longer}} see it, she ran to the lilac bush and shook it. The last bee had been {{hovering}} among the great purple clusters and had fled when she had touched it. Perhaps there would be another one to shoo away if she looked at each purple mass. Carefully she separated the blossoms with her hands and peered into the shadows. There were no more bees, only the scent of the flowers...|$|R
50|$|Shinazuki Yukiji: A {{teenage girl}} {{who goes to}} an all-girls school with another side she doesn't find out about until she meets another girl with a deity in her headband, despite <b>it</b> {{focusing}} <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> She {{seems to have a}} short temper only with Tamakichi, and even then, he always tells her that she's very patient. Yukiji is referred to as 'Sleeping Beauty' or 'Sleeping Princess' by Tamakichi, because she's the Tsukumo Master that many have been looking for or trying to hide. It is hinted at that she's on the Student Council.|$|R
50|$|Her {{method was}} {{to pick a}} {{historic}} character or famous building and weave a story <b>around</b> <b>it,</b> <b>her</b> best selling books were Under Salisbury Spire, Penshurst Castle and Winchester Meads. Of Life's Aftermath, perhaps {{the most popular of}} her novels, thirteen thousand copies have been issued.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Stanwix's wife, {{who was a}} good, motherly person, {{took charge}} of the little orphan, and {{arriving}} at Carvel Hall delivered her to my grandfather, who brought her up as his own daughter. You may be sure the emblem of Catholicism found upon her was destroyed, and she was baptized straightway by Doctor Hilliard, my grandfather's chaplain, into the Established Church. Her clothes were of the finest quality, and her little handkerchief had worked into the corner of it a coronet, with the initials [...] "E de T" [...] beside <b>it.</b> <b>Around</b> <b>her</b> neck was that locket with the gold chain which I have so often shown you, on one side of which is the miniature of the young officer in his most Christian Majesty's uniform, and on the other a yellow-faded slip of paper with these words: [...] "Elle est la mienne, quoiqu'elle ne porte pas mou nom." [...] "She is mine, although she does not bear my name." ...|$|E
60|$|Quest did {{not wait}} for another word. He jumped a rough bush of scrub on the {{right-hand}} side, galloped over the ground, which was already hot with the coming fire, and followed along down the road by which Lenora had passed. When {{he came to the}} first bend, he could hear the roar of flames in the trees. A volume of smoke almost blinded him; his horse became wholly unmanageable. He slipped from the saddle and ran on, staggering from right to left like a drunken man. About forty yards along the road, Lenora was lying in the dust. A volume of smoke rushed over her. The tree under which she had collapsed was already afire. A twig fell from it as Quest staggered up, and her skirt began to smoulder. He tore off his coat, wrapped <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> beat out the fire which was already blazing at her feet, and snatched her into his arms. She opened her eyes for a moment.|$|E
60|$|It {{was soon}} gratified; for, through {{a pair of}} folding doors, which opened {{not far from the}} {{platform}} on which she stood, she was ushered into a large low apartment hung with arras; at the upper end of which, under a species of canopy, was seated the ancient Lady of Baldringham. Fourscore years had not quenched the brightness of her eyes, or bent an inch of her stately height; her gray hair was still so profuse as to form a tier, combined as it was with a chaplet of ivy leaves; her long dark-coloured gown fell in ample folds, and the broidered girdle, which gathered <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> was fastened by a buckle of gold, studded with precious stones, which were worth an Earl's ransom; her features, which had once been beautiful, or rather majestic, bore still, though faded and wrinkled, an air of melancholy and stern grandeur, that assorted well with her garb and deportment. She had a staff of ebony in her hand; at her feet rested a large aged wolf-dog, who pricked his ears and bristled up his neck, as the step of a stranger, a sound so seldom heard in those halls, approached the chair in which his aged mistress sat motionless.|$|E
5000|$|Raven {{appears as}} a main {{character}} in the animated film Justice League vs. Teen Titans, voiced by Taissa Farmiga. She {{is the center of}} the story as <b>it</b> revolves <b>around</b> <b>her</b> father, Trigon, attempting to conquer Earth by possessing the Justice League, using Raven as the portal. At fourteen years old, she bonds with Damian Wayne as they recognize each other as kindred souls. At one point, this version uses the TV series' standard spell incantation ("Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos") to effect her magic. She manages to contain Trigon in a magical crystal, which she now wears on her forehead at all times.|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{hands were}} shaking when I tried to play, because she was {{right there in the}} control room," [...] he says. [...] "There was no way I could do <b>it</b> with <b>her</b> <b>around,</b> so I came back and did it later." ...|$|R
25|$|When Nawab Amir-ul-umra learnt the {{distress}} of her heart, his own overflowed with kindness: he very graciously set her up {{as his own}} mother, giving her the fort of Kumher for her residence and the mahals (palaces) <b>around</b> <b>it</b> for <b>her</b> support.|$|R
