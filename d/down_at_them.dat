5|$|Monodontids {{consist of}} two species: the beluga and the narwhal. They both {{reside in the}} frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their {{coloration}} acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, hunt in large pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly up or <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E
500|$|At 06:45 on August 2, C Company, 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry {{began to}} move out from its {{positions}} on a reconnaissance patrol supported by tanks and armored cars. Before the armored column left the lines, it ran head-on into a North Korean attack starting on the Notch, as mortar fire and three heavy machine guns opened up on it from [...] below {{the crest of the}} pass. The road before the pass erupted into a frantic and confused struggle, C Company in the lead was struck with machine gun fire, killing most of its 1st Platoon before the men could disembark from their trucks. American soldiers who dove for cover in the ditches along the road found North Korean soldiers already in cover there. The lead M4 was struck with mortar fire and destroyed, while anti-tank weapons set at least one American truck on fire. During this fight, advancing North Korean troops captured at least a few of the surprised American soldiers, using them as human shields when advancing up the high ground where the rest of the UN force was firing <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> In the end, the initial ambush cost the Americans about 30 casualties. C Company overcame several North Korean attempts to cut them off before withdrawing back to the American lines.|$|E
6000|$|As from {{a remote}} {{distance}} {{he could hear}} Spider Hagerty saying to him: [...] "No layin' <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the start. <b>Them's</b> instructions. Take a beatin' and earn your dough." ...|$|R
60|$|They turned back, {{following}} the crest until they found an easier but longer way <b>down.</b> Graham glanced <b>at</b> <b>them</b> sharply {{when they reached}} the camp, and guessed the truth, though Andrew tried to smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you like}} your boots, Private Montmorency? Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought from {{the way you were}} bending <b>down</b> and looking <b>at</b> <b>them</b> that perhaps their {{appearance}} was dissatisfying to you. My mistake.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{his voice}} faltered somewhat, {{and he looked}} <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> inquiringly.|$|E
60|$|The boy {{approached}} {{the edge of}} the jetty, and, peering <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> answered for himself.|$|E
60|$|They {{could see}} the lonely watcher {{fingering}} his gun, and peering <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> as if dissatisfied at their reply.|$|E
60|$|He {{brought from}} the {{bookcase}} several books and maps, and placed them on the table. The boys, who {{were sitting on the}} floor near the open fireplace, took <b>them</b> <b>down</b> and gazed <b>at</b> <b>them</b> with interest. Here was something that was surely new and novel.|$|R
60|$|While {{occupied}} with this a shout aroused them. Looking up, {{they saw the}} Ghost dead ahead and {{right on top of}} them, and dragging <b>down</b> upon <b>them</b> <b>at</b> a furious rate.|$|R
60|$|And {{they made}} me sit <b>down</b> <b>at</b> table beside <b>them,</b> poured me out a glass of wine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one after the other, and each with a bow, drank my good health, and their service to me, for my luck and courage.|$|R
60|$|She {{laid the}} extreme {{tips of her}} fingers upon his coat sleeve. He glanced <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> for a moment. Her {{reluctance}} was evident.|$|E
60|$|Sherikov's guards {{streamed}} {{out onto}} the plain. Crouching and running, they advanced toward the stalled cars. The police airships screeched <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> guns thundering.|$|E
60|$|No {{one was in}} the room, but a fine copy of Michael Angelo's Fates hung on the wall, looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> with weird significance.|$|E
60|$|VIVIE [fiercely] No. I hate you. [She takes {{a couple}} of books and some paper from the writing-table, and sits <b>down</b> with <b>them</b> <b>at</b> the middle table, at the end next the fireplace].|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} plenty of spin bowlers around {{for more than a}} hundred years but the four, for me, who have broken the mould and made batsmen think seriously about what was coming <b>down</b> the pitch <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> have been Bernard Bosanquet, Jack Iverson, John Gleeson and Shane Warne. Richie Benaud ...|$|R
60|$|The doctor came. Leonard felt it {{his duty}} to meet him with a cab. The {{examination}} did not take long. Annie, Arthur, Paul, and Leonard were waiting in the parlour anxiously. The doctors came <b>down.</b> Paul glanced <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> He had never had any hope, except when he had deceived himself.|$|R
60|$|As {{they went}} in they looked up, and saw a great many cannons pointed <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> from the embrasures in the {{surrounding}} ramparts and bastions.|$|E
60|$|Bab and Betty {{looked up}} quickly and {{recognized}} the familiar faces {{of their friends}} peering <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> like a choice collection of trophies or targets.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> {{she pulled}} the lace of her sleeves over them, but {{otherwise}} she did not heed him. She was lost in unexpressed imaginings.|$|E
6000|$|... "This aroused my curiosity, so when I {{went out}} for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was {{shuttered}} up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and <b>down,</b> glancing <b>at</b> <b>them</b> occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.|$|R
60|$|The {{papers were}} indeed {{reduced to a}} heap of black cinders, with a {{multitude}} of sparks hurrying confusedly among them, the traces of the pen being now represented by white lines, and the whole mass fluttering to and fro in the draughts of air. The destroyer knelt <b>down</b> to look <b>at</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tony {{maneuvers}} {{the helicopter}} around the yacht allowing Chase to mow <b>down</b> gunmen firing <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> while Jack abseils {{onto the deck}} of the yacht. As the day ends, Tony stays on the yacht with Kate {{to clean up the mess}} while Chase pilots the helicopter with a wounded Jack to a nearby hospital.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} Joan then that {{a band of}} devils {{surrounded}} the stage, all roaring at the huge, bristling demon above, who glared and bellowed <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{breathed a}} little sigh of relief. They {{had reached the}} gate. She still had {{something}} to say. Below them flared the lights of Monte Carlo. She looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> almost wistfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do I ken, your lordship? Looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> {{from the}} Warden's Tower, I could but see them glent by wi' their bridles ringing and their {{feathers}} fluttering, like {{the court of}} Elfland." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{minute or}} two later the elephant, {{catching}} sight of his enemies, quickened his pace, and with his little tail switching angrily, uplifted trunk, and widespread ears, he charged <b>down</b> upon <b>them</b> <b>at</b> a pace of which Dick had not supposed so cumbersome a beast would be capable.|$|R
50|$|At this {{juncture}} of the battle, 2nd Para's advance had become stuck. A Company {{was in the}} gorse line {{at the bottom of}} Darwin Hill, and against the entrenched Argentines who were looking <b>down</b> the hill <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> As it was now daylight, Jones led an unsuccessful charge up a small gully resulting in the death of the adjutant, Captain Wood, A Company's second-in-command Captain Dent, and Corporal Hardman.|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{the apple}} of Eve!" [...] cried the fat knight, [...] "it {{appears to me}} that this wind brings a very savory smell of garlic and of onions from their cooking-kettles. I am in favor of riding <b>down</b> upon <b>them</b> <b>at</b> once, if my old friend and comrade here is of the same mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; I {{have been}} to Miss Lapidoth's, {{to ask her to}} come and sing for us," [...] said Gwendolen, laying her gloves on the little table beside her, and looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Cursed if we do!" [...] growled a {{deep voice}} from above, and glancing upwards the {{officers}} in the cabin were aware {{of a line of}} fierce, bearded, sun-blackened faces looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> through the open skylight.|$|E
60|$|I {{remarked to}} Mr. Pike {{that the men}} seemed thinner and weaker than when they came on board, and he delayed {{replying}} for a moment while he stared <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> with that cattle-buyer's eye of his.|$|E
6000|$|... "From what I {{can make}} out, Mr. Rover, that concern-- Pelter, Japson & Company-- are {{a set of}} swindlers," [...] said he, at last. [...] "If I were you I'd close <b>down</b> on <b>them</b> <b>at</b> once, and with the {{heaviest}} possible hand. To give <b>them</b> any leeway <b>at</b> all might be fatal to your interests." ...|$|R
50|$|The oligarchic forces {{advanced}} up {{the road}} towards {{the top of the}} hill, but before they reached the top the men from Phyle charged <b>down</b> the hill <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> This charge broke the oligarchic line, and the exiles pursued their enemies down the hill onto the level ground. In this rout, seventy men of the Thirty's force were killed. Among the dead was Critias, the leader of the Thirty; several other prominent oligarchic leaders were also killed.|$|R
6000|$|... 1. It was {{sufficient}} to bring Mankind to a Neglect of God, to [...] worship him by halves, and give little or no Regard to his Laws, [...] and so grow loose and immoral, in direct Contradiction to his [...] Commands; this would not go <b>down</b> with <b>them</b> <b>at</b> first, so the Devil [...] went on gradually.|$|R
