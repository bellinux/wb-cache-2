5|$|At {{the end of}} August, 1916, Döblin {{was awarded}} the Fontane Prize (including a {{monetary}} award of 600 Marks) for The Three Leaps of Wang Lun (Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun). Following this recognition, Döblin set himself {{to work on his}} historical novel Wallenstein, set during the Thirty Years' War. Döblin had to interrupt work on the novel in March 1917 because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> typhus, but was able to use the university library at Heidelberg during his convalescence in April and May to continue researching the Thirty Years' War. Back in Saargemünd he came into conflict with his superiors due to the poor treatment of the patients; on 2 August 1917 he was transferred to Hagenau (Haguenau) in Alsace, where the library of nearby Strassbourg helped complete Wallenstein by the beginning of 1919.|$|E

25|$|Fenwick {{was born}} in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1861. His sole match for Canterbury came against Auckland in late March 1892, {{at a time when}} interprovincial matches were {{relatively}} rare (the Plunket Shield not yet having been established). Serving as the team's wicket-keeper, Fenwick came in ninth in Canterbury's first innings, and topscored with 30 not out, featuring in a 44-run ninth-wicket partnership with Robert Barry. In the second innings, he was promoted to open the batting with Frederick Harman, scoring another 17 runs. Earlier, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> two batsmen off the bowling of Herbert de Maus, including Auckland's captain, John Fowke. Auckland {{went on to win the}} match by four wickets.|$|E

Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was any doubt in his mind... the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.|$|E

Separated from his companions, he was robbed and nearly lost his life. Despite this setback, within ten days <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> up with his group and continued on to Khambhat in the Indian state of Gujarat. From there, they sailed to Calicut (now known as Kozhikode), where Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama would land two centuries later. While in Calicut, Battuta was the guest of the ruling Zamorin. While Ibn Battuta visited a mosque on shore, a storm arose and one of the ships of his expedition sank. The other ship then sailed without him only to be seized by a local Sumatran king a few months later.|$|E
25|$|In 1924 {{the club}} {{changed its name}} from Cercle Sportif Brugeois to Royal Cercle Sportif Brugeois. The club {{embarked}} on a successful period, led by two key players: Belgian record international Florimond Vanhalme and player-coach Louis Saeys. Cercle led the league midway through the 1925–26 season, but player injuries led to poor results that saw them finish in fifth place. Several important players left Cercle after this season, leaving hopes low for the 1926–27 campaign, but the year saw Cercle achieve their second national championship on the penultimate matchday with a thrilling 5–6 win over Daring Bruxelles. The victory was overshadowed by two deaths at the club a few months earlier: Albert Van Coile, who had succumbed from injuries sustained in a match against US Tourcoing, and former chairman René de Peellaert, who died from pneumonia which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> during Van Coile's funeral.|$|E

25|$|Narula's Ranji Trophy {{performances}} {{during the}} 1989–90 season secured a maiden Duleep Trophy appearance. Appearing for West Zone against South Zone at Bangalore's M.

Narula again appeared for West Zone the following season, though in the limited-overs Deodhar Trophy {{rather than in the}} Duleep Trophy. He began the tournament with 3/37 from nine overs in the quarter-final against Central Zone, took another wicket in the semi-final against North Zone, and then finished with 3/57 in the final against East Zone, including the final wicket of the match to secure West Zone's victory. His most notable wicket in the final was that of future India captain Sourav Ganguly, who <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> for 125, while his West Zone teammates had included Ravi Shastri, Sanjay Manjrekar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Sachin Tendulkar, and Vinod Kambli.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than two}} months after the {{disastrous}} result at the Flinders by-election, Hayden announced his resignation as Leader of the Labor Party to the caucus on 3 February 1983. Hawke was subsequently named as leader—and hence became Leader of the Opposition—pending a party-room ballot at which he was elected unopposed. By a remarkable coincidence, {{on the same day that}} Hawke became Leader, Fraser called a snap election for 5 March 1983, hoping to capitalise on Labor's feuding before it could replace Hayden with Hawke. Fraser initially believed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> Labor out, thinking that they would be forced to fight the election with Hayden as Leader. However, he was surprised to find out upon his return from seeing the Governor-General that Hayden had already resigned that morning, just hours before the writs were issued. In the election held a month later, Hawke led Labor to a landslide election victory, achieving a 24-seat swing—still the worst defeat that a sitting non-Labor Government has ever suffered—and ending seven years of Liberal Party rule.|$|E
25|$|Transylvania {{united with}} Romania on December 1, 1918, but Pușcariu {{was unable to}} attend the festivities at Alba Iulia, being sick {{in bed with a}} case of {{influenza}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> at Iași. Following this event, which marked the culmination of Greater Romania's creation, he was named the first rector of the Superior Dacia University in Cluj. A Franz Joseph University already existed in the city, but its Hungarian faculty departed as a bloc and an entirely new professorial corps and administrative structure were required. The revamped university had two founders, the idealistic Ghibu and the more practical Pușcariu. Chosen by the Directing Council, Transylvania's provisional government, the latter headed a twenty-man committee charged with the seemingly insurmountable task of setting up four faculties (Literature and Philosophy, Medicine, Science, Law) and recruiting professors within a few months. As a native Transylvanian, Pușcariu was familiar with the Austro-Hungarian milieu; he also had relations with academics in Western Europe and was close to a number of figures in the Old Kingdom, especially Nicolae Iorga. Set up in July 1919, the committee included twelve professors from the Universities of Iași and Bucharest, and eight Transylvanians.|$|E

25|$|According to Polybius (bold {{emphasis}} added) Just at this time, Gaius Atilius, {{the other}} Consul, had reached Pisa from Sardinia with his legions {{and was on}} his way to Rome, marching in the opposite direction to the enemy. When the Celts were near Telamon in Etruria, their advanced foragers encountered the advance guard of Gaius and were made prisoners. On being examined by the Consul they narrated all that had recently occurred and told him of the presence of the two armies, stating that the Gauls were quite near and Lucius behind them. The news surprised him but at the same time made him very hopeful, as he thought <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> the Gauls on the march between the two armies. He ordered his Tribunes to put the legions in fighting order and to advance thus at marching pace in so far as the nature of the ground allowed the attack in line. He himself had happily noticed a hill situated above the road by which the Celts must pass, and taking his cavalry with him, advanced at full speed, being anxious to occupy the crest of the hill before their arrival and be the first to begin the battle, feeling certain that thus he would get the largest share of credit for the result.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Australia made a six-match tour of New Zealand {{under the}} {{coaching}} of Terry Fearnley who {{prior to the}} tour had coached NSW to its first ever Origin series win over Qld (the tour actually took place between games 2 and 3 of the Origin series). The Kangaroos won five of those matches, and the Test series 2–1. Australia won the first Test in Brisbane 26–20. On Sunday 30 June 1985, Australia met New Zealand in the second Test at Carlaw Park, Auckland. The Test was a 20,000 sell-out, with all tickets accounted for weeks before the match. The Kiwis dominated long periods of the game but ninety seconds from time the Kiwis lost possession close to half way. John Ribot scored a try and Australia won 10–6. The tour ended in acrimony as tensions between coach Fearley and the Qld players, led by team captain Wally Lewis, reached boiling point with Lewis publicly stating that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> Fearnley and team vice-captain Wayne Pearce going over team selections in Fearnley's hotel room, though both Fearnley and Pearce denied the allegations. After the second test win Fearnley made 4 changes to the test team for {{the third and final}} test at Carlaw Park with all four players who were omitted being Queenslanders. The changes proved disastrous and NZ ran out easy 18–0 winners.|$|E
25|$|News {{that the}} AAFC would be disbanded after the 1949 season {{dampened}} {{attendance at the}} championship game, which Cleveland won 21–7. The Browns scored their first touchdown early {{in the first quarter}} on a short rush by Edgar Jones. Cleveland's offense sputtered in the second quarter, however, never advancing beyond their own 38-yard line, and the score remained 7–0 at halftime. A 68-yard rush by Motley for a touchdown gave the Browns a 14–0 lead in the third quarter despite slippery conditions that limited passing and made running difficult. The 49ers came back in the fourth quarter with a 73-yard touchdown drive that ended with throw by Albert to Paul Salata for the score. Cleveland then scored again after the next kickoff, however, an 11-play drive capped by a Dub Jones touchdown with six minutes left {{that turned out to be}} the last in the AAFC's four-season history. Cleveland's defense had a strong game, limiting the 49ers to just 122 rushing yards and 108 passing yards. Warren Lahr batted down a pass from Albert to Salata in the third quarter that would have been a touchdown if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> it. Graham threw for 128 yards in the game and rushed for 62 yards. The win gave the Browns the AAFC championship for the fourth time in the league's four years of existence.|$|E
