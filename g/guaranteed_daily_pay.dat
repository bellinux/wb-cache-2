50|$|It is {{not always}} clear whether an {{employer}} should <b>pay</b> Relevant <b>Daily</b> <b>Pay</b> or Average <b>Daily</b> <b>Pay</b> when an employee takes sick leave. The decision can make a major difference to an employee's pay. In 2012 New Zealand Post {{was found to have}} incorrectly paid employees Relevant <b>Daily</b> <b>Pay</b> based on their staff's rostered hours, rather than Average <b>Daily</b> <b>Pay,</b> which also takes into account occasional unrostered overtime that an employee might have worked, had they not been absent. This resulted in NZ Post making back payments to staff of nearly $12 million.|$|R

50|$|On May 19, 1954, {{during the}} wheat harvest, Catarina and {{thirteen}} other harvest-women complained with the {{supervisor of the}} property where they were, trying to obtain a two escudo increase in their <b>daily</b> <b>pay.</b> The fourteen women frightened the supervisor {{enough for him to}} go to Beja to call the owner and the police.|$|R
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of April, most of the Scandinavian prisoners in Germany had been gathered in Neuengamme. The mission dragged out; Colonel Björck returned to Sweden and a new commander for the column was appointed, Major Sven Frykman. Some of the personnel also left, but after a promise of double <b>daily</b> <b>pay,</b> around 130 men, half of the force, stayed.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} confer to the pellets high {{resistance}} metallurgic mechanics and appropriate characteristics, the pellets {{are subjected to}} thermal processing, which involves stages of drying, <b>daily</b> <b>pay</b> burn, burn, after-burn and cooling (in a cooling tower).

5000|$|A [...] "Soldier's catechism" [...] set out new {{regulations}} and drill procedures. The standard <b>daily</b> <b>pay</b> was 8 pence for infantry and 2 shillings for cavalry. The {{administration of the}} Army was more centralised, with improved provision of adequate food, clothing and other supplies. Cavalrymen (often recruited from among yeomen or the more well-to-do farmers) had to supply their own horses.|$|R

50|$|Rates of pay were in {{accordance}} with those of the British Marines, including routine provision of a subsistence allowance equivalent to two-thirds of <b>daily</b> <b>pay.</b> British Marines received the allowance when in the field (i.e., not serving on board a vessel); the NSW Marines received the allowance for the duration of their three-year enlistment, relieving the Admiralty or the government of the colony of the responsibility of providing messing facilities.|$|R
500|$|The tenants of the Tyldesley, Shakerley and Chaddock lands were summoned for {{military}} service. Archers from Chaddock fought at Crécy in 1346 {{and at the}} Battle of Agincourt in 1415. In 1360, William Chaddock was described as an archer on foot, [...] "potens de corpore et bonis". A muster roll described Hugh Tyldesley as an archer on horseback and Hugh Chaddock and Richard Tyldesley were foot-archers drawing <b>daily</b> <b>pay</b> for service from 22July to 21October 1391.|$|R
500|$|The {{man-made}} Huntspill River {{was constructed}} during World War II with sluices {{at both ends}} to provide a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>daily</b> supply of [...] of [...] "process water". It was intended that in the summer, when water supply was lower, it {{would serve as a}} reservoir with water pumped from the moors; and in winter serve as a drainage channel, via gravity drainage. Geotechnical problems prevented it from being dug as deep as originally intended and so gravity-drainage of the moors was not possible: thus, water is pumped up into the river throughout the year.|$|R

50|$|Beer {{money is}} the {{nickname}} for an allowance, established in the year 1800, {{that was given to}} non-commissioned officers and soldiers in the British Army. The practice was started at the suggestion of the Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Beer money payments were 1 penny per day and was a replacement for a daily issuance of beer or spirits while troops were on home service. The allowance continued until 1873 when it was rolled into the soldier's <b>daily</b> <b>pay.</b>|$|R
50|$|Natick Center {{station is}} {{primarily}} used by those walking from nearby neighborhoods.

All inbound trains except for a handful of express trains stop at both stations, as well as most outbound non-express trains.|$|R

Geotechnical problems prevented it from being dug as deep as originally intended and so gravity-drainage of the moors was not possible: thus, water is pumped up into the river throughout the year.|$|R
50|$|However the Act can {{be unfair}} in several circumstances. A common example is where an employee, having worked a five-day week, is also paid {{to be on}} standby during the weekend. In this case their Average <b>Daily</b> <b>Pay</b> will be {{significantly}} lower than if the employee was not paid to be on standby. This is because the standby allowance is typically small (a small increase in the numerator), {{but the number of}} workdays increases significantly as a result of weekends being included (a large increase in the denominator).|$|R

He introduced reforms to state employment laws, abolishing the <b>daily</b> <b>pay</b> and contract systems and introducing paid maternity leave for nursing mothers.|$|R
50|$|Within days McDonnell was {{relieved}} of his command and McLean, as Native Minister, announced that from 11 February 1870 Māori would control all the expeditions, with no European involvement. There {{would be no}} <b>daily</b> <b>pay</b> for soldiers, instead they would compete for ₤5000 reward offered for Te Kooti's capture. The pursuit was instead led by both Te Keepa with his Whanganui warriors, and Ropata and his Ngati Porou, with two companies of Arawa Armed Constabulary, picked from the tribes at Rotorua, Rotoiti, Tarawera, Matata and Maketu, also joining the fight.|$|R

In 2016 it is now 45 peso to the US$ and yet the {{standard}} wage in DR remains about 500 peso per day. So in 15 years the US value of Dominican Peso has gone from $1 = 20 peso to 45 peso.

2500|$|Ford {{astonished}} {{the world}} in 1914 by offering a $5 per day wage ($ today), which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers. A Cleveland, Ohio, newspaper editorialized that the announcement [...] "shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression." [...] The move proved extremely profitable; instead of constant turnover of employees, the best mechanics in Detroit flocked to Ford, bringing their human capital and expertise, raising productivity, and lowering training costs. Ford announced his $5-per-day program on January 5, 1914, raising the minimum <b>daily</b> <b>pay</b> from $2.34 to $5 for qualifying male workers.|$|R
50|$|The Act also {{rectified}} employers underpaying {{employees for}} sick days and holidays, particularly in jobs where {{part of the}} employee’s pay was bonus or performance pay. For instance, if an employee got paid $100 a day, plus $200 a day bonus, the employer could have paid the employee $100 for a sick day, and not $300 {{as they would have}} expected of earned for that day. The Act now requires an employee to be paid what they would have expected to earn had they worked that day. Typically, this is calculated to the person’s average <b>daily</b> <b>pay</b> for the last 12 months.|$|R

50|$|For officers, the fencible, {{like the}} militia regiments, {{presented}} both advantages and disadvantages.

50|$|In {{the final}} quarter of 19th century, the Great Western Railway (GWR) had {{undertaken}} the engineering feat of constructing the Severn Tunnel under the River Severn. One of the major difficulties encountered underground was the 'Great Spring', which necessitated the pumping of over 9 million gallons (41,000 m³) of water per day, at Sudbrook, from {{the western end of}} the tunnel, conveniently located only three miles (5 km) away from the proposed site at Caerwent. Even during the great drought of 1934 the lowest daily return was 9.1 million imperial gallons (41,000 m³). The GWR used about 1.5 million imperial gallons (6,800 m³) per day themselves, so there was always a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>daily</b> surplus of 7.5 million imperial gallons (34,000 m³).|$|R
