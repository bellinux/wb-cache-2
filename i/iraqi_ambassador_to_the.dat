Due to the speedy processing time of his immigration documents, {{as well as his}} high-profile political association, his arrival was picked up by the media a week later after his arrival. The government issued a statement that Al-Mashat's quick admittance into Canada had been done so through an administrative error and without the involvement of any Ministers (although his security clearance from the Canadian Security Intelligence Services was granted in only a day, which was highly unusual). An internal investigation named the Department of External Affairs at fault, under the purview of Minister Joe Clark. In a move that ran contrary to ministerial responsibility, two public servants were named as the men at fault, Mr. Raymond Chretien and Mr. David Daubney. Clark denied any knowledge of Al-Mashat's arrival in Canada until it had been picked up by the media, while also regretting Al-Mashat's admission. Accusations that Clark had been shielded from his ministerial responsibility due to his political standing arose in the public service, which not only soured relations between public servants and their ministers but also did little to reinforce the tenants of PS2000 that public servants should be encouraged to work autonomously while those involved in the Al-Mashat affair were publicly shamed.|$|E
