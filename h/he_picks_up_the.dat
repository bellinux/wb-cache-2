5|$|One morning, after Tod's {{escape from}} the greyhounds, the Master sends Copper on the hunt. After <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fox's trail, Copper relentlessly pursues him {{throughout}} the day and into the next morning. Tod finally drops dead of exhaustion, and Copper collapses on top of him, close to death himself. The Master nurses Copper back to health, and both enjoy their new popularity, {{but after a few}} months the excitement over Copper's accomplishment dies down. The Master is left alone again, and returns to drinking. He is once again asked to consider living in a nursing home, and this time he agrees. Crying, he takes his shotgun from the wall, leads Copper outside, and pets him gently before ordering him to lie down. He covers the dog's eyes as Copper licks his hand trustingly.|$|E
5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E
500|$|His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts {{the books}} he {{looks forward to}} reading for years to come. Just as he bends {{down to pick up}} the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> broken remains of the glasses he is {{virtually}} blind without, and says, [...] "That's not fair. That's not fair at all. There was time now. There was—was all the time I needed…! It's not fair! [...] It's not fair!" [...] and bursts into tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Goodbye Stranger", Castiel {{has been}} {{completely}} brainwashed by Naomi and has killed thousands of copies of Dean ruthlessly. Castiel is sent to find the angel tablet and tortures and kills the demons also looking for it, drawing Sam and Dean's attention. Sam and Dean track down someone who knows the location of one of Lucifer's Crypts where the angel tablet is and in ensuing scuffle, Sam ends up in trouble. Castiel saves Sam and captures one of the demons, claiming under Naomi's orders that he is searching {{for the second half}} of the demon tablet and that the demons are searching for a parchment that will allow them to translate it without a Prophet. Castiel tortures the demon who tells them where to find Meg, but kills her before she can reveal the truth to Sam and Dean. Castiel heads off alone and rescues Meg who explains what the demons really want. While Naomi initially wants her killed to prevent that, Castiel is able to make a case to keep her alive. The group then go to the warehouse where the crypt is and before heading inside with Dean, Castiel reveals that Sam is damaged by his trials on a level that even Castiel can't fix. Castiel and Dean locate the angel tablet and Castiel has to have Dean get it as it is warded against angels. However, Naomi orders Castiel to kill Dean and though he fights it, he has no control over his actions. As he is about to kill him, Dean manages to break through to Castiel's heart and he breaks free of Naomi's influence. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> angel tablet which completely severs Naomi's connection to and control over him. Castiel heals Dean and explains what happened, but senses that he must now protect the tablet from everyone, even Dean. Castiel is later seen traveling on a bus to an unknown destination with the tablet. Despite losing the tablet, Naomi is somewhat satisfied as according to her, Castiel is doing what he is supposed to be doing. Naomi later comes to Dean. [...] In an attempt to gain his trust, presumably because she knows Castiel is one of his weak spots, she lies to Dean about Castiel and claims that he misinterpreted everything she has done and is still insane. Dean, of course, doesn't believe her. Despite this, Castiel is eventually captured by Naomi's forces, but the angel tablet is claimed by Crowley after one of Naomi's angels betrays their location, although this gives Castiel time to escape and reunite with the Winchesters after killing the angel guarding him.|$|E

[...] Having checked on her sleep, he doesn't want to disturb it, so plunges into the reading of his newspapers, which, after filling him with horror, end up by putting him to sleep, too. [...] A dream arrives. [...] Pierrot, now a sleepwalker, gets up, seizes the carafe in which his hallucinated gaze sees some excellent Tokay, and drinks bumper after bumper. [...] A little tipsy, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> doll, believing it to be his daughter; he rocks it {{to put it back}} to sleep, smooths its little face and hair, and, growing annoyed over his exertions in undressing it for bed, he throws it on the floor.|$|E

6000|$|CAESAR. I do {{not make}} human sacrifices to my honor, as your Druids do. Since you will not burn these, at least I can drown them. (<b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bag and throws it over the parapet into the sea.) ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE (grinning, and {{not quite}} at ease). You might imagine I was embarking in the gent's {{furnishing}} business, {{instead of going to}} war. (<b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> life-preserving suit.) Some friend of mother's told her about this, and she insisted upon sending for it. I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I can't take it, of course.|$|E

60|$|The gentleman laughs him to scorn. Ah, heigh! and, coming forward, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{article and}} reviles it. Out of the mode, old, fragile, ugly of its kind.

But if the gentleman will give even so much (still something preposterous), he may have it, though truly its sale for that money is utter ruin.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I hear {{a couple}} of yells and see two men running up the street in leather {{overalls}} and high-heeled boots and cartwheel hats. One man is six or eight feet high, with open-plumbed joints and a heartbroken cast of countenance. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> watch that has stuck in the mud. The other man, who is little, with pink hair and white eyes, goes for the empty case, and says, 'I win.' Then the elevated pessimist goes down under his leather leg-holsters and hands a handful of twenty- dollar gold pieces to his albino friend. I don't {{know how much money}} it was; it looked as big as an earthquake-relief fund to me.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, Thrasymedes, having lent his shield to Diomede, {{has none}} of his own. Naturally, as he was to pass the night under arms, he would send to his father's {{quarters}} for the old man's shield, a sword, and a helmet. He would remain at his post (his men had provisions) till the general reveillez at dawn, and would then breakfast at his post {{and go into the}} fray. Nestor, therefore, missing his shield, would send round to Diomede's quarters for the shield of Thrasymedes, which had been lent overnight to Diomede, would take it into the fight, and would bring it back to his own hut when he carried the wounded Machaon thither out of the battle. When he arms to go out and seek for information, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> shield of Thrasymedes.|$|E

6000|$|Among princes and popes it is {{pleasant}} to meet one man of letters, and he {{the greatest of}} the great age, who was a bibliophile. The enemies and rivals of Moliere--De Vise, De Villiers, and the rest-- are always reproaching him--with his love of bouquins. There is some difference of opinion among philologists about the derivation of bouquin, but all book-hunters {{know the meaning of}} the word. The bouquin is the [...] "small, rare volume, black with tarnished gold," [...] which lies among the wares of the stall-keeper, patient in rain and dust, till the hunter comes who can appreciate the quarry. We like to think of Moliere lounging through the narrow streets in the evening, returning, perhaps, from some noble house where he has been reading the proscribed 'Tartuffe,' or giving an imitation of the rival actors at the Hotel Bourgogne. Absent as the contemplateur is, a dingy book-stall wakens him from his reverie. His lace ruffles are soiled in a moment with the learned dust of ancient volumes. Perhaps <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> only work out of all his library that is known to exist,--un ravissant petit Elzevir, 'De Imperio Magni Mogolis' (Lugd. Bat. 1651). On the title-page of this tiny volume, one of the minute series of 'Republics' which the Elzevirs published, the poet has written his rare signature, [...] "J. B. P. Moliere," [...] with the price the book cost him, [...] "1 livre, 10 sols." [...] "Il n'est pas de bouquin qui s'echappe de ses mains," [...] says the author of 'La Guerre Comique,' the last of the pamphlets which flew about during the great literary quarrel about [...] "L'Ecole des Femmes." [...] Thanks to M. Soulie the catalogue of Moliere's library has been found, though the books themselves have passed out of view. There are about three hundred and fifty volumes in the inventory, but Moliere's widow may have omitted as valueless (it is the foible of her sex) many rusty bouquins, now worth far more than their weight in gold. Moliere owned no fewer than two hundred and forty volumes of French and Italian comedies. From these he took what suited him wherever he found it. He had plenty of classics, histories, philosophic treatises, the essays of Montaigne, a Plutarch, and a Bible.|$|E
