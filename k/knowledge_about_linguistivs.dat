40|$|The {{theme of}} this article is how we as social {{scientists}} can research others through involvement, and develop true <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> the other without “othering” them, that is, not objectifying them or making them an instrument in our research, but rather be respectful of the other as a person. The thesis {{of this article is}} that othering is a matter of degree as well as principles. Social science and Action research can do respectful othering. Doing that is both a matter of personal skill and the wisdom of the researcher and of complying with some design principles. I argue that these design principles can be related to four areas of knowledge that we are likely to find in an involved research situation: <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> oneself, <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> the other, <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> the relation and <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> the situation.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} elderly patients' <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> and attitudes towards their medicines in Swedish primary care. METHODS: Thirty-four patients aged 65 years and above with multiple illnesses were included. Medication knowledge was assessed with a questionnaire measuring <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> indication and possible adverse effects for each medicine. Attitudes were investigated with the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire. RESULTS: The indication of at least 75 % of their medicines was known to 71 % of the patients. Patients with polypharmacy and multi-dose drug distribution respectively had significantly less knowledge. Eighty-four percent had no <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> possible adverse effects. For 93 % of the patients, the benefits of the medication outweighed the costs (concerns). No correlation was found between attitudes and knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> indication was higher than previously seen, but the <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> possible adverse effects was poor.
