5|$|The hero's {{story begins}} with a {{flashback}} dream {{of the death of}} his parents {{at the hands of the}} Dark Lord, the ruler of the nation of Granz. Upon waking, the hero, a gladiator-slave in Granz, attempts to escape before being confronted by the Dark Lord and thrown off of a bridge. After being <b>fished</b> <b>out</b> of a lake, the hero is advised to head to the city of Topple. The heroine's story also {{begins with a}} flashback dream of the Dark Lord and his assistant, Julius, killing her stepmother and destroying her village. Upon awaking, she is advised by the knight Bogard to head to Topple, while he journeys to the city of Wendell. The hero and heroine meet in Topple, and agree to journey together. They head toward Wendell, and along the way discover that women of the Mana tribe, which the heroine belongs to, are being kidnapped by vampires. The heroine is kidnapped, and is rescued by the hero and an unnamed man; they discover that the kidnappings are to keep the woman safe from the Dark Lord and Julius, who are killing them all in part because the tribe was unable to save the Dark Lord's mother from a terrible fate.|$|E
5|$|Ash soon {{comes to}} realize that the Pikachu refuses to go inside his Poké Ball and prefers his independence. As Ash carries the {{reluctant}} Pikachu, he hopes that they can be friends, but Pikachu acts aloof and openly shows his distrust of Ash. Just then, the two stumble upon a Pidgey in the wild and Ash unsuccessfully tries to catch it by throwing a Poké Ball. Ash uses his Pokédex and finds out that in order to catch a Pokémon, a trainer must first use their Pokémon to battle it, thereby weakening it, to be caught by a Poké Ball. With Pikachu being uncooperative, Ash tries to fight the Pidgey himself, but is easily beaten, which greatly amuses Pikachu. The Pidgey escapes and Ash finds a Rattata rummaging through his pack. He chases the Pokémon off as he hears cooing behind him. He turns to see several Pidgey gathered in the tall grass. Frustrated, Ash throws a rock at what he believes is the Pidgey. However, {{it turns out to be}} a Spearow, which starts attacking Pikachu and Ash. Pikachu shocks Spearow, and in the process alerts a whole flock. The angered Spearow flock gives chase and eventually catches up and attacks Pikachu. Ash quickly grabs Pikachu and dives down a waterfall in order to escape from the flock of Spearow, and the two are <b>fished</b> <b>out</b> down river by a young girl named Misty, who tells Ash to take the injured Pikachu to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City. Seeing the Spearow flock approaching, Ash escapes with Pikachu taking Misty's bike.|$|E

25|$|The Clearwater River {{was famous}} for its fabulous fishing {{starting}} in the 1940s. The McDiarmid family built four fishing camps along the east bank between Grouse Creek and the Mahood River. In 1950, they started construction of Trophies Lodge, named for the fish, as headquarters for this operation. During the 1950s and 1960s, they hosted many anglers who came {{from around the world}} to experience the Clearwater. The guestbook for Trophies Lodge contains distinguished names such as Vanderbilts, DuPonts, H.R. MacMillan (who came twice a year), and even semi-royalty in the person of Wallis Simpson. According to Mac McDiarmid, the proprietor, fish up to four pounds were always thrown back. After the Clearwater River Road was built along the west bank, the river became easily accessible and was quickly <b>fished</b> <b>out.</b> The McDiarmids closed Trophies Lodge and their fishing camps in 1970.|$|E
25|$|Intensive {{exploitation}} of lake resources and habitat destruction resulted in marked decrease in fish production so that commercial operations were halted and recreational fishing is presently limited {{to catch and}} release. Years of construction activity on the lake's limited watershed resulted in lowered water levels. Heavy metals (aluminium, chromium, arsenic, and copper) dissolved in the water {{as a result of}} coal burning were deemed to be at acceptable levels, but metals in sediment and mercury in larger pike were found to be excessive. TransAlta responded with measures to reduce metal and thermal pollution, and the Wabamun power plant was decommissioned and torn down. As a result of the Canadian National Railway oil spill, fish from the lake are not recommended for consumption. Walleye have not been seen in the lake since the early 1900s when they were <b>fished</b> <b>out.</b> Several attempts to restock walleye in the lake failed because the Wabamun power plant (built in the 1950s) discharged its heated cooling water into the lake, keeping that portion of the lake clear of ice. Walleye would spawn in the warm water weeks prior to their normal spawning time and the hatchlings did not survive when they could not find enough food in the still-cold portions of the lake. After closure of the Wabamun power plant in 2010, Alberta Fish and Wildlife attempted another stocking of walleye, and this one appears to have been successful. Walleye are reproducing and so are their young. TransAlta no longer uses the lake for any of its operations.|$|E

Maxentius' body was <b>fished</b> <b>out</b> of the Tiber and decapitated. His head was paraded through the streets for all to see. After the ceremonies, Maxentius' disembodied head was sent to Carthage; at this, Carthage would offer no further resistance. Unlike his predecessors, Constantine {{neglected}} {{to make the trip}} to the Capitoline Hill and perform customary sacrifices at the Temple of Jupiter. He did, however, choose to honor the Senatorial Curia with a visit, where he promised to restore its ancestral privileges and give it a secure role in his reformed government: there would be no revenge against Maxentius' supporters. In response, the Senate decreed him [...] "title of the first name", which meant his name would be listed first in all official documents, and acclaimed him as [...] "the greatest Augustus". He issued decrees returning property lost under Maxentius, recalling political exiles, and releasing Maxentius' imprisoned opponents.|$|E
500|$|One {{significant}} {{achievement for}} the resistance in Visayas was {{the capture of}} the [...] "Koga Papers" [...] by Cebuano guerrillas led by Lt. Col. James M. Cushing in March 1944. Named after Admiral Mineichi Koga, these papers contained vital battle plans and defensive strategies of the Japanese Navy codenamed the [...] "Z Plan", information on the overall strength of the Japanese fleet and naval air units, and most importantly that the Japanese have already deduced MacArthur's initial plans to invade the Philippines through Mindanao. These papers came into the possession of the Filipino guerrillas when the seaplane of Admiral Koga, which was en route to Davao, crashed into the coast San Fernando, Cebu, killing Koga and many others. After Koga's body and many surviving Japanese were washed ashore, the guerrillas found them and captured 12 high-ranking officers including Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukodome. The papers were inside a briefcase which was <b>fished</b> <b>out</b> of the sea by Cebuano fishermen before being handed down to the guerrillas. The Japanese ruthlessly hunted down the documents and their captured officers; burning villages and detaining civilians in their search. The guerrillas were ultimately forced to release their captives {{in order to stop}} the aggression, but unknown to the Japanese Cushing managed to request for a submarine to take the documents to Allied headquarters in Australia. The discovery of the papers allowed MacArthur to move his invasion from Mindanao to Leyte and also aided the Allies in the Battle of the Philippine Sea.|$|E

2500|$|Gosnell's {{license to}} {{practice}} was suspended on 22 February 2010, and these and other findings were presented to a Grand Jury on 4 May 2010. Public discussion focused on claims of unsanitary conditions and other unacceptable conditions at the practices. Media reports stated that furniture and blankets were stained with blood, freely roaming cats deposited their feces wherever they pleased, and that non-sterilized equipment was used and reused on patients. According {{to the grand jury}} report, patients were given labor-inducing drugs by staff who had no medical training. Once labor began, the patient would be placed on a toilet. After the fetus fell into the toilet, it would be <b>fished</b> <b>out,</b> so as not to clog the plumbing.

2500|$|Constantine entered Rome on 29 October. He {{staged a}} grand arrival {{ceremony}} {{in the city}} (adventus), and was met with popular jubilation.

After the ceremonies, Maxentius' head was sent to Carthage as proof of his downfall, Africa then offered no further resistance. The battle gave Constantine undisputed control of the western half of the Roman Empire. The descriptions of Constantine's entry into Rome omit mention of him ending his procession at the temple of Capitoline Jupiter, where sacrifice was usually offered. Though often employed to show Constantine's Christian sensibilities, this silence cannot be taken as proof that Constantine was a Christian at this point. He chose to honour the Senatorial Curia with a visit, where he promised to restore its ancestral privileges {{and give it a}} secure role in his reformed government: there would be no revenge against Maxentius' supporters. Maxentius was condemned to damnatio memoriae, [...] all his legislation was invalidated and Constantine usurped all of Maxentius' considerable building projects within Rome, including the Temple of Romulus and the Basilica of Maxentius. Maxentius' strongest supporters in the military were neutralized when the Praetorian Guard and Imperial Horse Guard (equites singulares) were disbanded. Constantine is thought to have replaced the former imperial guards with a number of cavalry units termed the Scholae Palatinae.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Freeze {{appears in}} The Batman, voiced by Clancy Brown. Unlike most {{versions}} of the character, this iteration is a bank robber that fires ice blasts directly out of his hands. After a successful diamond heist, Victor Fries is pursued by the vigilante Batman into a cryogenic lab. Victor is presumed dead after being accidentally locked in cryogenic chamber and electrocuted. When Victor awakens, he discovers his new cryokinetic abilities and forces a scientist to create a cryogenic suit to contain his condition.
