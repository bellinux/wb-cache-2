50|$|The {{meteor shower}} of the Pegasids occurs between the 7 and 13 July. It is a weak meteor shower {{that has its}} maximum around July 9 having a ZHR of only 3 meteors per hour. The meteors have, however, an {{atmosphere}} <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> of about 70 km/s.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 season FIA {{approved}} {{track configuration}} changes. Turn 10 chicane, known as 'Singapore Sling' was removed {{and replaced with}} a single-apex left-hand bend. Corner <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> is about 40 km/h faster. To compensate for the increase in speed, an extra layer of TecPro barriers lines {{the end of the}} Turn 10 run-off as an added safety measure.|$|E
5000|$|Traffic speed: High <b>entry</b> <b>speeds</b> (over 30 mph) require {{circulating}} {{vehicles to}} yield, often stopping, which lowers capacity and increases crash rates compared to modern roundabouts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The H 4 {{technique}} facilitates {{text entry}} with key sequences created using Huffman coding. This study evaluates {{the use of}} touch and motion-sensing gestures for H 4 input. Touch input yielded better <b>entry</b> <b>speeds</b> (6. 6 wpm, versus 5. 3 wpm with motion-sensing) and more favourable participant feedback. Accuracy metrics {{did not differ significantly}} between the two conditions. Changes to the H 4 technique are proposed and the associated benefits and drawbacks are presented...|$|R
50|$|Following the 2011 race, several drivers {{offered the}} opinion that the {{temporary}} chicane on the main straight was unnecessary, and it was subsequently removed ahead of the 2012 race so as to increase <b>entry</b> <b>speeds</b> into the first corner. However, during the first practice sessions for the 2012 race, several drivers — including Simon Pagenaud and Oriol Servià — became airborne as they crossed the train tracks. IndyCar officials abandoned the practice session and reinstalled the temporary chicane.|$|R
50|$|A {{standard}} of spreadsheets since the 1980s, this optional feature {{eliminates the need}} to manually request the spreadsheet program to recalculate values (nowadays typically the default option unless specifically 'switched off' for large spreadsheets, usually to improve performance). Some earlier spreadsheets required a manual request to recalculate, since recalculation of large or complex spreadsheets often reduced data <b>entry</b> <b>speed.</b> Many modern spreadsheets still retain this option.|$|E
50|$|In {{a broader}} scope, {{trailing}} off the braking pressure either while straight line braking or, as above, after turn in has begun, {{allows for a}} less abrupt and more accurate final corner <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> adjustment. Some corner entries, such as decreasing radius turns, are more adapted to the leaned over trail braking technique. In turns where a quicker steering action is more applicable, trailing the brake while turning in is unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|The infield {{section was}} still used for {{motorcycle}} racing {{at the track}} until about 2000 as the high speed esses (turns 6-9) {{at the end of}} the back straight were deemed too dangerous for the bikes at high speed (the <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> off the straight was close to 200 km/h (124 mph)) with very little runoff area between the track and the outside fence. Using the infield section not only bypassed the esses but slowed the bikes down and allowed them to continue using the circuit for the series such as the Australian Superbike Championship.|$|E
50|$|The {{layout of}} the impact area {{suggests}} that the body fell at a shallow angle, and was moving at typical meteorite <b>entry</b> <b>speeds</b> of 40,000 to 60,000 km/h. Its total mass was more than 3,500 tonnes. The shallow angle presented the body with more air resistance {{than it would have}} encountered at a steeper angle, and it broke up in the air into at least four pieces before impact. The biggest piece struck with an explosion roughly equivalent to the atom bomb that levelled Hiroshima.|$|R
5000|$|Opera 9.20 {{introduced}} [...] "Speed Dial Browsing". The {{blank page}} {{when a new}} tab is opened is replaced with a page with slots which the user can set to contain webpage bookmarks. This feature {{is based on the}} speed dial browsing previously introduced in Opera Mini. New versions of Opera's Speed Dial improved the feature by allowing an unlimited number of <b>speed</b> dial <b>entries,</b> <b>Speed</b> Dial extensions, introducing groups, real-time search of entries, added support to user-defined backgrounds and different resolution display layouts (e.g. widescreen).|$|R
50|$|All 24 {{competitors}} {{were born}} in the United States of America and were male. Buck Baker and Tiny Lund failed to collect any winnings from this race. This race was dominated by Chevrolet and Ford <b>entries.</b> <b>Speeds</b> for the racing weekend reached 72.202 mph in qualifying (achieved by Tom Pistone) and 65.747 mph during the actual race. The speeds were equalized by the dirt surface; which slowed down the stock cars during the 1950s and 1960s but brought exciting racing for those who were not quite ready for the blistering fast pace of asphalt racing.|$|R
50|$|The meteor {{originated}} from {{the asteroid belt}} between Mars and Jupiter as determined by its <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> of 19 kilometres/second. The Chelyabinsk meteor was probably a fragmented asteroid. The meteor had veins of black material which had experienced high-pressure shock and was partly melted, due to a previous collision. The metamorphism in the chondrules in the meteorite samples indicates the meteor had been several kilometres {{below the surface of}} an LL-chondrite and had a history of collisions. The meteor was probably in a gravitational resonance in the asteroid belt which increased the eccentricity of the orbit until the meteor collided into the Earth.|$|E
50|$|Racing was {{continued}} {{with a flat}} north turn, but AVUS only held national touring cars DTM and Formula 3 events. The length of the track was roughly cut in half twice in the 1980s and 1990 as racing on straights became unpopular. Also, chicanes were added to reduce <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> into the North Curve. Yet, some incidents and accidents occurred. The BMW of Dieter Quester rolled over when exiting the last corner, and crossed the finish line sliding on its roof, with sparks flying, for a podium finish. The car of John Winter hit a barrier and exploded into a fireball in North Curve, which he survived.|$|E
5000|$|The Hunter {{commenced}} its display with a {{low pass}} along the runway from south to north, turning for a second pass in the opposite direction. As it neared the airport, it pulled up into an inside loop. This manoeuvre started from a height of 200 feet m, which David Learmount later said [...] "left no room for misjudgement". The loop should have been started at a height of 500 ft and a speed of at least 350 kn indicated airspeed, attaining a height of 4000 ft and 150 kn {{at the top of}} the loop. Only 2700 ft and 105 kn were achieved from an initial <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> of 310 kn.|$|E
30|$|The {{paper is}} {{structured}} as follows. In Related work section we describe existing tilt-based text entry solutions that {{usually do not}} use the QWERTY layout, and/or rely on continuous application feedback. Pitch and Roll as input primitives for mobile devices section introduces the tilt-based concept which supports an interaction less relying on visual feedback; here we define Pitch and Roll movement sequences as discrete-tilt input primitives for mobile devices. In Discrete-tilt Pitch and Roll based text entry methods section we apply the proposed input commands on text entry in the mobile, by introducing three different text entry methods that utilize both QWERTY-based keyboard layouts and discrete-tilt-based strategies for character selection. Modeling upper-bound text <b>entry</b> <b>speeds</b> section deals with the proposed methods, targeting error-free interaction and expert-level input efficiency. We describe the used modeling methodology which consists of: (i) user experiment which is conducted to determine the time of discrete-tilt execution, (ii) movement models able to predict the total time required to enter a particular character, (iii) a constructed linguistic model for the English language that provides a matrix of digraph probabilities, and (iv) calculated predictions for discrete-tilt-based text <b>entry</b> <b>speeds.</b> In Discussion section we evaluate the proposed designs {{with respect to the}} predictions hence obtained, and discuss the model limitations. The last section offers a brief recapitulation, including the outline of our future research plan.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of conducting Space Shuttle-launched earth entry flight tests {{to enhance the}} technology base for second generation planetary entry missions is examined. Outer planet entry environments are reviewed, translated into earth entry requirements and used to establish entry test system design and cost characteristics. <b>Entry</b> <b>speeds</b> up to those needed to simulate radiative heating levels of more than 30 kW/sq cm are shown to be possible. A standardized recoverable test bed concept is described {{that is capable of}} accommodating a wide range of entry technology experiments. The economic advantage of shared Shuttle launches are shown to be achievable through a test system configured to the volume constraints of a single Spacelab pallet using existing propulsion components...|$|R

50|$|After {{finishing}} well {{in multiple}} competitions in 2003, {{the next step}} was full-time competition in the U.S. when he signed up for his first Formula Drift Championship Series in the 2004 season. Dai finished in the top 8 at two rounds and placed 2nd at two of the rounds placing him 2nd overall in the championship run. Dai was not only finishing at the top of each event but was also earning the title as the man with the fastest <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> every time. In 2005 and 2006 he continued to shine in the Formula Drift series standing on the podium numerous times. Throughout 2007 he was continually fighting for the championship, which finally placed him 3rd overall.|$|E
50|$|On 1 May 2012, the James W. Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park's Ranger Suzie Matin {{discovered}} {{two pieces}} of the meteorite (SM14 @ 11.5 grams) in her front yard. The park contains what {{is now known as}} Sutter's Mill (site). On 3 May 2012 scientists with the Ames Research Center and the SETI Institute utilized an airship to search the strewn field for the impact scars of kg-sized meteorites, but it is now understood that the high <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> prevented the survival of meteorites as large as found in the Murchison meteorite fall. Ground-based searches resulted in the additional recovery of two pristinely collected meteorites (SM12 and SM67) for scientific study.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{weeks after}} the February 15, 2013, Chelyabinsk meteor, Jenniskens participated in a Russian Academy of Sciences fact finding mission to Chelyabinsk Oblast. [...] Over 50 villages were visited to map {{the extent of the}} glass damage. Traffic video records were {{collected}} to map the shock wave arrival times. In order to determine the meteoroid <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> and angle, star background calibration images were taken and shadow obstacle dimensions were measured at sites where video cameras recorded the fireball and its shadows. Eyewitnesses were interviewed to learn about injuries, heat sensations, sunburn, smells and where meteorites were found. Meteorites found shortly after the fall by Chelyabinsk State University colleagues were analyzed and the results from this consortium study were published in Science.|$|E
40|$|Decelerations, heating rates, {{and total}} heat loads {{encountered}} when returning from Mars to earth at <b>entry</b> <b>speeds</b> of 12 km/sec to 16 km/sec are studied. For entry at 14 km/sec, {{it is found}} that a lift/drag ratio (L/D) of 0. 5 is required to provide a guidance corridor margin near 1 deg for the specified deceleration limit of 5 g. For a blunted, raked cone with an L/D = 0. 5, the peak heating rate near the aft end of the forebody varies from 0. 14 to 0. 23 kW/sq cm for laminar flow. If ablation triggers boundary layer transition, the peak heating can rise to 0. 5 or up to 0. 72 kW/sq cm. All heating rates are sufficiently high to make ablative heat shields necessary...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a {{text entry method}} for touchscreen devices using a Graffiti-like alphabet combined with automatic error correction. The method is novel in that the user does not receive {{the results of the}} recognition process, except {{at the end of a}} phrase. The method is justified over soft keyboards in terms of a Frame Model of Visual Attention, which reveals both the presence and advantage of reduced visual attention. With less on-going feedback to monitor, there is a tendency for the user to enter gestures more quickly. Preliminary testing reveals reasonably quick text <b>entry</b> <b>speeds</b> (> 20 wpm) with low errors rates (< 5 %).

50|$|In 2016 {{the company}} {{developed}} the e-Performance Hub, {{a technology that}} allows the company to better {{meet the demands of}} its omnichannel strategy. Teleperformance was awarded a US patent on May 5, 2015, for “securely and efficiently processing telephone orders” through a new technology called ESP™. ESP™ accelerates the <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> of confidential consumer data, while simultaneously securing the information capture process. In February 2015 Teleperformance announced the opening of the first virtual contact center in the Middle East and Africa. Located in Dubai’s Internet City, the facility will be a virtual contact center connecting UAE-based regional and other international clients with Teleperformance Egypt’s contact center in Cairo. Teleperformance was a commercial partner in the “Sensei Project” which was developed in 2016 to predict the outcome of the “Brexit” vote in the UK using data-mining of social media chatter.|$|E
50|$|The {{only time}} the circuit is {{run on a}} reverse {{direction}} is during the D1 Grand Prix round as Keiichi Tsuchiya felt the new layout meant reduced <b>entry</b> <b>speed,</b> making it less suitable for drifting. The series has hosted its rounds since , {{with the exception of}} the 2004 closure, the circuit became the first to take place on an international level racetrack and the first of the three to take place on an F1 circuit. The course starts from the 300R section, slide through the hairpin, then through 100R and ends past the Coca-Cola curve. With the reprofiling, as cars no longer run downbank, entry speeds have since been reduced, the hill at the exit making acceleration difficult. As part of the 2003 renovations, most of the old banked section of track was demolished. Only a small section remains to this day.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Full Course" [...] is {{the most}} common configuration. One of the most notable {{sections}} of the course, second only to [...] "Oak Tree" [...] (T11), are the [...] "Climbing Esses" [...] which consist of an initial left up-hill (T7), followed by a right which crests at the apex then dropping slightly into a left (T8) which again crests at the apex dropping slightly, and then up into a final left (T9). The complexity and difficulty of this section is multiplied by the incredible <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> because of a straight section leading into the Climbing Esses. This is followed by a cresting blind left hand turn (T10), [...] "South Bend", that finishes in a steep downward slope. Another signature section is the [...] "Roller Coaster" [...] (T14) which is a scaled-down mirror image to the famed [...] "Corkscrew" [...] at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.|$|E
30|$|Entry {{velocity}} for {{the smallest}} sample # 19 (d = 12 μm), with a 50 % release temperature of 680 °C, is about 12 km/s. For samples # 20 and # 74 with diameters of ca. 70 μm, a 50 % release temperature of about 500 °C is indicated in Fig. 11. Although a point satisfying both the diameter {{and the temperature}} is beyond the simulated area, slow entry velocity (< 10 km/s) is implied. The <b>entry</b> <b>speeds</b> for these snow-AMMs are distinctly lower than those for cometary dust particles (> 18 km/s), but in the range for particles of asteroidal origin (< 14 km/s) (Joswiak et al., 2007). For other samples with the 50 % release temperatures higher than 800 °C, the entry velocities are not constrained.|$|R
40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare soft keyboard layouts. The methodology involved paper mockups and manual timing in a classroom situation. Students worked in pairs – one as experimenter, one as participant – swapping roles midway through the experiment. Participants used a stylus to tap the well-known “quick brown fox ” phrase five times on each layout. <b>Entry</b> <b>speeds,</b> computed from the measured time to enter the phrase, were 26. 5 to 34. 5 wpm for the Qwerty keyboard layout, 12. 3 to 14. 7 wpm for the Opti layout, 15. 7 wpm for the Fitaly layout, 12. 1 and 12. 3 for a Qwerty-Phone (QP) hybrid layout, and 19. 0 to 23. 0 wpm for the standard phone keypad layout. The merits and limitations of the evaluation method are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{parametric}} study of corridor width and stagnation point heating are presented {{for a range of}} a probable mission designs and vehicle configurations. Entry velocities were varied from 6 to 10 km/s, L/Ds from 0. 1 to 1. 0, and ballistic coefficients from 100 to 500 kg/sq m. It is found that vehicles with an L/D of 0. 4 to 0. 5 provide an entry corridor width of at least 1 deg for velocities up to 10 km/s. For entry velocities below approximately 7 km/s, radiative cooling may be possible for the thermal protection system. It is recommended that, at higher <b>entry</b> <b>speeds,</b> ablative heat shields be used. Maximum integrated stagnation point heat loads were equivalent to or less than those experienced by the Space Shuttle on a typical reentry...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of the Su-27, the pilot {{initially}} disengages the angle of attack limiter of the plane, normally set at 26°. [...] This action also disengages the g limiter. After that the pilot pulls back on the stick hard. The aircraft reaches 90-120° angle of attack with a slight gain of altitude and a significant loss of speed. When the elevator is centered, the drag {{at the rear of the}} plane causes torque, thus making the aircraft pitch forward. At that time the pilot adds power to compensate for the lift loss. In a properly performed Pugachev's Cobra, the plane maintains almost straight flight throughout the maneuver; the plane does not roll or yaw in either direction. Proper <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> is significant because, if entering at too low a speed, the pilot might not be able to accomplish the maneuver; entering at too high a speed might result in airframe damage due to the high g-force or for the pilot to lose consciousness.|$|E
50|$|Rydquist became {{interested}} in drifting upon moving to California. He practiced with his personal Nissan 350Z before entering the Just Drift series in 2008 with the same car, finishing the season in 8th place. Rydquist earned a sponsorship from City Tire Online and a seat in Formula D, a drifting league recognized as the pinnacle of professional drifting. In 2009 Rydquist entered three FD competition events where he immediately qualified into Top 32 at Long Beach and received one vote for One-More-Time in the Top 32 tandem battle against reigning FD champion Tanner Foust. In Rydquist's second FD event at Road Atlanta, the FD judges requested two tandem battles between Rydquist and drifting veteran Darren MacNamara before deciding which driver {{to move on to}} Top 16. By Round 3 in Las Vegas Rydquist the team had improved the car and Rydquist qualified in 7th place with the 2nd highest <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> of the entire FD field, scoring higher points than no less than four former and current Formula Drift champions Chris Forsberg, Michael Essa, Vaughn Gittin Jr and Tanner Foust.|$|E
50|$|Behind Frank Clement {{the race}} was tight, however, with the 3 litre Ariès and the Jacques Chanterelle/René Schiltz Théophile Schneider {{managing}} {{to keep pace with}} the 3 litre Bentleys as the race progressed into the growing evening gloom. It was just after 9:30pm that the second Théophile Schneider, driven by Robert Poitier and Pierre Tabourin, precipitated the races most famous event. A few laps in arrears but being chased hard by Callingham in Old Mother Gun, the driver misjudged his <b>entry</b> <b>speed</b> into the virages Maison Blanche (since bypassed by the Porsche Curves), known amongst the British fraternity by their English translation: the White House curves. The Théophile Schneider slewed to a halt, broadside across the road. Rather than plough head-on into his opponent, Callingham chose to put the Bentley off the road, into a ditch. Unfortunately for him the big car rolled, throwing him into the centre of the road. Unsighted by the corner, when the second Théophile Schneider came upon the accident site the driver did not have time to take evasive action and thus collided, at speed, with the Bentley and its sister car. A similar fate awaited Duller, at the wheel of the number 2 Bentley, and a 2-litre Ariès, before Sammy Davis in the second 3-litre Bentley approached the White House curves.|$|E
