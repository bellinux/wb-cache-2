25|$|However, as of 2008 this {{technology}} remains too costly for many smaller libraries, and the conversion period {{has been estimated}} at 11 months for an average-size library. A 2004 Dutch estimate was that a library which lends 100,000 books per year should plan on a cost of â‚¬50,000 (borrow- and return-stations: 12,500 each, detection porches 10,000 each; tags 0.36 each). RFID taking a large burden off staff could also mean that fewer staff will be needed, resulting in some of them getting laid off, but that has so far not happened in North America where recent surveys have not returned a single library that cut staff because of adding RFID. In fact, library budgets are being reduced for personnel and increased for infrastructure, making it necessary for libraries to add automation {{to compensate for the}} reduced staff size. Also, the tasks that RFID takes over are largely not the primary tasks of librarians. A finding in the Netherlands is that borrowers are pleased with the fact that staff are now more available <b>for</b> <b>answering</b> questions.|$|E

500|$|Resistance to {{the growing}} {{influence}} of molecular biology was especially evident in evolutionary biology. Protein sequencing had great potential for the quantitative study of evolution (through the molecular clock hypothesis), but leading evolutionary biologists questioned the relevance of molecular biology <b>for</b> <b>answering</b> the big questions of evolutionary causation. Departments and disciplines fractured as organismic biologists asserted their importance and independence: Theodosius Dobzhansky made the famous statement that [...] "nothing in biology makes sense except {{in the light of}} evolution" [...] {{as a response to the}} molecular challenge. The issue became even more critical after 1968; Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution suggested that natural selection was not the ubiquitous cause of evolution, at least at the molecular level, and that molecular evolution might be a fundamentally different process from morphological evolution. (Resolving this [...] "molecular/morphological paradox" [...] has been a central focus of molecular evolution research since the 1960s.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Seeing {{the early}} {{success of the}} New York studio, Kellgren and Stone {{decided to move to}} the West Coast and open another one in Los Angeles. To design the studio, they {{contracted}} with Tom Hidley who had built TTG Studios in 1965, and was becoming known in L.A. <b>for</b> <b>answering</b> the high-decibel needs of rock music. Hidley was brought on board as the [...] "third musketeer", according to Stone. On December 4, 1969, the new studio opened its doors on 8456 West Third Street near La Cienega Boulevard. Sometimes known as [...] "Record Plant West", the new studio held a 16-track recorder, larger than the 12-track system in New York (occasionally called [...] "Record Plant East"), and studio time was 20 to 25 percent less expensive than typical studios in New York. Stone intended the Record Plant to stay innovative and retain the prestige of an industry leader, so in 1970 he installed a 24-track tape recorder. It was a very large machine assembled by Hidley at the cost of $42,000 but in the next three years it was used on only a few sessions.|$|E
