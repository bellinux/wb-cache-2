40|$|The paper {{presents}} a generalization of multi-dimensional linear regression to facilitate multi-sensor fault detection and signal reconstruction {{through the use}} of analytical optimization. The proposed methodology is founded upon the solution of an optimal signal reconstruction problem. The technique is applied to the real time monitoring of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> and burner-tip <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors,</b> of a 14 MW industrial gas turbine. Key benefits of the proposed technique are that it facilitates (i) real-time detection of sensor faults and the number of sensors that are at fault in a multi-sensor system; (ii) reconstruction of measurements that would normally be expected from the sensor at fault - thereby facilitating improved unit availability; (iii) determining the minimum number of non-faulty sensors that are required to be available to continue unit operation without unduly compromising performance. The use of an analytical formulation to determine (i-iii) means that the resulting technique incurs low computational overhead and is readily applied to real-time monitoring and subsequent remedial action. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the developed procedures to facilitate continued unit operation in the event of sensor faults. Whilst the application to industrial gas turbine machinery is used to focus the study, {{it should be noted that}} the proposed techniques are much more widely applicable to numerous industrial and commercial systems.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of correction {{of the dynamic}} characteristics of <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> in automatic control systems for the operation of aircraft gas turbine engines depends on {{the accuracy of the}} time constants of the sensors used from heat exchange conditions. The aim of this work was to develop a new method for determining the characteristic curves of the thermal inertia of <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors.</b> The new technique does not require finding the time constants of <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> on the experimental transient characteristics. Characteristic curves for each time constant are defined as hyperbolic dependencies on the heat transfer coefficient of the <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> sensing element with the gas flow. Parameters of hyperbolic dependencies are proposed to be established using two-dimensional regression analysis. For this purpose, special software has been developed in the Mathcad 14 and Mathcad 15. The software allows inputting the original data from the transient characteristics to the corresponding vectors or from tables in Excel format. It is shown that the transient characteristics in three-dimensional coordinates «time – heat transfer coefficient – the value of the transition characteristic» form a surface whose parameters are parameters of the desired hyperbolic dependencies. For a specific application of the technique, the regression functions for the dynamic characteristics of <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> corresponding to the first and second orders are given.

Measuring the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> is useful for {{a better understanding of}} engine processes. Thermocouples do not measure the instantaneous <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> because of their limited dynamic response. A thermocouple compensation technique has been developed to estimate the time constant in situ. This method has been commissioned in a simulation study and a controlled experiment with a reference temperature. The {{studies have shown that the}} signal bandwidth has to be restricted, since noise will be amplified in the temperature reconstruction. The technique has been successfully applied to some engine exhaust measurements. A comparison between two independent pairs of thermocouples has shown that temperature variations at frequencies up to 80 Hz can be recovered. The medium load results agree with a previous study, which used fast response thermometers with a bandwidth of about 50 Hz. However, the results at low load and two different speeds have highlighted the need to do some 1 -D unsteady flow simulations, in order to gain more insight into the exhaust process.

IVC (inlet valve closing) timings were set at up to 60  CA (crank angle) degrees earlier than the production setting of 37 ° ABDC for the engine. At the earliest timing, effective compression ratio was reduced from 15. 2 : 1 to 13. 7 : 1. The effects on emissions were significant only for EIVC settings at least 40  CA degrees earlier than the production setting, and were sensitive to engine load. At 2  bar BMEP (brake mean effective pressure) and fixed levels of NOx, soot emissions were reduced but CO (carbon monoxide) and HC (hydrocarbon) increased unless fuel rail pressure was reduced. With increasing load, soot reduction diminished and was negligible at 6  bar BMEP; CO and HC emissions deteriorated further. At all conditions, EIVC raised <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> by > 50  °C; the effect on fuel economy was negligible or a fuel economy penalty.
