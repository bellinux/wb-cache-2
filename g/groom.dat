This study {{set out to}} describe the general pattern, time budget and degree of cephalocaudal sequencing of self-oral <b>grooming</b> in the domestic cat. In 11 cats confined {{for the purposes of}} videotaping, sleeping and resting accounted for 50 % of the time budget. Oral <b>grooming,</b> 91 % of which was to multiple body regions, accounted for 4 % of the overall time budget or 8 % of non-sleepingrresting time. Scratch <b>grooming,</b> always directed to single regions, occupied about 1 r 50 of the time of oral <b>grooming.</b> There was a moderate and significant cephalocaudal trend to <b>grooming.</b> An increased likelihood for oral <b>grooming</b> to follow periods of sleep or rest was indicated by a significant negative correlation between sleeprrest duration and latency to the subsequent <b>grooming</b> bout. The effect of enforced deprivation of <b>grooming</b> on the subsequent occurrence of <b>grooming</b> was explored by the 3 -day application of Elizabethian collars, which prevented oral <b>grooming</b> or control collars that did not prevent <b>grooming.</b> In the 12 h immediately after removal of the Elizabethian collars, oral <b>grooming</b> increased by 67 % and scratch <b>grooming</b> by 200 % compared with the <b>grooming</b> rate after removal of control collars.

40|$|We {{investigated}} dyadic <b>grooming</b> {{relationships in}} a captive group of bonobos (Pan paniscus) and questioned what social function <b>grooming</b> fulfils in the market {{of services and}} favors. Hereto we examined which of two theoretical models - <b>grooming</b> for support (Seyfarth, 1977, 1980) or <b>grooming</b> according to the similarity principle (de Waal & Luttrell, 1986) - best accounted for the observed <b>grooming</b> distribution. Similarity in traits did not correlate with increased <b>grooming</b> or close proximity among the individuals. Therefore, the similarity hypothesis was rejected. Seyfarths model of rank-related <b>grooming</b> was largely confirmed. The animals distributed their <b>grooming</b> according {{to the rank of}} the receivers. We found an exchange between <b>grooming</b> and receipt of support. There was more <b>grooming</b> up than down the hierarchy. However, not all predictions about rank-related competition over <b>grooming</b> were confirmed. We found that dyadic <b>grooming</b> reciprocity indeed increased with decreasing rank distance. Yet, there was no increase of <b>grooming</b> within the dyad with decreasing rank distance and high ranking individuals were not competed over at the highest rates. The observed correlation between <b>grooming</b> and support received represents an important fit with Seyfarths prediction, but does not allow for conclusions about underlying causal processes.

40|$|Social {{networking}} sites (SNS) provide innovative social bonding methods {{known as}} social <b>grooming.</b> These have drastically decreased time and distance constraints of social <b>grooming.</b> Here we show two type social <b>grooming</b> (elaborate social <b>grooming</b> and lightweight social <b>grooming)</b> {{discovered in a}} model constructed by thirty communication data-sets including face to face, SNS, mobile phones, and Chacma baboons. This demarcation {{is caused by a}} trade-off between the number and strength of social relationships on social <b>grooming.</b> The trade-off of elaborate social <b>grooming</b> is weaker than the trade-off of lightweight social <b>grooming.</b> On the other hand, the cost of elaborate methods is higher than lightweight methods. This model connects micro-social <b>grooming</b> behaviour and macro-social structures with these trade-offs. People tend to use elaborate social <b>grooming</b> to reinforce close relationships and construct deep limited societies (e. g. face to face and Chacma baboons). This seems to be apriori. On the other hand, people tend to use lightweight social <b>grooming</b> to maintain many weak social relationships and construct expanded shallow societies (e. g. SNS). Humans recently have obtained this method. Humans with lightweight methods who live in significantly complex societies use various social <b>grooming</b> to effectively construct social relationships. Elaborate social <b>grooming</b> is for getting cooperation from close relationships. Lightweight social <b>grooming</b> is for getting information from many weak relationships...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{mismatch}} between lightpath channel capacity and traffic request capacity in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical mesh networks. Traffic <b>grooming</b> {{is needed to}} resolve this mismatch in an efficient way. We study the dynamic traffic <b>grooming</b> problem in WDM mesh networks using the fixed-alternate routing (FAR) approach. Based on the FAR approach, we propose the fixed-order <b>grooming</b> (FOG) algorithm to support on-line provisioning of multi-granularity subwavelength connections. As traffic <b>grooming</b> involves two-layered routing, it is {{significantly different from the}} routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem in wavelength-routed WDM networks. We introduce the route selection problem (also called <b>grooming</b> node selection problem) and propose three <b>grooming</b> policies to address this problem. The three <b>grooming</b> policies are load sharing (LS), sequential <b>grooming</b> (SG) and minimum gap (MG). To address the wavelength and transceiver constraints, we propose another three <b>grooming</b> policies including least physical hop first (LPH), least virtual hop first (LVH) and least stringent resource first (LSR).

40|$|Social <b>grooming</b> is {{a common}} form of affiliative {{behavior}} in primates. Biological market theory suggests that <b>grooming</b> can be traded either for <b>grooming</b> or other social commodities and services. When no other services are exchanged, <b>grooming</b> is predicted to be approximately reciprocated within a dyad. In contrast, the amount of reciprocal <b>grooming</b> should decrease as other offered services increase. We studied <b>grooming</b> patterns between polygamous male and female in golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) from the Qinling Mountains of central China and found that about 29. 7 % of <b>grooming</b> bouts were reciprocated. However, the durations of <b>grooming</b> bouts offered and returned was asymmetrical within dyads. In bisexual dyads, more <b>grooming</b> was initiated by females than males, which became more pronounced {{as the number of}} females per one-male unit increased. The rate of copulation per day for each female was positively correlated with the total duration of <b>grooming</b> time females invested in males [...] Females without an infant (non-mothers) directed more <b>grooming</b> towards females with an infant (mothers) and {{were significantly more likely to}} be non-reciprocated. There was a significant negative relationship between non-mother and mother <b>grooming</b> duration and the rate of infants per female in each one-male unit. High-ranking females also received more <b>grooming</b> from low-ranking females than vice versa. The rate of food-related aggressive interactions was per day for low-ranking females was negatively correlated with the duration of <b>grooming</b> that low-ranking females gave to high-ranking females.

40|$|In {{non-human}} primates, <b>grooming</b> {{is thought}} to be a costly activity for the donor and beneficial for the recipient. Reciprocity assumes that individuals act as the donor and recipient of <b>grooming</b> and switch roles over time to balance the benefits and costs.

We tested the role of direct, indirect, and generalized reciprocity in explaining <b>grooming</b> exchanges of wild Barbary macaques. We collected the occurrence and latency of the three types of <b>grooming</b> reciprocity during one hour focal session run simultaneously on two partners who just stopped <b>grooming</b> (post-grooming session) or who were in proximity (i. e. within 1. 5 meters) without <b>grooming</b> (control session).

Directly reciprocated <b>grooming</b> from B to A was more likely to occur, and occurred earlier when A had previously <b>groomed</b> B than in control sessions. We found no evidence for indirect or generalised reciprocity. Our results indicate that <b>grooming</b> distribution in Barbary macaques is partnerspecific and occurs according to direct reciprocity. Such partner specificity can explain the lack of evidence for generalised reciprocity, whereas indirect reciprocity may be too cognitively demanding to occur in macaques...|$|R
