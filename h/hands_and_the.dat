She also holds a shakti and hala (plough). Such a Varahi sculpture is found at Abanesi, depicted with the dancing Shiva. She may also be depicted holding a child sitting on her lap, like Matrikas are often depicted.|$|E

Just two weeks before the opening was scheduled, Carradine was still shooting some additional scenes.|$|E
5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{ebb and flow of}} war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E

5|$|Having been a {{professional}} musician since the mid-'60s (and the guitarist for King Crimson since 1969), {{by the late}} 1980s Robert Fripp found himself in conflict with his longtime record label E.G.Records and management company (E.G. Management) over royalties allegedly owed by E.G. to himself and to other band members. During this period, Fripp met and began working with producer and online developer David Singleton, initially on a Guitar Craft tour in 1990 and subsequently on the production of two albums - the League of Crafty Guitarists' Show of <b>Hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eponymous album for the Fripp-and-Toyah-fronted group Sunday All Over the World. Fripp and Singleton's production partnership was sealed by work on two King Crimson boxed sets (1991's Frame by Frame and 1992's The Great Deceiver) and continues {{to the present day}} under the name of TonProb.|$|E

On the way to Willow's dorm she trips, turns around and sees The Gentlemen {{floating}} toward her. In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks on doors which no one will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking down the hall and exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the door with a vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing. They clasp <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.|$|E
5|$|One Foot used Bournemouth to film some {{exterior}} sequences {{because of}} its favourable climate, easy access to London, and economical benefits relative to filming in the capital. After the first series was filmed, the housenear Pokesdown, Bournemouthwhich had been used for the Meldrews' house in location sequences, changed <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new owners demanded nearly treble the usage fees that the previous owners had asked for. Rather than agree to this, the production team decided {{to find a new}} house, and the first episode of the second series was rewritten to have the Meldrews' house destroyed in a fire (Filmed on waste ground in Northcote Road, Springbourne). This also gave the opportunity for a new interior set to be designed, as Belbin had been unhappy with the original set designed for the series, which she felt was too restrictive to shoot in.|$|E

5|$|Operation Perch was a British {{offensive}} of the Second World War {{which took}} place from 7 to 14 June 1944, {{during the early stages}} of the Battle of Normandy. The operation was intended to encircle and seize the German occupied city of Caen, which was a D-Day objective for the British 3rd Infantry Division in the early phases of Operation Overlord. Operation Perch was to begin immediately after the British beach landings with an advance to the south-east of Caen by XXX Corps. Three days after the invasion the city was still in German <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> operation was amended. The operation was expanded to include I Corps for a pincer attack on Caen.|$|E

Two quick wickets fell before Ponsford joined Woodfull in the middle, but having {{been struck by}} short balls several more times, Woodfull was bowled by Allen for 22, having batted {{for an hour and}} a half. When a doctor was publicly requested, to attend an injury to Voce, many in the crowd believed it was Woodfull who required assistance, leading to a renewal of protest. In later years, Woodfull's wife believed that his injury at Adelaide was partly responsible for his death aged 67 in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} Gregory's main motivation was {{to increase the}} number of Christians; others wonder if more political matters such as extending the primacy of the papacy to additional provinces and the recruitment of new Christians looking to Rome for leadership were also involved. Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under Æthelberht could have had some bearing on the choice of location. Also, the mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards. At the time of the mission Britain was the only part of the former Roman Empire which remained in pagan <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> historian Eric John argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.|$|E

5|$|According to Byzantine custom, the {{coronation}} of an emperor could only {{take place in}} Constantinople and be performed by the Patriarch; yet Constantinople was still in Latin <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Patriarch (now Germanus II, 1223–40) resided in Nicaea. Theodore thus turned to the Metropolitan of Thessalonica, Constantine Mesopotamites, whom he had just restored to his see after removing the Latin prelate. Mesopotamites however recognized the Patriarch at Nicaea as legitimate, and steadfastly refused to perform the rite, despite pressure from Theodore, his brother Constantine, and John Apokaukos. Rather than submit, he preferred to return to exile. In response, in March 1225 Theodore convened a council of the bishops of his domains at Arta, chaired by Apokaukos. The council approved a declaration, composed by Apokaukos, which extolled Theodore's achievements against the Latins and Bulgarians, his liberation of Greek lands, eviction of Catholic priests and restoration of Orthodox bishops, and his imperial descent, and declared that the council recognized only him as emperor. Armed with this declaration, Theodore had the loyal Archbishop of Ohrid, Demetrios Chomatianos, perform {{the coronation}} instead.|$|E
5|$|Between 17 and 20 July 1914, Monarch {{took part}} in a test {{mobilisation}} and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed {{with the rest of the}} Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. Following the outbreak of World War I in August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. On 8 August, Monarch was conducting gunnery practice south-east of Fair Isle when she was unsuccessfully attacked by a submarine-fired torpedo. This was probably a false alarm as the area was too far to the west of the German U-boats' patrol zones to be likely. , however, has been suggested as a candidate for the attack, although the boat was sunk the following day with the loss of all <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> truth will never be known.|$|E
5|$|In 530 a major Persian {{offensive}} in Mesopotamia {{was defeated by}} Roman forces under Belisarius at Dara, while a second Persian thrust in the Caucasus was defeated by Sittas at Satala. Belisarius was defeated by Persian and Lakhmid forces at the Battle of Callinicum in 531. In the same year the Romans gained some forts in Armenia, while the Persians had captured two forts in eastern Lazica. Immediately after the failure at Callinicum the Persians and Romans negotiated without success. The two sides re-opened talks in spring 532 and finally signed the Eternal Peace in September 532, which lasted less than eight years. Both powers agreed to return all occupied territories, and the Romans agreed to make a one-time payment of 110 centenaria (11,000lb of gold). Iberia remained in Persian <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Iberians who had left their country were given the choice of remaining in Roman territory or returning to their native land.|$|E

5|$|The Roman {{position}} was worsened {{by the absence}} of Egypt's prefect, Tenagino Probus, who was battling pirates. According to Zosimus, the Palmyrenes were helped by an Egyptian general named Timagenes; Zabdas moved into Egypt with 70,000 soldiers, defeating an army of 50,000 Romans. After their victory, the Palmyrenes withdrew their main force and left a 5,000-soldier garrison. By early November, Tenagino Probus returned and assembled an army; he expelled the Palmyrenes and regained Alexandria, prompting Zabdas to return. The Palmyrene general aimed a thrust at Alexandria, where he seems to have had local support; the city fell into Zabdas' <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Roman prefect fled south. The last battle was at the Babylon Fortress, where Tenagino Probus took refuge; the Romans had the upper hand, since they chose their camp carefully. Timagenes, with his knowledge of the land, ambushed the Roman rear; Tenagino Probus committed suicide, and Egypt became part of Palmyra. In the Augustan History the Blemmyes were among Zenobia's allies, and Gary K. Young cites the Blemmyes attack and occupation of Coptos in 268 as evidence of a Palmyrene-Blemmyes alliance.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{started on}} 6 September 1831. Russian forces {{surprised}} the Poles by attacking the strongest Polish {{position in the}} suburb of Wola. Despite staunch defence {{of some of the}} ramparts, especially Fort 54 and Fort 56, after the first day the outer line of Polish defences had been breached by Russian infantry and artillery. The following day fights resumed, but this time Russian artillery was close enough to shell the western boroughs of the city itself. Although losses were similar on both sides, Polish authorities decided not to risk another Massacre of Praga and ordered the evacuation of the city. On 8 September 1831 Warsaw lay in Russian <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the Polish Army retreated to Modlin. The November Uprising ended soon afterwards, with the remnants of the Polish Army crossing the borders of Prussia and Austria, to avoid being captured by the Russians.|$|E
