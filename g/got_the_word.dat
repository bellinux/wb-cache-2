500|$|Nude {{dancing at}} the club began in 1985 after a judge {{overturned}} City of Portland ordinances banning it at venues which served alcohol. A lawsuit over pasties and G-strings was brought after Portland annexed land formerly regulated by Multnomah County, which allowed tavern dancers to perform without clothing. A bar forced by the annexation to eliminate its nude dancing successfully sued the city. [...] "As soon as we <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> , we went nude," [...] said a club employee who was quoted in The Oregonian.|$|E
500|$|The special {{departed}} from Santa Fe's [...] La Grande Station in Los Angeles at 1:00pm Pacific Time on July 9, 1905. [...] The locomotive and three cars left {{the station and}} the cheering crowds, estimated at 20,000people, and began its run eastward. [...] The number of people at La Grande Station is remarkable in itself since the train's schedule was planned only one day before the event; the Santa Fe used the train {{as an opportunity to}} publicize itself and <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> out to news agencies across the railroad's territory.|$|E
2500|$|According to Robert Giroux, [...] "The studios {{seemed to}} be fearful that if {{certain aspects of the}} case were exposed, it would {{exacerbate}} their problems." [...] King Vidor said of the case in 1968: [...] "Last year I interviewed a Los Angeles police detective, now retired, who had been assigned to the case immediately after the murder. He told me, 'We were doing all right and then, before a week was out, we <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> to lay off.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Saying! God {{only knows}} their wickedness. I <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> 'Upper Marlboro' and 'South River' and 'next voyage,' and that profligate rector {{wanted to know}} as to how 'Griggs was reliable.'" ...|$|R

2500|$|Superliner cars got the Phase IV {{striping}} {{located in}} the same location as previously minus the swoop up on the Sightseer Lounge cars. These cars lost their Phase II-style wording above the doors and instead <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "Superliner" [...] in blue placed above the red & white stripes, slightly overlapping the stripes. The 'Superliner' text spanned most {{of the length of}} the car. The Viewliner cars received a similar treatment but bearing the word [...] "Viewliner". In June 2016, the last Amtrak Locomotive (P32-8BHW 515) was repainted in Phase V colors.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan and {{scientists}} and engineers from KRL were also told to be stay alert and were also sent to Balochistan along with PAEC. On the early morning of 27 May 1998, the ISI spotted camouflage F-16s were spotted conducting exercises; the ISI quickly <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> that the Israeli fighters, flying on behalf of India were inbound to take out Pakistan's nuclear facilities. When Sharif heard the news, he angrily ordered PAF to be scrambled and rolled its nuclear bombs out of their shelters in preparation to launch. But {{on the night of}} 27 May, the United States and other nations assured Nawaz Sharif that [...] "Pakistan was safe, the Israeli attack never materialized", according to political scientist dr. Shafik H. Hashmi.|$|E
2500|$|This {{incident}} alarmed Bernadotte, {{but before}} he could take stronger measures, the news reached La Romana that Rafael Lobo, an agent of the Spanish Junta had arrived offshore. Lobo indicated that the British fleet was en route, so the Spanish general <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> to his subordinates {{that it was time to}} execute the plan. The Spanish troops on Funen seized the port of Nyborg on 7 August. [...] The only resistance was from two Danish vessels in the harbour - the brig Fama and the smaller Søe-Ormen - [...] which were attacked by a British frigate and overwhelmed. The next day, the soldiers on Jutland commandeered some small craft at Fredericia and Aarhus and sailed to Funen. The Infante, Rey, and Zamora Regiments made a clean getaway, but the colonel of the Algarve regiment refused to budge. Finally, the senior captain put the plan into motion but it was too late. Finally aware of the plot, Kindelan rode to a nearby French camp and told them what was going on. A brigade of Dutch hussars intercepted the Algarve Regiment and forced their surrender; the senior captain then killed himself.|$|E
5000|$|Gorgar was {{the first}} 'talking' pinball machine. With a {{vocabulary}} of seven words (Gorgar, Speaks, Beat, You, Me, Hurt, <b>Got)</b> <b>The</b> <b>words</b> could be combined together for different phrases, such as [...] "Gorgar speaks" [...] and [...] "Me <b>got</b> you."

5000|$|Demos {{indicate}} that Lennon composed {{the song in}} late 1967. The original lyrics were [...] "Cry baby cry, make your mother buy." [...] Lennon described to biographer Hunter Davies how he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> from an advertisement. Some of the lyrics of the song are loosely based on the nursery rhyme [...] "Sing a Song of Sixpence".|$|R
5000|$|Winona was so smart. She was fifteen, {{she turned}} sixteen on the movie. She was a prodigy. From {{a very young}} age, she was an old soul. She really <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> and <b>the</b> imagery. She had watched tons of old movies. She was really {{sophisticated}} intellectually. She had the beauty of Veronica. She had the intelligence. She was just the perfect anti-Heather. Denise Di Novi, producer of Heathers ...|$|R
2500|$|Cantrell was a {{close friend}} of former Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, who he {{described}} as his best friend. Staley died in April 2002 at the same time of Cantrell's Degradation Trip tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, [...] "It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it [...] I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.". [...] "The shows I played between the time I <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's {{one of those things where}} if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again." [...] Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said: [...] "Jerry really loved Layne. They had a bond I haven't seen before." [...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.|$|E

The Rocky Mountain way is better than the way I had, because the music was better.' I <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> Bam!" ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{first major}} {{television}} role, Driscoll {{was sent to}} audition for EastEnders by his agent and following a screen test was given the part of vicar Alex. His first scene was with actress Daniella Denby-Ashe who played Sarah Hills. He has reflected, [...] "I was really chuffed. But that soon turned to fear when I had my first scene with Daniella. It was so nerve-racking. I didn't really understand the set-up. I don't know how I <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> out." ...|$|R

60|$|He said, as you state, that Cruikshank had <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> from a pot- house singer, but the {{locality}} {{he named}} was Whitechapel,* {{where he was}} looking out for characters. He added that Cruikshank sung or hummed the tune to him, and he gave it the musical notation which follows the preface. He also said that Charles Dickens wrote the notes. His personal connection with the work and his relation to Dickens are, I think, fair evidence on the question.|$|R
500|$|John F. Kennedy, {{the only}} Catholic {{to be elected}} President of the United States, was a Fourth Degree member of Bunker Hill Council No. 62 and Bishop Cheverus General Assembly. Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart visited Kennedy at the White House on Columbus Day, 1961. The {{president}} told Hart that his younger brother, Ted Kennedy, had received [...] "his Third Degree in our Order three weeks before".

50|$|If the {{contestant}} {{tried to}} place a stopper or gave an incorrect guess for <b>the</b> <b>word</b> in play, control and any unused letters passed to the opponent.

Play continued until one of the contestants solved <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> <b>The</b> last letter in <b>the</b> <b>word</b> was never revealed, and if the contestant had one space left he/she was required to guess.

60|$|A loud Dutch shout from Dirck {{broke out}} of him, {{regardless}} of the street, and his whole face lighted up into a broad sympathetic smile. I had {{caught a glimpse of}} a sled coming down the acclivity we were slowly ascending, which sled glided past us just as I <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> out of my mouth. It was occupied by Jason alone, who seemed just as much charmed with the sport as any other grown-up boy on the hill. There he went, the cocked-hat uppermost, the pea-green coat beneath, and the striped woollens and heavy plated buckles stuck out, one on each side, governing the movement of the sled with the readiness of a lad accustomed to the business.|$|R
60|$|Then suddenly, {{like the}} notes of some deep-throated bird, her rounded voice rang out in song so wildly sweet, and yet with so eerie and sad a refrain, {{that it made}} the very blood stand still. Up, up soared the golden notes, that seemed to melt far away, and then to grow again and travel on, laden with all the sorrow {{of the world and}} all the despair of the lost. It was a marvellous song, but I had not time to listen to it properly. However, I <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of it afterwards, and here is a {{translation}} of its burden, so far as it admits of being translated at all.|$|R
