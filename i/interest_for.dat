5|$|According to Dance, Clemens was {{requested}} by 20th Century Fox as a love <b>interest</b> <b>for</b> Ellen Ripley. Director David Fincher initially intended to reunite Paul McGann, Richard E. Grant and Ralph Brown (from Withnail and I) with Grant playing Clemens, but Grant declined the role. Despite Alien 3 poor critical reception, Dance {{said in a}} 2014 Daily Beast interview that he considered the film superior to Aliens and its potential was hampered by 20th Century Fox.
