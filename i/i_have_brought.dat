Hughes recognised {{that such a}} clause would {{be a threat to}} White Australia and made it clear to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George that he would leave the conference if the clause was adopted. When the proposal failed, Hughes reported in the Australian parliament:The White Australia is yours.

It presents a contrast: while the lower choral voices remind of the Old Covenant, [...] "" [...] (It is the ancient law: human, you must die!), based on Jesus Sirach, the solo soprano turns to accepting death as a union with Jesus, singing three times [...] "" [...] (Yes, come, Lord Jesus!).

500|$|The cabinet {{clashed with}} Brătianu {{when it was}} {{discovered}} that it had been negotiating in secret with the disinherited Prince Carol (a traditional adversary of the PNL) as Ferdinand's health was taking {{a turn for the worse}} (Averescu later claimed that he had been asked by Brătianu: [...] "So, after <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> you to power, you wish to rise and dominate?"). The PNL withdrew its support, and, through an order signed by Constantin Hiott, Averescu's was replaced by the broad coalition government of Barbu Știrbey, Brătianu's brother-in-law. The general's deposition, confirmed by King Ferdinand on his deathbed, created a vacuum on the Right, soon filled by the Iron Guard, a fascist movement formed by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu (formerly an associate of Cuza's).|$|E
500|$|The {{play was}} revived {{early in the}} Restoration. When the {{existing}} stock of pre-civil war plays was divided between the two newly created patent theatre companies, Hamlet was the only Shakespearean favourite that Sir William Davenant's Duke's Company secured. It became the first of Shakespeare's plays to be presented with movable flats painted with generic scenery behind the proscenium arch of Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre. This new stage convention highlighted {{the frequency with which}} Shakespeare shifts dramatic location, encouraging the recurrent criticism of his failure to maintain unity of place. In the title role, Davenant cast Thomas Betterton, who continued to play the Dane until he was 74. David Garrick at Drury Lane produced a version that adapted Shakespeare heavily; he declared: [...] "I had sworn I would not leave the stage till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> it forth without the grave-digger's trick, Osrick, & the fencing match". The first actor known to have played Hamlet in North America is Lewis Hallam. Jr., in the American Company's production in Philadelphia in 1759.|$|E
500|$|On 24April 1917, Little engaged a DFW C.V, {{forcing it}} to land. He then {{followed}} the German aircraft down {{to claim it}} as captured and personally take its crew prisoner at gunpoint. The Australian flipped his own plane in a ditch after touching down, however, prompting the surrendering enemy pilot to suggest: [...] "It looks as if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> you down, not you me, doesn't it?" [...] Naval Eight's conversion to the Sopwith Triplane in April saw Little begin to score heavily, eventually registering twenty-four victories on the type to bring his total up to twenty-eight by 10July, including twin victories in a day on four occasions. He was the squadron's top scorer with the Triplane, mostly in one particular airframe, N5493, that he christened [...] "Blymp", which also became the nickname of his baby son. [...] The unit then began flying Sopwith Camels, in which he scored a further ten kills in July to make fourteen all-up for the month. When he subsequently rotated back to England for rest, he was ranked Flight Lieutenant and credited {{with a total of}} thirty-eight victories, including fifteen destroyed or captured. A bar to his DSC had been gazetted on 29June, for [...] "exceptional daring and skill in aerial fighting on many occasions", and he received the French Croix de Guerre on 11July, becoming—along with fellow Australian RNAS ace Roderic (Stan) Dallas—one of the first three British Empire pilots to be so decorated. In August, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order [...] "for exceptional skill and daring", followed by a bar to the decoration in September for [...] "remarkable courage and boldness in attacking enemy machines". He was mentioned in despatches on 11December, and promoted to flight commander the following month.|$|E

And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage. And we cried to the Lord, the God of our fathers, and the Lord heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression. And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders. And He has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. And now, behold, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> {{the first of the}} fruit of the land, that You, O Lord, have given me." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the incident, Chakraverti {{started to}} {{administer}} the Wiccan way of healing and held sessions at her home. She used to advocate different ways of healing the mind and counsel people on their day to day problems suggest solutions for them. Chakraverti used the curative powers of crystals [...] for curing people of backache, pains and spinal injuries. She also started investigating and bringing to light the plight of women in rural Bengal where many were tortured after being labeled as witches. Chakraverti travelled to such villages in Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum and documented such crimes, sometimes teaching women who were emotionally or physically battered by men to recognize and unleash the power within themselves. [...] "Wicca can do that through their empowerment of the goddesses. [...] The village women—simple women accused of witchcraft—would give me stories which were really heartbreaking. It {{opened my eyes to}} how much venom there was in these men. [...] I have tried [...] to bring succor to women branded ‘witches' or ‘dayans' who are still today being molested and killed for what they are believed to practice. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> their cases before the authorities and the press in an attempt to show up the hypocrisy of their persecutors– mostly men– who are trying to denigrate this ancient branch of learning in order to wreak revenge on these women for some very personal motives." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 18th century, Shakespeare {{dominated}} the London stage, while Shakespeare productions turned increasingly into {{the creation of}} star turns for star actors. After the Licensing Act of 1737, one fourth of the plays performed were by Shakespeare, and {{on at least two}} occasions rival London playhouses staged the very same Shakespeare play at the same time (Romeo and Juliet in 1755 and King Lear the next year) and still commanded audiences. This occasion was a striking example of the growing prominence of Shakespeare stars in the theatrical culture, the big attraction being the competition and rivalry between the male leads at Covent Garden and Drury Lane, Spranger Barry and David Garrick. In the 1740s, Charles Macklin, in roles such as Malvolio and Shylock, and David Garrick, who won fame as Richard III in 1741, helped make Shakespeare truly popular. Garrick went on to produce 26 of the plays at Drury Lane Theatre between 1747 and 1776, and he held a great Shakespeare Jubilee at Stratford in 1769. He freely adapted Shakespeare's work, however, saying of Hamlet: [...] "I had sworn I would not leave the stage till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> it forth without the grave-digger's trick, Osrick, & the fencing match." [...] Apparently no incongruity was perceived in having Barry and Garrick, in their late thirties, play adolescent Romeo one season and geriatric King Lear the next. 18th century notions of verisimilitude did not usually require an actor to be physically appropriate for a role, a fact epitomized by a 1744 production of Romeo and Juliet in which Theophilus Cibber, then forty, played Romeo to the Juliet of his teenaged daughter Jennie.|$|E
