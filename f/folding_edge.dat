50|$|Similarly, the 2 × 4 {{rectangle}} {{forms of}} them can be categorized. Each of these forms has exactly one chain associated with it, and each chain yields four different rectangle forms, depending on the position of the edge where it is folded with regard to the middle tile. By concatenating one of the numbers 0, 1, 2 or 3 to the chain's name, depending on whether the number of tiles {{to the right of the}} middle tile before the <b>folding</b> <b>edge,</b> a categorization of the rectangle forms is obtained. The starting position, for example, is rectangle form OUR2.The cube now is rainbow and has silver rings. A game rule for this is one is you can match the silver rings and color squares, which can make it more complicated.A similar classification can also be obtained for the heart-shaped forms of the puzzle, of which 64 exist.|$|E

30|$|A {{modelling}} {{method for}} realistic simulation of foldcores has been elaborated. The influences on mechanical properties of foldcores were investigated and modelling approaches were set up.

30|$|The second failure {{mechanism}} is the rupture of the <b>folding</b> <b>edge.</b> This happens after reaching peak stress {{leading to a}} significant drop in the stress level. The further course of the stress-strain curve is defined by further rupture in the edges, folding of the faces, and compaction.|$|E
30|$|The {{failure modes}} {{observed}} in the experiments are qualitatively the same for compression and shear. The first failure mode is buckling of the cell faces. The main mechanism which drives buckling is plasticization of the <b>folding</b> <b>edge.</b> If this happens, the “clamping” of the faces gets weaker and the critical buckling load of the faces is decreased. Buckling defines the peak stress of the stress-strain curve. At this point, there is no rupture in the material.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{magnetic}} material was {{applied in the}} design of a UHF-RFID metal tag to increase the reading distance. The influence of the electromagnetic properties, especially the electromagnetic loss, of a magnetic substrate on the gain of the tag antenna is discussed by analyzing the reflection and the surface current distribution. As to folded antenna, the loss of energy caused by the magnetic substrate tends to occur in the <b>folding</b> <b>edge</b> of the antenna. Both simulations and experiments indicate that electromagnetic loss markedly reduces the gain rapidly when both the dielectric loss tangent (tan δ) and the magnetic loss tangent (tan δm) are between 0 and 0. 3. The reading distance drops from 3 m to 1. 5 m when the tan δm of the magnetic composite substrate increases from 0. 009 to 0. 023. And tan δm should be less than 0. 1 for the antenna working excellently. The conclusion offers meaningful guidance for future studies of magnetic substrate folded metal tag. 1...|$|E
3000|$|The {{complexity}} of the algorithm is the calculation of the folding cost of each edge. The folding cost of each edge includes two parts: the edge curvature and the area difference. For each edge, the value of both of the two parts should be calculated. Generally, the simplification of the whole model can be realized if the order of all edges is sorted {{by the size of}} all edges according to the folding cost of all edges and the edge folding operation. However, the specific details on the model cannot be preserved and it cannot guarantee the real sense of the model through the simple model can be obtained according the simplification method mentioned above. Therefore, we introduce an interactive method to mark the area that needs to be preserved by a manual way when choosing the <b>folding</b> <b>edge,</b> so as to retain the local features with special significance. In this paper, a random weight is set up for the folding cost of the edge of the reserved region, that is (rand (...) [*]+[*]a). The average folding cost of all edges is added to obtain the edges of the reserved area with a larger folding cost, so that the edges of the feature area can be retained effectively. For the head model collected by Kinect, we can adjust the value of a to control the simplification rate of the reserved area. We introduce a function rand (...) to reduce the effect of noise on the model. When a takes a large value, it can completely preserve the details of the feature area; when a is taken for smaller values, the simplification ratio of the reserved area becomes larger, which cannot achieve the purpose of preserving the details of the model. When a is taken between the two values, the reserved area can be simplified to a suitable level.|$|E

40|$|Using {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) simulations, we {{have investigated the}} kinetics of the graphene <b>edge</b> <b>folding</b> process. The lower limit of the energy barrier {{is found to be}} ~ 380 meV/Å (or about 800 meV per edge atom) and ~ 50 meV/Å (or about 120 meV per <b>edge</b> atom) for <b>folding</b> the <b>edges</b> of intrinsic clean single-layer graphene (SLG) and double-layer graphene (DLG), respectively. However, the <b>edge</b> <b>folding</b> barriers can be substantially reduced by imbalanced chemical adsorption, such as of H atoms, on the two sides of graphene along the edges. Our studies indicate that thermal folding is not feasible at room temperature (RT) for clean SLG and DLG edges and is feasible at high temperature only for DLG <b>edges,</b> whereas chemical <b>folding</b> (with adsorbates) of both SLG and DLG edges can be spontaneous at RT.

40|$|Low energy {{electron}} beam irradiation of {{the edges of}} graphene can lead to rearrangement of the carbon atomic structure. We demonstrate the ability to distinguish intrinsic edges of graphene from edges formed by back folding based upon atomic structure and their susceptibility to sputtering. We examine how the atomic structure of the edges of graphene and few layer graphene sheets influences their stability under {{electron beam}} irradiation at a low electron accelerating voltage of 80 kV using aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We demonstrate that edges of few layer graphene produced by back folding are extremely robust against electron beam induced sputtering as compared to intrinsic edges that are naturally formed. The stability of the <b>folded</b> <b>edges</b> in few layer graphene is shown to increase with increasing number of layers. The higher stability of <b>fold</b> <b>edges</b> {{is related to the}} absence of any unsaturated carbon atoms that can be sputtered by electron beam irradiation. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
