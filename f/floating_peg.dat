Investors fled the market by selling rubles and Russian assets (such as securities), which also put downward pressure on the ruble. This forced the Central Bank to spend its foreign reserves to defend Russia's currency, which in turn further eroded investor confidence and undermined the ruble.

40|$|I {{review the}} case for pegging the {{exchange}} rate by surveying the recent theoretical literature on the choice of exchange rate regimes. This literature suggests that by enhancing the transparency or controllability of monetary policy, pegging {{may be more effective}} in lowering inflation expectations than other targets (such as money growth). However, under certain conditions a peg may be vulnerable to shifts in expectations. A peg also may require greater fiscal restraint by limiting the availability of inflation tax revenue; however, given certain economic distortions, policymakers may find it less costly to adopt expansionary fiscal policies under a peg than under a <b>float.</b> <b>Pegging</b> may stimulate growth by enhancing international trade or investment. However, it may reduce welfare by restricting the ability of policymakers to offset shocks. I also examine how pegging is associated with inflation and output in a sample of developing countries using a new exchange rate classification method. I find that a pegged exchange rate is associated with lower inflation and inflation volatility and with faster growth and similar output volatility. However, the theoretical survey suggests that any inferences should be drawn with care. Foreign exchange rates; Monetary policy; Economic development...|$|R

40|$|Applying a {{stochastic}} dynamic general equilibrium model, {{the performance}} of various simple rules is analyzed in a small open economy context. The aspects that are considered in the analysis include the degree of exchange rate pass-through, trade openness, the policy objective and the source and persistency of shocks. The main objective of this analysis is to investigate if the rule reacts to exchange rate performs better than the basic closed economy rule without exchange rate term. Comparison on the performances is also made between the consumer inflation targeting and domestic inflation targeting rules. The results show that adding the exchange rate term to the policy rule enhances improvement especially in the higher pass-through case. The superior rule is the hybrid rule that reacts to the exchange rate term. CPI inflation targeting rules outperform the domestic inflation targeting rules in term of welfare loss. However, more complicated domestic inflation targeting rules generate lower loss in term of relative loss. On {{the second part of}} this chapter, comparisons on the performances of different exchange rate regimes are made under different source and persistency of shocks.

To answer this question we lay down an open economy model where net lending toward {{the rest of the}} world is constrained by a collateral constraint motivated by limited enforcement.

30|$|Exchange rate is {{the value}} of one country’s {{currency}} into another country’s currency. Different economists argue that a flexible exchange rate is considered to be an important factor for any economy. Moffett et al. (2017) categorized exchange rate into four types. The fixed exchange rate is controlled by the government, which is using country’s reserves for a specific time period. Managed floating exchange rate is the rate based on the demand and supply of specific currencies under certain interaction of the government. Freely floating rate is the exchange rate that fully relies on the force of demand and supply at an open market, without any government interaction. The last type of exchange rate is pegged exchange rate - when home currency is pegged as compared to the currency of another country, and both countries are similar as compared to other countries’ currencies (Moffett et al., 2016; Piana 2001). Nowadays <b>floating</b> and <b>pegged</b> exchange rates are the most popular exchange rates. The floating exchange rate is adopted by the US, Europe, Japan for international trade and the currencies of these countries depend on how the currency trades in foreign exchange markets.|$|R
40|$|Literature {{focusing}} on real exchange rate (RER) misalignment and agricultural trade is inconclusive {{and far from}} convincing. Against this background, the study sought to {{examine the impact of}} RER misalignment on agricultural exports using a panel data set of 20 countries covering the period 1983 - 2006. The equilibrium RER is first estimated using the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares technique and deviations from this equilibrium level are termed RER misalignment. The calculated misalignment measure is then inserted in the export model as a covariate. Pre-estimation checks suggested that export determinants follow a non-stationary process (a random walk with a drift) and are cointegrated. Using the Feasible Generalized Least Squares technique to control for heteroscedasticity and contemporaneous correlation across countries, the study indicates that RER misalignment has a detrimental effect on agricultural exports and the effect is non-linear. This result is robust to estimation by the instrumental variable technique to control for endogeneity and simultaneity of the exchange rate. Against this background, policymakers in these countries should work to eliminate currency misalignment through maintaining clean <b>floats</b> otherwise <b>pegged</b> rates should remain in tandem with the equilibrium level suggested by their long term fundamentals...|$|R

In reviewing the debate between supporters of <b>pegged</b> versus <b>floating</b> rates, there is little analysis found of the implications that these alternative currency arrangements could have on effective demand along Keynesian lines. Interestingly, not only is this latter issue completely ignored, as among neoclassical economists, but even among Post Keynesian economists, there is little focused analysis of the implications of the choice of exchange rate regime on domestic effective demand. After a brief theoretical analysis of the role that <b>floating</b> versus <b>pegged</b> exchange rates would have on the ability of a domestic economy to amortize negative international shocks, the paper suggests that a floating rate would generate less recessionary pressures domestically than would a pegged exchange rate.

50|$|In the Cold War-era United States, {{under the}} Bretton Woods system of fixed {{exchange}} rates, intervention {{was used to}} help maintain the exchange rate within prescribed margins and {{was considered to be}} essential to a central bank’s toolkit. The dissolution of the Bretton Woods system between 1968 and 1973 was largely due to President Richard Nixon’s “temporary” suspension of the dollar’s convertibility to gold in 1971, after the dollar struggled throughout the late 1960s in light of large increases in the price of gold. An attempt to revive the fixed exchange rates failed, and by March 1973 the major currencies began to float against each other.Since the end of the traditional Bretton Woods system, IMF members have been free to choose any form of exchange arrangement they wish (except pegging their currency to gold), such as: allowing the currency to <b>float</b> freely, <b>pegging</b> it to another currency or a basket of currencies, adopting the currency of another country, participating in a currency bloc, or forming part of a monetary union.
