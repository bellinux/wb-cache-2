5|$|In many {{countries}} {{the rate of}} suicide is highest in the middle-aged or elderly.

It is the second most common cause of death in adolescents and <b>in</b> <b>young</b> males is second only to accidental death. <b>In</b> <b>young</b> males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality. In the developing world rates are similar, but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma.

40|$|AbstractAlthough brain {{plasticity}} {{in the form}} of gray matter increases and decreases has been observed in chronic pain, factors determining the patterns of directionality are largely unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that fibromyalgia interacts with age to produce distinct patterns of gray matter differences, specifically increases <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> and decreases <b>in</b> older patients, when compared to age-matched healthy controls. The relative contribution of pain duration was also investigated. Regional gray matter was measured <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> (n= 14, mean age 43, range 29 – 49) and older (n= 14; mean age 55, range 51 – 60) female fibromyalgia patients and matched controls using voxel-based morphometry and cortical thickness analysis of T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance images. To examine their functional significance, gray matter differences were compared with experimental pain sensitivity. Diffusion-tensor imaging was used to assess whether white matter changed in parallel with gray matter, and resting-state fMRI was acquired to examine whether pain-related gray matter changes are associated with altered functional connectivity. Older patients showed exclusively decreased gray matter, accompanied by compromised white matter integrity. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>younger</b> patients showed exclusively gray matter increases, namely in the basal ganglia and insula, which were independent of pain duration. Associated white matter changes <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> patients were compatible with gray matter hypertrophy. In both age groups, structural brain alterations were associated with experimental pain sensitivity, which was increased in older patients but normal <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> patients. Whereas more pronounced gray matter decreases in the posterior cingulate cortex were related to increased experimental pain sensitivity in older patients, insular gray matter increases <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> patients correlated with lower pain sensitivity, possibly indicating the recruitment of endogenous pain modulatory mechanisms. This is supported by the finding that the insula <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> patients showed functional decoupling from an important pain-processing region, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest that brain structure and function shift from being adaptive <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> to being maladaptive in older patients, which might have important treatment implications...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{prediction}} of springback during {{sheet metal forming}} is critically important for automotive and aerospace industries, especially when forming metals with high strength to weight ratio such as Titanium. This requires materials mechanical data during plastic deformation and their dependencies on parameters like strain, strain rate and sample orientation. In this study, springback is quantified experimentally as elastic strain recovery, degradation <b>in</b> <b>Young’s</b> modulus and inelastic strain recovery on unloading in a commercially pure titanium type 50 A (CP-Ti- 50 A). The results show strain rate dependent anisotropic mechanical behaviours and a degradation <b>in</b> <b>Young’s</b> modulus with increased level of plastic deformation. The level of degradation <b>in</b> <b>Young’s</b> modules increases gradually from 13 % for samples parallel to the rolling direction (RD) to 20 % for those perpendicular to the RD. A measurable non-linear strain recovery was also observed on unloading that is orientation dependent. The level of springback is characterised as the sum of elastic recovery and the contributions from both the degradation <b>in</b> <b>Young’s</b> modulus and anelastic strain recovery. It is shown that the Chord modulus can estimate springback with a reasonable accuracy taking into consideration the elastic strain recovery, degradation <b>in</b> <b>Young’s</b> modulus and anelastic strain recovery...|$|R
