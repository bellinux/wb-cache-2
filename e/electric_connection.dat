50|$|The first {{idea for}} feeding {{electricity}} to a train from an external source was by using both rails {{on which a}} train runs, whereby each rail is a conductor for each polarity, and is insulated by the sleepers. This method is used by most scale model trains, however {{it does not work}} so well for large trains as the sleepers are not good insulators. Furthermore, the <b>electric</b> <b>connection</b> requires insulated wheels or insulated axles, but most insulation materials have poor mechanical properties compared with metals used for this purpose, leading to a less stable train vehicle. Nevertheless, it was sometimes used {{at the beginning of the}} development of electric trains. The oldest electric railway in the world, the Volk's Railway in Brighton, England was originally electrified at 50 volts DC using this system (it is now a three rail system). Other railway systems that used it were the Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway and the Ungerer Tramway.|$|E

5000|$|In 1882, Forbes became {{manager of}} the British Electric Light Company, {{manufacturers}} of carbon filaments and arc lamps. He experimented with using carbon for the brushes in electric motors, rather than wire or gauze and in 1885 took out a patent for the Improved Means for Establishing <b>Electric</b> <b>Connection</b> between Surfaces in Relative Motion Applicable to the Collectors of Dynamo Machines. This advocated carbon as a current collector for rotating electrical machines. The invention would prove outstandingly successful {{and it is in}} universal use in electricity generation to this day. He could have become a rich man with such an innovation but he sold his American patent rights to Westinghouse Electric for £2,000. There is no evidence that he received any UK royalties. In the obituary published in the Proceedings of the Philosophical Society, G L Addenbroke wrote that 'Forbes always referred to this work with much modesty, but {{there can be no doubt}} that, he presented to the World an idea of great engineering and commercial value, the importance of which he does not seem to have fully grasped at the time.'

5000|$|In 2002, New Jersey Transit {{finished}} {{construction of}} the Montclair Connection, a small set of tracks along Pine Street in Montclair that connected the Boonton Line and the Montclair Branch. The concept of the Montclair Connection had been originated in 1929 by the Regional Plan Association, to connect the New York & Greenwood Lake with the Montclair Branch. However, the Great Depression, which began in 1929, shelved plans for the connection. Three decades after the Erie's Main Line was realigned out of Passaic (in 1963), New Jersey Transit returned to the plan for the Montclair Connection. The original plan was for a one-track diesel connection, but this grew into a two-track <b>electric</b> <b>connection</b> with extension of catenary wires. After negotiations with the township of Montclair, detailed plans and design began in 1998, and construction began just a year later. When the Montclair Connection was completed in 2002, {{the names of the}} Montclair Branch and Boonton Line were eliminated in favor of the labeling the new whole [...] "the Montclair-Boonton Line". Although no stations along the Montclair Branch (Watsessing, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, and Bay Street) were closed, three stations along the old Greenwood Lake alignment had service end on September 20, 2002: Arlington station, in Kearny, Rowe Street, in Bloomfield, and Benson Street, in Glen Ridge. This alignment was turned over to Norfolk Southern for maintenance. The station building at Benson Street was damaged by a fire in the 1980s and had fallen into disrepair; in May, 2009, it was sold to a private developer and entirely rebuilt. During the Montclair Connection's construction, Bay Street station, which was a single platform with only one track, was rebuilt entirely, with two high-level platforms and new tracks.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} {{attempt to create}} an {{electric}} railway between the metropolis of Chicago and the Fox Valley settlement of Aurora was in late 1891. By this time, passengers in Aurora and Elgin were served by steam engines. Elgin was served by the Milwaukee Road. Geneva and West Chicago served by the Chicago and North Western Railway. St. Charles served by The Chicago and Great Western. And, Aurora was served by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy (CB&Q). However, {{it was thought that}} an electric line would greatly facilitate interurban travel, as there would be no freight trains to slow passenger trains. A group of investors founded the Chicago & Aurora Interurban Railway with a $1 million investment. However, the railroad was unable to secure additional funds; it failed to meet an 1893 construction deadline and effectively ceased operation thereafter. A second attempt came two years later with the Chicago, Elgin & Aurora Electric Railway. Plans called for the railroad to run through Turner (now West Chicago), Wheaton, and Glen Ellyn. Like its predecessor, the railroad failed to acquire the necessary funds for construction. Yet another group incorporated the DuPage Interurban Electric Railway in 1897, but was met with a similar fate.Small electric lines opened in the 1890s that connected the municipalities of the Fox River Valley. A profitable streetcar railway stretched from Aurora north to Carpentersville. The success of this railway inspired investors to again attempt an <b>electric</b> <b>connection</b> to Chicago. A group led by F. Mahler, E. W. Moore, Henry A. Everett, Edward Dickinson, and Elmer Barrett formed independent railway lines that were projected to stretch from Aurora and Elgin to Chicago. These two companies were incorporated on February 24, 1899. The Everett-Moore group was Ohio's largest interurban railroad company and had experience administrating several lines around Cleveland, most notably the Lake Shore Electric Railway. These two companies, the Aurora, Wheaton & Chicago Railway and Elgin & Chicago Railway, were incorporated on February 24, 1899.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{technique}} to identify, by direct electric measurements, the total losses {{at full load}} in synchronous permanent-magnet brushless ac machines is here presented. The proposed procedure can anyway be extended to anisotropic machines. The procedure adopts a back-to-back <b>electric</b> and mechanic <b>connection</b> capable to use a single three-phase power converter to perform a full power test. The coupled motors are driven in speed as an equivalent electric machine at no load. The motor load can be regulated by the physical angular displacement in between the rotors of the two machines, and the converter will control the speed and equalize the current amplitude in the motors. In this condition, the motors exchange active power at the shaft in mechanical form and at the <b>electric</b> <b>connections</b> in electrical form. The active power supplied by the converter in steady state results in the total power dissipated by the two motors. A simple algorithm to identify the current-to-mechanical angle relationship at a given speed is proposed. The measurement technique is simulated and verified using an experimental test bench that adopts two low-power high-torque electric machine...|$|R
