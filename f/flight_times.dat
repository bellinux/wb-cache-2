5|$|There are {{scheduled}} flights from Stornoway, Benbecula and Barra airports both inter-island {{and to the}} mainland. Barra's airport is {{claimed to be the}} only one in the world to have scheduled flights landing on a beach. At high water the runways are under the sea so <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> vary with the tide.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} the shootdown, USAF OPC {{officials}} began including Black Hawk <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> in the daily ATO and included the correct IFF code in the ATO provided to Eagle Flight. OPC officially ended on 31 December 1996. Over the six years of the operation, coalition participants flew a total of 62,000 fixed-wing and rotary-wing sorties. The Black Hawk shootdown was the only serious accident to occur during the operation.|$|E
5|$|However, {{these results}} {{also noted that}} the system might be able to work against longer-ranged missiles. Although these {{traveled}} at very high speeds, their higher altitude trajectories made detection simpler, and the longer <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> provided more time to prepare. Both projects were allowed to continue as research efforts, and were transferred to the US Air Force when that force separated from the Army in 1947. The Air Force faced significant budget constraints and cancelled Thumper in 1949 in order to use its funds to continue their GAPA surface-to-air missile (SAM) efforts. The next year Wizard's funding was also rolled into GAPA to develop a new long-range SAM design, which would emerge a decade later as the CIM-10 Bomarc. ABM research at the Air Force practically, although not officially, ended.|$|E
50|$|For trajectories in {{the plane}} of the moon's orbit with small {{periselenum}} radius (close approach of the Moon), the <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> for a cislunar free-return trajectory is longer than for the circumlunar free-return trajectory with the same periselenum radius. <b>Flight</b> <b>time</b> for a cislunar free-return trajectory decreases with increasing periselenum radius, while <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> for a circumlunar free-return trajectory increases with periselenum radius.|$|R
50|$|The minimum pilot {{experience}} is 1,500 hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> (1200 for Helicopters), 500 hours of cross-country <b>flight</b> <b>time,</b> 100 hours of night <b>flight</b> <b>time,</b> and 75 hours instrument operations time (simulated or actual).

50|$|Flight time: Another {{outstanding}} {{feature of}} this gadget is its <b>flight</b> <b>time.</b> At twenty-seven minutes, this drone surpasses plenty of its competitor’s productions which offer as little as little as eleven minutes of <b>flight</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R
5|$|Meteorologists use the {{location}} {{of some of the}} jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against, which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines. Often, the airlines work to fly 'with' the jet stream for this reason. Dynamic North Atlantic Tracks are one example of how airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate the jet stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a jet stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on <b>flight</b> <b>times.</b> These are a narrow belt.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>times</b> {{appear to}} be {{extremely}} inaccurate. Example: 10-in (300-lb) projectile would have to average only 133ft per second to be in flight for 202 seconds to cover 9,000yds. A more accurate estimate {{will be in the}} range of 30 seconds.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 1974, a {{teletext}} system which was launched to bring news content on television screens using text only was launched. Engineers originally began developing {{such a system}} to bring news to deaf viewers, but the system was expanded. The Ceefax service became much more diverse before it ceased on 23 October 2012: it not only had subtitling for all channels, it also gave information such as weather, <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> and film reviews.|$|E
30|$|The {{subjects}} {{performed a}} maximal jump {{on a platform}} (Multi jump tester; DKH corporation, Japan) that was connected to a computer. They were instructed to conduct as high as possible while placing hands on the lumbar division to eliminate upper-limb effect. The <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> during vertical jump was recorded. From the <b>flight</b> <b>time,</b> the CMJ height was calculated using the following formula. Jump height (cm) =  1 / 8 (<b>flight</b> <b>time)</b> 2  × the gravity constant (= 9.81  m/s 2).|$|R
25|$|Once {{a balloon}} pilot has {{completed}} {{a minimum of}} 3 solo take-offs, accumulated a minimum of 50 hours <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> in untethered balloons and 300 hours total balloon <b>flight</b> <b>time,</b> his licence may then be further endorsed for take-offs in built-up areas.|$|R
50|$|Despite their {{importance}} for aviation safety, European <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> rules {{did not exist}} until recently. It is only since July 2008, that EU Member States must respect the “EU-OPS” Regulation’s Subpart Q (in Annex III) that regulates <b>Flight</b> <b>Time</b> Limitations (FTL) for air crew.|$|R
25|$|Let's {{say that}} for at a certain {{ionization}} voltage, a singly charged hydrogen ion acquires a resulting velocity of Xms−1. A singly charged deuterium ion under the sample conditions would have acquired roughly X/1.41ms−1. If a detector was {{placed at a distance}} of 1m, the ion <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> would be 1/X and 1.41/Xs. Thus, the time of the ion arrival can be used to infer the ion type itself, if the evaporation time is known.|$|E
25|$|Special {{relativity}} also {{predicts that}} two light rays traveling {{in opposite directions}} around a spinning closed path (e.g. a loop) require different <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> {{to come back to}} the moving emitter/receiver (this is a consequence of the independence of the speed of light from the velocity of the source, see above). This effect was actually observed and is called the Sagnac effect. Currently, the consideration of this effect is necessary for many experimental setups and for the correct functioning of GPS.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} of the 1974–75 winter season, Pan Am began {{operating}} a series of short- and medium-haul week-end charter flights from Tegel under contract to a leading West German tour operator. These flights served popular resorts in the Alpine region and the Mediterranean. Following a major reduction in the airline's scheduled activities at Tempelhof as a result of co-ordinating its <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> with British Airways (rather than operating competitive schedules), this helped increase utilisation of the 727s based at that airport, especially on weekends.|$|E
50|$|According to the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA), TW-5 {{accounts}} for roughly 43% of all <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> within the Naval Air Training Command, and 11% of the Navy and Marine Corps' <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> worldwide. Approximately 1,200 students complete flight training with TW-5 annually.|$|R

25|$|The US Army had {{considered}} {{the issue of}} ballistic missile defense (BMD) as early as late in World War II, {{but a series of}} studies on the topic suggested attacking a V-2 rocket would be difficult simply because the flight time was so short that it would leave little time to forward information through command and control networks. Bell Labs pointed out that although longer-range missiles flew much faster, their longer <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> would address the timing issue and their very high altitudes would make long-range detection easier.|$|E
25|$|A graph {{structure}} can {{be extended}} by assigning a weight to each edge of the graph. Graphs with weights, or weighted graphs, are used to represent structures in which pairwise connections have some numerical values. For example, if a graph represents a road network, the weights could represent the length of each road. There may be several weights associated with each edge, including distance (as in the previous example), travel time, or monetary cost. Such weighted graphs are commonly used to program GPS's, and travel-planning search engines that compare <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> and costs.|$|E
25|$|As an {{interceptor}} the Thunderceptor {{was soon}} eclipsed by designs from other companies, {{but like the}} Thunderceptor none of these would go into production. The United States Air Force decided to wait the short time needed to introduce newer and much more capable designs created {{as a part of}} the 1954 interceptor project. The Thunderceptor, like the other interceptor designs of the era, had extremely short <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> on the order of 25 minutes, making them almost useless for protecting an area as large as the United States. The 1954 designs outperformed the XF-91 in speed, range, and loiter time, as well as including the radar and fire-control systems needed for night and all-weather operation. The era of the dedicated day fighter-type interceptor was over.|$|E

5|$|The Douglas DC-7 serving Flight 663 {{made its}} first flight in 1958, and had {{subsequently}} accumulated a total of 18,500 hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time.</b> It was piloted by Captain Frederick R. Carson, 41, who had been employed by Eastern Air Lines for 19 years and who had accumulated 12,607 hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time.</b> His copilot, First Officer Edward R. Dunn, 41, a nine-year veteran of Eastern Airlines, had 8,550 hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time.</b> The <b>flight</b> engineer was Douglas C.

25|$|Accepting {{that the}} {{conflicting}} {{data in the}} typed report's <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> indeed require both northward and southward ground speeds greater than the flight's eighty-five mph airspeed, a Byrd defender posits a westerly-moving anti-cyclone that tailwind-boosted Byrd's ground speed on both outward and inward legs, allowing the distance claimed to be covered in the time claimed (the theory is based on rejecting handwritten sextant data in favor of typewritten alleged dead-reckoning data). This suggestion has been challenged by Dennis Rawlins who adds that the sextant data in the long unavailable original official typewritten report are all expressed to 1", a precision not possible on Navy sextants of 1926 and not the precision of the sextant data in Byrd's diary for 1925 or the 1926 flight, which was normal (half or quarter of a minute of arc).|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{advance in}} analog computing was {{the development of}} the first fire-control systems for long range ship gunlaying. When gunnery ranges increased dramatically in the late 19th century it was no longer a simple matter of calculating the proper aim point, given the <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> of the shells. Various spotters on board the ship would relay distance measures and observations to a central plotting station. There the fire direction teams fed in the location, speed and direction of the ship and its target, as well as various adjustments for Coriolis effect, weather effects on the air, and other adjustments; the computer would then output a firing solution, which would be fed to the turrets for laying. In 1912, British engineer Arthur Pollen developed the first electrically powered mechanical analogue computer (called at the time the Argo Clock). It was used by the Imperial Russian Navy in World War I. The alternative Dreyer Table fire control system was fitted to British capital ships by mid-1916.|$|E
25|$|Røros Airport had a peak {{patronage}} in 1996, {{with more}} than 30,000 passengers. The airport {{was taken over by}} the CAA (later renamed Avinor) in 1998. Starting in 1998 Braathens experienced a period of harsh financial performance. To cut costs, the airline therefore on 2 January 2001 terminated all its unprofitable routes, including to Røros. As a temporary solution, Danish Air Transport flew the route until 31 July, after bidding NOK500,000 per month. A public tender was issued, and Widerøe won the contract to operate from 1 August. Ground handling at the airport was taken over by Røros Flyservice. Patronage {{in the last year of}} Braathens operations was 27,000 passengers. By 2002 this had dropped to about 8,000. The main reasons were more inconvenient <b>flight</b> <b>times,</b> smaller capacity and higher prices, caused by the contractual obligations in the PSO agreement. In particular the number of course and conference passengers dropped to near null.|$|E

Flights on the Comet were about 50 percent faster than on advanced piston-engined aircraft such as the Douglas DC-6 (490mph for the Comet compared to the DC-6's 315mph), and a faster rate of climb further cut <b>flight</b> <b>times.</b> In August 1953 BOAC scheduled nine-stop London to Tokyo flights by Comet for 36 hours, compared to 86 hours and 35 minutes on their Argonaut piston airliner.
