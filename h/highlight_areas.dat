25|$|The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is the Federal {{authority}} for patient safety {{and quality of}} care {{and has been a}} leader in pediatric quality and safety. AHRQ has developed Pediatric Quality Indicators (PedQIs) with the goal to <b>highlight</b> <b>areas</b> of quality concern and to target areas for further analysis. Eighteen pediatric quality indicators are included in the AHRQ quality measure modules; based on expert input, risk adjustment, and other considerations. Thirteen inpatient indicators are recommended for use at the hospital level, and five are designated area indicators. Inpatient indicators are treatments or conditions with the greatest potential of an adverse event for hospitalized children.|$|E
500|$|The {{island has}} been {{structured}} {{to provide a}} fair mix of puzzle solving, exploration, and narrative elements while avoiding a [...] "paradox of choice" [...] by giving the player too much freedom and not knowing where to go next. According to artist Luis Antonio, {{one of the first}} things that Blow wanted the player to see was the mountain to make them aware as this being their ultimate goal. The game initially started the player in an abandoned bunker converted to living space, but as it was originally arranged, the player would exit the bunker not facing the mountain. Though they attempted to move and rotate the bunker space around to meet Blow's goal, it was ultimately scrapped in favor of a simpler space with interior elements that fit with other portions of the game, and which the player would climb out into the external environment with the mountain in full view. This introductory area was also meant to serve as the game's tutorial, helping players to understand fundamental mechanics of one must switch between solving puzzles and exploring the environment to find others, and Thekla spent a great detail of time fine-tuning the details to be clear without verbal explanation. The team's artists worked to support Blow's objective of guiding the player by using contrasts of color and of natural and man-made structures to <b>highlight</b> <b>areas</b> that the player would be drawn towards. Blow wanted the game's art to start off with bright colors and high saturation, to present a type of optimism to the player, while later settings in the game would become less bright. He also wanted to make sure all elements of the game world stood out to avoid visual noise within the game that may have interfered with puzzle solving. To accomplish this, he and his team often had to review the game as if they were a new player to it, and identify what elements they were visually drawn to; this would often identify features of the island they had incorporated early on but were no longer appropriate for the final game.|$|E
