40|$|Groundwater basins {{are usually}} {{separated}} into aquifers that are hydrologically interrelated. This interrelation {{may take the}} form of water movement from one aquifer to another. When differentials in water quality exist, pumping from one of the aquifers can cause water movement that may be associated with degradation of its quality. A management policy that considers this interrelation may be preferable to an independent management of each aquifer. This paper develops a dynamic optimal control model to evaluate joint versus independent management. The optimal <b>joint</b> <b>pumping</b> management, in which two adjacent aquifers of different water qualities are interrelated, is analyzed and compared to independent aquifer pumping, and the situations where joint management is not required are identified. Policy implications are then derived and discussed. Finally, the theoretical model is applied to a case of interrelated aquifers in southern Israel. The empirical model identifies conditions (interest rate, agricultural fresh water supply rainfall recharge, price of surface water, drinking water quality standards) under which a joint policy is preferable. The empirical results confirm the theoretical ones. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1997 groundwater management, groundwater quality, interrelated aquifers,...|$|R

To compromise the problem of pressure overshoot and dynamic characteristics with the conventional PID control method, and to prevent wheels from mistakenly locking which resulting in decreased brake efficiency, a fuzzy PID pressure controller is designed. Through simulation test, the rated pressure step response time {{of the system is}} about 0. 35 s with 2 percent overshoot and 0. 05 MPa steady-state error, the system- 3 dB bandwidth is 8 Hz. It is demonstrated that the structure is feasible, the controller design is reasonable, and the EHA can satisfy the requirements of the aircraft braking system in static and dynamic performance.

40|$|Land {{subsidence}} due to groundwater pumping is a {{major environmental}} problem in flat alluvial coastal plains. In the eastern Po River plain, Italy, CADF, a local Water Distribution Company serving a 1300 km 2 territory, is producing water from a well-field established since the 1930 s at the Ro Ferrarese village. The 107 m 3 /year current pumping rate is withdrawn from a 20 - 60 m deep confined aquifer. In order {{to cope with the}} increasing water demand, CADF has planned in 2006 the development a new field 5 km east of the old one. The new field is made of 9 wells located in the Po River overbank and produces from the same shallow aquifer. To provide the establishment authorization, the Regional Environmental Agency has required the evaluation of the environmental impact in terms of land subsidence and possible structural instability of the Po River embankment (that is more than 10 m above the surrounding farmland) due to differential displacements. In order to comply with the previous requirements, a modeling study supported by in situ investigations has been performed. Advanced three-dimensional finite element flow and poroelastic models have been implemented with a realistically detailed lithostratigraphic sequence obtained by integrating a number of borehole stratigraphies and 2 D electrical resistivity tomographies. The models have been calibrated against the outcome of available pumping tests and records of land settlement taken at the old wellfield. A "best fit" scenario along with other three plausible scenarios have been simulated in order to account for the major data uncertainties of the hydrologic parameters, i. e. hydraulic conductivity of the pumped aquifer and sand and clay vertical compressibility. The models have been used to simulate the anthropogenic land subsidence from the establishment of the Ro well-field (1930) to the present time (2005), and to predict the expected occurrence up to 2035. The results show a cumulative maximum land settlement of 15 ± 4 cm at the Ro well-field over the simulated 105 years. A value of 6 ± 2 cm of land subsidence may be expected from 2005 to 2035 at the new well-field. The displacement gradient is of the order of 10 - 4 - 10 - 5. Hence, it may be concluded that the activation of the new well-field and the <b>joint</b> groundwater <b>pumping</b> from the old one should not generate any instability of the Po River embankment...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of pumps {{depending on the}} state in chemical and process plants and in powerstations is essential for plant monitoring and guaranteeing plant safety. Among the pumps, hermetically sealed pumps for puming dangerous, toxic or explosive fluids guarantee particularly great safety for plants. On the other hand, they are nearly inaccessible from outside, so the inside parameters are also nearly inaccessible, without damaging the hermetic principle. Therefore, in this investigation, the {{diagnosis of}} these pumps was examined by means of vibration analysis of the <b>joint</b> or coupled-up <b>pump</b> and motor housings, together with the internal main parameters, the flow of coolant and the temperatures and pressures of the coolant flow. For example, from the vibration signals of the pump housing, the pump speed and motor slip can be determined with certainty. The results {{can also be used}} for the diagnosis of conventional pumps with coupled asynchronous motors.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} identity and learning in cross-functional teams (CFTs). It focuses on how aspects of members’ identity affect {{the process of developing}} cross-functional (CF) teamwork and examines how emerging identity issues can account for different outcomes in the learning of CF teamwork. More specifically, the research focuses on what these emerging identity issues entail in terms of underlying and action-orienting meanings, and on how this can favour or hinder the learning of CF teamwork. This study argues that the collective process of learning how to operate as a CFT is influenced by relational, social and contextual issues. Theoretically, the thesis offers a number of contributions. A critique of current approaches to CF teamwork is provided, where a review of the relevant literature reveals a largely functionalist stance, with a main focus on researching the factors contributing to the effectiveness of CFTs. The thesis advocates an alternative interpretative stance to investigating the role of identity in learning cross-functionality, offering the possibility of an interpretation which is situated in the specific context and which is open to the understanding of emerging, possibly revealing issues. Furthermore, this thesis argues that, within this interpretative approach, by studying what favours or hinders the learning of CF teamwork, {{it may be possible to}} deepen our understanding of CFT dynamics. The learning of CF teaming has also been identified as one of the gaps in the relevant literature. The situated learning theory (SLT) and community of practice approach (Lave and Wenger, 1991) is thus adopted as an appropriate theoretical framework for researching the learning of CF teamwork, which is understood here as a practice. SLT suggests that individual learning should be thought of as emergent, involving opportunities to participate in the practices of the community as well as the development of a social identity which provides a sense of belonging and commitment (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998). Theoretically and empirically justified, the new insight and main focus of this research consists of the consideration of events occurring not only within a CFT, but also beyond and before it, which are able to shape the identities involved, at different levels. This is beneficial, since it explains the different ways of engaging with the practice of cross-functionality and consequently the different learning outcomes. Within the situated learning literature there is surprisingly little explicit reference to theories of identity construction (Handley et al., 2006). A conceptualization of identity is thus derived by tapping into theories of identity which have not yet been developed in SLT, but which represent a useful theoretical development in this arena of studies. These gaps and issues were addressed by conducting qualitative research in a medium-sized Italian firm manufacturing car parts. In particular, an ethnographic study was carried out, using complementary methods such as direct observation, semi-structured interviews and documentary data. Investigations concerned two skilled workers’ CFTs devoted to developing the product ranges respectively of <b>joints</b> and <b>pumps,</b> and a managers’ CFT whose task was to design a new pump for a particular client. Three identities emerged as especially significant for the meanings they entailed and for the influence they proved to have on learning this practice: the sense of identity derived from relationships characterized by paternalism with significant others at work (i. e. the leaders), and the sense of identity derived from being a worker from Brescia, the specific geographical location of the study, and from being a worker or a manager, understood in terms of occupation and social class...|$|R
40|$|European {{foundries}} {{master the}} art of mass-producing cast iron pipes in the early 1800 s (Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute 2006 : 1). Slow sand filters, buried pipes with bell and spigot <b>joints,</b> steam powered <b>pumps,</b> and water towers make for a universally applicable technology for urban water supply. Piped water systems enjoy a long service life and modest operational costs but require high initial outlays of capital. Also, pipe laying raises complex right-of-way issues (Meidinger 1980). Around 1850 {{it is by no}} means certain that buried water infrastructure can hold its own against contending modes of urban water supply. Cost-wise it certainly cannot compete against local water sources such as shallow wells and canals. By 1900 however, piped supply is establishing itself as the dominant source of domestic water in European and North American cities. Seventy years on, piped networks are the sole source of urban domestic water. i A parallel network of buried sewers carries the large volumes of piped water away from urban homes. How do piped water and waste technologies come to dominate domestic water regimes in European and North American cities? An early literature attributed the rise of urban piped water and sewerage to an unfolding understanding of the nature of waterborne disease (Baker 1949). Subsequent investigations by urban environment historians show that public health concerns play a minor role only in early 19 th century decisions to embrace piped water infrastructure (Juuti and Katko, 2005; Millward 2004; Tarr et al. 1984; Troesken and Geddes 2003). The introduction of piped water supply, in enabling householders to install waterborne waste removal systems, may arguably even have aggravated waterborne disease (Tarr et al. 1984). ii Urban environment historians place the rise of piped water against a background of rapid industrial and population growth in European and North American towns. The environmental stress accompanying 19 th century industrialisation triggers a crisis of urban water and waste that literally overwhelms city administrations (Tarr 1996). National and state governments respond by, late in the 19 th century, enacting laws and regulations that place responsibility for solving the crisis in urban public health on the shoulders of municipal administrations. City administrations respond by committing to large-scale and centralised technologies for handling urban water and waste. Much of the research published in English focuses, rather unsurprisingly, on the United States and Britain. This article attempts to complements our understanding of the emergence of the piped water paradigm with evidence from the European continent. Here, as elsewhere, waterworks are pioneered by private entrepreneurs under municipal concession contracts. Early concessions confer a limited degree of market power to concessionaires. In most cases the concession amounts to no more than a permit to bury piped systems in municipal soil. Gradually waterworks concessions grow in scope. The public health legislation underlying these arrangements provides concessionaires with a virtual monopoly on domestic water supply in the city. The next two sections sketch the development of piped water and sewerage technologies and the increasing involvement of municipalities with piped supply. Section four turns to the central argument. I show how the deepening commitment of municipal administrations to piped water occasions a shift in the legal brief under which concessionaires operate and the consequences this has for domestic water provision in the city. The final section summarises key points...|$|R
