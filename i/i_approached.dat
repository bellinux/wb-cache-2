However, in the Tirol, {{an integral part of}} Austria which was mostly German-speaking, the southern part, the province of Trento, was exclusively Italian-speaking. The clergy of Bologna was not totally free from nationalistic fervor either. Therefore, in his capacity as Archbishop, on the outbreak of World War I, della Chiesa made a speech on the Church's position and duties, emphasizing the need for neutrality, promoting peace and the easing of suffering.|$|E

500|$|In {{the lead}} up to Christmas 1914, there were several peace initiatives. The Open Christmas Letter was a public message for peace {{addressed}} [...] "To the Women of Germany and Austria", signed {{by a group of}} 101 British women suffragettes at the end of 1914 as the first Christmas of World War <b>I</b> <b>approached.</b> Pope Benedict XV, on 7 December 1914, had begged for an official truce between the warring governments.

The threat of the Hittites prompted Mitanni's king to sue for peace: Artatama <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> Amenhotep II for an alliance and long negotiations started. The talks lasted until after Amenhotep's death, when his successor Thutmose IV (...) finally sealed a treaty that divided the Levant between the two powers. Qatna and the states north of it, such as Nuhašše, fell into the sphere of Mitanni. Despite its reduced status, Qatna still controlled the Lebanon Mountains [...] in the 14th century BC.|$|E
500|$|Playing {{the harp}} (clarsach) was {{especially}} popular with medieval Scots – {{half a century}} after Gerald's writing, King Alexander III kept a royal harpist at his court. Of the three medieval harps that survive, two come from Scotland (Perthshire), and one from Ireland. Singers also had a royal function. For instance, when the king of Scotland passed through the territory of Strathearn, it was the custom that he be greeted by seven female singers, who would sing to him. When Edward <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> the borders of Strathearn {{in the summer of}} 1296, he was met by these seven women, [...] "who accompanied the King on the road between Gask and Ogilvie, singing to him, as was the custom in the time of the late Alexander kings of Scots".|$|E

500|$|Pyramid Head {{makes an}} {{appearance}} in the 2006 film adaptation of Silent Hill as [...] "Red Pyramid", and is portrayed by Roberto Campanella. In the film, the psyches of the female characters shaped the character's physical appearance. Gans claimed that replicating the character's head exactly and having the actor move while wearing {{it proved to be}} impractical; he noted that, despite the name, Pyramid Head actually wore [...] "a basin" [...] instead of a triangle-shaped head. Red Pyramid's sword and head were constructed out of lightweight material painted to appear heavy. For the role, Campanella wore a [...] "five-part prosthetic"; it took two-and-a-half to three hours to get him into costume and make-up. His boots had a hidden [...] sole which made him just under [...] tall. Patrick Tatopoulos, who worked on the make-up effects and monsters, enjoyed the project of designing the character. According to him, Red Pyramid serves {{as a symbol of the}} town's darkness and harbinger of its changed character. Gans considered the monsters of the film [...] "a mockery of human beings", and commented: [...] "The real monsters are the people, the cultists who tortured Alessa. When <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> the film, I knew that it was impossible to represent the monsters as simply beasts that jump on you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, better {{opportunities}} for work {{were not the}} only incentive to move; family played a major role and the dispersion of Italians globally.

At {{the end of}} the 1907–08 season, the number of teams in the first division was increased from 10 to 12 clubs, with Promotion champion RC de Gand and runner-up ESC Forest being promoted while no first division was relegated.

[...] His determination to get back into the Test squad was not deterred by not being selected for the first three Tests, but he then had an opportunity to impress the then England captain, David Gower.

Published in January 1915 in Jus Suffragii, the journal of the IWSA, the Open Christmas Letter was answered two months later by a group of 155 prominent German and Austrian women who were pacifists. The exchange of letters between women of nations at war helped promote the aims of peace, and helped prevent the fracturing of the unity which lay in the common goal they shared: suffrage for women.|$|E
