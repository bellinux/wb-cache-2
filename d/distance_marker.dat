Historically, milestones were used, but since the early 20th century they fell into disuse. However, for administrative and maintenance purposes, <b>distance</b> <b>marker</b> posts and driver location signs have been erected on motorways and certain dual carriageways.The numbers on <b>distance</b> <b>marker</b> posts are embedded into emergency roadside telephone numbers and are used by the emergency services to pinpoint incidents.The advent of the mobile phone meant that location information embedded into motorway emergency telephone systems was not being accessed by drivers and since 2007 driver location signs have been erected on many motorways. These contain important information about the location and carriageway direction, and the reference number should be quoted in full when contacting the emergency services.|$|E
50|$|Since {{at least}} 1980, {{motorways}} have had <b>distance</b> <b>marker</b> posts installed at 100 metre intervals alongside the hard shoulder. These posts {{are used to}} help pinpoint road locations for maintenance and emergency purposes, and also show the direction to the nearest emergency roadside telephone. The numbers on the posts, for which no units are given, are derived from the distance, in kilometres, of the post from a reference datum location such as a city centre, an administrative boundary or some other feature. On the M25 for example, distances are referenced to a point near Junction 31 even though {{the section of the}} ring road between Junction 31 (post 186.6) and Junction 1a (post 5.7) is the A282, not the M25.On motorways <b>distance</b> <b>marker</b> posts also bear an arrow pointing towards the location of the nearest emergency telephone.|$|E

50|$|In the UK, driver {{location}} {{signs are}} placed every 100 m along {{each side of}} British motorways, and along some other major roads. They were first introduced in 2003, and they complement <b>distance</b> <b>marker</b> posts (small roadside posts used for road maintenance and administrative purposes). Both types of sign display a unique location number. The number, although given without units, is the distance in kilometres from a designated datum location for the road.|$|E
5000|$|The main thoroughfare, High Road Leytonstone, {{running the}} length of Leytonstone to Stratford, is an ancient pathway dating to pre-Roman times.

50|$|Because Totsuka-juku was {{approximately}} one day's journey from Nihonbashi, {{it was a}} very common resting place for travelers {{at the start of the}} journey and the largest post station after Odawara-juku. Because of its size, there were two honjin in the post station as well, one belonging to the Sawabe family (澤辺) and the other belonging to the Uchida family (内田). Another reason for Totsuka-juku being so large was that it was also the intersection of Kamakura Kaidō and the Atsugi Kaidō. A <b>distance</b> <b>marker</b> can now be found in both Shinano-chō and Totsuka-chō.|$|E
