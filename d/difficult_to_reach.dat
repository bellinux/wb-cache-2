5|$|After {{retiring}} from football, Gatski was a scout for the Boston Patriots {{for two years}} before becoming head football coach and athletic director at the West Virginia Industrial School for Boys, a correctional facility for young offenders in Pruntytown, West Virginia. He worked there until the school shut down in 1982. He hunted and fished in retirement, and was often <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach.</b> He lived on a mountain in West Virginia and did not have a telephone for many years.|$|E

5|$|Cave 10 {{is located}} {{at a higher level}} than cave 9 and is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> as its front is broken. An open veranda with a broken ceiling and floor leads to a middle room through a grooved broken door, which has windows on either side. The right wall of the hall has a recess with a seat. A cell {{to the left of the}} room has a seat in a recess. A door from the cell leads to a {{half-cell}} which has a recess and seat. Traces of painting are seen on the ceiling. Outside the veranda to the left is a cistern.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> down to bite in the feet of a rival, making {{it more likely that}} the bite marks were made in a carcass. As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism. Other evidence for cannibalism has been unearthed.|$|E
5|$|About half {{of those}} {{who lost their lives}} on the Wall were killed in the first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E

50|$|The G8 summit {{historically}} {{serves to}} draw international attention <b>to</b> <b>difficult</b> problems and <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> general agreements, not necessarily {{as a place}} to hammer out detailed solutions.

50|$|It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{directly}} <b>reach</b> {{the mill}} due to it being {{located within the}} private garden of Lambridge Mill Cottage; unfortunately no public rights of way run nearby; however, {{it is possible to}} get relatively close to the structure via the Waxham New Cut, the mill is well beyond the limit of navigation, therefore only small non-motorised craft may venture this far up the river.|$|R
5|$|Isolated and <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach,</b> the {{monument}} initially attracted few visitors, by 1920 only 1,800 for the year. The situation changed markedly when {{large numbers of}} Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds. One highway connected Grants Pass with the California coast at Crescent City. Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, led from the Grants Pass – Crescent City highway to the cave. Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, a booster group from Grants Pass that dressed in animal skins, posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote {{the monument}}. By 1928, {{the number of visitors}} to the cave had risen to about 24,000 a year.|$|E
5|$|The six {{sites with}} {{particularly}} outstanding architecture or sculpture are Chichen Itza, Palenque, Uxmal, and Yaxchilan in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala and Copán in Honduras. Other important, but <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach,</b> sites include Calakmul and El Mirador. The principal {{sites in the}} Puuc region, after Uxmal, are Kabah, Labna, and Sayil. In {{the east of the}} Yucatán Peninsula are Coba and the small site of Tulum. The Río Bec sites of the base of the peninsula include Becan, Chicanná, Kohunlich, and Xpuhil. The most noteworthy sites in Chiapas, other than Palenque and Yaxchilan, are Bonampak and Toniná. In the Guatemalan Highlands are Iximche, Kaminaljuyu, Mixco Viejo, and Q'umarkaj (also known as Utatlán). In the northern Petén lowlands of Guatemala there are many sites, though apart from Tikal access is generally difficult. Some of the Petén sites are Dos Pilas, Seibal, and Uaxactún. Important sites in Belize include Altun Ha, Caracol, and Xunantunich.|$|E

50|$|France and Italy both emerged victorious {{from their}} semi-finals against <b>difficult</b> {{opposition}} <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the final. France beat Portugal 2-1 after extra-time; Nuno Gomes gave Portugal {{the lead in}} the 19th minute, which they held until just after half-time, when Thierry Henry equalised.

25|$|Graphite-caused {{positive}} reactivity feedback - When graphite heats up, {{it increases}} U-233 fission, causing an undesirable positive feedback. The LFTR design must avoid certain combinations of graphite {{and salt and}} certain core geometries. If this problem is addressed by employing adequate graphite and thus a well-thermalized spectrum, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> break-even breeding. The alternative of using little or no graphite results in a faster neutron spectrum. This requires a large fissile inventory and radiation damage increases.|$|E
25|$|Teeth {{cleaning}} (also {{known as}} prophylaxis, literally a preventive {{treatment of a}} disease) is a procedure {{for the removal of}} tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing, especially in areas that are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> in routine toothbrushing. It is often done by a dental hygienist. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling and tooth polishing and debridement if too much tartar has accumulated. This involves the use of various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from the teeth.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{meaningful}} alternatives, such as affordable schools and quality education, according to ILO, is another major factor driving children to harmful labour. Children work {{because they have}} nothing better to do. Many communities, particularly rural areas where between 60–70% of child labour is prevalent, do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach,</b> unaffordable or {{the quality of education}} is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worth it.|$|E

50|$|The {{time taken}} <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> {{a high level}} of {{proficiency}} can vary depending on the language learned. In the case of native English speakers, some estimates were provided by the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) of the U.S. Department of State, which compiled approximate learning expectations for a number of languages for their professional staff (native English speakers who generally already know other languages). Of the 63 languages analyzed, the five most <b>difficult</b> languages <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> proficiency in speaking and reading, requiring 88 weeks (2200 class hours), are Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean. The Foreign Service Institute and the National Virtual Translation Center both note that Japanese is typically more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> learn than other languages in this group.|$|R
