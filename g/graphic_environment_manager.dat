50|$|<b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> (GEM) was an {{operating}} environment created by Digital Research (DRI) {{for use with}} the DOS operating system on Intel 8088 and Motorola 68000 microprocessors.|$|R

50|$|Although FreeMiNT {{can use the}} {{graphical}} {{user interface}} of the TOS (the <b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> Application <b>Environment</b> Services (AES)), it is better served with an enhanced AES which can use its multitasking abilities.|$|R
25|$|After {{seeing a}} {{demonstration}} of the Apple Lisa, Kildall oversaw the creation of DRI's own graphical user interface, called <b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> (GEM) Desktop. Novell acquired DRI in 1991 in a deal that netted millions for Kildall.|$|R
500|$|The initial {{version of}} PerForm was {{designed}} for the <b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> (better known as [...] "GEM"), a DOS-based windowing system. Later versions of this program, known as PerForm PRO, were designed to work under Windows 3.1 and subsequent Windows operating systems. PerForm PRO 3.0 included integration with Delrina's own WinFax software, and included a range of automation tools.|$|R
50|$|Ventura Publisher was {{the first}} popular desktop {{publishing}} package for IBM PC compatible computers running the GEM extension to the DOS operating system. The software was originally developed by Ventura Software, a small software company founded by John Meyer, Don Heiskel, and Lee Jay Lorenzen, all of whom met while working at Digital Research. It ran under an included run-time copy of Digital Research, Inc.'s <b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> (GEM).|$|R
5000|$|At {{the same}} time Atari was looking to enhance the TOS with {{multitasking}} abilities, they found, that MiNT could fulfill the job and hired Eric Smith. MiNT was adopted as an official alternative kernel {{with the release of}} the Atari Falcon, slightly altering the MiNT acronym into [...] "MiNT is Now TOS". Atari bundled MiNT with a multitasking version of the <b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> (GEM) under the name MultiTOS as a floppy disk based installer.|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to provide a more}} {{user-friendly}} environment, numerous software manufacturers wrote file management programs that provided users with menu- and/or icon-based interfaces. Microsoft Windows is a notable example, eventually resulting in Microsoft Windows 9x becoming a self-contained program loader, and replacing DOS as the most-used PC-compatible program loader. Text user interface programs included Norton Commander, DOS Navigator, Volkov Commander, Quarterdesk DESQview, and Sidekick. Graphical user interface programs included Digital Research's <b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> (originally written for CP/M) and GEOS.|$|R
50|$|Digital Research (DRI) {{created the}} <b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> (GEM) as an add-on program for {{personal}} computers. GEM {{was developed to}} work with existing CP/M and DOS operating systems on business computers such as IBM PC compatibles. It was developed from DRI software, known as GSX, designed by a former PARC employee. The similarity to the Macintosh desktop led to a copyright lawsuit from Apple Computer, and a settlement which involved some changes to GEM. This {{was to be the}} first of a series of 'look and feel' lawsuits related to GUI design in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The list of {{products}} that were inspired or influenced by the user interface of the Star, {{and to a lesser}} extent the Alto, include the Apple Lisa and Macintosh, <b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> (GEM) from Digital Research (the CP/M company), Microsoft Windows, Atari ST, BTRON from TRON Project, Commodore's Amiga, Elixir Desktop, Metaphor Computer Systems, Interleaf, IBM OS/2, OPEN LOOK (co-developed by Xerox), SunView, KDE, Ventura Publisher, and NEXTSTEP. Adobe Systems PostScript was based on Interpress. Ethernet was further refined by 3Com, and has become a de facto standard networking protocol.|$|R
50|$|WordPerfect ST {{differs from}} the DOS version most notably in speed and number of windows a user can open. On the Atari ST version, a user can open up to four windows (compared to DOS' two) and the {{application}} runs {{three to five times}} faster than the DOS version (depending on which update or patch is installed). This was possible because WordPerfect for the Atari ST was designed from the ground up and was optimized for the Motorola 68000 processor as well as Atari's GEM (<b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager)</b> operating system.|$|R
500|$|Prevailing in {{an early}} {{copyright}} infringement suit in the mid-1980s, Apple forced Digital Research to alter basic components in Digital Research's <b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> ("GEM"), almost a direct copy of the Macintosh's graphical user interface (GUI), or [...] "look and feel". Features Digital Research removed from GEM {{as a result of}} the lawsuit included disk drive icons on the desktop, movable and resizable windows in the file manager, shading in the title bars, and window open/close animations. In addition, visual elements including the scrollbar thumbs and the window close button were changed to be less similar to those in the Mac GUI.|$|R
5000|$|The Data East {{case is a}} {{significant}} judgment because [...] "it {{is the first time}} in the computer industry that a look-and-feel lawsuit has been decided in favor of the defendant". The litigation of copyright infringements based on look-and-feel similarities was fairly new, and previous cases had been settled out of the court, to the benefit of the presumed copyright holder. For example, in 1985, Digital Research had to change some aspects of their <b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> (GEM) product and agreed to pay Apple a financial compensation as part of a settlement that would keep them out of court.|$|R

50|$|With {{the loss}} of the IBM deal, Gary and Dorothy found {{themselves}} under pressure to bring in more experienced management, and Gary's influence over the company waned. He worked in various experimental and research projects, such as a version of CP/M with multitasking (MP/M) and an implementation of the Logo programming language. He hoped that Logo, an educational dialect of LISP, would supplant BASIC in education, but it did not.After seeing a demonstration of the Apple Lisa, Kildall oversaw the creation of DRI's own graphical user interface, called <b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> (GEM) Desktop. Novell acquired DRI in 1991 in a deal that netted millions for Kildall.|$|R
5000|$|From {{early in}} Windows' history Gates {{viewed it as}} Microsoft's future. He told InfoWorld {{magazine}} in April 1984 that [...] "Our strategies and energies as a company are totally committed to Windows, {{in the same way}} that we're committed to operating-system kernels like MS-DOS and Xenix. We're also saying that only applications that take advantage of Windows will be competitive in the long run." [...] IBM was notably absent from Microsoft's announcement, and by late 1984 the press reported a [...] "War of the Windows" [...] between Windows, IBM's TopView, and Digital Research's <b>Graphics</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Manager</b> (GEM). Microsoft had promised in November 1983 to ship Windows by April 1984, but subsequently denied that it had announced a release date, and predicted that Windows would ship by June 1985. Deemphasizing multitasking, the company stated that Windows' purpose, unlike that of TopView, was to [...] "turn the computer into a graphics-rich environment" [...] while using less memory.|$|R
