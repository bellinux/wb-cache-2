50|$|Because {{they use}} shared resources, {{concurrent}} systems in general require {{the inclusion of}} some kind of arbiter somewhere in their implementation (often in the underlying hardware), to control access to those resources. The use of arbiters introduces the possibility of indeterminacy in concurrent computation which has major <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>practice</b> including correctness and performance. For example, arbitration introduces unbounded nondeterminism which raises issues with model checking because it causes explosion in the state space and can even cause models to have an infinite number of states.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{views the}} {{enhancement}} of students' self-concepts as {{a high priority for}} school psychologists. It focuses on the theory, research and <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>practice</b> regarding academic self-concept. Four models of the structure of self-concept and their resulting <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>practice</b> are reviewed: (1) nomothetic; (2) taxonomic; (3) compensatory; and (4) hierarchical. Marsh's (1987) Big- Fish- Little-Pond effect on academic self-concept is discussed, with implications for the possible impact on academic self-concept of placement into remedial or accelerated programs, movement between varying types of school systems, or the possibility that parents who place their children into highly competitive educational programs may actually achieve exactly the reverse of their intended goals. The document concludes with a brief overview of recent research on academic self-concept underway at the University of Maryland, stressing the <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>practice</b> resulting therefrom.
