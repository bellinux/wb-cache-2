5|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>cars</b> and plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|BP in its 2017 Energy Outlook {{forecasts}} {{that the}} number of plug-in <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> will rise from 1.2 million in 2015 to around 100 million by 2035 representing about 5.5% of the global fleet of passenger cars. Around 25% of these plug-in electric vehicles will be plug-in hybrids and 75% will be pure battery <b>electric</b> <b>cars.</b> The oil company also projects that automotive fuel demand for use in cars will continue to rise, despite efficiency improvements in conventional internal combustion engines and increased plug-in car adoption due to growth in demand for car travel from the growing middle class in emerging economies.|$|E

5|$|In August 2012, and as {{a result}} of Europe's debt crisis that {{resulted}} in PSA Peugeot Citroën (PSA) Group slow sales, Mitsubishi Motors announced the suspension of its supply of the i-MiEV electric vehicle to PSA, although the period for supplying vehicles under their contract as part of original equipment manufacturer agreements has not yet ended. The suspension is part of the decision of several Japanese manufacturers to suspend their joint development projects and contracts with several European partners. By early August 2012, PSA had sold a total of 6,575 Peugeot iOns and Citroën C-Zeros since their launch in Europe in 2010, while Mitsubishi had assembled almost 11,000 <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> destined to PSA, leaving the French carmaker with more than 4,400 <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> in unsold inventory.

5|$|In {{order to}} avoid its {{dependence}} on rare-earth minerals, Toyota Motor Corporation announced in January 2011 that it is developing an alternative motor for future hybrid and <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> that does not need rare-earth materials. Toyota engineers in Japan and the U.S. are developing an induction motor that is lighter and more efficient than the magnet-type motor used in the Prius, which uses two rare earths in its motor magnets. Other popular hybrids and plug-in <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> in the market that use these rare-earth elements are the Nissan Leaf, the Chevrolet Volt and Honda Insight. For its second generation RAV4 EV due in 2012, Toyota is using an induction motor supplied by Tesla Motors that does not require rare-earth materials.

40|$|The rising {{number of}} {{vehicles}} {{over the years has}} driven the increase of air pollution and fuel consumption. One of the solutions to overcome this problem is using hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>car</b> because it is environmentally friendly and efficient in fuel consumption. LIPI has conducted <b>electric</b> <b>car</b> research since 1997, but there were so many problems in its development that <b>electric</b> <b>car</b> can not be developed into a national industry scale. Therefore, it is important to conduct a study that maps the problems and finds the solutions to prevent the same failure of <b>electric</b> <b>car</b> commercialization process from happening to hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>car.</b> This study was done by collecting and analyzing the primary and secondary data through interviews, discussing <b>electric</b> hybrid <b>car</b> with stakeholders, and examining earlier study results and regulations. Based on this study, several policies to support sustainability research of hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>car</b> were proposed. Some recommendations were the making of national roadmap and regulation for the usage of hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>car</b> on the road. For policy makers at LIPI, a research focus, research coordination, and pre-commercialization program were recommended.  </p...|$|R

New light-duty plug-in registrations totaled 45,492 plug-in cars and vans registered, up 32% from 2015, and making Norway the top selling plug-in country market in Europe in 2016, surpassing the Netherlands, Europe’s top market in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Research {{published}} by Bloomberg New Energy Finance in February 2016 predicts that as battery prices continue to fall, light-duty electric vehicles without government subsidies {{will be as}} affordable as internal combustion engine cars in most countries by the mid-2020s. As a result, the study forecasts that annual sales of electric vehicles will hit 41 million by 2040, representing 35% of new light duty vehicle sales. In another scenario the study considers that if new carsharing services are successful, together with the adoption of autonomous cars, they could boost electric-vehicle market share to 50% of new car saless by 2040. On the other hand, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in its 2015 World Oil Outlook projected that the market share of battery <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> and fuel cell cars will remain below 1% in 2040, while the share of hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> is projected to grow from 1% in 2013 to 14% in 2040.|$|E
