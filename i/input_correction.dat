40|$|Road {{traffic is}} {{important}} to everybody in the world. People travel and commute everyday. For those who travel by cars (or other types of road vehicles), traffic congestion is a daily experience. One essential goal of traffic researchers is to reduce traffic congestion and to improve the whole traffic system operation and the environment. To achieve this goal, we have to first understand prevailing traffic situations, then perform pro-active traffic control and management. The estimation of traffic states in the past, {{in the present and}} in the future {{plays an important role in}} traffic management and control systems. This thesis focuses on the development of traffic state estimation approaches, which provide such traffic state information. In road networks, traffic states refer to typical quantities, such as travel times, traffic speeds, traffic flow and density. These quantities reflect the traffic conditions. Based on these data, we are able to find out when a traffic jam starts, or where a traffic accident occurs. However, it is not feasible to get the full picture of traffic states from the current monitoring systems. Due to cost and technical constraints, we can only obtain spatially and temporally discretised traffic data. These traffic data are collected mainly from point-based sensors, such as inductive loops, radars, and cameras. Alternatively, traffic information might be observed by probe vehicles with a selected penetration rate. In all cases, the detected data usually contain errors and noise, which might hinder further analyses. Based on these constraints, this thesis aims to develop a traffic state estimation procedure to solve the foregoing problems and to provide accurate and complete traffic state information. In this procedure, both traffic flow models and the available observation data are used to estimate the most probable traffic states within a data-assimilation framework. Our approach is formulated using a moving observer perspective, resulting in a Lagrangian formulation of traffic state estimation. In the Lagrangian coordinate system, coordinates move with the vehicles. The Lagrangian formulated first-order traffic flow model is applied to describe the evolution of traffic state variables. The proposed Lagrangian formulation of traffic state estimation offers both theoretical and computational advantages over the conventional Eulerian formation. Moreover, this approach can capture the dynamics of multiple vehicle classes by implementing a multi-class traffic flow model. In this thesis, data pre-processing methods are also developed to improve the quality of the observation inputs. Both Eulerian and Lagrangian sensing data are incorporated into the state estimation. The online technique, known as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), is applied for data assimilation: this combines traffic model prediction with observation <b>input</b> <b>correction.</b> Importantly, the Lagrangian concept is not restricted to the EKF method with the first-order traffic flow model, but can also be applied to other data-assimilation techniques in combination with more involved macroscopic traffic flow models. A series of experimental studies based on both synthetic and real-world data have been performed to test the proposed methodology. These studies have validated both the mixed-class and the multi-class traffic state estimation methods. The results have demonstrated that the Lagrangian traffic state estimation outperforms the Eulerian approaches in the EKF-based framework, and the multi-class approach further improves the performance of state estimation compared with the mixed-class case. In summary, Lagrangian multi-class state estimation can provide accurate class-specific traffic information for class-specific control applications and traffic management.

The mechanical erosion was calculated from the suspended sediment transport in the basin, considering the surface runoff discharge and the respective concentration calculated taking in account the statistical hydrogram separation method employed. The specific physical degradation calculated for the Piracicaba River basin was 90 t/km 2. a, which correspond the velocity of the soil thickness reduction of about 64 m/Ma. The dissolved load of Piracicaba River was corrected due to the influence of the atmospheric inputs, mainly for SO 4 2 -, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + (79. 6; 63. 8 and 41. 8 %, respectively).

The method described here starts with expanding an Earley parser to let it correct erred <b>input.</b> The <b>corrections</b> consist of inserting or deleting tokens from the <b>input,</b> but other <b>corrections</b> can be simulated by combining these two operations. When parsing an input string, typically more than one derivation can be generated. This is especially the case if the input has been corrected.

DOP selects the most probable derivation based on a corpus of derivations that were previously generated by the Earley parser. The complete system, i. e. the expanded Earley parser in combination with DOP, has been successfully tested on correcting corrupted C programs. The next step is to use the system for error correction in natural language processing. ...|$|R
40|$|Multi-combination {{vehicles}} (MCVs) are {{road freight}} vehicles comprising a prime mover towing {{two or more}} trailers. At each articulation point, movements occur due to the driver, vehicle, road and environment such as driver steering, vehicle length, road roughness and side wind loading, respectively. These lateral displacements dictate the lane width required for vehicles using the road and, if ignored or predicted inaccurately, can affect the cost or safety of the road. Previous research (Prem et al., 1999) estimated the lane width requirements for several MCVs on two routes with average roughness. In this current study, a full scale testing programme was undertaken on a rough road to measure the lateral displacement of the rear trailer of a B-Double on a nominally straight path. Video footage was recorded during the tests from a camera {{on the top of}} the prime mover which was aimed at target boards at the rear of the vehicle. Lateral movements of the trailers were extracted from the video data – these were relative to a moving frame of reference, namely the prime mover which was subject to driver steering <b>inputs.</b> <b>Corrections</b> were made for the relative angle between the prime mover and the trailers, which was found to vary with the applied steering angle.

40|$|Objective: Prostate cancer {{remains one}} of the most {{prevalent}} forms of cancer in men aged over 65 years, with yearly around 11, 200 new cases and 2, 600 deaths in the Netherlands. Diagnosis of prostate cancer still relies on biopsies, which are unpleasant and invasive procedures for the patient. The new PET tracer, [68 Ga]Sarabesin 3, aims to offer an accurate and minimally invasive way to locate and diagnose PC by taking benefit of the overexpression of the gastrin releasing peptide receptor on prostate cancer cells. In this research, the pharmacokinetics of the tracer in cancerous and healthy tissues from dynamic PET imaging was studied to identify receptor-specific uptake in prostate cancer tissue. Methods: An image derived input function was obtained from a volume of interest drawn over the femoral artery. The image derived <b>input</b> function <b>correction</b> methods proposed by Chen[1], Mourik[2] and Hackett[3] were evaulated using Monte Carlo simulation of the fermoral artery. The simulation was done in GATE using a model of the Siemens Biograph mCT. Iteratively reweighted least squares and step-wise model fitting were used to increase the accuracy in the small spots suspicious of cancerous tissue. In order to validate the applied arterial <b>input</b> function <b>correction</b> methods, a model of the Siemens Biograph mCT was built in the GATE Monte Carlo software. The absorbed dose was calculated using the MIRD male dosimetry model, OLINDA/EXM and the time activity curves in the various organs. A simple one-way perfusion model of the kidney was applied to estimate the bladder filling over time. Results: The sensitivity and spatial resolution of the GATE model at the field-of-view center were respectively 11, 1 ± 0, 027 kcps/MBq and 4, 00 ± 0, 56 mm full width half maximum in the radial direction, both closely matching the values of reported by Jakoby[4]. Applying the arterial <b>input</b> function <b>correction</b> methods to the simulated arterial and venous concentration curves showed that Hackett’s method[3] most accurately estimates the true arterial concentration with less than 1 % error after the first pass peak. Step-wise fitting of the 1 -, FDG- and 2 -compartment models showed to be less vulnerable to local minima. An increase up to 280 % receptor density was observed in the spots suspicious of cancerous tissue compared to the surrounding tissue healthy prostate tissue, thereby providing proof for the specific uptake of [68 Ga]Sarabesin 3 by gastrin releasing peptide receptor in prostate cancer tissue. The pharmacokinetics of [68 Ga]Sarabesin 3 were best described by a FDG model or a 2 compartment model with a small retention coefficient. It was not possible to determine the retention coefficient of the latter due the relatively large noise and small number of measurement points 50 minutes post-injection. Conclusion: Hackett’s method estimated the arterial concentration well in Monte Carlo simulations. [68 Ga]Sarabesin 3 showed a good uptake in spots suspicious of cancerous tissue and had a high retention despite being an antagonist. The absorbed dose per administered activity to the prostate, red bone marrow and pancreas were estimated at 16, 5, 13, 5 and 196 ?Gy/MBq and the effective dose was 22, 40 ?Sv/MBq, which is similar to the average [18 F]DG effective dose.
