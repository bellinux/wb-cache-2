It is highly desirable to retain the basic OSPF model of reliable flooding, especially when large quantities of <b>external,</b> rarely-changing <b>routing</b> data must be carried across the radio network. However, {{it is not easy}} to implement reliable flooding, and improper implementations may cause excessive message control overheads. An existing patent method proposes an expanding ring algorithm to build adjacency graph for reliable flooding. We first analyze this method and show the message complexity of reliable flooding could be O(n) times of optimum. We then show that a slight modification on this method can generate an adjacency graph, called ER-CDS, which supports reliable flooding with message complexity O(1) of optimum. However, the construction cost based on the patent method is still high and does not adapt to network topology changes well. Finally, we propose a localized splash merging algorithm to construct ER-CDS, and then conducted extensive simulations to evaluate its performance...|$|R

The advertisement of more-specific prefixes provides network operators with a fine-grained method to control the interdomain ingress traffic. Moreover, customer networks combining this mechanism with selective advertisements may decrease their monthly transit traffic bill and potentially impact the business of their providers. In this paper, we develop a methodology for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to monitor new occurrences of prefix deaggre-gation within their customer base. Moreover, the ISPs can detect on their own when deaggregation may decrease the transit bill of their customer networks. We first examine the ISP’s BGP routing data for new cases of prefix deaggregation generated by customers.

As a preliminary, we describe basic characteristics of the most popular real-time services like VoIP, videoconferencing, live media streaming, and network multiplayer games. We focus on the end-to-end latency, bandwidth and efficient transmission methods. Next, we present our project concepts, infrastructure model, details of implementation and our testing environment which was designed for testing many aspects of real-time services. The system combines mechanisms for ensuring best possible connection quality (QoS), load balance of servers in infrastructure and gives control over the packet routing decisions. Additionally, provided security mechanisms make it a good choice even in the environment where a high security level is required. The system is based on the Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) model and data between users is routed over an overlay network, consisting of all participating peers as network nodes. This overlay can by used for application level multicast or live media stream. In the logging process each user is assigned to a specific node (based on his geographic location and nodes load). Because nodes are participating in data transmission, we have control over the data flow route.
