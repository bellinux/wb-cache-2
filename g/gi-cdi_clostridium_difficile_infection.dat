40|$|Background: <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>{{infection}}</b> is a healthcare-associated infection {{resulting in}} significant morbidity. Although immunosuppression {{is associated with}} <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> acquisition and adverse outcomes, the epidemiology of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> in HIV-infected patients has been little studied {{in the era of}} antiretroviral therapy. This study identifies the risk factors for acquisition of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> in HIV-infected patients. Methods: A retrospective, propensity score–matched case–control study design was employed, with patients selected from our institution’s outpatient HIV clinic. <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> cases were defined as having positive stool testing plus an appropriate clinical presentation. The propensity score was generated via multiple logistic regression from year of HIV diagnosis, age at first contact, duration of follow-up, gender, and initial CD 4 count. Results: The 46 cases included were matched to a total of 180 controls. Prior antibiotic treatment {{was a significant predictor of}} <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> (odds ratio: 13, 95 % confidence interval: 3. 49 – 48. 8, p[*]<[*]. 001) as was number of hospital admissions in the preceding year (odds ratio: 4. 02, confidence interval: 1. 81 – 8. 94, p[*]<[*]. 001). Having both proton pump inhibitor use and CD 4 count < 200 cells/µL significantly increased odds of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> in the multivariable model (odds ratio: 15. 17, confidence interval: 1. 31 – 175. 9, p[*]=[*]. 021). Conclusion: As in the general population, frequent hospitalizations and exposure to antimicrobials are independent predictors of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> acquisition in patients with HIV. Additionally, low CD 4 count and proton pump inhibitor use are new potentially modifiable variables that can be targeted for prevention of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> in future interventional studies...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{quantify}} {{the risk of}} death associated with <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection,</b> in an Australian tertiary hospital. 			Background: Two reviews examining <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> and mortality indicate that <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> is associated with increased mortality in hospitalized patients. Studies investigating the mortality of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> in settings outside of Europe and North America are required, so that the epidemiology of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> in these regions can be understood and appropriate prevention strategies made. 			Design: An observational non-concurrent cohort study design was used. Methods: Data from all persons who had (exposed) and a matched sample of persons who did not have <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection,</b> for the calendar years 2007 - 2010, were analysed. The risk of dying within 30, 60, 90 and 180 days was compared using the two groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and conditional logistic regression models were applied to the data to examine time to death and mortality risk adjusted for comorbidities using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. 			Results: One hundred and fifty-eight cases of infection were identified. A statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality was identified between exposed and non-exposed groups at 60 and 180 days. In a conditional regression model, mortality in the exposed group was significantly higher at 180 days. 			Conclusion: In this Australian study, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> was associated with increased mortality. In doing so, it highlights the need for nurses to immediately instigate contact precautions for persons suspected of having <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> and to facilitate a timely faecal collection for testing.

40|$|Introduction: The {{incidence}} of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> {{has been steadily}} rising, growing in virulence, and demonstrating {{an increase in the}} severity and morbidity of the disease. A clinical prediction rule (risk score), applied early in, or prior to, hospitalization is a strategy to identify vulnerable patients, target preventative interventions, improve outcomes for <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection,</b> and translate evidence into clinical practice. Objectives: The purpose of this research was to develop and validate a clinical prediction rule for the risk of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection.</b> Methods: Between August 2007 and June 2009, preoperative variables and positive <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> assays were collected for adult patients admitted for surgical colectomy from 24 hospitals in Michigan. After performing univariate analysis of 36 preoperative patient risk factors, significant variables associated with <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> at a p value ≤. 15 were advanced into a binary logistic regression model. The regression coefficients of this model were translated into a weighted scoring system to develop the clinical prediction rule. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis evaluated the predictive accuracy of the score. Results: 2274 patients underwent colectomy and fulfilled inclusion criteria. A total of 55 patients (2. 4 % overall) developed <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection.</b> Mechanical ventilation (p=. 012) and a history of a transient ischemic attack (p=. 042) were independently associated with <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection.</b> A clinical prediction rule, including the variables from the final model, demonstrated a larger score with an increased patient risk (p ≤. 01). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0. 628 (95 % CI. 550 -. 706). Conclusions: Pulmonary and neurological morbidities emerged as significant preoperative predictive variables of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> in this cohort. In contrast to previous studies, bowel preparation, with and without antibiotics, was not associated with an increased risk of CDI. Findings from this study suggest pathogen-directed interventions, such as a clinical prediction rule to quantify the risk factors of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection,</b> may offer a promising adjunctive strategy to reduce infection and protect vulnerable patient populations...|$|R

Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infections</b> (CDI) among patients hospitalized in the Department of Nephrology, Transplantation and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice. Material/Methods: Thirty-seven patients with <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> diagnosed between October 2011 and November 2013 (26 months), identified among a total of 3728 patients hospitalized in this department during this period, were included in this retrospective, single-center study. The CDI definition was based on the current recommendations of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Results: The observation period was divided into two 13 -month intervals. Increased incidence (of borderline significance) of CDI in the second period compared to the first period was observed (1. 33 % vs 0. 65 % respectively; p= 0. 057). Patients after kidney (n= 11), kidney and pancreas (n= 2) and liver (n= 5) transplantation represented 48 % of the analyzed CDI patients, and in half of these patients (50 %) CDI symptoms occurred within the first 3 months after transplantation. <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> leads to irreversible deterioration of graft function in 38 % of kidney recipients.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> is {{the most}} common {{infectious}} cause of nosocomial diarrhea. Recommended treatments for <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> include metronidazole and vancomycin. Recent investigation has shown an increasing rate of metronidazole treatment failure, particularly among the elderly. The authors studied the outcome of metronidazole therapy for <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> in patients over 65 years of age and risk factors associated with metronidazole treatment failure. Material and Methods. This retrospective study was performed at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Clinical Center of Vojvodina from January 2011 to January 2014. The study sample included 112 patients, over 65 years of age, diagnosed with <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection,</b> who were treated with oral metronidazole 400 mg 3 times per day for 10 days. The efficacy of treatment regimen was assessed by resolution of diarrhea and rates of recurrence within 60 days after completion of therapy Results. Metronidazole was administrated to 112 patients over 65 years of age. Treatment with metronidazole resulted in resolution of diarrhea in 78 patients (69. 65 %). After successful metronidazole treatment, clinical symptoms of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> recurred in 28 the patients (36. 60 %). Risk factors for metronidazole treatment failure are duration of diarrhea before treatment, leucocytosis > 15 000 /mm 3, albumin level ≤ 25 g/l, serum creatinine level ≥ 200 μmol/l, increased C-reactive protein, and concomitant administration of antibiotic and immunosuppressives.

40|$|Recurrent <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> {{represents}} a burdensome clinical issue whose epidemiology is increasing worldwide. The pathogenesis {{is not yet}} completely known. Recent observations suggest that the alteration of the intestinal microbiota and impaired innate immunity may play {{a leading role in}} the development of recurrent infection. Various factors can cause dysbiosis. The causes most involved in the process are antibiotics, NSAIDs, acid suppressing therapies, and age. Gut microbiota impairment can favor <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> <b>infection</b> through several mechanisms, such as the alteration of fermentative metabolism (especially SCFAs), the alteration of bile acid metabolism, and the imbalance of antimicrobial substances production.
