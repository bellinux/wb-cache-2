40|$|A {{considerable}} sum {{of money}} is allocated to UK universities {{on the basis of}} Research Assessment Exercise performance. In this paper we analyse the impact of the two main funding models on the intra-territorial and <b>intra-regional</b> <b>allocation</b> of funds. We also examine the effect of the present system of territorial safety nets and discuss the impact of their removal. The major conclusion is that the safety net implicit in the current funding arrangements delivers well for Wales but poorly for Scotland and is broadly neutral for England and Northern Ireland. However, this broad neutrality for England masks quite considerable variation across the nine regions of England. Research, university funding, Research Assessment Exercise,...|$|E
40|$|With the {{political}} changes in South Africa {{in the early}} 1990 s, the South African government introduced a reform process in the entire water sector {{with the goal of}} a more enhanced and equitable water management system. This paper analyzes existing water allocation situations and applies a nonlinear optimization model to investigate the optimal intra- and inter-regional allocations in the Middle Olifants sub-basin of South Africa. Results show higher benefit from inter-regional water allocation. Reducing water supply levels to conform to the sustainable water supply policy, it can be shown that although water supply is reduced by approximately 50 %, total benefits from water are only reduced by 5 % and 11 % for inter- and <b>intra-regional</b> <b>allocation</b> regimes respectively. These results indicate that alternative water allocation mechanisms can serve as instruments to offset for the effects of water scarcity.

40|$|Equitable {{allocation}} {{of health care}} resources is crucial for promoting health equity. Since {{the emergence of the}} resource allocation working party (RAWP) formula nearly three decades ago, many countries have implemented resource allocation policy reforms aiming to improve equity. Little is known about whether, how and the extent to which, most of these policies have actually improved equity. This study examined whether, and the extent to which, decentralisation of health resource allocation decision-making in Ghana has improved equity in funding within regions and explored the factors that influenced the equitable {{allocation of}} resources for health care in Ghana. The study used a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. Two of the ten regions in Ghana: Ashanti and Northern, covering the southern and northern sectors of the country, were purposefully selected. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to measure levels of relative deprivation of districts applied as a proxy of need. An equity-adjusted share index (EAS) was developed and used as a yardstick against which equity in funding was assessed. Factors influencing the equitable allocation of resources were explored qualitatively through open-ended interviews with policy makers and other health sector stakeholders. The study found that resource allocation in the Ashanti and Northern Regions were largely inequitable, in terms of differentially benefiting the most disadvantaged districts. The proportion of variance in the actual share of funds that could be explained by the predicted EAS was below 50 % for all the years examined, except for the allocation of government funds to the Ashanti Region for 1999, where the proportion of variance was 56 %. Resource allocation in the Northern Region favoured three urban districts over their rural counterparts. However, in the Ashanti Region, there was a significant shift in resources from richer to poorer districts from 2000 to 2002. The Kumasi Metro district, for example, saw its share of donor-pooled funds reduced drastically from 20 % of the total budget in 2000 to 7. 2 % in 2001 and 5. 6 % in 2002. Key factors influencing resource allocation and equity included low funding of the health system, local capacity to utilise funds efficiently, manpower availability, politics, donor influence and the nature of collaboration with the local government. The study concluded that <b>intra-regional</b> resource <b>allocation</b> in Ghanaâ€™s Ashanti and Northern regions was less equitable than expected, despite efforts to redistribute funds. It recommended more effective mechanisms for promoting equity through <b>intra-regional</b> resource <b>allocation</b> in Ghana...|$|R

This paper analyses the existing water allocation situations and applies a non-linear optimisation model to investigate the optimal intra-and inter-regional allocation regimes in the Middle Olifants sub-basin of South Africa. Economic issues such as efficiency gains related to water transfers are discussed and calculated water price elasticities and estimated water demand functions provide necessary fundamentals for further modelling work. Social and environmental aspects are accounted for by includ-ing constant water demands in the model. Results show higher benefits from inter-regional water allocation. Reducing water supply levels to conform to the sustainable water supply policy, it can be shown that although water supply is reduced by approximately 50 %, total benefits from water use are only reduced by 5 % and 11 % for inter- and <b>intra-regional</b> <b>allocation</b> regimes, respectively.
