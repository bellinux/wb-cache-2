5|$|Although Greek {{continued}} as {{the language of}} the Byzantine Empire, linguistic <b>distribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East was more complex. A Greek-speaking majority lived in the Greek peninsula and islands, western Anatolia, major cities, and some coastal areas. Like Greek and Latin, the Thracian language was of Indo-European origin, as were several now-extinct languages in Anatolia attested by Imperial-era inscriptions. Albanian is often seen as the descendant of Illyrian, although this hypothesis has been challenged by some linguists, who maintain that it derives from Dacian or Thracian. (Illyrian, Dacian, and Thracian, however, may have formed a subgroup or a Sprachbund; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Various Afroasiatic languages—primarily Coptic in Egypt, and Aramaic in Syria and Mesopotamia—were never replaced by Greek. The international use of Greek, however, was one factor enabling the spread of Christianity, as indicated for example by the use of Greek for the Epistles of Paul.|$|E
5|$|Although Greek was {{in common}} use around the Mediterranean and into Asia Minor even beyond Imperial borders, {{linguistic}} <b>distribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{eastern part of}} the Empire was complex. Now-extinct languages in Anatolia included Galatian (the form of Celtic introduced by invading Gauls in the 3rd century BC), Phrygian, Pisidian, and Cappadocian, attested by Imperial-era inscriptions. Christian sources also mention the survival of Galatian, Cappadocian, Mysian, and Isaurian in Asia Minor. Like Greek and Latin, these are categorized as Indo-European. Phrygian is not named as a language in a literary text until the 6th century, but is preserved in about a hundred funerary inscriptions in Greek script, most accompanied by Greek text as well and dating from the 3rd century. A Cappadocian accent in speaking Greek seems to be mentioned in a few sources.|$|E
5|$|Chromium, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, {{and lead}} have the {{greatest}} potential to cause harm on account of their extensive use, the toxicity {{of some of their}} combined or elemental forms, and their widespread <b>distribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environment. Hexavalent chromium, for example, is highly toxic as are mercury vapour and many mercury compounds. These five elements have a strong affinity for sulfur; in the human body they usually bind, via thiol groups (–SH), to enzymes responsible for controlling the speed of metabolic reactions. The resulting sulfur-metal bonds inhibit the proper functioning of the enzymes involved; human health deteriorates, sometimes fatally. Chromium (in its hexavalent form) and arsenic are carcinogens; cadmium causes a degenerative bone disease; and mercury and lead damage the central nervous system.|$|E

40|$|We prove {{universality}} of the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities and spin <b>distributions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mixed $p$-spin models. The assumption for the {{universality of}} the identities requires exactly that the coupling constants have zero means and finite variances, and the result applies to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. As an application, we obtain universality of spin <b>distributions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> generic $p$-spin models under the condition of two matching moments. In particular, certain identities for 3 -overlaps and 4 -overlaps under the Gaussian disorder follow. In general, we find that universality of spin <b>distributions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mixed $p$-spin models holds if mild dilution of connectivity by the Viana-Bray diluted spin glass Hamiltonians is present and the first three moments of coupling constants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mixed $p$-spin Hamiltonians match.

5|$|Cladistic {{analyses}} of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa, with Daspletosaurus more basal than either.

An alternative hypothesis was presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones. Alioramus was found to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress <b>distribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skull.|$|E

The studio was especially concerned with the film's cast of then-unknown actors. MGM spent more than $2 million on an advertising campaign that placed emphasis on the film's music. The studio also allowed select theatre chains to give out free tickets for special screenings. Fame was released nationwide on June 20, 1980.
