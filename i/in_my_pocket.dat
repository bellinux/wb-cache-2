25|$|Following the 1968 {{publication}} of Nova, {{there was not}} only a large gap in Delany's published work (after releasing eight novels and a novella between 1962 and 1968, Delany's published output virtually stopped until 1973), there was also a notable addition to the themes found in the stories published after that time. It was at this point that Delany began dealing with sexual themes to an extent rarely equaled in serious writing. Dhalgren and Stars <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Pocket</b> Like Grains of Sand include several sexually explicit passages, and several of his books such as Equinox (originally published as The Tides of Lust, a title that Delany does not endorse), The Mad Man, Hogg and, Phallos can be considered pornography, a label Delany himself endorses.|$|E
25|$|Stewart grew up {{with both}} his mother and father, but his mother died {{while he was a}} {{teenager}} and his father remarried. His mother was part of the Dudgeon sept of the Noresmen. His mother was thought to be a major influence in Stewart’s life from whom he received his love and appreciation for beauty. He was a cab proprietor and later ran a farm called Pictstonhill. He was a very religious man and influenced Stewart towards missionary work. Stewart had a desire from a young age to go to Africa. He told his cousin, “I shall never be satisfied till I am in Africa with a Bible <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> and a rifle on my shoulder to supply my wants.” From a very young age, James Stewart knew {{what he wanted to do}} with his life: be a missionary in Africa.|$|E
25|$|Delany's {{eleventh}} {{and most}} popular novel, the million-plus-selling Dhalgren, {{was published in}} 1975 to both literary acclaim (from {{both inside and outside}} the science fiction community) and derision (mostly from within the community). Upon its publication, Delany returned to the United States at the behest of Leslie Fiedler to teach at the University at Buffalo as Butler Professor of English in the spring of 1975, preceding his permanent return to New York City that summer. Though he wrote two more major science fiction novels (Triton and Stars <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Pocket</b> Like Grains of Sand) in the decade following Dhalgren, Delany began to work in fantasy and science fiction criticism for several years. His main literary project through the late 1970s and 1980s was the Return to Nevèrÿon series, the overall title of the four volumes and also the title of the fourth and final book. Following the publication of the Return to Nevèrÿon series, Delany published one more fantasy novel. Released in 1993, They Fly at Çiron is a re-written and expanded version of an unpublished short story Delany wrote in 1962. This would be Delany's last novel in either the science fiction or fantasy genres for many years.|$|E

She had little money and worked as a waitress at Dunkin' Donuts and with modern dance troupes, taking classes at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and eventually performing with Pear Lang Dance Theater. Madonna said of her move to New York, [...] "It was the first time I'd ever taken a plane, the first time I'd ever gotten a taxi cab. I came here with $35 <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b> It was the bravest thing I'd ever done." [...] She started to work as a backup dancer for other established artists. Madonna claimed that during a late night she was returning from a rehearsal, when a pair of men held her at knifepoint and forced her to perform fellatio. Madonna later commented that [...] "the episode was a taste of my weakness, it showed me that I still could not save myself {{in spite of all the}} strong-girl show. I could never forget it." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of Al Capone, Steiger played {{sophisticated}} thief Paul Mason, who masterminds a caper to steal $4 million in French francs from the underground vault of the casino of Monte Carlo, in the Henry Hathaway heist film Seven Thieves (1960). Bosley Crowther of The New York Times gave a positive review of the film, praising the [...] "nerve-rackingly delicate plot" [...] and the [...] "most elaborate roles" [...] of Steiger and his co-star, Edward G. Robinson. The following year, he took {{the part of a}} prison psychiatrist who tries to cure the psychological demons of Stuart Whitman's character in The Mark. Steiger's performance was so convincing that, after the film was released, he received a call from a psychiatric institution asking him to attend one of their board meetings. The Mark was followed by a role in the European film production of World <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Pocket</b> alongside Nadja Tiller. Steiger increasingly played in films in Italy and France during this period. Not only did he believe he had greater credibility and esteem as an actor in Europe, but he approved of the more relaxed filming schedule prevalent there at that time.|$|E

2500|$|... "Brute facts", in the {{terminology}} of speech act philosopher John Searle, are facts which are true anyway, regardless of human belief. Suppose you don't believe in gravity: jump over a cliff and you'll still fall. Natural science {{is the study}} of facts of this kind. [...] "Institutional facts" [...] are fictions accorded factual status within human social institutions. Monetary and commercial facts are fictions of this kind. The complexities of today's global currency system are facts only while we believe in them: suspend the belief and the facts correspondingly dissolve. Yet although institutional facts rest on human belief, that doesn't make them mere distortions or hallucinations. Take my confidence that these two five-pound banknotes <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> are worth ten pounds. That's not merely my subjective belief: it's an objective, indisputable fact. But now imagine a collapse of public confidence in the currency system. Suddenly, the realities <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> dissolve.|$|E

In the comics, he was relatively inarticulate, represented by hyphens between each syllable he spoke, but possessed of simple wisdom and strong morals. This characterization was essentially characterized in the video game, {{where he was a}} playable character, and his only line of dialogue in the cut scenes was [...] "Yeah..." [...] In the animated special, he was known as [...] "Big Ed" [...] and was essentially a comic simpleton.|$|E
