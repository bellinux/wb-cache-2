Firstly, roadside safety level was divided by indicators which can reduce the probability of run-into-roadside or improve the safety of roadside objective characteristics, and each <b>indicator</b> <b>safety</b> classification standards was determined on the basis of certain statistics data. Then, countermeasures database of roadside safety improvement is established by summarize and refining the roadside safety conditions countermeasures based on the domestic and overseas research results. Finally, against Game problems for roadside safety improvement process, and carried out the analysis of conflict and cooperation about the Game problems, decision-making information fusion model of roadside safety improvement is proposed by Game Theory.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between safety culture, safety climate, and leading <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> in enhancing <b>safety</b> performance in the workplace. The research showed that an organisation’s positive safety culture is believed to be important in improving safety performance. Achieving a positive safety culture takes time and relies on a top-down approach, with a visible commitment to safety by management. On the other hand, safety climate relies on a bottom-up perceptual approach, corresponding to individual values, attitudes, and perceptions regarding safety. No universally agreed method exists for stablishing and correlating safety culture factors with leading <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> for the oil and gas industry, nor is there a generic set of <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> to cover all relevant aspects of a positive safety culture. However, it is possible to link the safety culture maturity model to a set of leading <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> so that management can act on the early warning signs...|$|R

40|$|Evaluating {{the safety}} of {{different}} traffic facilities is a complex and crucial task. Microscopic simulation models {{have been widely used}} for traffic management but have been largely neglected in traffic safety studies. Micro simulation to study safety is more ethical and accessible than the traditional safety studies, which only assess historical crash data. However, current microscopic models are unable to mimic unsafe driver behavior, as they are based on presumptions of safe driver behavior. This highlights the need for a critical examination of the current microscopic models to determine which components and parameters have an effect on <b>safety</b> <b>indicator</b> reproduction.

40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) The steel {{industry}} {{is considered a}} very harsh working environment that has been seen {{to be a major}} contributor to the occupational health and safety incidents occurring in the manufacturing sector. Due {{to the nature of the}} steel making process, the {{steel industry}} remains dangerous to employees. Leading key performance <b>indicators</b> of <b>safety</b> are a control mechanism that can be used in contributing to the improvement of safety performance. The aim of the research conducted was to determine if leading key performance <b>indicators</b> of <b>safety</b> are being utilised in organisations in the steel industry, to determine the KPI in use was informative of the root cause of the safety incident and to identify the initial KPI development requirements in a steel manufacturing organisation in South Africa. A literature review centred on leading key performance <b>indicators</b> of <b>safety</b> was conducted to establish the meaning of KPI and their application in other similar industries. A benchmark for the research was established from the literature review. The research was influenced by the methods that were applied by Grabowski, Ayalasomayajula, Wang, Merrick, Mc Cafferty, Meador & Kinney, 2007, that were successfully used in the derivation of leading KPI in the shipping industry. The research done by Toellner, 2001 on leading <b>indicators</b> of <b>safety</b> was also influential in conducting this study. The data was obtained through random sampling in a population of production staff, engineering, personnel, specialists and managerial staff, whose experience in the industry ranged from two years to forty years. The questionnaire was randomly distributed to a population consisting of fourteen supervisors, twelve engineering staff, eighty-six production personnel, twenty-one specialists and six management staff. The respondents’ level of experience in the industry varied from two years to forty years and a combined experience level of one-hundred and thirty-five years. It was found that the key performance <b>indicators</b> of <b>safety</b> that were being utilised have not evolved significantly over the past fifteen years and they do not provide insight to the root cause of the accident.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} {{physically}} meaningful energy related <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> for robots sharing their workspace with humans. Based on these <b>indicators,</b> <b>safety</b> criteria are introduced as constraints {{in the control}} algorithm. The first constraint {{is placed on the}} kinetic energy of the robotic system to limit the amount of dissipated energy in case of collision. This constraint depends on the distance between the robot and the human operator. The distance is computed with a point cloud based algorithm acquired using a set of depth sensors (Kinects). The second constraint is on the amount of potential energy that is allowed to be generated within the human-robot system during physical contact. It is used to modulate the contact forces. The control algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem and computes every time step the actuation torques for a KUKA LWR 4 manipulator given some task to be performed, the introduced constraints and the physical limitations of the system to respect. The overall framework allows a human operator to safely enter the robot's workspace and physically interact with it...|$|R

40|$|The {{safety of}} nuclear waste {{disposal}} must be assessed {{into the far}} future. For long-lived waste, including spent nuclear fuel, the necessary time-frames span over {{hundreds of thousands of}} years. In fact, similar assessments are required for disposal of all long-lived or stable toxic materials. Regardless of the type of long-term risks involved, the acceptability of disposal of hazardous waste must be judged against established criteria. In the case of nuclear waste disposal, expected radiation doses and radiological risk to humans have since long been applied as <b>indicators</b> of <b>safety.</b> Corresponding criteria in terms of dose or risk limits have been decided or proposed by competent authorities in many countries. However, the long timeframes make the calculation of these <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> difficult. This is mainly due to the unavoidable uncertainties in predicting human behaviour and biosphere evolution. On the other hand, the confidence in calculated values of radionuclide flux from a repository and the resulting biosphere concentrations is considerably greater. As a consequence, environmental concentrations and fluxes of radionuclides released from a repository have been discussed as <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> complementary to dose and risk.

Although important, they do not specifically address patient needs or {{provide a framework for}} their adoption in the context of endoscopy services. The consensus guidelines reported in this article, however, aimed to identify processes and indicators relevant to the provision of high-quality endoscopy services that will support ongoing quality improvement across many jurisdictions, specifically in the areas of ethics, facility standards and policies, quality assurance, training and education, reporting standards and patient perceptions. BACKGROUND: Increasing use of gastrointestinal endoscopy, particularly for colorectal cancer screening, and increasing emphasis on health care quality, highlight the need for clearly defined, evidence-based processes to support quality improvement in endoscopy. OBJECTIVE: To identify processes and indicators of quality and safety relevant to high-quality endoscopy service delivery. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of 35 voting participants developed recommendation statements and performance indicators. Systematic literature searches generated 50 initial statements that were revised iteratively following a modified Delphi approach using a web-based evaluation and voting tool. Statement development and evidence evaluation followed the AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines, REsearch and Evaluation) and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) guidelines.

Organizations and {{investigators}} are alike in searching for ways to improve delivery and safety of patient care. Many have reported that the existence of a patient safety and risk management system will have an effective impact on the overall patients' outcomes. Aims: To study the effectiveness of a patient safety model on patient <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> when implemented in a university hospital. Methods: A task force constituted by various patient safety experts was established to design a practical concept of patient safety management based on a nine steps model and applied by all hospital departments. Patient <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> (780) were monitored over a four years period and the model's effectiveness was analyzed on 40 selected indicators. Results: A statistical significant improvement by 67. 5 % (27 / 40) of initially measured patient <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> was evidenced mainly in the domains of peri-operative mortalities, neonatal mortality, return to surgeries, healthcare associated infections, safety and medication use, blood transfusion reactions, cardio pulmonary resuscitations, patient adverse events, and occurrence variance reporting.

40|$|The {{growth in}} the use of {{endoscopy}} to diagnose and treat many gastointestinal disorders, and its central role in cancer screening programs, has led to {{a significant increase in the}} number of procedures performed. This growth, however, has also led to many variations in, among others, the provision of services, the choice of sedative medications and the training of providers. The recognition of the significance of quality in endoscopy has prompted several countries, including Canada, to initiate efforts to adopt nationwide quality improvement programs. The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology formed a committee to review endoscopy and quality with the aim of stimulating improvement. This article focuses specifically on patient <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> that were developed at a consensus conference aimed at generating a broad range of recommendations for selected endoscopic procedures, which if adopted, could lead to significant changes in how endoscopy services are provided. INTRODUCTION: The importance of quality indicators has become increasingly recognized in gastrointestinal endoscopy. Patient safety requires the identification and monitoring of occurrences associated with harm or the potential for harm. The identification of relevant <b>indicators</b> of <b>safety</b> compromise is, therefore, a critical element that is key to the effective implementation of endoscopy quality improvement programs. OBJECTIVE: To identify key <b>indicators</b> of <b>safety</b> compromise in gastrointestinal endoscopy. METHODS: The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology <b>Safety</b> and Quality <b>Indicators</b> in Endoscopy Consensus Group was formed to address issues of quality in endoscopy. A subcommittee was formed to identify key <b>safety</b> <b>indicators.</b> A systematic literature review was undertaken, and articles pertinent to safety in endoscopy were identified and reviewed. All complications and measures used to document safety were recorded. From this, a preliminary list of 16 indicators was compiled and presented to the 35 -person consensus group during a three-day meeting. A revised list of 20 items was subsequently put to the consensus group for vote for inclusion on the final list of <b>safety</b> <b>indicators.</b> Items were retained only if the consensus group highly agreed on their importance. RESULTS: A total of 19 <b>indicators</b> of <b>safety</b> compromise were retained and grouped into the three following categories: medication-related – the need for CPR, use of reversal agents, hypoxia, hypotension, hypertension, sedation doses in patients older than 70 years of age, allergic reactions and laryngospasm/bronchospasm; procedure-related early – perforation, immediate postpolypectomy bleeding, need for hospital admission or transfer to emergency department from the gastroenterology unit, instrument impaction, severe persistent abdominal pain requiring evaluation proven to not be perforation; and procedure-related delayed – death within 30 days of procedure, 14 -day unplanned hospitalization, 14 -day unplanned contact with a health provider, gastrointestinal bleeding within 14 days of procedure, infection or symptomatic metabolic complications. CONCLUSIONS: The 19 <b>indicators</b> of <b>safety</b> compromise in endoscopy, identified by a rigorous, evidence-based consensus process, provide clear outcomes to be recorded by all facilities as part of their continuing quality improvement programs...|$|R
