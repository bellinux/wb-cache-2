5|$|The {{discovery}} of the radioactivity of uranium ushered <b>in</b> <b>additional</b> scientific and practical uses of the element. The long half-life of the isotope uranium-238 (4.51 years) makes it well-suited for use in estimating {{the age of the}} earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating, including uranium–thorium dating, uranium–lead dating and uranium–uranium dating. Uranium metal is used for X-ray targets in the making of high-energy X-rays.|$|E

5|$|A port of Titan Quest for mobile devices was {{developed}} under license from Nordic Games by DotEmu, a French developer {{who had previously}} developed a successful mobile port of Ys Chronicles I. The controls and interface were redesigned {{from the ground up}} to work for touchscreen controls, something the team spent months on. Despite the changes, the team worked to make the gameplay {{as close as possible to}} the original experience.

5|$|Although {{potentially}} dangerous objects and money were confiscated and stored when a prisoner first entered the Bastille, most wealthy prisoners continued to bring <b>in</b> <b>additional</b> luxuries, including pet dogs or cats {{to control the}} local vermin. The Marquis de Sade, for example, arrived with an elaborate wardrobe, paintings, tapestries, a selection of perfume, {{and a collection of}} 133 books. Card games and billiards were played among the prisoners, and alcohol and tobacco were permitted. Servants could sometimes accompany their masters into the Bastille, as in the cases of the 1746 detention of the family of Lord Morton and their entire household as British spies: the family's domestic life continued on inside the prison relatively normally. The prisoners' library had grown during the 18th century, mainly through ad hoc purchases and various confiscations by the Crown, until by 1787 it included 389 volumes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150 musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets over their heads and waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force. Baron von Hotze, commander of the Austrian force there, advanced on the position near Richterswil to direct its defense, and was killed by a French musket ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, could not push the French back, and organized a retreat from the region, falling back to St. Gallen and losing another 8,000 men and some guns. By the time Suvorov arrived in St. Gallen in early October, the Austrians and the Russians had been pushed out and he was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting <b>in</b> <b>additional</b> losses.|$|E

5|$|Coonley died in 1958; ACS {{had looked}} to Coonley for her {{leadership}} {{over the years}} but even more so for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in 1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused serious financial hardship. Under the direction of newly appointed headmaster John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. A swimming pool was added in 1961 to bolster the program. Enrollment had declined {{over the years and}} Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing prospective students. In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought <b>in</b> <b>additional</b> tuition and much needed financial stability.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{good start}} (1–0 in a {{friendly}} match against Guatemala after 10 years of failure against this opponent), a draw conceded at Estadio Cuscatlán in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF), facing a modest Guyana national football team (2–2) earned him {{the wrath of the}} public. A victory in extremis (2–3) at Georgetown, Guyana (with a penalty stopped by goalkeeper Dagoberto Portillo <b>in</b> <b>additional</b> time) allowed El Salvador to stay in the race for qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Unfortunately the home defeat (0–1) against Costa Rica buried the hopes of qualifying for the national team. Juan de Dios Castillo was removed from office in November 2012 and replaced on December 17 by the Peruvian Agustín Castillo, five national champion with C.D. FAS.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} the GPK was authorised, {{controversy}} raged about the route a railway to England might take. It was plain that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a direct route from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that {{became known as the}} Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost unpopulated territory. The locomotives available at the time were not thought to be capable of climbing the steep inclines, and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfries—the Nithsdale line—would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing <b>in</b> <b>additional</b> traffic. Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{was reported}} along the Florida Panhandle, peaking at over 10inches (254mm) {{in the extreme}} northwestern portion of the state. The rainfall caused the worst flooding in tenyears, and resulted <b>in</b> <b>additional</b> flooding to the already swollen Coldwater Creek and Blackwater River in Santa Rosa County. Near the river, 30homes were destroyed with an additional 50houses damaged, totaling about $320,000 (1988USD, $560,000 2007USD) in damage. Several roads were closed from the flooding, as well. The strong convective band associated with Florence extended across the Florida Panhandle, spawning nine tornadoes in Walton County and one waterspout in Bay County. Damage from the tornadoes amounted to about $100,000 (1988USD, $175,000 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|Hudner begged {{superiors}} {{to allow}} him to return to the wreck to help extract Brown, but he was not allowed, as other officers feared an ambush of the vulnerable helicopters resulting <b>in</b> <b>additional</b> casualties. In order to prevent the body and the aircraft from falling into Chinese or North Korean hands, the U.S. Navy bombed the crash site with napalm two days later, reciting the Lord's Prayer over the radio as they watched Brown's body consumed by flames. The pilots observed that his body looked to have been disturbed and his clothes stolen, but he was still stuck in the aircraft. The remains of both Brown and the aircraft were never recovered. Brown was the first African American U.S. Navy officer killed in the war.|$|E

The commercial heart of Honiara was virtually reduced to rubble and ashes. Three National Parliament members, Charles Dausabea, Nelson Ne'e, and Patrick Vahoe, were arrested during or {{as a result of}} the riots. The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), the 16-country Pacific Islands Forum initiative set up in 2003 with assistance from Australia, intervened, sending <b>in</b> <b>additional</b> police and army officers to bring the situation under control. A vote of no confidence was passed against the Prime Minister. Following his resignation, a five-party Grand Coalition for Change Government was formed in May 2006, with Manasseh Sogavare as Prime Minister, quelling the riots and running the government. The army part of RAMSI was removed and rebuilding took shape.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{demand for}} boric acid has led {{a number of}} {{producers}} to invest <b>in</b> <b>additional</b> capacity. Turkey's state-owned Eti Mine Works opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at Emet in 2003. Rio Tinto Group increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers {{have been unable to}} meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate (borax) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring and Rommel had a {{disagreement}} over the latter's conduct in the Battle of Bir Hakeim. Rommel's initial infantry assaults {{had failed to}} capture this vital position, the southern pivot of the British Gazala Line, which was held by the 1st Free French brigade, commanded by General Marie Pierre Koenig. Rommel had called for air support but had failed to break the position, which Kesselring attributed to faulty coordination between the ground and air attacks. Bir Hakeim was evacuated on 10 June 1942. Kesselring was more impressed {{with the results of}} Rommel's successful assault on Tobruk on 21 June, for which Kesselring brought <b>in</b> <b>additional</b> aircraft from Greece and Crete. For his part in the campaign, Kesselring was awarded the Knight's Cross with oak leaves and swords.|$|E
