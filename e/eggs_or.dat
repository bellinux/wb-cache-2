5|$|The {{predator}}y {{ground beetle}} L. grandis is a predator {{of both the}} eggs and larvae of L. decemlineata, and its larvae are parasitoids of the pupae. An adult L. grandis may consume up to 23 <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> 3.3 larvae in a single day.|$|E
5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> a slice of lemon.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the frequent ingestion of baked hen's <b>egg</b> <b>or</b> cow's milk accelerates the resolution of hen's <b>egg</b> <b>or</b> cow's milk allergy. This practice is being introduced into clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence {{to determine whether the}} introduction of baked hen's <b>egg</b> <b>or</b> cow's milk into the diet of children with hen's <b>egg</b> <b>or</b> cow's milk allergies respectively leads to a larger proportion of children outgrowing these allergies than expected. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted in Medline, Embase and CINAHL. The inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized control trials, case-control or cohort studies; children aged 0 - 18 years with hen's <b>egg</b> <b>or</b> cow's milk allergy; baked hen's <b>egg</b> <b>or</b> cow's milk intervention with or without a comparator; and resolution of the hen's <b>egg</b> <b>or</b> cow's milk allergy as determined by food challenge as the outcome. Studies were critically appraised using the quality assessment tool for quantitative studies. PROSPERO reference CRD 42015026029. RESULTS: We identified 851 and 2816 hen's egg and cow's milk articles respectively. Only three hen's egg and three cow's milk studies fulfilled our pre-specified inclusion criteria. The studies concluded that baked products either increased the likelihood of the resolution of allergy or accelerated resolution. However, when critiqued, all studies were classified as weak because they were observational, lacking an appropriate control group; this brings into doubt the study's conclusions. There were a number of examples of severe reactions to baked products. CONCLUSION: There is little evidence to address the hypothesis that the ingestion of baked hen's <b>egg</b> <b>or</b> cow's milk results in more patients outgrowing their hen's <b>egg</b> <b>or</b> cow's milk allergy respectively. Data are required from a trial comparing the resolution rates of baked-tolerant participants who are randomized to ingest or avoid baked products to assess the accuracy of this hypothesis...|$|R

5|$|Insect life-histories show {{adaptations to}} {{withstand}} cold and dry conditions. Some temperate region insects {{are capable of}} activity during winter, while some others migrate to a warmer climate or go {{into a state of}} torpor. Still other insects have evolved mechanisms of diapause that allow <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> pupae to survive these conditions.|$|E
5|$|Proposed {{mechanisms}} for {{the recognition of}} worker-laid <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> active reproductive workers include marker hydrocarbons {{on the surface of}} queen-laid eggs, cuticle hydrocarbons on reproductive workers, and recognition of nest-mates. In rare cases, worker-laid eggs carry mimicked queen hydrocarbons and escape policing, a condition known as the anarchic syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{does not}} act aggressively toward predators within its territory; its only reaction is alarm calling. Predators include snakes, weasels, squirrels, and blue jays, which may destroy <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> kill young, and hawks and cats, which {{pose a threat}} to both young and adults. As of 2007, the oldest known American goldfinch was 10 years and 5 months old.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their <b>eggs,</b> <b>or</b> in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Texas culture {{comes from}} a blend of Southern (Dixie), Western (frontier), and Southwestern (Mexican/Anglo fusion) influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another. Texas {{is placed in the}} Southern United States by the United States Census Bureau. A popular food item, the breakfast burrito, draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon and {{scrambled}} <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> other hot, cooked fillings. Adding to Texas's traditional culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a melting pot of cultures from around the world.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles are {{dependent}} on egg yolk material for sustenance. About a week to {{a week and a}} half after emerging from their <b>eggs</b> (<b>or</b> the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|E

5|$|Israeli eating customs also {{conform to}} the wider Mediterranean region, with lunch, rather than dinner, being the focal meal of a regular workday. “Kibbutz foods” have been adopted by many Israelis for their light evening meals as well as breakfasts, and may consist of various types of cheeses, both soft and hard, yogurt, labne and sour cream, {{vegetables}} and salads, olives, hard-boiled <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> omelets, pickled and smoked herring, a variety of breads, and fresh orange juice and coffee.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} were once intensively hunted for their meat and eggs; {{consumption}} has decreased, however, due to worldwide legislation. Despite this, turtle meat and eggs are still consumed {{in countries where}} regulations are not strictly enforced. In Mexico, turtle eggs are a common meal; locals claim the egg is an aphrodisiac. Eating turtle <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> meat can cause serious illness due to harmful bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, {{and high levels of}} toxic metals that build up through bioaccumulation.|$|E
5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views kosher certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, <b>eggs,</b> <b>or</b> fish, strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E

5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the very}} few genera where the workers lay trophic <b>eggs,</b> <b>or</b> {{infertile}} eggs laid as food for viable offspring. Workers laying trophic eggs have only been reported in two species; these species are M. forceps and M. gulosa. Depending on the species, colonies specialise in trophallaxis; queens and larvae eat eggs that are laid by worker individuals, but the workers do not feed on eggs. Neither adults nor larvae consume food during winter, but cannibalism among larvae is known to occur throughout the year. The larvae only cannibalise each other; this is most likely to happen when no dead insects are available.|$|E
5|$|Olive oil was a {{ubiquitous}} {{ingredient in}} Mediterranean cultures, but remained an expensive import {{in the north}} where oils of poppy, walnut, hazel and filbert were the most affordable alternatives. Butter and lard, especially after the terrible mortality during the Black Death made them less scarce, were used in considerable quantities in the northern and northwestern regions, especially in the Low Countries. Almost universal in middle and upper class cooking all over Europe was the almond, {{which was in the}} ubiquitous and highly versatile almond milk, which was used as a substitute in dishes that otherwise required <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> milk, though the bitter variety of almonds came along much later.|$|E
5|$|Some species (such as Tetramorium caespitum) {{attack and}} take over {{neighbouring}} ant colonies. Others are less expansionist, but just as aggressive; they invade colonies to steal <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> larvae, which they either eat or raise as workers or slaves. Extreme specialists among these slave-raiding ants, such as the Amazon ants, are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured workers to survive. Captured workers of the enslaved species Temnothorax have evolved a counter strategy, destroying just the female pupae of the slave-making Protomognathus americanus, but sparing the males (who don't take part in slave-raiding as adults).|$|E

5|$|The {{black vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds on carrion, {{but will also}} eat <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> kill newborn animals. In areas populated by humans, it also feeds at garbage dumps. It finds its meals either by using its keen eyesight or by following other (New World) vultures, which possess {{a keen sense of}} smell. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It lays its eggs in caves or hollow trees or on the bare ground, and generally raises two chicks each year, which it feeds by regurgitation. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. This vulture also appeared in Mayan codices.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex ratio}} of male to female dragonflies varies both {{temporally}} and spatially. Adult dragonflies {{have a high}} male-biased ratio at breeding habitats. The male-bias ratio has contributed partially to the females using different habitats to avoid male harassment. As seen in Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana), male populations use wetland habitats, while females use dry meadows and marginal breeding habitats, only migrating to the wetlands to lay their <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> to find mating partners. Unwanted mating is energetically costly for females because it affects {{the amount of time}} that they are able to spend foraging.|$|E
5|$|The {{young are}} covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after six months, but {{continue}} to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large birds of prey and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take <b>eggs</b> <b>or</b> hatchlings. Predation is relatively uncommon, since the vigilant parents often aggressively displace birds of prey who come near and the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.|$|E
