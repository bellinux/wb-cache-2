5|$|When Histiaeus {{heard of}} the fall of Miletus, he seems to have {{appointed}} himself as leader of the resistance against Persia. Setting out from Byzantium with his force of Lesbians, he sailed to Chios. The Chians refused to receive <b>him,</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> attacked and destroyed the remnants of the Chian fleet. Crippled by the two defeats at sea, the Chians then acquiesced to Histiaeus's leadership.|$|E
5|$|Röhm {{hoped to}} assume {{command of the}} army and absorb it into the ranks of the SA. Hindenburg and Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg {{threatened}} to impose martial law if the alarming activities of the SA were not curtailed. Hitler also suspected that Röhm was plotting to depose <b>him,</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> ordered the deaths of Röhm and other political enemies. Up to 200 people were killed from 30 June to 2 July 1934 in an event that became known as the Night of the Long Knives. After this purge, the SA was no longer a major force.|$|E

5|$|The state {{legislature}} decided during Houston's third senatorial term not to re-elect <b>him,</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> {{ran for the}} office of Governor of Texas, losing to Hardin Richard Runnels. He was still in Washington when William (Willie) Rogers Houston was born on May 25, 1858, their last child born in the Woodland home. In order to satisfy creditors of his gubernatorial campaign debts, Houston was forced to sell the house to his political supporter J. Carroll Smith. He subsequently defeated incumbent Runnels with a second bid for the office during a period when the populace was bitterly divided over the issue of secession from the United States, and was sworn in December 31, 1859.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Richard {{started to}} {{complain}} {{of pain in}} his left calf. The synthetic graft inserted in his July 1980 surgery had closed off, which meant that he needed a surgical bypass in his left leg. Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still had faith in <b>him,</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> was re-signed on February 17 of the following year. Just {{a little over two}} months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career. Despite an almost complete recovery, the risk of future complications was so great that he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493strikeouts and a 3.15ERA in 238games and 1,606innings. Nolan Ryan broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Kỳ {{specifically}} said {{nine or ten}} {{other officers}} should be dismissed for involvement in the coup, but refused to identify who he had in mind. Some observers accused Kỳ and Thi of deliberately orchestrating or allowing the plot to develop before putting it down in order to embarrass Khánh and allow themselves to gain prominence and prestige on the political stage. In later years, Cao Huy Thuan, a professor and Buddhist activist based in the northern town of Da Nang, claimed that during a meeting with Kỳ and Thi {{a few days before}} the coup, the officers had discussed their plans for overthrowing Khánh. Another conspiracy claim was propagated by General Trần Văn Đôn, who conjectured that Khánh had tried to provoke or bait rival generals, such as Khiêm, into revolting against <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> could defeat and remove them from the scene, thereby strengthening himself and boosting his political image.|$|E

After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing.

Blair learns that Todd caused the explosion that killed Guy, and divorces him in June. When Blair falls into a coma, Todd pays lawyer Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano) five million dollars to marry <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> can keep custody of Starr.
