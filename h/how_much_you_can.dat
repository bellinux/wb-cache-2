The producers select the stories, select the cast, tell you <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> pay for a picture and how long you can have to make it in. All this could be borne. But when they tell you that they also will cut your picture, that is too much." ...|$|E

Our economy has kind of grown up now on depreciation and deductions and industries have grown up around that and so I don't know exactly <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> simplify it, but you sure have to make a stab at it." [...] Later that week, in accepting Forbes' endorsement of his own presidential candidacy, Giuliani said that [...] "a flat tax would make a lot of sense".|$|E

2500|$|Arisu Kashiwagi, lead {{designer}} at Imaginary Forces for {{the title}} sequence, was [...] "inspired by all the changing activity and vignettes within those rows of windows [...] — the patterns of light, color, narratives, and graphic silhouettes. It is pretty amazing <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see {{and the number of}} windows out there with wide open shades... I could understand our innate fascination with the rear window and that discomforting pleasure when catching a small sliver of a private act." [...] She also looked to Edward Hopper's [...] "Night Windows" [...] and Gerhard Richter's paintings for reference. In order to differentiate the sequence from other painting-inspired ones, Kashiwagi chose to take [...] "a more modern, abstract look while also embracing the spirit of David Mack’s watercolor paintings from" [...] Alias. On the design concept, she added, [...] "We based the concept off of Jessica’s PTSD and alcoholism, her blurry, unreliable point of view, and translated that visually using paint strokes that smear and obfuscate the scenes ... the scenes would appear only in small sections of the frame, either blocked by a foreground element or contained inside of a silhouetted framing device." [...] Michelle Dougherty, creative director on the project, looked to the opening sequence of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window to help create the [...] "voyeuristic approach" [...] as well as [...] "using the city as a character" [...] to highlight [...] "the dark places [...] the grit" [...] where Jones investigates.|$|E

6000|$|As {{the artist}} in him was stirred, great {{problems}} presented themselves; for instance, in certain circumstances was [...] "darling" [...] or [...] "little one" [...] the better phrase? [...] "Darling" [...] in solitary grandeur is more pregnant of meaning than [...] "little one," [...] but [...] "little" [...] has a flavour of the patronizing which [...] "darling" [...] perhaps lacks.

60|$|It {{was not a}} dull {{excursion}} for me. I {{managed to}} put in the time very well. I made various acquaintanceships, and in my quality of stranger was able to ask as many questions as I wanted to. A thing which naturally interested me, as a statesman, was the matter of wages. I picked up what I could under that head during the afternoon. A man who hasn't had much experience, and doesn't think, is apt to measure a nation's prosperity or lack of prosperity by the mere size of the prevailing wages; if the wages be high, the nation is prosperous; if low, it isn't. Which is an error. It isn't what sum you get, it's <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> buy with it, that's the important thing; and it's that that tells whether your wages are high in fact or only high in name. I could remember how it was in the time of our great civil war in the nineteenth century. In the North a carpenter got three dollars a day, gold valuation; in the South he got fifty--payable in Confederate shinplasters worth a dollar a bushel. In the North a suit of overalls cost three dollars--a day's wages; in the South it cost seventy-five --which was two days' wages. Other things were in proportion. Consequently, wages were twice as high in the North {{as they were in the}} South, because the one wage had that much more purchasing power than the other had.|$|E
