Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 118 - 127. Since {{the initiation}} of the Health Transformation Programme in 2003 a series of reforms in health and social security systems have been realized in Turkey. An examination of the official documents related to these reforms {{in light of the}} international right to health documents reveals that the former is coherent with the latter, at least ostensibly. Considering the influence of the EU accession process on Turkey as a candidate country, especially in issues concerning human rights, one may expect to see a push from the EU in the issue of health, as well. However, an examination of the EU‟s demands in the accession documents concerning the health care system, reveals that EU does not have a strong human rights emphasis in health-related issues, especially before 2003. Interestingly, a right to <b>health</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in the accession documents begins to be observed after 2003, namely the iv initiation of the Health Transformation Programme. This shows that right to health is not something the EU ignores, but it hesitates to put concrete demands concerning it, be it because of the principle of subsidiarity, or the second class position the Union attributes to economic and social rights vis-a-vis civil and political rights. Whatever the reason is, the question whether the EU accession process has a role in the right to <b>health</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of recent health reforms in Turkey, can be answered negatively based on the accession documents.

Among the concepts that have emerged over the past decade to examine this relationship are socio-economic inequality and social capital. Using data from the World Values Survey and the World Bank, we tested the hypothesis that self-rated health is affected by social capital and income inequality cross-nationally. The merit of our approach was that we used multilevel methods in a larger and more diverse sample of countries than used previously. Our results indicated that, for a large number of diverse countries, commonly used measures of social capital and income inequality had strong compositional effects on self-rated health, but inconsistent contextual effects, depending on the countries included.

40|$|Objective: To compare {{clinical}} and economic study data for docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine {{in the treatment}} of anthracycline-resistant advanced breast cancer. Study design and methods: A Markov decision-analysis model to simulate the clinical course of a `typical' patient with advanced breast cancer during salvage chemotherapy was updated with response rates and adverse effect rates from phase III clinical trial data for docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine. Costs were taken from UK national databases and hospitals. Utilities were estimated from 30 oncology nurses in the UK using the standard gamble method. Perspective: National Health Service. Results: When compared with other chemotherapeutic agents, docetaxel has been shown to increase response rate, time to progression and survival in patients with advanced breast cancer. In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-utility ratio for docetaxel versus paclitaxel was Lstg 1995 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (1998 values). The incremental cost-utility ratio for docetaxel versus vinorelbine was Lstg 14 055 per QALY gained. In the comparison with vinorelbine, docetaxel provided the equivalent of an additional 92 days of perfect <b>health.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> analyses confirmed the robustness of the model and the validity of the base-case analysis results.

Methods: This was a prospective cohort study that included 625 patients aged 70 years and older (mean age 80. 0 +/- 5. 6 years) hospitalized by the way of the emergency room, for at least 48 h, in two academic hospitals. Three months after discharge, 550 patients remained for analysis. On admission, people were assessed for premorbid functional status with the activities of daily living (ADL) scale and instrumental ADL scale. Demographic and medical data, including cognitive function, falls, polypharmacy, comorbidity, continence, mobility and self-rated health, were collected. ADL functioning was re-assessed at discharge and 1 and 3 months later. Functional decline was defined as the loss of at least one point on the ADL scale between the premorbid and 3 -month evaluation. Univariate analyses were used to select variables associated with functional decline. A logistic regression model was then constructed to predict functional status 3 months after discharge. Results: Three months after discharge, 165 (31. 5 %) patients had declined. The predictive tool SHERPA includes five factors: age, impairment in premorbid instrumental ADLs, falls in the year before hospitalization, cognitive impairment (Abbreviated Mini Mental State below 15 / 21) and poor self-rated <b>health.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> and specificity were 67. 9 % and 70. 8 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: This {{contribution}} is an exploratory {{study of a}} target population - adolescents - that has been little investigated, as emerges from {{the analysis of the}} national and international literature on blood donation (Lemmens et al., 2009). As regards the recruitment of volunteers, young people represent a potential of great interest, not only for the blood supply that they could provide and a possible “career” in donation that they could take up, but also for the promotion of healthy lifestyles by fostering in them a greater awareness of their health and their contribution {{to the development of a}} mature and responsible civic culture. In fact, recent research demonstrated that, although adolescents are ideal candidates for blood donation (due to their <b>health,</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> and the possibility of a “long journey” as blood donors), they nevertheless reveal themselves to be uninformed and, therefore, constitute a smaller presence in the donor population (Caligaris et al., 2006). It often happens that young people who arrive at blood collection centres turn out to be inappropriate for donation because of health problems (due to drug use, unprotected sexual activity, high alcohol levels, etc.). Aims: Aim of this work is to investigate the propensity in blood donation, the diffusion of risk behaviors among adolescents that limit and restrict the potential of blood donation, reducing the number of possible subjects suitable for donation, and the possible link between this propensity and risk behaviors. Methods: Adolescents were asked to complete an anonymous self-report questionnaire during class time. The questionnaire included items ad hoc designed to investigate the intention to donate blood and behaviors traditionally considered “at risk” for health in adolescence.

40|$|U. S. {{healthcare}} costs have experienced unsustainable growth, with expenditures of $ 2. 5 trillion in 2009, and are rising {{at a rate}} faster {{than that of the}} U. S. economy. A major factor in the cost of the U. S. healthcare system is related to the strategic behavior of system participants based on their incentives. This dissertation addresses the challenge of designing incentives to solve problems in healthcare systems. Principal agent theory and Markov decision processes are the primary methods used to construct incentives. The first problem considered is how to design contracts in order to align consumer and provider incentives with respect to preventive efforts. The model consists of an insurer contracting with two agents, a consumer and a provider, and focuses on the trade off between ex ante moral hazard and insurance. Two classes of efforts on behalf of the provider are studied: those which complement consumer efforts, and those which substitute with consumer efforts. The results show that the provider must be given incentives when the consumer is healthy to induce effort, and that inducing provider effort allows an insurer to save on incentives given to the consumer. The insurer can save on the cost of incentives by using a multilateral contract compared to the bilateral benchmark. These savings are illustrated by an example showing which model features affect the savings achieved. The second problem addresses the decision to provide knowledge to consumers regarding the consequences of health behaviors. The model developed to address this second problem extends the literature on incentives in healthcare systems to consider dynamic environments and includes a behavioral model of healthcare consumers. By using a learning model of consumer behavior, a policy maker's knowledge provision problem is transformed into a Markov decision process. This framework is used to solve for optimal knowledge provision policies regarding behaviors affecting coronary <b>health.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> analysis shows robust threshold features of optimal policies. The results show that knowledge about smoking should be provided at most health and behavior states. As the cost of providing knowledge increases or aptitude for behavioral change decreases, fewer states are in the optimal knowledge provision policy, with healthy consumers dropping out first. Knowledge about diet and physical activity is provided more selectively due to the to uncertainty in the health benefits, and the time delay in accrued rewards...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} human health impact of gold jewelry during its entire life cycle. Gold has many {{negative}} impacts {{on human health}} during its life cycle, such as emissions and accidents during different stages in the life cycle. There are also indications that mining of different minerals leads to conflicts and that minerals, such as gold, are used for financing military activities resulting in people getting killed, injured or displaced. Especially {{the eastern part of}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is associated with conflict gold. Consequently, gold produced in the DRC is the main focus of this study, while gold produced in Sweden and South Africa are included for comparison. The main method of this thesis is an attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) with an expanded social perspective. The disability-adjusted life years (DALY) is the indicator, and the results are quantified for the amount of gold in one typical wedding ring and per kg of gold. The indicator DALY is chosen since it allows for considering different types of causes of death and impairment, including conflicts, occupational hazards and environmental hazards. The aim is not to reach an exact figure of how many years of life that are lost, but rather to evaluate the magnitude of different processes. The three types of human health impacts that are quantified in this study are: impacts from environmental emissions, impacts from work environment accidents, and impacts from conflict. About 0. 4 years of life were lost per wedding ring for gold produced in the DRC, which is several orders of magnitude larger than the impact of gold produced in South Africa and Sweden. The calculated number for life years lost is very high for such a small amount of gold, creating credibility for the title of this tudy: “the blood wedding ring”. The impact from the conflict is several orders of magnitude larger than the impact in any other process. If the impact assessment result from the conflict is excluded from the results, the emissions occurring at the extraction and processing of gold instead had the greatest impact, several orders of magnitude larger than any other process. In particular, mercury emissions to air had a high impact on human health during the processing of gold in artisanal mining in the DRC. The other processes have more minor impacts on human <b>health.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> analyses were conducted to evaluate data gaps and uncertainties. These analyses in general showed that the results of the impact assessment are reasonable. The overall conclusion is that even though the results are uncertain, the conflict’s impact on human health is still several magnitudes larger than those of all other processes evaluated in the study...|$|E
