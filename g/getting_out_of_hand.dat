Looking to solve the problem, Malay administrator Long Jaafar invited the Chinese in Penang to work in Perak, particularly at Larut. By the 1840s, Perak's Chinese population exploded. The new immigrants {{more often than not}} were members of Chinese secret societies. Two of the largest were Ghee Hin and Hai San. These two groups regularly tried to increase their influence in Perak and this resulted in frequent skirmishes.

First processes of the arrested peasants began in December 1937 in the court in Przemyśl. Altogether, around 1000 people were sentenced to up to 5 years. Many of them stayed behind bars until September 1939, when prison guards left their posts behind, escaping the advancing German troops.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} the Kenyon report in February 1918, {{the following month}} Ware appointed Reginald Blomfield {{to be one of}} the senior architects overseeing the design of British war cemeteries. Blomfield was chosen on the recommendation of Kenyon. Blomfield was an expert in both British and French architecture, and had written extensively on garden planning. Blomfield was greatly experienced in serving on committees, commissions, and government advisory bodies, and Ware hoped that Blomfield would use his age, experience, and dominance in the field of architecture to help rein in Baker and Lutyens. Ware also hoped that Blomfield's amiable nature and firm hand would keep the disagreements between Baker and Lutyens from <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b> Furthermore, Blomfield was a widely acknowledged expert in generating highly accurate cost estimates and in crafting excellent contracts. Blomfield was paid £400 per year in 1918, which was raised to £600 per year in 1919.|$|E

Many German-speaking South Tyroleans, after years of linguistic oppression and discrimination by Fascist Italy, wanted revenge upon ethnic Italians living in the area (particularly in the larger cities) but were mostly prevented from doing so by the occupying Nazis, who still considered Mussolini head of the Italian Social Republic and wanted to preserve good relations with the Italian Fascists, still supporting Mussolini against the Allies. Although the Nazis were able to recruit South Tyrolean youth and to capture local Jews, they prevented anti-Italian feelings from <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b> Mussolini, who wanted to set up his new pro-German Italian Social Republic in Bolzano, was still a Nazi ally.|$|E

25|$|Bogan left Hamilton {{not long}} afterward, {{settling}} into working on ranches {{in and around}} the Texas Panhandle. In 1884, Bogan was a ring leader in a cowboy's strike for better wages, which ended in all who took part being blacklisted, finding themselves unable to work in the Panhandle. Bogan rode to Wilbarger County, Texas, and joined up for a cattle drive as a drover, working for the Worsham R-2 Ranch. Cowboy T. J Burkett, also working on that drive, would years later comment that Bogan was a valuable hand to have, and that one night during a fierce thunderstorm, Bogan alone was able to hold 600 head of cattle from breaking into stampede. When the drive reached Dodge City, Kansas, and the cowboys were paid, they commenced to drink and party. Believing they were <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand,</b> Town Marshal Jack Bridges and his deputies confronted them and ran them out of town. This resulted in a brief gunfight between the lawmen and the cowboys, during which cowboy John Briley was shot and killed. Bogan and Burkett were both involved in that escapade, and the cowboys took no action in retaliation.|$|E
25|$|Oklahoma got {{the ball}} to begin the second half but {{immediately}} turned it over after the Miami defense sacked Jones and forced a fuma\ble at the Oklahoma 11-yard line. Miami recovered it and quickly converted it to a touchdown, taking the lead by a score of 14–10. Oklahoma {{was not able to}} answer and instead incurred two personal foul penalties forcing them into a fourth down with 42 yards to go. Miami took possession after the punt and capitalized with a third touchdown giving them an 11-point lead. Trying to prevent the game from <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand,</b> Oklahoma marched down the field after plays that included a 19-yard rush from Chris Brown, a 25-yard pass to Cameron Kenney, and a 21-yard pass to DeMarco Murray to score a touchdown to decrease the deficit to four. The score would remain unchanged until Oklahoma scored a field goal {{near the end of the}} fourth quarter on a drive that saw six consecutive running plays and one pass that gained no yards. Miami took possession of the ball with just over four minutes remaining in the game and were able to hold that possession until time expired giving them a one-point win.|$|E

500|$|Writing in {{the journal}} Antipodes, {{academics}} Felicity Holland and Jane O'Sullivan credit the film with exploring the themes of Australian masculinity, mateship, violence and sexuality. The film's portrayal of a rape and murder at a teenage party suggests that serious crime can arise from drinking and fun simply <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b> The violence, they say, erupts from extreme larikkinism rather than the archetypal psychopathy seen in other films featuring violence towards women. The film's critique of criminal masculinity undermines the status of previously celebrated masculine lawbreakers in Australian history and cinema, such as Ned Kelly and Mick Dundee. The authors believe that the focus on masculinity leaves the female victim largely out of the film; they consider the [...] "near erasure" [...] of Tracy to be a troubling aspect; the film instead focuses on portraying the males as victims of their class, masculinity and mateship.|$|E
500|$|Accum paid {{particular}} attention to beer, introducing the subject with the comment: [...] "Malt beverages, and especially port, the preferred drink of the inhabitants of London and other large cities, is among the items which is most frequently adulterated {{in the course of}} supply." [...] He claimed that English beer was occasionally mixed with molasses, honey, vitriol, pepper and even opium. Among the most shocking customs he pointed out was the practice of adding fishberries, part of the Menispermaceae family, to port. It became evident during the French Revolutionary Wars that the practice was <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand,</b> and Accum attributed the intoxicating power of the drink to the addition of this plant matter. Accum used various sources to substantiate his claims. As evidence for his claims about Cocculus indicus he used, among others, import statistics, which he complemented with observations about when the price of Cocculus indicus from commodity price lists of brewing materials merchants increased. He also looked at historic price trends for the same commodities.|$|E

60|$|Sometimes {{they agreed}} {{it was the}} {{newspapers}} that made war--that fanned every trivial difference into a vital question of national honour--that, whenever there was any fear of peace, re-stoked the fires of hatred with their never-failing stories of atrocities. At other times they decided it was the capitalists, the traders, scenting profit for themselves. Some held it was the politicians, dreaming of going down to history as Richelieus or as Bismarcks. A popular theory was that cause for war was always discovered by the ruling classes whenever there seemed danger that the workers were <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b> In war, you put the common people back in their place, revived in them the habits of submission and obedience. Napoleon the Little, it was argued, had started the war of 1870 with that idea. Russia had welcomed the present war as {{an answer to the}} Revolution that was threatening Czardom. Others contended it was the great munition industries, aided by the military party, the officers impatient for opportunities of advancement, the strategists eager to put their theories to the test. A few of the more philosophical shrugged their shoulders. It was the thing itself that sooner or later was bound to go off of its own accord. Half every country's energy, half every country's time and money was spent in piling up explosives. In every country envy and hatred of every other country was preached as a religion. They called it patriotism. Sooner or later the spark fell.|$|E

60|$|Now, {{it is very}} {{important}} to understand here that there were two courses of action still open to the disappointed capitalist confronted by the new peril of this real or alleged decay. First, he might have reversed his machine, so to speak, and started unwinding the long rope of dependence by which he had originally dragged the proletarian to his feet. In other words, he might have seen that the workmen had more money, more leisure, more luxuries, more status in the community, and then trusted to the normal instincts of reasonably happy human beings to produce a generation better born, bred and cared for than these tortured types that were less and less use to him. It might still not be too late to rebuild the human house upon such an architectural plan that poverty might fly out of the window, with the reasonable prospect of love coming in at the door. In short, he might have let the English poor, the mass of whom were not weak-minded, though more of them were growing weaker, a reasonable chance, in the form of more money, of achieving their eugenical resurrection themselves. It has never been shown, and it cannot be shown, that the method would have failed. But it can be shown, and it must be closely and clearly noted, that the method had very strict limitations from the employers' own point of view. If they made the worker too comfortable, he would not work to increase another's comforts; if they made him too independent, he would not work like a dependent. If, for instance, his wages were so good that he could save out of them, he might cease to be a wage-earner. If his house or garden were his own, he might stand an economic siege in it. The whole capitalist experiment had been built on his dependence; but now it was <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand,</b> not in the direction of freedom, but of frank helplessness. One might say that his dependence had got independent of control.|$|E
