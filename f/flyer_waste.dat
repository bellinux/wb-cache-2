For this purpose, 800 houseflies from 4 garbage sources in the city of Kerman (Hospital, urban, fruit and vegetable market, and slaughter house wastes) were collected each month for the period of 5 consecutive months. Both the external surface and digestive system of the collected flies were investigated for the presence of bacteria, fungi, protozoa and parasitic worms. Antibiogram test was performed on the collected bacteria. Escherichia coli, Proteus, gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus), Yeast and mycellial fungi, and amoebae cyst were found in the external surface of all collected flies. In the files collected from hospital garbages, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Giardia cyst, Ascaris and Oxyur ova were also found. The highest antibiotic resistance was observed against Pseudomonas and the highest sensitivity was observed in Streptococcus. Considering the per capita of hospital garbage production in Iran and its contamination to various types of microorganisms such as viruses transmitted by blood, the appropriate management of hospital garbage disposal in order to prevent the accumulation and multiplication of insects especially houseflies and consequently the prevention of various diseases and environmental pollution is highly recommended.
