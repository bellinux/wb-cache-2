40|$|The use of {{ammunition}} primed with depleted uranium {{is one of}} the hallmarks of modern combat operations, resulting in environmental contamination by particles of depleted uranium and uranium oxide, scattered around in the form of submicron-scale aerosols. This paper examined the protective effectiveness of the Serbian military's M 3 protective face mask in relation to the presence of airborne depleted uranium and its by-products. Sodium chloride in solid aerosol form was used as a test substance and adequate physical simulator of such radioactive aerosols because its granulometric (particle) size distribution met the requirements of suitability as a simulator. Determination of aerosol concentration was carried out by flame photometry method, whilst granulometric distribution was determined by an electric particles analyzer. It was established that the total internal leakage of the M 3 protective mask was as much a function of the penetration of particles through the combined M 3 filter as of the leaks along the fitting line of the user's face mask and the <b>inhalation</b> <b>valve.</b> In terms of its protective effect against aerosols of depleted uranium and associated oxides, the Serbian M 3 protective mask was determined to be of high efficiency and physiological suitability.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect on}} aerosol {{deposition}} from a pressurised {{metered dose inhaler}} of a 750 cm 3 spacer device with a one way <b>inhalation</b> <b>valve</b> (Nebuhaler, Astra Pharmaceuticals) was assessed {{by means of an}} in vivo radiotracer technique. Nine patients with obstructive lung disease took part in the study. The pattern of deposition associated with use of a metered dose inhaler alone was compared with that achieved with the spacer used both for inhalation of single puffs of aerosol and for inhalation of four puffs actuated in rapid succession and then inhaled simultane-ously. On each occasion there was a delay of 1 s between aerosol release and inhalation, simulat-ing poor inhaler technique. With the metered dose inhaler alone, a mean (SEM) 8 - 7 (1 - 8) % of the dose reached the lungs and 80 * 9 (1 9) % was deposited in the oropharynx. With single puffs from the spacer 20 - 9 (1. 6) % of the dose (p < 0. 01) reached the lungs, only 16 - 5 (2. 3) % (p < 0. 01) was deposited in the oropharynx, and 55 - 8 (3 1) % was retained within the spacer itself. With four puffs from the spacer 15 - 2 (1. 5) % reached the lungs (p = 0 - 02 compared with the metered dose inhaler alone, p < 0 - 01 compared with single puffs from the spacer), 11 - 4 (1. 2) % was deposited in the oropharynx, and 67 * 5 (1. 8) % in the device itself.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Some {{patients}} {{suffering from}} laryngeal cancer {{have to be}} treated with a total laryngectomy. As part of their rehabilitation of voice, a shunt valve can be placed between the trachea and oesophagus. If the patient wants to speak, the stoma is closed with a finger or thumb to force expired air through the shunt valve into the oesophagus. Soft tissue {{at the top of the}} oesophagus starts to vibrate and thus functions as new vocal folds. Some of these patients use an automatic tracheostoma valve (ATV) on their stoma. This enables them to speak without using their hands. The department of Biomedical Engineering of the University Medical Centre Groningen has developed a new ATV. This new ATV can be automatically closed by inhalation, in contrast to the currently used exhalation valves. By this means the patient should be able to save more air for phonation. The hypothesis is that patients are able to speak longer and louder using the new automatic tracheostoma valve. METHODS: To verify these expectations, 14 patients were equipped with a prototype of the new <b>inhalation</b> <b>valve</b> and a commercially available exhalation ATV. For every patient the phonation time, loudness, frequency, intratracheal pressure and flow during speech were measured for both valves. After this, patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire about which valve they preferred. RESULTS: There is no significant difference found in the measured parameters between both valves, but most patients are of the opinion that the new valve is more easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: The new inhalation speech valve proves to be comparable to the existing speech valve. Further development will result in an optimal product, which could be better than existing automatic tracheostoma valves.

50|$|Inhalation {{closes the}} {{mouthpiece}} exhalation non-return valve and draws gas through the <b>inhalation</b> non-return <b>valve.</b> The pressure drop draws {{the contents of}} the outer bellows through the scrubber, <b>inhalation</b> hose, non-return <b>valve</b> and mouthpiece to the diver. As the concentric bellows contract, the pressure in the inner bellows increases and first closes the internal non-return valve, then pushes its contents through the outer non-return valve, discharging to the surroundings.When the bellows is fully contracted, the bottom cover triggers the gas addition valves which inject gas until the diver stops inhaling and the bottom cover no longer presses against the addition valve actuator.If the gas in the breathing circuit has been compressed by an increase in depth, the gas volume will be even less and the addition valves will be triggered for longer, bringing the volume back to the appropriate level. The RB80 uses two addition valves in parallel, so that if one fails, the other will provide the required gas.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} <b>Inhalation</b> TracheoStoma <b>Valve</b> (TSV) {{is designed}} to facilitate finger-free tracheoesophageal speech. In contrast to existing models, the TSV closes by means of strong inhalation (instead of exhalation) to reach the “speaking position”. Inhaling air in this position is possible through a small one-way valve, thus allowing unlimited phonation time. The device can be deliberately changed to the “breathing position ” by a fast expiration. Experimental setups are used to measure in vitro and in vivo {{the performance of the}} Inhalation TSV. In patients, the Inhalation TSV is compared with existing TSVs for the parameters; air volume to close TSVs, speaking time of the TSVs and speaking volume of the TSVs. The device functions well in physiological ranges, is optimally adjustable and is an improvement regarding to existing devices. The Inhalation TSV makes inhalation in the “speaking position ” possible and saves up to 22 % of the total exhalation volume for speaking compared to existing TSVs...|$|R
40|$|Background. Speech valves {{help restore}} speech after {{surgical}} {{removal of the}} larynx (laryngectomy). Laryngectomized Patients breathe through an artificial opening (tracheostoma) in the neck. A shunt valve is routinely inserted between oesophagus and trachea to restore speech. At closure of the stoma with a finger, exhaled air is rerouted into the oesophagus, which will vibrate and form the new voice. Manual closure of the stoma attracts attention, requires one free hand and is unhygienic. Therefore automatic, hands-free speech valves are preferred. Present valves automatically close upon strong exhalation and open again when the pressure drops. This method wastes valuable air during closure and pressure should be maintained during speech, making long sentences or pauses impossible. The new iValve closes at strong inhalation. In speech mode, inhalation mid sentence is now made possible. The patient can speak almost as natural, pausing and whispering at will. The iValve automatic <b>inhalation</b> <b>valve</b> is a full silicone rubber, hands-free speech valve. The switching mechanism consists of a silicone rubber bi-stable valve shell. A prototype was tested in vitro. Method. 6 iValve prototype versions were tested in vitro at different settings. Closing flows, Opening pressures and air flow resistances were measured and compared with physiological values and the air flow resistance of two commercially available valves. Results. The iValve operates within physiological pressures and flows. Air flow resistance in breath mode was good, yet higher than the two commercial valves. Resistance in speech mode was above physiological air flow resistance. Conclusions. The iValve works and can be adjusted within physiological ranges. Pressures and flows can be independently controlled. Air flow resistance in speech mode should, and can, be decreased. The full silicone rubber mechanism is a viable novel design approach. The iValve offers a more intuitively useable alternative with more dynamic speech...|$|E

It is concluded that the spacer device gives lung deposition of metered dose aerosols comparable to or greater than a correctly used inhaler and oropharyngeal deposition is greatly reduced.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{requirements}} is to ensure the safe use of respirators and dust masks. They cover use, inspection, maintenance, and storage. They apply to workers and supervisors. 2 Requirements 2. 1 Use Respirators are issued to individual workers for protection against airborne contaminant(s), only after authorization and completion of required respiratory medical evaluation, training, and a practical fit test. Respirators must not be worn for any other purpose without the knowledge and approval of the supervisor and the ESH coordinator. Authorization to use a respirator, including medical evaluation, training, and fit testing, must be renewed each year. Changes in respirator used, work conditions, or the worker’s physical condition may require repeating some of the authorization process. (See Respiratory Protection: Evaluation and Certification Procedure.) 2. 2 Inspection Workers must inspect their respirators before and after use. Respirator inspections must include checking that 1. Sealing surface are clean and free of cracks and holes 2. Rubber and elastic parts have good pliability and no signs of deterioration 3. <b>Inhalation</b> and exhalation <b>valves</b> are clean and seated properly 4. Straps are sufficiently elastic and free of worn areas 5. If full face, face shield is cleaned and clear (no smudges, scratches, or other damage that may impede visibility) Respirators that fail an inspection must be removed from service and replaced...|$|R
