25|$|For this to happen, Yoong {{signed with}} Shane Beikoff racing {{to compete in}} the final three rounds of the Konica Minolta series. Testing at Queensland Raceway gave Yoong his V8 Supercar debut in a Ford Falcon AU at Eastern Creek. After {{qualifying}} in 17th, he got into 13th {{at the start of the}} race but a collision with a fellow competitor saw Yoong drop two places. The damage caused the car to sit out for the rest of the weekend, but Yoong bounced back at Queensland Raceway to start ninth. The race was more eventful as he dropped to 25th and lapped after his car was stuck in <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> and an incident with Kevin Mundy on lap one meant he was unable to finish higher than 10th. The third race saw an 18th-place finish.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{final drive ratio}} for {{vehicles}} equipped with the 7-speed automatic has been (numerically) reduced from 3.69 to 3.36, the new 7-speed automatic has much lower first through <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> overall ratios than the old 5-speed automatic and the 6-speed manual in the 6MT cars (which retain the old 3.69 final drive ratio). Giving it closer gear ratios in all gears, to match engine rpm better with power demand, brings better acceleration while overdrive ratios in 6th and 7th gears reduces highway cruising rpm and improves fuel mileage. The new 7-speed automatic retains the Drive Sport (DS) shift mode and Downshift Rev Matching (DRM) feature of the previous 5-speed automatic. Paddle shifters are standard on G37S models equipped with the 7-speed automatic. The new engine/transmission combo did add some weight the car (3,590lb. for the G37 vs. 3,508 for the G35 in identical trim).|$|E
25|$|Shastri {{continued}} as vice captain to Kapil Dev in the 1985–86 season. This {{season and the}} England tour of 1986 were ordinary ones for him. Australia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan toured India in 1986–87. Shastri {{played a crucial role}} in the Tied Test at Madras against Australia, scoring 62 and 48*. When Indian middle order collapsed and India fell behind the run rate, his two sixes in quick succession off off–spinner Greg Matthews came in handy. In the final Test at Bombay he scored 121*. As was becoming increasingly common, it was played in first and <b>fourth</b> <b>gear.</b> He hung around for around 30 minutes for the last run for his fifty and twice as long in the nineties. Yet he hit six sixes, three of which came after he completed his hundred. The huge six off left arm fast bowler Bruce Reid – a cross batted heave that went over longon – was particularly memorable. Six sixes in an innings was an Indian record at the time. But he was outshone by Dilip Vengsarkar who scored 164* in the same innings. They added a record 298* for the sixth wicket.|$|E

2500|$|In 1937, Oldsmobile was {{a pioneer}} in {{introducing}} a four-speed semi-automatic transmission called the [...] "Automatic Safety Transmission", although this accessory was actually built by Buick, which would offer it in its own cars in 1938.

25|$|The Range Rover used {{permanent}} four-wheel drive, {{rather than}} the switchable rear-wheel/four-wheel drive on Land Rover Series vehicles, and had a lever for switching ratios on the transfer box for off-road use. Originally, the only gearbox available was a four-speed manual unit, until Fairey overdrive became an option after 1977. A three-speed Chrysler TorqueFlite automatic gearbox became an option in 1982, which was upgraded to a 4-speed ZF box in 1985, coupled to an LT230 transfer box. The other major transmission upgrade in the Range Rover's lifetime was the switch from the LT95 combined four-speed manual gearbox and transfer box to the LT77 five-speed gearbox and separate LT230 transfer box in 1983. The LT230 was later used on both the Defender and Discovery models, but was replaced on the Range Rover by a Borg Warner chain-driven transfer box incorporating an automatic viscous coupling limited slip differential - earlier transmissions had a manual differential lock (operated by a vacuum servo on the LT95 and mechanically on the LT230). The LT77 had two major design changes: first an upgrade to larger bearings for the layshaft and new ratios around 1988, then a newly designed synchro hub for third and <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> and double synchros for first and second. This {{is also known as}} the suffix H gearbox or LT77s.|$|E
500|$|The 1992 Hooters 500, {{the final}} {{race of the}} 1992 season, is {{considered}} one of the most eventful races in NASCAR history. It was the final race for Richard Petty and the first for Jeff Gordon. Sixdrivers were close enough in the points standings to win the championship that day. Allison led second-place Kulwicki by 30 points, Bill Elliott by 40, Harry Gant by 97, and Kyle Petty by 98 and needed to finish sixth or better to clinch the championship. Kulwicki received approval from NASCAR and Ford to change the [...] "Thunderbird" [...] lettering on his bumper for the race to [...] "underbird" [...] because he felt like the underdog in the contention for the championship. During Kulwicki's first pit stop, the first gear in the car's transmission broke. Andrews said, [...] "We had to leave pit road in <b>fourth</b> <b>gear,</b> because we had broken metal parts in there, and only by leaving it in fourth are you not going to move metal around as much. We could only hope that the loose piece of metal didn't get in there and break the gears in half. We had three or fourpit stops after it broke. I held my breath all day long." [...] Allison was racing in sixthplace, closely behind Ernie Irvan, when Irvan's tire blew with 73 (of 328) laps left in the event. As a result, Allison ran into the side of Irvan's spinning car and his car was too damaged to continue. Kulwicki and Elliott were left to duel for the title. While leading late in the race, Andrews calculated the exact lap for his final pit stop so that Kulwicki would be guaranteed to lead the most laps and would gain fivebonus points. Kulwicki made his final pit stop only after leading enough laps to guarantee the bonus points. To save time, the pit crew did a fuel-only pit stop. Not changing tires allowed them to be available to push the car to prevent it from stalling, since the car had to start moving in a higher gear. Because the team's fuel man hurried to add the gasoline during the quick stop, he did not add the desired amount into the tank. As a result, Kulwicki had to conserve fuel to ensure that his car was still running at the end of the race. Elliott won the race and Kulwicki stretched his fuel to finish second. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by maintaining his 10-point lead over Elliott. He celebrated the championship with his second Polish victory lap. Always conscious of his appearance for potential sponsors, Kulwicki combed his hair, making a national television audience wait for him to emerge from his car.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors {{then got}} serious {{in this type}} of racing and signed up James Garner's [...] "American International Racers" [...] (AIR) team to a three-year contract. Garner's shops {{prepared}} ten 1969 SC/Ramblers provided by AMC. The cars were modified for the punishing Baja 500 race. Raising the suspension and using Goodyear tires on 10x15-inch wheels increased ground clearance. All window glass was removed and roll cages were installed. The cars had [...] fuel tanks. Two cars were further modified with four-wheel drive. The AIR team built AMC's [...] V8 engines to blueprint tolerances, thus increasing horsepower to [...] at the flywheel.

50|$|The TR6 {{featured}} a four-speed manual transmission. An optional electrically switched overdrive operated on second, third, and <b>fourth</b> <b>gears</b> on early models and {{third and fourth}} on later ones. Construction was traditional frame. Other features included semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension, rack and pinion steering, 15 in wheels and tires, pile carpet on floors and trunk/boot, bucket seats, and full instrumentation. Brakes were discs at the front and drums at the rear. A factory steel hardtop was optional, requiring two people to deploy. The dashboard was walnut veneer. Other factory options included a rear anti-roll bar and a limited-slip differential.|$|R
5000|$|... 1955 - The Second generation, 20 Series was introduced. It was {{designed}} to have more civilian appeal than the BJ for export reasons. It also had more stylish bodywork and a better ride thanks to longer four-plate leaf springs which had been adapted from the Toyota Light Truck. It had a more powerful [...] 3.9 L six-cylinder Type F gasoline engine, but still only had a three speed gearbox. The interior of the vehicles were made more comfortable by moving the engine 120 mm forward. The 20 Series still had no low range, but it had synchronism on the third and <b>fourth</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... 1982 saw {{the debut}} of the “Cross-Fire Injection” fuel {{delivery}} system. This TBI (Throttle Body Fuel Injection) was {{not the type of}} fuel injection installed previously in some C1 and C2 Corvettes. It utilized two throttle bodies combined with Chevrolet’s computer control system. The engine produced [...] and was mated to a new four-speed automatic transmission with torque converters bypass in the top three gears. Compared to the previous Turbo-Hydramatic 3-speed, the new 700-R4 transmission had a lower first and second gear for improved low-end acceleration, and a <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> overdrive that would reduce engine RPM by 30 percent at highway cruising speeds, resulting in better fuel economy. On the downside, the new transmission was not considered a strong unit and proved problematic. The final model C3 Corvette's published performance numbers were 0-60 in 7.9seconds-the quarter-mile in 16.1 @ [...] This was the last year for 8-track tape availability and new “cross-fire injection” emblems appeared on front fenders.

2500|$|On lap 17, battling over seventh {{place as}} they {{approached}} the last left-hander before the pits, Piquet's Brabham was nearly touching the back of Reutemann's Williams. Piquet got around Reutemann on the inside when Reutemann, fighting for the Championship, braked early. [...] On the next lap, Andretti also went by Reutemann. Piquet put himself in a position to score points when he took over sixth place from John Watson on lap 22. Reutemann continued to slip backwards with gearbox trouble, having lost <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> as early as lap two. Reutemann finished the race in eighth, a lap down, and the title went to Piquet. However, if that year's season opener, the 1981 South African Grand Prix, had have been a race with World Championship Points awarded, Reutemann would have been World Champion with 58 Points against Piquet's 56. He returned with Williams for 1982, finishing [...] second in the South Africa, the only Cosworth-engined runner able to take the fight to the much more powerful turbo-engined Renaults. The Falklands War, however, generated a tense political period between Argentina and the United Kingdom, and Reutemann chose to distance himself from the team and retire after the Brazilian race. In light of the further developments that took place in Reutemann's life, many felt that his decision to terminate his racing career was made with an eye to his future in politics. This is disputed by Williams's Chief Designer Patrick Head, who felt that the Falklands War was only an excuse and that Reutemann had simply retired because [...] "his heart wasn't in it anymore".|$|E
2500|$|During {{a safety}} car {{situation}} on Lap 160 of the 2012 Daytona 500, Earnhardt Ganassi Racing driver Juan Pablo Montoya's car had a suspension part failure, and it lost control on turn 3, sharply veering {{right into a}} safety truck and jet dryer trailer, causing a massive diesel/jet fuel fire. As it was seen on video, sparks were seen emanating from Montoya's car right before its hard collision with the jet dryer trailer and left driver's side of the truck. Montoya was treated at the infield care center and released. Montoya's report over the radio after the incident was [...] "I left the pits and felt a really weird vibration and I came back in and checked the rear end {{and said it was}} okay and I got into the backstraight and we were are going <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> but wasn't going that fast. Every time I got on the gas I could feel the rear squeezing. When I was telling the spotter to have a look how the rear was moving the car just turned right." [...] The driver of the Chevrolet Silverado Crew Cab, Duane Barnes, was taken to a local hospital for observation and was resting comfortably. He was an employee at Michigan International Speedway, a sister track of Daytona. The tracks often share jet dryer equipment on race weekends to help in case of rain such as the case on Sunday, the original scheduled start time of the race. The entire incident took about two hours to clean up before the last 40 (later extended to 42 due to a Green-white-checkered finish) laps were able to be completed.|$|E
25|$|A March 1985 light {{facelift}} {{brought a}} new asymmetrical grille (although not for the Cabriolet) and some interior improvements. The E and E II models were replaced by the new E III, while a lower priced U model joined the lineup. The U was the only non-commercial City to be available with a four-speed manual in the Japanese domestic market. Naturally aspirated engines in the AA Citys also gained a new fiber-reinforced aluminum alloy connecting rods ("FRM"), a world first in series production. One month later, the R became available with the interesting Hypershift transmission, a four-speed with an electronically controlled overdrive on second, third, and <b>fourth</b> <b>gears</b> - in essence creating a 7-speed gearbox.|$|R
50|$|Press {{comment in}} a country where {{technical}} innovation generates enthusiasm was very positive in respect of the car’s status as the world’s first production car to be fitted with a belt driven camshaft, but criticised the unresponsiveness of the standard drum brakes and the heavy clutch. The car’s tendency to pitch under acceleration or sharp braking which was attributed to its short wheel base also drew criticism as did the “back to front” gear box which, as on the existing Isar, had originally been intended for a (never produced except as a prototype) front-wheel-drive small car and accordingly positioned first and third gears nearest to the driver, with second and <b>fourth</b> <b>gears</b> nearest the front of the car.|$|R
5000|$|The Series IIA Lightweight was {{replaced}} by the Series III Lightweight in 1972, soon after the replacement of the civilian Series IIA with the Series III. The vehicle remained in essence the same, with a few relatively minor changes - there are detail differences to the chassis; and a revised gearbox had syncromesh on second through <b>fourth</b> <b>gears</b> instead of just third and fourth. In the electrical department the Series III was fitted with an alternator in place of the dynamo of the Series IIa; the new indicator switch incorporates a headlamp flasher and horn; and the ignition switch was now fitted in a new steering column cowl instead of on the dashboard. The Lightweight did retain the earlier Series IIa metal dashboard even after the upgrade. Around 1980, in line with civilian models, the engine had five main bearings instead of three.|$|R
2500|$|By 1941, {{after an}} {{increase}} in aluminium prices of forty percent, an internal report at Citroën showed that producing the TPV post-war would not be economically viable, given the projected further increasing cost of aluminium. Boulanger decided to redesign the car to use mostly steel with flat panels, instead of aluminium. The Nazis had attempted to loot Citroën's press tools; this was frustrated after Boulanger got the French Resistance to re-label the rail cars containing them in the Paris marshalling yard. They ended up all over Europe, and Citroën {{was by no means}} sure they would all be returned after the war. In early 1944 Boulanger made the decision to abandon the water-cooled two-cylinder engine developed for the car and installed in the 1939 versions. Walter Becchia was now briefed to design an air-cooled unit, still of two cylinders, and still of 375cc. Becchia was also supposed to design a three-speed gearbox, but managed to design a four-speed for the same space at little extra cost. At this time small French cars like the Renault Juvaquatre and Peugeot 202 usually featured three-speed transmissions, as did Citroën's own mid-size Traction Avant - but the 1936 Italian Fiat 500 [...] "Topolino" [...] "people's car" [...] did have a four-speed gearbox. Becchia persuaded Boulanger that the <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> was an overdrive. The increased number of gear ratios also helped to pull the extra weight of changing from light alloys to steel for the body and chassis. Other changes included seats with tubular steel frames with rubber band springing and a restyling of the body by the Italian Flaminio Bertoni. Also, in 1944 the first studies of the Citroën hydro-pneumatic suspension were conducted using the TPV/2CV.|$|E

5000|$|Mixing of gearsets can be {{achieved}} due to the similarity between the various transmissions, but some gears must be interchanged in sets. First and second gear are integral to the input shaft and cannot be interchanged independently. All transmissions have a third gear ratio of 1.38:1. However, third and <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> are clustered on the counter shaft which was available with two different <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> ratios: 1.03:1 or [...]94:1. Fifth gear is independently interchangeable and available with a [...]80:1 and [...]72:1 ratio.|$|E
50|$|Long chassis cars {{came with}} {{different}} transmission ratios whereby the 1:1 ratio matched <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> {{and there was}} no overdrive. The final drive ratio was also raised for the longer cars.|$|E
50|$|The Lancer WRC05 saw no {{significant}} changes, but the car's width was increased by 30 mm {{due to a}} change in the WRC regulations. The engine remained the same, but the ECU and the turbo wastegate were updated. Aerodynamic alterations to the bodywork were introduced to improve stability and to accommodate the new, wider track, while suspension links and driveshafts were lengthened. Steering-mounted gearshift paddles were also introduced, and longer ratios were adopted for first, third and <b>fourth</b> <b>gears.</b> The car showed great promise, since Panizzi took 3rd place in Monte Carlo, and ex-Peugeot man Rovanpera was fast on gravel events, eventually clinching a 2nd place at the last round in Australia, but soon after that Mitsubishi pulled out of the WRC, and only returned through Ralliart UK, who took over the cars and supported private and semi-works entries in 2006 and 2007. At the Swedish WRC-event in 2006, local rallydriver Daniel Carlsson made podium with a 3rd place in the Värmland forests, in such an entry. Daniel battled for seconds, just into finish line, with team mate Gigi Galli, who settled for fourth spot.|$|R
5000|$|It had {{the body}} of the later [...] "TR3A". Two series were produced: one with a {{commission}} number preceded by TSF of which 530 were produced. Of these 530 the last 29 were built as Triumph Italia's; one with commission numbers preceded by TCF of which 2804 were produced. Both series were partly produced in parallel. The TSF series were identical to the last run of TR3As, so with a two-litre engine and non-synchronized 1st gear transmission. The TCF series has the 2.138-litre TR4 engine.
