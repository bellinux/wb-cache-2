50|$|Meteorites {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tools that cosmochemists have for studying the chemical nature of the Solar System. Many meteorites come from material that is as old as the Solar System itself, and thus provide scientists with a record from the <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> <b>nebula.</b> Carbonaceous chondrites are especially primitive; that is they have retained many of their chemical properties since their formation 4.56 billion years ago, and are therefore a major focus of cosmochemical investigations.|$|E
5000|$|Cosmochemistry (from Greek κόσμος kósmos, [...] "universe" [...] and χημεία khemeía) or {{chemical}} cosmology {{is the study}} of the chemical composition of matter in the universe and the processes that led to those compositions. This is done primarily through the study of the chemical composition of meteorites and other physical samples. Given that the asteroid parent bodies of meteorites were some of the first solid material to condense from the <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> <b>nebula,</b> cosmochemists are generally, but not exclusively, concerned with the objects contained within the Solar System.|$|E

In the examination of the effects of solar wind implantations the topics covered include (1) solar wind radiation damage parameters and their aging characteristics, (2) the theory of the ancient solar wind, (3) the solar wind sputtering erosion rate, (4) the physicochemical properties of amorphous coatings, (5) maturity indexes and the macroscopic properties of the lunar regolith, (6) solar wind gas bubbles, (7) the composition of very heavy nuclei in the contemporary solar wind, and (8) track aging processes.

40|$|The exact {{process of}} {{chondrule}} formation {{is still not}} known. The most common scenarios are formation in a protoplanetary nebular environment: e. g. X-wind model [1] or nebular shock fronts, where precursor grains are heated by collisions with gas [2]. Most chondrules probably have been heated to 1500 – 1600 ºC, followed by a cooling rate of usually between 10 to 1000 ºC/h [3]. In this part of our study about the formation of chondrules by shock processes, we try to simulate the formation of chondrules by gas-grain collisions in a nebular environment. Earlier, related studies usually {{did not result in}} chondrulelike objects[4]. In a first series of experiments using plasma arcs, we produced successfully spherical silicate droplets in a simple set-up under atmospheric conditions. These chondrule-like objects already show similarities to actual chondrules [5]. In a second series, the experiments take place in an environment closer to the <b>earlier</b> <b>solar</b> <b>nebula,</b> at low pressure and a reducing environment. ...|$|R
40|$|One {{fundamental}} {{controversy about}} terrestrial planet and asteroid formation is {{the discrepancy between}} meteoritical evidence for high temperatures (1500 to 2000 K) in the inner <b>solar</b> <b>nebula,</b> and much lower theoretical temperature predictions {{on the basis of}} models of viscous accretion disks that neglect compressional heating of infalling gas. It is shown here that rigorous numerical calculations of the collapse of a rotating, three-dimensional presolar nebula are capable of producing temperatures on the order of 1500 K in the asteroid region (2. 5 astronomical units), in either nearly axisymmetric or strongly nonaxisymmetric nebula models. The latter models may permit significant thermal cycling of solid components in the <b>early</b> inner <b>solar</b> <b>nebula...</b>|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} mission's science {{objectives}} {{refer to the}} composition of the Sun, not that of the solar wind. Scientists desire a sample of the Sun because evidence suggests that the outer layer of the Sun preserves {{the composition of the}} <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> <b>nebula.</b> Therefore, knowing the elemental and isotopic composition of the outer layer of the Sun is effectively the same as knowing the elemental and isotopic composition of the solar nebula. The data can be used to model how planets and other Solar System objects formed, and then extend those results to understanding stellar evolution and the formation of planetary systems elsewhere in the universe.|$|E
5000|$|Gehlenite {{is found}} in {{carbonaceous}} chondrites from which it condensed as a refractory mineral in the hotter stages (FU Ori) of the presolar nebula, and was subsequently consumed in processes which created enstatite and other more abundant minerals making it a remnant mineral from the <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> <b>nebula</b> (along with corundum and spinel). Its occurrence in the early condensation phase of the solar nebula was predicted by Harry Lord in the 1950s, but studies of carbonaceous chondrites did not support this claim until the Allende meteorite was discovered in 1969. [...] It {{is also found in}} diorite intruded carbonate rocks, and to a far lesser extent in uncompahgrites, melilitites, alnoites, lamprophyres and possibly kimberlite pipes.|$|E
40|$|Abiotic {{generation}} of complex organic compounds, in the <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> <b>nebula</b> that formed our solar system, is hypothesized {{by some to}} occur via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. In its simplest form, FT synthesis involves the low temperature (300 degC) produces FT products that include lesser amounts of n-alkanes and greater alkene, alcohol, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds. We have begun to experimentally investigate FT synthesis {{in the context of}} abiotic {{generation of}} organic compounds in the <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> <b>nebula.</b> It is generally thought that the <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> <b>nebula</b> included abundant hydrogen and carbon monoxide gases and nano-particulate matter such as iron and metal silicates that could have catalyzed the FT reaction. The effect of FT reaction temperature, catalyst type, and experiment duration on the resulting products is being investigated. These solid organic products are analyzed by thermal-stepwise pyrolysis-GCMS and yield the types and distribution of hydrocarbon compounds released as a function of temperature. We show how the FT products vary by reaction temperature, catalyst type, and experimental duration and compare these products to organic compounds found to be indigenous to ordinary chondrite meteorites. We hypothesize that the origin of organics in some chondritic meteorites, that represent an aggregation of materials from the early solar system, may at least in part be from FT synthesis that occurred in the <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> <b>nebula...</b>|$|E

40|$|Aluminium {{loves to}} exist as an oxide, Al 2 O 3. This oxide was {{probably}} the first refractory phase to condense from the <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> <b>nebulae.</b> Rubies and sapphires (Al 2 O 3, corundum) are hard and stable naturally-occurring precious minerals. Bauxite (an impure hydrated form of Al 2 O 3) needs to be coerced, {{at the expense of}} 125 - 210 GJ energy usage and 10 - 22. 5 t CO 2 emissions through the entire extraction process (in particular, energy production for the Hall- Héroult electrolytic refining stage), into the final form of a 1 tonne bundle of purity Al ingot ex. smelter. Aluminium is therefore quaintly (and often disparagingly) referred to as 'solidified electricity', implying the need to be extremely cautious with its use since {{it is one of the}} most energy-intensive engineering materials. Fortunately, aluminium alloys have also had good press, being highly versatile and durable in service and being readily recyclable (at about 5 % of the energy required to produce the primary Al initially). However, the ground is shifting and with the growing focus on embodied energy and carbon footprints, aluminium's processing and use is being revisited...|$|R

Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) using negative Au primary ion was applied to in situ oxygen isotope ratio analysis on a polished thin section of the CAI. Present data indicate that O isotope composition is homogeneous inside of fassaite grains as well as among grains in the HN 3 - 1 CAI, and that the delta(exp 18) O value (- 24. 14 percent relative to SMOW) determined previously could be applied to most fassaite grains. The results suggest that most fassaite grains are preexisting solids like spinel grains...|$|R

The CONSERT radar was designed to probe the interior of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with a wavelength of about 3 meters. It was successfully operated during the First Science Sequence of the Rosetta mission when the CONSERT’s wave propagated through part of the nucleus’ small lobe. The shape of the received signals provides some hints about the internal structure of the comet's small lobe. The limited broadening observed on the received pulses is compared to simulations performed {{on a series of}} non-homogeneous nucleus models to put constrains on the potential structures at the wavelength's scale.

Attention is given to the evolution of the primitive <b>solar</b> <b>nebula,</b> the instabilities in the primitive <b>solar</b> <b>nebula,</b> and the giant gaseous protoplanets.

40|$|Comets, such as Hale-Bopp (C/ 1995 O 1), {{are frozen}} {{reservoirs}} of primitive <b>solar</b> <b>nebula</b> dust grains and ices. Analysis {{of the composition}} of cometary dust grains from infrared spectroscopic techniques permits an estimation {{of the types of}} organic and inorganic materials that constituted the <b>early</b> primitive <b>solar</b> <b>nebula.</b> In addition, the cometary bombardment of the Earth (approximately 3. 5 Gy ago) supplied the water for the oceans and brought organic materials to Earth which may have been biogenic. Spectroscopic observations of comet Hale-Bopp suggest the possible presence of organic hydrocarbon species, silicate and olivine dust grains, and water ice. Spectroscopy near 3 microns obtained in Nov 1996 r= 2. 393 AU, delta= 3. 034 AU) shows a feature which we attribute to PAH emission. The spatial morphology of the 3. 28 microns PAH feature is also presented. Optical and infrared spectrophotometric observations of comets convey valuable information about the spatial distribution and properties of dust and gas within the inner coma. In the optical and NIR shortward of 2 microns, the observed light is primarily scattered sunlight from the dust grains. At longer wavelengths, particularly in the 10 gm window, thermal emission from these grains dominates the radiation allowing an accurate estimate of grain sizes and chemical composition. Here we present an initial analysis of spectra taken with the NASA HIFOGS at 7 - 14 microns as part of a multiwavelength temporal study of the "comet of the century"...|$|R

30|$|We {{assume that}} loosely-bound {{aggregates}} of micrometersized cosmic grains underwent heating {{events in the}} <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> system. This assumption is supported by several aspects of today’s understanding of the <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> system. At first, an important fraction of the dust condensed from the gas phase, a process which required an initially hot <b>solar</b> <b>nebula.</b> In this environment, a dust aggregation started; such processes of aggregation have been investigated in detail in order to describe terrestrial planet formation (e.g., Weidenschilling and Cuzzi, 1993). Moreover, meteoritic chondrule formation indicates that there were heating events {{in the same period}} and in the same material reservoir that transformed dust aggregates to melt spherules. Today, frictional heating by shocks in the <b>solar</b> <b>nebula</b> is favored among the numerous hypotheses on chondrule formation (Boss, 1996; Ciesla, 2005). With respect to the following, we add that the hypothesis that heating happened by lightning-like gas discharges is still under serious discussion. Finally, a general hint for heating events of cosmic dust in the <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> system are FU Orionis outbursts (e.g., Bell et al., 2000), which are an increase of luminosity for years or decades which solar-type stars undergo in their period of formation.|$|R

It is found that FTT reactions account reasonably well for all well-established features of organic matter in meteorites investigated.

It is shown that the <b>early</b> <b>solar</b> <b>nebula</b> was incompletely mixed and contained debris which was injected from a stellar source at most a few million years prior to the formation of the solar system. The average solar system material consists of ambient interstellar material deficient in certain nuclear species to which a small fraction of freshly synthesized material was added.

Accretional detrital remanent magnetization (ADRM) operates via “compass needle”-type alignment of ferromagnetic solids with locally uniform background fields in the <b>solar</b> <b>nebula.</b> Accretion of coherently aligned magnetic particles should have formed aggregates up to centimeters in size with significant net magnetic moment. We quantify several processes that constrain the likelihood of ADRM formation, finding that rotational gas damping and background field intensities expected for the <b>solar</b> <b>nebula</b> are sufficient to mutually align magnetic particles with diameters between ∼ 30 μm and several cm. The lower bound is dictated by Brownian motion or radiative torque while the upper bound is set by aerodynamic torque on non-spherical particles. Processes important for interstellar dust dynamics such as Larmor-type precession and Purcell torque are less significant in the <b>solar</b> <b>nebula.</b> ADRM can be potentially observed as zones of coherent magnetization in primitive chondrites and may be detected by spacecraft magnetic field observations on the surfaces of small bodies.
