Her guns were still above water, which allowed her to support the defending German army against British <b>ground</b> <b>forces</b> until {{the final days of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{invasion}} of Khafji was initially a propaganda victory for the Ba'athist Iraqi government, it was swiftly recaptured by Saudi <b>ground</b> <b>forces.</b> The battle serves as a modern demonstration that air power in a supporting role to <b>ground</b> <b>forces</b> can be of great assistance in halting and defeating a major ground operation.|$|E

5|$|McNair had {{established}} Army <b>Ground</b> <b>Forces</b> headquarters at the Army War College campus, where Devers lived, but Stilwell had moved the headquarters into the Pentagon. Eisenhower, {{as the new}} Chief of Staff of the Army, decided that the Army <b>Ground</b> <b>Forces</b> headquarters should be co-located with the Army Air Forces' Tactical Air Command, so it was moved to Fort Monroe, Virginia, not far from Langley Field. Devers opened his headquarters there on 1 October 1946. Further reorganization occurred on 10 March 1948, when Army <b>Ground</b> <b>Forces</b> was renamed Army Field Forces. Control of the armies {{was transferred to the}} Department of the Army, and Army Field Forces was reduced to a coordinating staff agency.|$|E

5|$|The Army Service Forces was {{abolished}} on 14 May 1946, on {{the recommendation}} of War Department's Simpson Board, but the Army <b>Ground</b> <b>Forces</b> remained. Devers' November 1945 testimony before the board had urged that the Army Service Forces be retained. Army <b>Ground</b> <b>Forces</b> was given control of the six armies in the United States, but as demobilization gathered pace, the strength of the army shrank dramatically. Devers was faced with the unpleasant task of informing many officers that they were being demoted. One reform that he did achieve was {{to reduce the number of}} combat branches to just three: infantry, armor and artillery.|$|E

5|$|The Vietnam War saw the {{introduction}} of helicopter gunships which could be employed to support ground based forces, and the experience gained in Vietnam would spawn the creation of several aircraft {{during and after the}} war designed specifically to aid <b>ground</b> <b>forces,</b> including the AC-47 Spooky, Fairchild AC-119, Lockheed AC-130, and A-10 Thunderbolt II, all of which are operated by the Air Force, and the F/A-18 Hornet which is operated by the navy. In addition, the army and marine corps operate UH-1 Iroquois, AH-1 Cobra, and AH-64 Apache helicopters for close air support, and these helicopters can be stationed onboard amphibious assault ships to provide ship-to-shore air support for <b>ground</b> <b>forces.</b> These aircraft would later prove instrumental in aiding <b>ground</b> <b>forces</b> from the 1980s onwards, and would be involved in the 1991 Gulf War, the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
