Because morphological congruence of aforementioned species to other Trigonochilum representatives we propose to maintain them temporarily in this genus.|$|R
5|$|As cases {{cannot be}} stacked in Wagiman, these number suffixes cannot be called case suffixes, whereas the nominal suffixes <b>discussed</b> <b>above</b> (such as -binyju 'only'), {{show the same}} {{syntactic}} distribution - they occur {{in the same place}} - and therefore may be analysed as cases themselves.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} goal of measuring enzyme kinetics {{is to determine}} the chemical mechanism of an enzyme reaction, i.e., the sequence of chemical steps that transform substrate into product. The kinetic approaches <b>discussed</b> <b>above</b> will show at what rates intermediates are formed and inter-converted, but they cannot identify exactly what these intermediates are.|$|E
5|$|Classically, {{algebraic}} {{functions are}} defined by an algebraic equation, and transcendental functions (including those <b>discussed</b> <b>above)</b> {{are defined by}} some property that holds for them, such as a differential equation. For example, the exponential function is the function which is equal to its own derivative everywhere, and assumes the value 1 at the origin. However, one may equally well define an analytic function by its Taylor series.|$|E

5|$|During the {{modernization}} in the 1980s, three important weapons {{were added to}} the Iowa-class battleships. The first was the CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system <b>discussed</b> <b>above.</b> The other two were missiles for use against both land and sea targets. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly. As has been <b>discussed</b> <b>above,</b> some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle. Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat, and marched as quickly as possible back to Athens.|$|E
5|$|Photons {{have many}} {{applications}} in technology. These examples are chosen to illustrate applications of photons per se, rather than general optical {{devices such as}} lenses, etc. that could operate under a classical theory of light. The laser is an extremely important application and is <b>discussed</b> <b>above</b> under stimulated emission.|$|E
30|$|The first {{improved}} {{algorithm is}} designed for window in RANGE mode, named range-based global sampling algorithm (RGSA). As we <b>discuss</b> <b>above,</b> range mode is able {{to ensure that the}} data is clean, which is friendly in statistical calculations. And we don’t need to adjust the window boundaries, because the nature of the range window ensures that the exact boundary can be found. So all operations are the same as dealing with normal windows. For more information, refer to algorithm 3. Here we just give the basic version.|$|R

We <b>discuss</b> <b>above</b> the pulse energy effect on tip apex temperature and pulse frequency may also affect it since it directly correlates to cooling time between pulses [29, 30]. The second-order interactions between base temperature and laser pulse energy and also laser pulse frequency are less important and have less effect on reducing the quantity H [...]...|$|R

5|$|Proto-Germanic *xalja-wītjan (or *halja-wītjan) is reconstructed from Old Norse hel-víti 'hell', Old English helle-wíte 'hell-torment, hell', Old Saxon helli-wīti 'hell', and the Middle High German {{feminine}} noun helle-wīze. The compound is {{a compound}} of *xaljō (<b>discussed</b> <b>above)</b> and *wītjan (reconstructed from forms such as Old English witt 'right mind, wits', Old Saxon gewit 'understanding', and Gothic un-witi 'foolishness, understanding').|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} of the bright portion of the nebula is primarily caused by the interaction of a fast stellar wind being emitted by the central PNN with the visible material ejected during {{the formation of the}} nebula. This interaction causes the emission of X-rays <b>discussed</b> <b>above.</b> The stellar wind, blowing with the velocity as high as , has 'hollowed out' the inner bubble of the nebula, and appears to have burst the bubble at both ends.|$|E

5|$|As <b>discussed</b> <b>above,</b> any non-pseudoforest graph {{contains}} as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted {{to form a}} butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted to form a diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E
5|$|As <b>discussed</b> <b>above,</b> in the PostgreSQL {{implementation}} of SQL, Null {{is used to}} represent all UNKNOWN results, including the UNKNOWN BOOLEAN. PostgreSQL does not implement the UNKNOWN literal (although it does implement the IS UNKNOWN operator, which is an orthogonal feature.) Most other major vendors {{do not support the}} Boolean type (as defined in T031) as of 2012. The procedural part of Oracle's PL/SQL supports BOOLEAN however variables; these can also be assigned NULL and the value is considered the same as UNKNOWN.|$|E
5|$|I. anglicus, {{described}} by Friedrich Holl in 1829, {{is the original}} type species of Iguanodon, but, as <b>discussed</b> <b>above,</b> was replaced by I. bernissartensis. In the past, it has been spelled as I. angelicus (Lessem and Glut, 1993) and I. anglicum (Holl, 1829 emend. Bronn, 1850). It is known from teeth from the middle Valanginian-age Lower Cretaceous Grinstead Clay Formation) of Cuckfield, West Sussex, England. It is currently classified in the genus Therosaurus as T. anglicus.|$|E

5|$|In {{animals and}} plants, a {{tricyclic}} compound called molybdopterin (which, despite the name, contains no molybdenum) is reacted with molybdate {{to form a}} complete molybdenum-containing cofactor called molybdenum cofactor. Other than the phylogenetically-ancient nitrogenases (<b>discussed</b> <b>above)</b> that fix nitrogen in some bacteria and cyanobacteria, all molybdenum-using enzymes (so far identified) use the molybdenum cofactor, where molybdenum is in the oxidation state of VI, similar to molybdate. Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules {{in the process of}} regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|Proteins {{can also}} be natural poisons or antinutrients, such as the trypsin inhibitors (<b>discussed</b> <b>above)</b> that are found in some legumes, {{as shown in the}} figure above. A less common class of toxins are toxic enzymes: these act as {{irreversible}} inhibitors of their target enzymes and work by chemically modifying their substrate enzymes. An example is ricin, an extremely potent protein toxin found in castor oil beans. This enzyme is a glycosidase that inactivates ribosomes. Since ricin is a catalytic irreversible inhibitor, this allows just a single molecule of ricin to kill a cell.|$|E
5|$|The barbarisation theory, {{ultimately}} {{derived from}} Edward Gibbon's 18th-century magnum opus, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, contains two propositions. (1) That the late army recruited much {{greater numbers of}} barbarian-born troops than {{the army of the}} Principate; and (2) that the greater number of barbarian recruits resulted in a major decline of the army's effectiveness and was a leading factor in the collapse of the Western Roman empire. As <b>discussed</b> <b>above,</b> proposition (1) is probably correct, although it should be borne in mind that probably about three-quarters of the late army's recruits remained Roman-born. This section considers proposition (2).|$|E
