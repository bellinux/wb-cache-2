5|$|From 1915 Gaudí devoted himself almost {{exclusively}} to his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família, a synthesis of his architectural evolution. After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, {{the rest of the}} church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, <b>helicoidal</b> in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park Güell and the crypt of the Colònia Güell, creating a church that is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E
5|$|The first {{example was}} the Teresian College (Col·legi de les Teresianes) (1888–1889), in Barcelona's Carrer Ganduxer, {{commissioned}} by San Enrique de Ossó. Gaudí fulfilled the wish {{of the order}} that the building should be austere, in keeping with their vows of poverty. He designed a simple building, using bricks for the exterior and some brick elements for the interior. Wrought ironwork, one of Gaudí's favourite materials, appeared on the facades. The building is crowned by a row of merlons which suggest a castle, a possible reference to Saint Teresa's Interior Castle. The corners have brick pinnacles topped by <b>helicoidal</b> columns and culminate in a four-armed cross, typical of Gaudí's works, and with ceramic shields bearing various symbols of the order. The interior includes a corridor which is famous for the series of catenary arches that it contains. These elegant arches are decorative and support the ceiling and the floor above. For Gaudí, the catenary arch was an ideal constructional element, capable of supporting great loads with slender masonry.|$|E
5|$|Among Gaudí's {{largest and}} most {{striking}} works is the Casa Batlló (1904–1906). Commissioned by Josep Batlló i Casanovas to renovate an existing building erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cortés, Gaudí focused on the façade, the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a fifth floor for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Domènec Sugrañes, Joan Rubió and Josep Canaleta. The facade is of Montjuïc sandstone cut to create warped ruled surfaces; the columns are bone-shaped with vegetable decoration. Gaudí kept the rectangular shape of the old building's balconies—with iron railings {{in the shape of}} masks—giving the rest of the facade an ascending undulating form. He also faced the facade with ceramic fragments of various colours ("trencadís"), which Gaudí obtained from the waste material of the Pelegrí glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a skylight supported by an iron structure {{in the shape of a}} double T, which rests on a series of catenary aches. The <b>helicoidal</b> chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in clear glass in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by clear glass balls filled with sand of different colours. The facade culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed ceramic tiles in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon's back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and with Gaudí's four-armed cross.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{evolved from}} plane to spatial geometry, to ruled geometry. These {{constructional}} forms are highly {{suited to the}} use of cheap materials such as brick. Gaudí frequently used brick laid with mortar in successive layers, as in the traditional Catalan vault, using the brick laid flat instead of on its side. This quest for new structural solutions culminated between 1910 and 1920, when he exploited his research and experience in his masterpiece, the Sagrada Família. Gaudí conceived the interior of the church {{as if it were a}} forest, with a set of tree-like columns divided into various branches to support a structure of intertwined hyperboloid vaults. He inclined the columns so they could better resist the perpendicular pressure on their section. He also gave them a double-turn <b>helicoidal</b> shape (right turn and left turn), as in the branches and trunks of trees. This created a structure that is now known as fractal. Together with a modulation of the space that divides it into small, independent and self-supporting modules, it creates a structure that perfectly supports the mechanical traction forces without need for buttresses, as required by the neo-Gothic style. Gaudí thus achieved a rational, structured and perfectly logical solution, creating at the same time a new architectural style that was original, simple, practical and aesthetic.|$|E

25|$|The corne de vache {{approach}} {{tends to}} result in a structure that is almost as strong as one built to the logarithmic pattern and considerably stronger than one built to the <b>helicoidal</b> pattern but, again, the extra complexity has meant that the method has not seen widespread adoption, especially since the simpler <b>helicoidal</b> structure can be built much stronger if a segmental design is chosen, rather than a full-centred one.|$|E
25|$|Despite this {{there were}} many full-centred skew bridges built to the <b>helicoidal</b> pattern and many still stand, Kielder Viaduct and Neidpath Viaduct being just two examples.|$|E
25|$|TBP's C-terminus {{composes of}} a <b>helicoidal</b> shape that (incompletely) {{complements}} the T-A-T-A region of DNA. It {{is interesting to}} note that this incompleteness allows DNA to be passively bent on binding.|$|E
25|$|Seventh Street Improvement Arches, Saint Paul, Minnesota by William A. Truesdell (St. Paul and Duluth Railroad, 1883–1884), {{a pair of}} <b>helicoidal</b> semicircular masonry arches with a {{skew angle}} of 27 degrees.|$|E
25|$|This {{book was}} {{acknowledged}} as the definitive {{work on the}} subject of the <b>helicoidal</b> skew arch and remained a standard text book for railway engineers until the end of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the <b>helicoidal</b> and {{logarithmic}} methods, {{in which}} the intrados of the arch barrel is cylindrical, the corne de vache method results in a warped hyperbolic paraboloid surface that dips in the middle, rather like a saddle.|$|E
25|$|The {{brickwork}} {{is considerably}} {{more complex than}} in a <b>helicoidal</b> design and, {{in order to ensure}} that the courses of bricks meet the faces of the arch at right angles, many had to be cut to produce tapers.|$|E
25|$|Buck's trigonometrical {{approach}} allowed every {{dimension of}} a skew arch {{to be calculated}} without recourse to taking measurements from scale drawings and it allowed him to calculate the theoretical minimum angle of obliquity to which a practical semicircular <b>helicoidal</b> skew bridge could be designed and safely built.|$|E
25|$|The viaduct between London Bridge and Greenwich {{stations}} (London and Greenwich Railway, 1834–1836), a {{long and}} complex structure, which has subsequently been widened on both its southern (1842) and northern (1850) sides, and also extended westwards to Charing Cross (1864) and northwards to Cannon Street (1866). <b>Helicoidal</b> skew brickwork is visible at several locations where it spans existing roads that cross the line at oblique angles.|$|E
25|$|Even when {{starting}} from a relatively high-symmetry structure the combined effect of exchange interactions, spin-orbit coupling, orbital-ordering and crystal deformations activated by the JTE {{can lead to}} very low symmetry magnetic patterns with specific properties. For example, in CsCuCl3 an incommensurable <b>helicoidal</b> pattern appears both for the orbitals and the distortions along the -axis. Moreover, many of these compounds show complex phase diagrams when varying temperature or pressure.|$|E
25|$|If {{collisions}} {{between the}} particles are very frequent, they are scattered in every direction. This {{happens in the}} photosphere, where the plasma carries the magnetic field in its motion. In the corona, on the contrary, the mean free-path of the electrons is {{of the order of}} kilometres and even more, so each electron can do a <b>helicoidal</b> motion long before being scattered after a collision. Therefore, the heat transfer is enhanced along the magnetic field lines and inhibited in the perpendicular direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year Fox, still aged only 28 and employed by Robert Stephenson {{as an engineer}} on the London and Birmingham Railway, presented his paper encapsulating these principles to the Royal Institution and from this was born the English or <b>helicoidal</b> method of constructing brick skew arches. Using this method many thousands of skew bridges were built either entirely of brick or of brick with stone quoins by railway companies in the United Kingdom, {{a substantial number of}} which survive and are still in use today.|$|E
25|$|Claustro de D. João III (Cloister of John III): Started under King John III of Portugal, was {{finished}} {{during the reign}} of Philip I of Portugal. The first architect was Diogo de Torralva, who began the work in 1557, to be finished in 1591 by Philip I's architect, the Italian Filippo Terzi. This magnificent, two-storey cloister connects the dormitory of the monks to the church, and {{is considered one of the}} most important examples of Mannerist architecture in Portugal. The storeys are connected to each other by four elegant <b>helicoidal</b> stairways, located at each corner of the cloisters.|$|E
25|$|Nicholson never {{pretended to}} have invented the skew arch {{but in his}} later work The Guide to Railway Masonry, {{containing}} a Complete Treatise on the Oblique Arch (1839), he does claim to have invented the method for producing the templates that enabled the accurate cutting of the voussoir stones used in all skew bridges built between the years 1828 and 1836, citing testimonials from the builders of major works, such as the Croft Viaduct at Croft-on-Tees near Darlington. However, by 1836 a young engineer called Charles Fox had improved on Nicholson's <b>helicoidal</b> method and other writers were proposing alternative approaches to the problem.|$|E

He also found a similar condition in vertebrate muscles. Later he discovered that former histologists had recorded the same thing, but their observations had received little attention. He contended that <b>helicoidal</b> striation is a general feature of muscles and that muscular conduction takes place along this <b>helicoidal</b> path, even though the evidence for this generality was against him, yet his cinematographic records supported his interpretation for arachnids and other arthropods.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>helicoidal</b> {{method of}} laying down the stone or brick courses championed by Nicholson, Fox and Buck {{is only an}} {{approximation}} to the ideal.

2500|$|In {{some plants}} and cell types, after a maximum size or point in {{development}} has been reached, a secondary wall is constructed between the plasma membrane and primary wall. Unlike the primary wall, the cellulose microfibrils are aligned parallel in layers, the orientation changing slightly with each additional layer so that the structure becomes <b>helicoidal.</b> [...] Cells with secondary cell walls can be rigid, as in the gritty sclereid cells in pear and quince fruit. Cell to cell communication is possible through pits in the secondary cell wall that allow plasmodesmata to connect cells through the secondary cell walls.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{strength}} and stability, a skew bridge built to the logarithmic pattern has advantages over one built to the <b>helicoidal</b> pattern, especially so {{in the case of}} full-centred designs. However, the courses are not parallel, being thinner towards the most acutely angled quoin (located where the face of the arch makes an obtuse angle with the abutment in the plan view, at S and Q in the development to the left, and at the left hand side of the photograph of the intrados on the right) and thicker towards the most obtusely angled quoin (at O and G in the development and just off the right hand side of the photograph), ...|$|E
6000|$|I had {{no desire}} to {{continue}} in this depression, as I should in going north, for I should find nothing but lakes, marshes and ferneries, infested with the same primitive and monstrous forms of life. So I continued my course eastward and soon had the satisfaction to find myself meeting the sluggish current of such streams as I encountered in my way. By vigorous use of the new double-distance telepode, which enables the wearer to step eighty surindas instead of forty, as with the instrument in popular use, I was soon again at a considerable elevation above the sea-level and nearly 200 prastams from [...] "Pike's Peak." [...] A little farther along the water courses began to flow to the eastward. The flora and fauna had again altered in character, and now began to grow sparse; the soil was thin and arid, and in a week I found myself in a region absolutely destitute of organic life and without a vestige of soil. All was barren rock. The surface for hundreds of prastams, as I continued my advance, was nearly level, with a slight dip to the eastward. The rock was singularly striated, the scratches arranged concentrically and in <b>helicoidal</b> curves. This circumstance puzzled me and I resolved to take some more instrumental observations, bitterly regretting my improvidence in not availing myself of the Ahkoond's permission to bring with me such apparatus and assistants as would have given me knowledge vastly more copious and accurate than I could acquire with my simple pocket appliances.|$|E
