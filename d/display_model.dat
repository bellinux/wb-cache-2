5|$|In 2004, Northrop Grumman {{proposed}} a YF-23-based bomber {{to meet a}} USAF need for an interim bomber, for which the FB-22 and B-1R were also competing. Northrop modified aircraft PAV-2 {{to serve as a}} <b>display</b> <b>model</b> for its proposed interim bomber. The possibility of a YF-23-based interim bomber ended with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, which favored a long-range bomber with much greater range. The USAF has since moved on to the Next-Generation Bomber program.|$|E
5|$|YF-23A PAV-2, AF ser. no. 87-0801, {{registration}} number N232YF, was on {{exhibit at the}} Western Museum of Flight until 2004, when it was reclaimed by Northrop Grumman and used as a <b>display</b> <b>model</b> for a YF-23-based bomber. PAV-2 was returned to the Western Museum of Flight and was on display as of 2010 at the museum's new location at Zamperini Field, Torrance, California.|$|E
5|$|By September, {{the game}} was still unfinished, and almost every Williams {{programmer}} assisted in meeting the deadline for the AMOA trade show. The evening before the trade show, the arcade cabinets were delivered for display. The developers, however, forgot to create an attract mode—an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play—for the game, and began working on it that night. Early the next morning, the team created the final EPROM chips for the mode and installed them in cabinets. The chips, however, did not work and the designers made additional attempts to correct the problem. Once the attract mode was operational, Jarvis and the team returned to their homes {{to prepare for the}} show. After the show, the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely. The <b>display</b> <b>model</b> featured five levels, which the team felt was more than enough because of the game's difficulty. Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis's score of 60,000points seemed unbeatable to them. The developers decided it was best to be prepared for players that might exceed their expectations and added more levels that repeated.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{factor was}} that people working at mass-market retail stores lacked the {{specialized}} training Apple offered to its dealers. The Performa <b>display</b> <b>models</b> were often poorly taken care of; the demo computers crashed, the self-running demo software not running or the <b>display</b> <b>models</b> not even powered on. Consumers {{who may have been}} purchasing their first computer were steered away from the Performas because they [...] "weren't compatible". Apple tried to address the training issue by hiring their own sales people to aid the store sales staff, most of them recruited from Macintosh user groups. Despite this, however, many returned Performa computers could not be serviced properly because the stores were not authorized Apple service centers.|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of producing a reliable display that will cope with daily wear and tear, these displays are expensive. Usually, only 40 or 80 braille cells are <b>displayed.</b> <b>Models</b> with between 18 and 40 cells exist in some notetaker devices.|$|R

50|$|All {{items in}} the {{collection}} are maintained in running order; the museum posts times when visitors can see the <b>display</b> <b>models</b> started.

5000|$|Flight Miniatures is a {{brand of}} plastic {{snap-fit}} style desktop <b>display</b> <b>model</b> aircraft. The majority of models they produce are of commercial airliners in 1:200 scale. Other scales and a limited range of military aircraft models are also available.|$|E
50|$|The CGA video card, with a {{suitable}} modulator, could use an NTSC television set or an RGBi monitor for display; IBM's RGBi monitor was their <b>display</b> <b>model</b> 5153. The other option that was offered by IBM was an MDA and their monochrome <b>display</b> <b>model</b> 5151. It {{was possible to}} install both an MDA and a CGA card and use both monitors concurrently if supported by the application program. For example, AutoCAD, Lotus 1-2-3 and others allowed use of a CGA Monitor for graphics and a separate monochrome monitor for text menus. Some model 5150 PCs with CGA monitors and a printer port also included the MDA adapter by default, because IBM provided the MDA port and printer port on the same adapter card; {{it was in fact}} an MDA/printer port combo card.|$|E
5000|$|The {{museum has}} {{a variety of}} {{exhibits}} on earth science, space, biotechnology, and the environment.
