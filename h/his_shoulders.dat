50|$|Parks tore {{his knee}} ligaments in the Boxing Day derby against Cardiff Blues, marking {{the start of}} a long line of injuries, which {{ultimately}} led to his retirement from rugby. Early in his second season with the Dragons, Parks injured <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> in a tackle. Unaware of the severity of the injury, Richard continued to play and then had an operation over Christmas to repair <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> He returned to action {{at the beginning of the}} year but <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> problem reoccurred. It was at this point, in May 2009 and after of trying many different courses of treatment to repair <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> Richard was advised the damage to <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> was irreversible and following the second operation on <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> that year, he was advised he should not play rugby anymore. He had made 30 appearances for the Dragons. Richard retired from rugby on 26 May 2009 aged 31.|$|R

30|$|As time passed, his {{complaints}} about <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> did not regress. He had limited function and pain at the posterior side of <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Two {{years after the}} trauma, when <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> radiographs were repeated, scapular spine pseudo-arthrosis was diagnosed. Scapular spine fracture could not be diagnosed for whole this time, and he was treated for soft tissue injury and operated for rotator cuff tear.|$|R
5|$|As {{soldiers}} {{approached the}} sacristy, {{one of the}} young sons of defender Anthony Wolf stood to pull a blanket over <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> In the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him. Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker, who attempted to hide behind Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted in front of the women. Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy. Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner.|$|E
5|$|He had {{a liberal}} {{education}} {{by the standards}} of his age and learned French, German and Latin. He showed a special interest in history and astrology. A cleric from Wrocław, Nicholas, taught him the basic principles of Christian faith. However, Louis's religious zeal was due to his mother's influence. In a royal charter, Louis remembered that in his childhood, a knight of the royal court, Peter Poháros, often carried him on <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> His two tutors, Nicholas Drugeth and Nicholas Knesich, saved the lives of both Louis and his younger brother, Andrew, when Felician Záh attempted to assassinate the royal family in Visegrád on 17 April 1330.|$|E

Both fighters wrestled inconclusively until Mysterio delivered a second 619. During the second sequence of the move, Guerrero grabbed Mysterio's legs and achieved a position with <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> spread so as to win both a pinfall and the WWE Cruiserweight title.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match, the Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) faced The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). The {{advantage}} switched {{back and forth}} several times, as the Steiners threw The Headshrinkers with several suplex variations and used their aerial abilities to attack their opponents from the ring ropes. The Headshrinkers relied mainly on using their power to wear down the Steiners. At one point, Fatu picked Rick Steiner up on <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> so that Samu could attack Rick from the top rope. Rick caught Samu instead and performed a bodyslam on Samu from Fatu's shoulders. The match ended when Scott Steiner performed a Frankensteiner to pin Samu and win the match.|$|E

50|$|In {{early days}} the {{information}} is unclear. Based on the written pattayam, a person should bathe before lifting and placing the kavadi on <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Once he started walking with kavadi on <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> he should not drink water or urinate. If {{he needs to do}} that, he needs to bathe again before having the kavadi placed on <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The person carrying the kavadi should wear a white dhoti, and he should stay in the same dhoti until the kavadi is offered to Lord Murugan in Pazhani.|$|R
5|$|According to legend, Shiva's wife Sati immolated {{herself in}} the yajna-fire of her father Daksha, as a protest against Shiva's dishonor. The God became furious and started to dance the Tāndava with Sati's body on <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Knowing that the dance of {{destruction}} was about to annihilate the world, Vishnu cut the body of Sati to pieces with Sudarshana Chakram, his celestial weapon, thereby appeasing Shiva. Each of 51 pieces of the body fell to earth, and the place where each piece fell became a holy center of pilgrimage or Shakti Peetha. The legend goes that Sati's right arm fell near a now-extinct hot spring at the Chandranth peak in Sitakunda. The site is marked by the temple of Sambhunath just below the Chandranath temple {{on top of the}} peak, and it is a major tirtha for Hindus in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{challenged}} Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young), {{who were}} accompanied by Coach D'Amore, for the NWA World Tag Team Championship in the seventh match.

Later, Young went to grab a chair from Devine who had his back turned to the ring. This caused Devine to panic and hit Young in the head with the chair. Storm immediately followed by grabbing Young and pinning <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> to the mat with a school boy type pin attempt for the victory.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{advertising}} {{included the}} parading of giant pageant-style floats of Bảo Đại {{through the streets}} of Saigon, depicted with bags of money on <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> a deck of cards in his hands, and with naked blonde women and bottles of cognac in his arms. This was a reference to the head of state's reputation for opulence, gambling and womanising. In particular, the blonde hair referred to Bảo Đại's purported penchant for European mistresses with whom he liaised on the French Riviera. Bảo Đại's dummy was accompanied by that of a Frenchman putting gold into his pockets, thereby questioning his nationalist credentials. Posters and effigies associating Bảo Đại with a pig's head were disseminated, while a prominent newspaper composed and encouraged the people to sing insulting songs about Bảo Đại.|$|E

5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on <b>his</b> <b>shoulders).</b> He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E
5|$|Rishabhanatha {{is usually}} {{depicted}} in the lotus position or kayotsarga, a standing posture of meditation. The distinguishing features of Rishabhanatha are his long locks of hair which fall on <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and {{an image of a}} bull in sculptures of him. Paintings of him usually depict legendary events of his life. Some of these include his marriage, and Indra performing a ritual known as abhisheka (consecration). He is sometimes shown presenting a bowl to his followers and teaching them the art of pottery, painting a house, or weaving textiles. The visit of his mother Marudevi is also shown extensively in painting. He is also associated with his Bull emblem, the Nyagrodha tree, Gomukha (bull-faced) Yaksha, and Chakreshvari Yakshi.|$|E
5|$|The event, {{featuring}} commentary by Michael Cole, Jerry Lawler and Booker T, {{began with}} the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match. During the bout, Sheamus slammed Sin Cara through a ladder propped between the ring apron and the announcers' table with a powerbomb. The ladder was bent in half and Cara was stretchered away from ringside. Near {{the end of the}} match, Barrett, Rhodes and Bryan were the only three in the ring. Bryan put Rhodes in a guillotine choke submission hold on top of the ladder {{in the middle of the}} ring while Barrett sneaked up the other side of the ladder. After Bryan knocked Rhodes off the ladder, Barrett got Bryan onto <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and tried to throw him off. Bryan countered with repeated elbow strikes to Barrett's head. Bryan then kicked Barrett in the head and unhooked the briefcase to win the contest.|$|E
