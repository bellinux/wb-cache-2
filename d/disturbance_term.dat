Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 41 - 42. The standard {{regression analysis}} {{assumes that the}} variances of the <b>disturbance</b> <b>terms</b> are constant, and the ordinary least squares (OLS) method employs this very crucial assumption to estimate the covariance of the <b>disturbance</b> <b>terms</b> perfectly, but OLS fails to estimate well when the variance of the <b>disturbance</b> <b>terms</b> vary across the observations. A very good method suggested by Eicker and improved by White to estimate the covariance matrix of the <b>disturbance</b> <b>terms</b> in case of heteroskedeisticity was proved to be biased. This paper evaluates the performance of White’s method {{as well as the}} OLS method in several different settings of regression. Furthermore, bootstrapping, a new method which very heavily depends on computer simulation is included. Several types of this method are used in several cases of homoskedastic, heteroskedastic, balanced, and unbalanced regressions. Orhan, MehmetM. S...|$|R

The most popular procedure is the approach developed by Dickey and Fuller (1979, 1981), which only requires running appropriately specified regressions.

In this paper we show that the augmented Dickey-Fuller-test (ADF-test) is biased in finite samples if the <b>disturbance</b> <b>term</b> does not follow a white noise process. We will show that for many values of the parameters, the ADF-test accepts the maintained hypothesis of a unit root too often, if the <b>disturbance</b> <b>term</b> follows an AR, MA or ARMA process.
