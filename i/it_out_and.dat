5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E

5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

50|$|It {{was founded}} in 1917 as a {{football}} club; the handball came in the 1940s. The club had an athletics section from 1920 to 1924, when <b>it</b> broke <b>out</b> <b>and</b> formed the club Horten FIK. Falk also had a bandy section from 1945 to 1949, when <b>it</b> broke <b>out</b> <b>and</b> formed the club Horten BK. In 1945 Falk absorbed the club Horten SK.|$|R
5|$|Gilbert {{acted as}} stage {{director}} {{for his own}} plays and operas. He sought realism in acting, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes. Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals. As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the overture for the last moment, sketching <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> entrusting it to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier, to complete. Pinafore opened on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique.|$|E
5|$|On Hill 69 and {{the coastal}} road, the 53rd Battalion intercepted and engaged a {{contingent}} of Egyptian reinforcements from Majdal. After the battles, the 53rd Battalion reported that at 03:00, they had been ready to ambush possible reinforcements, and at 06:00, an Egyptian convoy of two armored vehicles and 4 other vehicles {{made their way to}} Isdud. They were hit by Israeli mines, operated by Avraham Schwarzstein's platoon (see Battle of Nitzanim), and only two vehicles made <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> back to Majdal. At 09:00 the general retreat order was given, and after reaching Nitzanim, Schwarzstein's platoon set out to assist the Negev forces' retreat, helping carry the 20-so casualties. The forces on Hill 69 retreated only at noon to Be'er Tuvia.|$|E
5|$|The Regional Finals {{were not}} all that far away from Knoxville– the Lady Vols only had to travel a couple of hours, to Nashville, where they faced 5th-seeded Rutgers, 22–9. Rutgers had survived two close games to reach this point, {{defeating}} 12th-seeded Oregon, 79–76, in the first round, and then upsetting 4th-seeded Iowa State, 62–61 in the second. Their third-round game was not quite so close. Although Rutgers only trailed by two {{towards the end of}} the first period, UT was able to outscore Rutgers by six to close <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> opened the second half up by building the lead to sixteen. The Scarlet Knights never recovered, losing 92–60. Holdsclaw and Catchings were again the leading scorers, with 25 and 23. The Lady Vols shot 52.2% from the field and forced Rutgers to 27 turnovers. This game gave Tennessee their 36th win, breaking Connecticut's record of 35, as the Lady Vols advanced to the Regional Finals.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the biggest}} reason for {{increase}} in female infanticide is being associated {{with the increase in}} number of private Ultrasound Scanning Centres which often tell the sex of baby, and as they become more accessible and affordable people who could not find out the sex of baby historically, have started finding <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> often results in abortion in case of girl child.|$|E
25|$|Like Latour, Riesch's {{troops had}} to contend with terrible roads and snow squalls. They fell far behind Kollowrat, {{reaching}} Albaching only at 9:30am. Consequently, Richepanse's division passed in front of Riesch. Near the village of St. Christoph, the two Austrian grenadier battalions sent by Kollowrat stumbled upon Richepanse's marching column, cutting his division in half. With single-minded determination, the Frenchman left his rear brigade under General of Brigade Jean-Baptiste Drouet to fight <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> drove to the north with his leading brigade.|$|E

The two batsmen put the {{pressure}} back on India {{and took the}} score to 6/193 in the 47th over, having scored 56 off the last 10 overs. In that over by Sharma, Symonds, then on 30, clearly nicked the ball to wicketkeeper Dhoni, however Steve Bucknor made a blunder by not giving <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> symonds too stood his ground.

There it was abandoned until a steam wagon enthusiast hauled <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> restored it in 1988.
