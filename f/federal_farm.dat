25|$|With the President {{reaching}} out to new constituencies, a series of programs were targeted at farmers. The Smith–Lever Act of 1914 created the modern system of agricultural extension agents sponsored by the state agricultural colleges. The agents taught new techniques to farmers. The 1916 <b>Federal</b> <b>Farm</b> Loan Act provided for issuance of low-cost long-term mortgages to farmers.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} and immediate benefits of higher grain prices is a dramatic reduction in <b>federal</b> <b>farm</b> support payments. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, corn farmers received $8.8 billion in government support in 2006. Because of higher corn prices, payments are expected to drop to $2.1 billion in 2007, a 76 percent reduction.|$|E

25|$|On April 19, 2013, Kentucky legalized Hemp when Governor Steve Beshear {{refused to}} sign or veto Senate Bill 50, {{allowing}} the state law to go into effect. Beshear {{had been one of}} the last obstacles blocking SB50 from becoming law. Under federal law, hemp is a Schedule 1 narcotic, just like PCP and heroin, in spite of the fact that hemp typically only has 0.3 percent THC, compared to the three percent to 22 percent usually found in marijuana. The Schedule 1 designation was exempted for Kentucky's pilot hemp research projects when the <b>federal</b> <b>Farm</b> Bill (a.k.a. The Agricultural Act of 2014) was passed.|$|E

50|$|The Mississippi Delta {{has long}} been home to American {{industrial}} agriculture, with cotton, rice and soybeans {{by far the biggest}} export from the region. The 1st District covers most of the Arkansas Delta area and stretches as far west to the Ozarks. The farming areas, despite their fertility, are generally poor by national standards, with unemployment and undereducation as some of the greatest problems. Rice farms are the amongst the greatest recipients of <b>federal</b> <b>farming</b> subsidization - and three of the top five subsidy farms in the United States are in the 1st District, receiving over $100 million since 1996.|$|R

25|$|As {{economic}} difficulties worsened, Iowa farmers sought to find local solutions. Faced with extremely low farm prices, including corn at ten cents a bushel and pork at three cents a pound, some farmers in western Iowa formed the Farmers Holiday Association. This group, {{which had its}} greatest strength {{in the area around}} Sioux City, tried to withhold farm products from markets. They believed this practice would force up farm prices. The Farm Holiday Association had only limited success as many farmers did not cooperate and the withholding itself did little to raise prices. Farmers experienced little relief until 1933 when the federal government, as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, created a <b>federal</b> <b>farm</b> aid program.|$|E
25|$|Hoover pursued many {{policies}} {{in an attempt}} to pull the country out of depression, while attempting to restrain the federal government from becoming directly involved in commercial affairs. In the days following Black Tuesday, Hoover gathered business and labor leaders, asking them to avoid wage cuts and work stoppages while the country faced what he believed would be a short recession similar to the Depression of 1920–21. Some economists, such as Lee Ohanian, point to the resulting wage rigidity as a key cause of the severity of the Great Depression. Hoover also authorized the Mexican Repatriation program to help unemployed Mexican citizens return home. The program was largely a forced migration of approximately 500,000 people to Mexico, and continued until 1937. In the spring of 1930, Hoover acquired from Congress an additional $100 million to continue the <b>Federal</b> <b>Farm</b> Board lending and purchasing policies. At the end of 1929, the FFB established the National Wool Marketing Corporation (NWMC), a national wool cooperative made up of 30 state associations. Hoover also supported new public works projects, although his fear of budget deficits led him to oppose expansive projects such as that contemplated by the Muscle Shoals Bill, which sought to establish government production and distribution of power in the Tennessee Valley. In autumn 1930, Hoover established the President's Organization for Unemployment Relief, which issues press releases urging companies to hire.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{contentious}} issue of Coolidge's presidency was relief for farmers. Some in Congress proposed a bill designed to fight falling agricultural prices by allowing {{the federal government to}} purchase crops to sell abroad at lower prices. Agriculture Secretary Henry C. Wallace and other administration officials favored the bill when it was introduced in 1924, but rising prices convinced many in Congress that the bill was unnecessary, and it was defeated just before the elections that year. In 1926, with farm prices falling once more, Senator Charles L. McNary and Representative Gilbert N. Haugen—both Republicans—proposed the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill. The bill proposed a <b>federal</b> <b>farm</b> board that would purchase surplus production in high-yield years and hold it (when feasible) for later sale or sell it abroad. Coolidge opposed McNary-Haugen, declaring that agriculture must stand [...] "on an independent business basis," [...] and said that [...] "government control cannot be divorced from political control." [...] Instead of manipulating prices, he favored instead Herbert Hoover's proposal to create profits by modernizing agriculture. Secretary Mellon wrote a letter denouncing the McNary-Haugen measure as unsound and likely to cause inflation, and it was defeated.|$|E

2500|$|Herbert Hoover {{had been}} elected President of the United States in November 1928, and took office in March 1929. [...] But even then, the {{agricultural}} industry in the United States was heading for a depression. Unlike his predecessor, Hoover agreed to provide some federal support for agriculture, and in June 1929 the Congress passed the Agriculture Marketing Act. The act established and was administered by the <b>Federal</b> <b>Farm</b> Board. The crash {{of the stock market}} in late October 1929 led the <b>Federal</b> <b>Farm</b> Board's general counsel to resign. [...] Although Reed was a Democrat, his reputation as a corporate agricultural lawyer led President Hoover to appoint him the new general counsel of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Farm</b> Board on November 7, 1929.

25|$|Mechanization set in on {{the heels}} of World War II, making the use of horses in {{agriculture}} and transportation largely obsolete.

2500|$|Under the Wilson {{administration}} during World War I, the U.S. Food Administration, {{under the}} direction of Herbert Hoover, set a basic price of $2.20 per bushel.

[...] Black concluded that, on its face, the Hatch Act and implementing civil service regulations were unconstitutionally overbroad (a fact even the government had admitted in its brief, Black said).|$|E
