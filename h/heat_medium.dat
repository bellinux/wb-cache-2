40|$|As {{energy costs}} {{continue}} to increase, {{one must be}} willing to accept greater complexities in heat recovery systems. The days of being satisfied with only simple hot product to cold feed exchange, restricted to the plot boundaries of each unit, are a thing of the past. This paper presents results of a refinery-wide survey to identify potential high temperature heat sources that are not being recovered and low temperature systems that consume fuel. The best candidates in each category were connected by a circulating <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> loop where waste heat is recovered for useful purposes. The <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> chosen is turbine fuel. It is pumped around the refinery to pick up heat at the crude distilling unit, the hydrocracker, the catalytic cracker, and the coker; the heat is used to reboil a butylenes splitter column and to preheat boiler feed Water. The heat that is recovered is equivalent to some 660 B/D of fuel: at an illustrative fuel value of say $ 30 per barrel, the value of the recovered heat is $ 20, 000 per day. An energy conservation project at Shell's Norco (Louisiana) Manufacturing Complex involves several processing units and recovers heat that was previously lost to air or cooling water. The recovered heat is used to reboil a butylenes splitter column and to preheat boiler feed water. Essentially, the system consists of a circulating <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> that transfers waste heat to heat consumers.

40|$|Electrochemical {{reactions}} at the electrode-solution interface of an ohmic heater can {{be avoided}} or significantly limited by choosing appropriate processing conditions {{in relation to the}} food properties. In the present work the effect of the electrical parameters (electric field strength and frequency of the applied current signal) and product factors (halides concentration, electrical conductivity and pH) on metal release from stainless steel (type AISI 316 L) electrodes of a batch ohmic heater was investigated. In each experiment, the concentrations of the main constituents of stainless steel (iron, chromium and nickel) released in the <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> were detected by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS). Results showed that the rate of metal release from the electrodes to the <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> depends on frequency and applied field strength. However, the use of ohmic heating at a higher frequency than conventional (50 Hz) can significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) reduce the flux of metal ions from stainless steel electrodes. Moreover, it was also demonstrated that electrochemical phenomena occurring at the electrode-solution interface strongly depend on the composition, pH and electrical conductivity of the <b>heating</b> <b>medium.</b> Industrial relevance: The magnitude of electrode material released into the <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> during ohmic processing depends on many factors, whose effects should be known in order to define optimal treatment conditions, electrode material and food properties able to avoid or minimize the undesired phenomenon of contamination of the food product, electrode-fouling and electrode corrosion.
