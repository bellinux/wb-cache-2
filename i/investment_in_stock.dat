Essentially, the objectives of investment are to reduce the risk, increase the return and better diversification of capital investment. However, investment involves risk and <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> market is risky. Wise investment decision has to be made in order to prevent any loss of capital investment. As to help the investors, this study proposed four stages of investment framework which are selecting, forecasting, distributing and estimating profit. The proposed method can be used to select the right stocks, forecast the future prices, distributing the capital investment and estimating the profit gained. The mathematical models involved are cluster analysis, geometric Brownian motion and analytic hierarchy process. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a real investment situation in Bursa Malaysia involving small size companies. Furthermore, methodology is build to group a large amount of stocks into several clusters based on their performance and selected the clusters that gave high return to proceed with forecasting future closing prices. Then, eight stocks from the higher percentage increase of forecasted return are selected to carry on with distribution proportion of capital investment. Profit estimation can be made after all the stages are analyzed. It is found this proposed method is able {{to reduce the risk of}} loss, increase the return and better diversification of capital investment...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the statisticalsignificance and implication of various specifications of stock return. Three specifications are considered, i. e. return that (1) ignoresdividend, (2) ignores the proceed from further investment ofdividend, and (3) assumes that dividend is reinvested in the samestock. The differences among the three specifications are analyzedunder one, four, and seven years of investment periods. Using a sample consisted of 102 companies listed on theIndonesian Stock Market during the seven year period starting fromthe beginning of 2001, it is found that each return specificationresults in return numbers that in general are statistically differentfrom each other. The only insignificant difference is the differencebetween return that ignores proceed from further investment ondividend and the one that assumes that dividend is reinvested in thesame stock for one year of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock.</b> The implication of the differences in returns calculated undereach specification is further analyzed using an association studythat regresses market return on accounting return (ROE) in the sameone, four, and seven year periods of investment.

However, in several financial models the boundedness assumption of the market price of risk fails.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the increase of an investment horizon on the comparative advantages of the basic asset classes and on the principles of constructing the investment strategy. It demonstrates that the traditional approach of portfolio management theory, which states that <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> are preferable over bonds in terms of their long-run risk–return trade-offs, is by no means always consistent with empirical evidence. This article proves the opposite, i. e., that for long-term investors, <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> corporate bonds are more profitable in terms of the risk–return ratio than <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks,</b> arguing <b>in</b> favor of strategies pursued by pension funds and other institutional investors focused primarily on <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> fixed-income instruments, including infrastructural bonds. Emphasis is placed on the need for regular adjustments to long-term investors’ portfolios. As portfolios get older, those investors see a reduction in the returns’ dispersion, while differences in risk between various portfolios increase. This means that to maintain a fixed risk–return ratio for a portfolio as the horizon increases, an investor needs to increase the share of lower-risk financial assets during asset allocation process.
