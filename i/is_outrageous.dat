We wanted to find a solution to a plot problem. And we still had Leonard Nimoy’s presence there, even though he [...] was dead. So they came up with the bizarre idea of putting his presence into Anna Torv, which <b>is</b> <b>outrageous.</b> Outrageous, and yet we did it, and {{had a lot of fun}} doing it.

The lawsuit filed in federal court sought more than $75,000 in damages. Sheindlin said in her statement that any money she wins through the lawsuit will go toward college scholarships through the Her Honor Mentoring Program. Sheindlin further stated, [...] "Mr. Haymond is a lawyer and should know better. The unauthorized use of my name <b>is</b> <b>outrageous</b> and requires legal action."

2500|$|After the 7 July 2005 London bombings, Friedman {{called for}} the U.S. State Department to [...] "shine a {{spotlight}} on hate speech wherever it appears", {{and to create a}} quarterly [...] "War of Ideas Report, which would focus on those religious leaders and writers who are inciting violence against others". Friedman said the governmental speech-monitoring should go beyond those who actually advocate violence, and [...] include also those whom former State Department spokesperson Jamie Rubin calls [...] "excuse makers". In his July 22 column, Friedman wrote against the [...] "excuses" [...] made by terrorists or apologists who blame their actions on third-party influences or pressures. [...] "After every major terrorist incident, the excuse makers come out to tell us ... why the terrorists acted. These excuse makers are just one notch less despicable than the terrorists and also deserve to be exposed. When you live in an open society like London, where anyone with a grievance can publish an article, run for office or start a political movement, the notion that blowing up a busload of innocent civilians in response to Iraq is somehow [...] "understandable" [...] <b>is</b> <b>outrageous.</b> [...] "It erases the distinction between legitimate dissent and terrorism" [...] Mr. Rubin said, [...] "and an open society needs to maintain a clear wall between them."
