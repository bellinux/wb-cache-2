40|$|Purpose: This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} into the relationship between corporate boards and the likelihood of a firm being convicted of an <b>environmental</b> <b>offence</b> in the United Kingdom (UK). Design/Methodology/Approach: The study uses a probit model to analyse the relationship between corporate boards and the likelihood of a firm being convicted of an <b>environmental</b> <b>offence</b> in the UK, controlling for firm size, financial leverage and profitability. Findings: The results suggest that the likelihood of a firm being convicted of an <b>environmental</b> <b>offence</b> increases with board size, but decreases with the presence of a woman on the board. No support is found for our hypotheses about the proportion of outside directors and the presence of a lawyer on the board. Marginal effects results also show that adding one member to the board increases the chance of a firm being convicted for an <b>environmental</b> <b>offence</b> by 4. 2 % while having a woman on the board decreases the likelihood of a firm being convicted of an <b>environmental</b> <b>offence</b> by 31. 8 %. Research limitations/implications: The sample size of 55 firms is small which could affect the generalisability of the study.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the thesis is to answer the question, whether the current Czech {{criminal}} legislation enables effective punishment of serious <b>environmental</b> <b>offences</b> and ensures the enforcement of rules on environmental protection in a more efficient way than administrative sanctions. Protection of the environment through the criminal law can be traced in the Czech Republic back to 1980 s. However, criminal law has until now played only marginal role in the sanctioning of offences against the environment. Majority of <b>environmental</b> <b>offences</b> are prosecuted in administrative procedures. Since 1990 s {{the international community and}} later also the EU have discussed the need to pursue a harmonised criminal policy aimed at the protection of the environment. In case of serious environmental violations criminal law penalties are perceived as a more effective and appropriate measure than administrative penalties. Despite {{the fact that most of}} the potentially harmful activities are strictly regulated by both EU and national environmental law, environment continues to be threatened by pollution and excessive exploitation and environmental rules are being breached.

50|$|In many cases, {{particularly}} corporations {{found it}} more cost-effective {{to continue to}} pollute more than the law allowed and simply pay any associate fines if indeed the corporation was actually found and convicted of violating environmental laws or regulations. Perversely, corporations actually had a disincentive to comply with environmental laws or regulations as compliance generally raised their operational costs which meant that many corporations obeying the environmental laws, whether {{out of a sense}} of legal duty or public obligation, were disadvantaged and lost a competitive edge and consequently suffered in the marketplace to competitors who disregarded environmental laws and regulations. As a result of weak environmental legislation and continued adverse public opinion regarding the management of the environment, many governments established various environmental enforcement regimes that dramatically increased the legal powers of environmental investigators. The inclusion of criminal sanctions, significant increases in fines coupled with possible imprisonment of corporate officers changed the face of environmental law enforcement.

40|$|My Phd {{research}} {{is focused on}} the theme of the extension of the corporate liability to environmental crimes. This “reform” has been realized by the legislative decree n. 121 / 2011 on which also corporations are responsible for <b>environmental</b> <b>offences,</b> as provided by the art. 25 undecies of the legislative decree n. 231 / 2001. The new statutory legislation puts into effect the European regulation: the EU directive 2008 / 99 /CE on the protection of the environment through Criminal law, and the one 2009 / 123 /CE relating to pollution caused by ships. My thesis, therefore, begins with the close examination of such hard European process that ends with the difficult transposition of the law by the Italian legal system. The research, then, considers the issues related to the principles of the legislative decree n. 231 / 2001, especially the principles provided by art. 5 and artt. 6 - 7. According to the first principle, the issue depends on the features of <b>environmental</b> crimes: these <b>offences,</b> in fact, are essentially contraventions so they can be intentional or committed by recklessness. Regarding the second principle, provided by articles 6 and 7, it’s difficult for corporations to set up a valid compliance programs to prevent environmental crimes. The legislative decree n. 121 / 2011, unfortunately, hasn’t a rule such as the art. 30 of the legislative decree n. 81 / 2008. For these reasons, my thesis has two purposes: the first, working out the issue between the principles of corporate liability with the features of environmental offences; the second, trying to offer few proposals concerning a new system of a corporate liability for environmental crimes...|$|R
40|$|Towards a {{performance}} monitor for traffic enforcement. Within {{the framework of}} the elaboration of the Strategic Memorandum Police Traffic Duties, the police in the Netherlands intend to set up a monitoring system. It will be used for monitoring the police performance in the field of road safety and general safety in traffic, based on its own defined targets.

30|$|Besides EMA and the police, {{traditional}} {{leaders are}} empowered under the Traditional Leaders Act to apprehend and prosecute environmental law offenders {{including those that}} breach veld fires regulations. A study by Christianson et al. (2012) reported that local leadership {{played a key role}} in the prevention and control of veld fires, and fines imposed by traditional leaders are legally binding. To this end, the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) has trained a total of 537 traditional leaders in fire management, who are mandated by the law to preside over <b>environmental</b> <b>offences.</b> However, this number is still too low to be effective, hence the need to train all leaders, village heads and chiefs in the country to prosecute and preside over fire offences. The local leaders often lack capacity to execute their duties when they are not properly trained to handle fire cases. Thus, it is suggested that enforcement of laws and regulations should be decentralized so that all chiefs can handle such cases in their local areas and that fines should be proportional to the damages caused. The laws should also be amended so that those who start fires are not only fined, but should also pay for the damages to the victims. Instead of fines, alternative forms of punishment such as jail terms should be considered to prevent people from starting veld fires. To expedite the processing of fire crimes, a special court should be established for that purpose.|$|R

The aims {{of the study were}} : to understand better the attitudes of individuals within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to environmental compliance and non-compliance including whether they regard the latter as crimes, and to understand the influence of such attitudes on business responsiveness and responsibility. The study also had six main objectives : to determine awareness and attitudes of individuals in SMEs to the environment and environmental protection; to determine people's definitions of compliance and whether environmental non-compliance is comparable to other types of crime; to consider the relationship between attitudes and corporate culture, and also with perceived preventative behaviour; to examine the influence of social values on business attitudes and stakeholder responses; to examine any apparent differences of attitudes of the legal profession to <b>environmental</b> <b>offences</b> and the influence upon individuals in businesses; to consider the potential effects of attitudes to environmental compliance upon policies encouraging self-regulation and the achievement of the objectives of sustainable development. Main Topics : The dataset contains 387 responses by individuals, management and non-management, from within small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), to a structured postal questionnaire covering four subject areas : personal attitudes to the environment; attitudes to environmental non-compliance scenarios presented in a business context; attitudes to environmental crime as compared with other crimes; attitudes to general business and specific individual company responses to the environment and environmental compliance.

40|$|The thesis {{acknowledges}} {{that in many}} law enforcement situations more than two types of actors are involved. It analyzes three different scenarios each adding a distinct third type of actor to the standard economic model of regulatory monitoring and enforcement. The first part considers citizens reporting crime and analyzes the impacts of citizens motivated to share their knowledge with enforcement authorities {{on the stage of}} rule design. The main contribution is that it uncovers a previously overlooked benefit of uniform regulations. It is shown that such regulations can be efficiency enhancing as they harness citizen reporting thereby reducing costly regulatory inspections. The second part considers private initiatives monitoring environmental mediums in order to detect potential pollution events. It analyzes how improvements in citizens' capability to assess whether a firm polluted affects pollution, environmental harm, and overall welfare. It is shown that a decrease in the probability of falsely not detecting an actual pollution event has ambiguous effects. Especially, due to crowding effects, a better monitoring technology can lead to more pollution, less environmental quality, and lower overall welfare. The third part considers the recent trend of an increased criminalization of <b>environmental</b> <b>offences.</b> It explicitly considers the institutional framework in which criminal law enforcement authorities, i. e. prosecutors and courts, are operating. This part shows that the restrictions accompanied with this framework - the legality principle and constrained sanctioning discretion - can have negative effects on polluters' incentives to self-report pollution events. This in turn decreases the regulator's ability to order recovery. Thus, it is shown that the merits of the higher deterrence of criminal law can be offset by less self-reporting and less recovery...|$|R

40|$|Criminal law has {{considerably}} {{evolved in}} the last few decades. A number of new trends have challenged the traditional features of “modern criminal law”. One of the new trends affecting criminal justice systems is the so-called “Europeanisation process”, which {{is the result of the}} growing intervention of the EU in the area of criminal law. Another new trend which criminal law and other legal disciplines are facing is the increasingly blurred dividing line between legal categories. Various dimensions of this unclear division between categories have been identified in legal literature, in particular between administrative and criminal law. This book aims to study the combination of the two abovementioned trends and their impact on criminal justice systems. The hazy line between administrative and criminal law has been around for a while and has grown independently of the European Union. Up until now, it has mainly been analysed at the national level in a sector by sector approach. This research aims to go beyond such an approach to the topic and sets a systematised assessment of the situation in motion. The main questions that this book tackles are whether and to what extent the EU contributes to the blurred line and whether it tries to restrict it, hold it in check and/or organise it. In order to reflect upon such issues, the book is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on an analysis of selected case studies, namely different types of crimes where the EU plays an increasing role: trafficking in human beings, terrorism, protection of the EU’s financial interests, market abuse, <b>environmental</b> <b>offences</b> and competition. These case studies are ordered into four different categories based on how broad and significant the intervention of administrative measures/actors is in the fight against crime. The second part of the book is of a more general nature. Following an article concerning the organisation of the coexistence of administrative and criminal law at the national level, the other contributions focus on the EU level and aim to assess the influence of the EU on the existence and development of the hazy line between administrative and criminal law. Most of them show that the EU somehow contributes to the lack of clarity. They tend to identify the main reasons for this and the potential problems caused by the blurred line in terms of individual procedural safeguards and the effectiveness of the fight against crime. This book is the result of cooperation within an international team mainly composed of academics and researchers who are members of ECLAN (the European Criminal Law Academic Network) and of practitioners working at the national or EU level. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal written about the {{difficulties}} faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) compared to larger businesses. SMEs face difficulties complying with environmental legislation, particularly because of the amount of complex law. This can result in the ‘environment’ being treated as less of a priority even though SMEs collectively have a significant environmental impact. Over the past few years, the UK has been focused towards achieving ‘better regulation’. In particular, Hampton highlighted the need for more strategic thinking when it comes to developing regulation. Hampton suggested that regulators should use a risk-based model similar to that used by the England and Wales Environment Agency (EA). This view is shared by Local Authorities and other environmental regulators; however, there has been criticism from some commentators who suggest that certain legislation is not successfully enforced. The increased use of risk assessment by the EA has reduced the number of inspections resulting in more ‘pressure’ being put on remaining inspections as well as there being less opportunity to identify non-compliance. In addition, those businesses not included under direct regulatory regimes are unlikely to be audited for compliance against any environmental legislation; consequently a significant portion of all businesses go un-inspected and uncontrolled. Because of the number of SMEs, there needs to be an effective system of regulation that controls activities and targets those businesses that pose a risk to the environment, without unnecessarily over-burdening SMEs. It is clear from the coalition Government’s planned austerity measures in 2011 that management of the environment will have to be done with less resource than before. This thesis draws together findings from research conducted between 2005 - 2011. Previous research on compliance with legislation has often been conducted in isolation with little research comparing compliance across a range of legislation, and certainly not using triangulation methods to assess SMEs’ overall legal performance. This study aimed to investigate the legal performance of UK SMEs with a range of environmental legislation. This study identifies: • the level of compliance (‘spirit’ and ‘letter’ of the law) with environmental legislation; • the impact and effectiveness of environmental legislation; and • ways of improving the environmental compliance control systems for SMEs. The study incorporated a wide range of environmental legislation, including that covering:waste management/ transfer, environmental permitting (including waste exemptions), site waste management plans, WEEE, RoHS, packaging, oil storage as well as identifying other potential <b>environmental</b> <b>offences.</b> Detailed compliance audits were conducted with 44 SMEs from 5 different sectors from the north-west of England. Interviews with SME management, site staff, regulators, Government policy officials and support organisations; in total 99 individuals were interviewed. The study indicates: • Low levels of compliance with the ‘letter’ and ‘spirit’ of the law. • Knowledge and understanding of environmental legislation was poor; no single SME, regulator or support organisation appreciated ‘environmental compliance’ as a whole. • Enforcement activity and surveillance of the SMEs audited was very low; this reflected nation enforcement figures. • The impact of environmental legislation on SMEs is overstated. The impact increased commensurate with ‘effort to comply’ and ‘enforcement action’. • There was evidence of direct and indirect environmental harm as a result of noncompliance. • Regulation can only be effective if it is complied with; measuring the link between the legislation and environmental protection must be accompanied by a clear understanding of compliance levels. This study produces an initial assessment methodology for SMEs, compliance performance indicators and recommendations to improve SME compliance controls.

More specifi cally, the hypothesis was that there would be intraseries consistency in the distances travelled (spatial consistency) and the characteristics of the crime sites selected (environmental consistency) by serial sexual offenders. For spatial consistency to be tested, the distances travelled from home to offend and the criminal range for each offence series were analysed. Support was found for spatial consistency, and, in line with much overseas research, it was also found that the offenders typically did not travel very far from home to offend (median distance of 3 km). The environmental consistency measure was made up of various physical, temporal, and contextual variables that described the environmental characteristics of an offence.

40|$|With rapid {{industrialization}} and urbanization, environmental degradation {{has become a}} major threat to the wellbeing of mankind and the environment. Despite concerted efforts by governments around the world, deteriorating environmental condition remains a major problem for the global community. While environmental issues have been studied {{from a wide range of}} perspectives, from scientific to health and wellbeing, however, there is scarce literature on the role of religion on the corporate environmental management and practice. Islam, one of the major religions of the global community has clearly articulated in the Quran and the Hadith that protection of the environment is a sacred duty before Allah. Islam emphasizes the relationship between humans and other elements of the environment, apart from individual obligation to perform rituals to Allah. However, despite the call for mankind to protect the environment under the Shariah, the environmental condition in Islam dominated countries suggests that mankind has neglected the duty to give due attention and care to the environment. This study explores the gap between Islam’s call to protect the environment and the actual corporate practice within Islam dominated countries. Malaysia, the chosen context of the study, is a multiracial society with Islam as a dominant religion. The Islamic influence among the majority of its population (Malays) is very significant to the extent that Islamic rituals are practiced as an integral part of the Malay ethnic culture. Islam also influences other aspects of the Malaysian setting, including economy and politics. However, deterioration of the environment in Malaysia over the past three decades, suggests that Malaysia has a poor record of protecting and preserving its natural environment and habitat. Much of the environmental degradation can be traced to the rapid industrialization of the economy since the 1980 s. This study examines the environmental perception and practices of managers of the Shariah-compliant public listed firms in Malaysia. The primary objective of the study is to assess whether managers’ personal beliefs influence their perception on corporate environmentalism. In this study, a sample of respondents from the firms was chosen, covering three hierarchical levels of managers - top, medium and operational. These managers were selected as they have the capacity and capability to influence corporate environmental practices of the firms. In this thesis, the social constructivist epistemology, symbolic interactionism and grounded theory method were used as the research design. The chosen research design allows for the development of new theory on factors influencing managers’ perception and actual practice of corporate environmentalism in a country where Islam is the main religion. The findings reveal that managers’ perspective is not influenced by Islamic theology or Shariah principles, but by secular worldview of environmental best practices and regulations. The component of trust among firms as proposed by the Shariah is almost non-existent. Secular regulation requirements were found to have strong coercive, mimetic and normative isomorphic pressures for firms to engage in corporate environmentalism to gain legitimacy. The study contributes to the corporate environmentalism literature from the perspective of Islam. Findings of the study reveal that Islamic religious authorities in Malaysia have failed to incorporate economic and social changes based on Shariah principles pertaining to environmental protection. Islamic environmental theology has not been translated into tangible rules, tracking mechanism, enforcement and punitive measure for violators of environmental rules. The absence of an effective Islamic environmental regulatory system is due to the traditionalist stance adopted by religious institutions in charge of Islamic affairs in Malaysia. Many of these institutions did not incorporate socioeconomic changes that have taken place over time and thus resulted in the preservation of environmental belief and practices from earlier generations who lived in an era whereby environment was not a major concern for the society. Lack of an effective Islamic environmental regulatory system, has resulted in firms relying on secular legislations for adherence to environmental protection and control. This will lead to firms meeting minimum standards for environmental protection as stipulated by regulators and that the environmental practice is not holistic, natural and sustainable over a longer period of time. In view of the findings, a new Shariah Environmental Framework that incorporates the non-material and spiritual dimensions of social reality is proposed to give support to corporate environmental initiatives in Malaysia. This includes ensuring the new framework is able to adapt to structural changes in the economic system and that the economic activities do not adversely impact the environment. In this context, fatwa, enforcement and punitive measures on <b>environmental</b> care and <b>offences</b> from an Islamic perspective should be developed, implemented and continually reviewed to ensure corporate Malaysia is not only at the fore-front of environmental protection and preservation in Malaysia, but also contribute to global best practices on environmental management...|$|R
