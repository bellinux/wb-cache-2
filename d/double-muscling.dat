40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{incidence}} and causes of dystocia and perinatal calf mortality in <b>double-muscled</b> cattle, straight and reciprocal matings between <b>double-muscled</b> and normal cattle were made in three breeding seasons. A total of 348 matings resulted in 247 calvings in the four mating types. The frequency of normal calvings or calvings requiring slight assistance was higher among normal cows mated to <b>double-muscled</b> or normal bulls {{compared with that of}} <b>double-muscled</b> cows mated to <b>double-muscled</b> bulls (94 % vs 78 %, P < 0. 05). In general the incidence of dystocia was higher among the <b>double-muscled</b> than the normal cows (19 % vs 6 %, P < 0. 05). Calf birth weight, dam weight at calving, and condition score were not shown to contribute significantly to the differences in the frequencies of dystocia. A higher incidence of dystocia was found in the mating type which frequently gave rise to phenotypically muscular calves (DM × DM). The height, width, and area of pelvic opening were significantly smaller (P < 0. 05) in the <b>double-muscled</b> than in the normal cows, indicating that the higher incidence of dystocia and perinatal mortality in <b>double-muscled</b> cattle can be attributed, at least partially, to the smaller area of pelvic opening in the <b>double-muscled</b> cattle...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess in vivo blood oxygen binding in <b>double-muscled</b> {{calves and}} dairy calves with {{conventional}} muscle conformation. ANIMALS: 58 dairy and 48 <b>double-muscled</b> calves. PROCEDURE: Calves {{were classified as}} neonatal (24 hours old) or older calves (2 to 26 days old). Venous and arterial blood samples were collected, and hemoglobin concentration, pH, PCO 2, and PO 2 were determined. Blood oxygen equilibrium curves (OEC) under standard conditions were constructed, and the oxygen exchange fraction (OEF) {{and the amount of}} oxygen released at the tissue level by 100 ml of blood (OEF Vol%) were calculated. RESULTS: In each breed, partial pressure of oxygen at 50 % saturation of hemoglobin (P 50) under standard conditions was significantly higher in older than in neonatal calves, indicating a right shift in OEC with age. Venous P 50 was significantly lower in neonatal <b>double-muscled</b> calves than in neonatal dairy calves, but arterial and venous P 50 were significantly higher in older <b>double-muscled</b> calves than in older dairy calves. In <b>double-muscled,</b> but not in dairy, calves, OEF was significantly higher in older than in neonatal calves. In neonatal calves, OEF Vol% was not significantly different between breeds, but OEF Vol% was significantly higher in older <b>double-muscled</b> calves than in older dairy calves. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The lower OEF in neonatal <b>double-muscled</b> calves, compared with dairy calves, could contribute to the higher sensitivity of <b>double-muscled</b> calves to hypoxia. Blood oxygen affinity decreased with age, but OEF and OEF Vol% were unchanged with age in dairy calves, whereas they increased with age in <b>double-muscled</b> calves...|$|R
40|$|Forty-one and 55 {{records of}} right-sided and {{systemic}} arterial pressures, cardiac output, and end-diastolic and end-systolic right ventricular volumes {{were collected from}} a group of 6 conventional and 6 <b>double-muscled</b> calves, respectively. In each group, the mean right ventricular pressure-volume loop was constructed. Global cardiac performance was significantly lower in the <b>double-muscled</b> than in the conventional calves. The right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, as well as the diastolic portion of the mean pressure-volume loop, were similar in the 2 groups. Those results suggest that the reduced cardiac performance of <b>double-muscled</b> calves is not due to a lowered ventricular preload and that diastolic properties of their myocardium {{are similar to those of}} conventional calves. When expressed on a body weight basis, however, the right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were lower in the <b>double-muscled</b> than in conventional calves. When expressed as a function of probable metabolic demand, therefore, the volumetric capacity of the cardiac pump appears to be reduced in <b>double-muscled</b> calves. The significantly lower right ventricular ejection fraction, maximal rate of ventricular pressure rise and right ventricular peak-systolic pressure to end-systolic volume ratio measured in <b>double-muscled</b> as compared with conventional calves suggest that reduced myocardial contractility may also be partly responsible for the significantly lower stroke index of the former calves. The cardiac pump of <b>double-muscled</b> cattle thus seems to be less effective than that of conventional cattle because of reduced volumetric capacity and lowered strength of contraction.

50|$|The {{value of}} the <b>double-muscling</b> breed is due to their {{superior}} carcass characteristics.

40|$|During growth, central venous, right ventricular, {{pulmonary}} arterial, pulmonary capillary wedge, {{and systemic}} arterial pressures, heart rate, and cardiac output were repeatedly measured in 41 Friesian calves, considered as having conventional muscular conformation, and in 19 Belgian White and Blue <b>double-muscled</b> calves.

These circulatory indices were calculated: stroke volume, cardiac and stroke indices, pulmonary and systemic pulse pressures, pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance indices, and right and left ventricular work indices. Results indicated that systemic arterial and pulse pressures, as well as cardiac output, stroke volume, cardiac and stroke indices, and right and left ventricular work indices were significantly (P < or = 0. 05 to 0. 001) lower but, in contrast, pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance indices were significantly (P < or = 0. 001) higher in <b>double-muscled</b> than in conventional calves. Right-sided vascular pressures and heart rate were similar in the 2 groups. These results indicated that global cardiac performance may be considerably poorer in <b>double-muscled</b> calves. Diminished cardiac performance of <b>double-muscled</b> calves appears to be related neither to relative bradycardia nor to reduced ventricular preload.

40|$|While the {{hereditary}} {{nature of}} the <b>double-muscling</b> phenotype (a generalized muscular hypertrophy documented in several cattle breeds) is well established, its precise segregation mode has remained controversial. Both monogenic models (autosomal dominant or recessive) and oligogenic models have been proposed. Using a panel of 213 bovine microsatellite markers, and an experimental pedigree obtained by backcrossing double-muscled (Belgian Blue) xconventional (Friesian) F 1 dams to double-muscled sire, we have mapped a locus on bovine Chromosome (Chr) 2 that accounts for all the phenotypic variance in the backcross generation.

40|$|Hypoxic-induced {{pulmonary}} hypertension {{is known to}} be intensive in the bovine species and sometimes leads to pathological cardiac repercussions. On the other hand, doubled-muscled cattle are predisposed to develop hypoxaemia during exercise and with respiratory diseases. Therefore {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the cardiovascular response to acute hypoxia in <b>double-muscled</b> calves compared with calves of standard conformation. Pulmonary arterial pressure, electrocardiogram and blood temperature were simultaneously recorded, arterial blood was sampled for blood gas analysis and cardiac output was determined in six Friesian calves and six <b>double-muscled</b> calves of the Belgian White and Blue breed(BWB) when breathing air (fractional inspiratory oxygen concentration [FIO 2]: 21 per cent) and when breathing a hypoxic gas mixture (FIO 2 : 10 per cent). All the absolute values of the measured parameters were significantly (P less than or equal to 0. 001) different between the two breeds, except heart rate and arterial blood gas values. The pattern of hypoxic-induced decrease in arterial PO 2 was similar in the two breeds of calves, suggesting that the pulmonary exchange capacities during hypoxia are no less efficient in <b>double-muscled</b> calves than in calves of standard conformation. Similarly, the percentage of variation of the mean pulmonary arterial pressure from its normoxic to its hypoxic value was the same in the two breeds of calves, suggesting that <b>double-muscled</b> calves are not predisposed to develop a more precocious or more intense {{pulmonary hypertension}} for a given level of hypoxaemia.

The PO 2 at 50 % hemoglobin saturation (P 50) increased during somatic growth, probably because {{of the increase in}} DPG recorded in <b>double-muscled</b> neonates and to the progressive disappearance of HbF in both breeds. The oxygen exchange fraction (OEF%) was used to assess the combined influence of the OEC shift and OEC shape changes on blood oxygen desaturation under standard conditions, when the PO 2 decreases within a physiological range. The OEF% showed an increase during the first month, then a stabilization. The effects of Cl, Pi, and pH in Friesian calves were similar as in adult cattle. <b>Double-muscled</b> neonates had a lower P 50, OEF% values, and DPG concentrations and higher hemoglobin and Cl concentrations than Friesian neonates.

40|$|An {{exceptional}} muscle development {{commonly referred}} to as 'double-muscled' (Fig. 1) has been seen in several cattle breeds and has attracted considerable attention from beef producers. <b>Double-muscled</b> animals are characterized by an increase in muscle mass of about 20 %, due to general skeletal-muscle hyperplasia-that is, {{an increase in the number}} of muscle fibers rather than in their individual diameter.

In vitro, myostatin was undetectable during proliferation, peaked at the onset of fusion and decreased during terminal differentiation. It was not detected in myotubes by in situ hybridisation. The inhibition of differentiation by BrdU prevented the decrease in expression. Our results show that the peak in myostatin expression coincides with early differentiation indicating a regulatory role in cattle myogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Objective-To assess blood oxygen binding in calves with diarrhea. Animals- 22 dairy and 26 <b>double-muscled</b> calves with diarrhea, 31 healthy dairy carves and 37 healthy <b>double-muscled</b> calves. Procedure-Severity of disease, {{including}} {{the ability of}} affected calves to stand, was evaluated. Hydration and signs of depression were scored. Venous and arterial blood samples were collected, and 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate, ATP, chloride, inorganic phosphate, lactate, pyruvate, total protein, albumin, and hemoglobin concentrations, and Hct, pH, PCO 2, and PO 2 were determined. Oxygen equilibrium curves (OEC) were constructed under standard conditions, and oxygen extraction ratios were calculated. Results-Recumbent calves of both breed-types were more dehydrated and had more severe signs of depression than ambulatory affected carves. In both breed-types, hemoglobin oxygen affinity was increased in calves with diarrhea, compared with healthy calves, as indicated by a decrease in standard partial oxygen pressure (P 50). Diarrhea induced hypocapnia and hypothermia in the most severely affected calves, which counteracted the acidosis-induced right shift in arterial and venous OEC. Arterial and venous P 50 were significantly less in <b>double-muscled</b> calves with diarrhea than healthy carves, whereas P 50 for affected dairy calves {{were similar to those}} of healthy calves. Except in the most severely affected dairy calves, oxygen extraction ratio was significantly less in carves with diarrhea, compared with healthy calves. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Release of oxygen from blood may be impaired in carves with diarrhea, depending on the effect of the disease on certain blood biochemical variables...|$|R
