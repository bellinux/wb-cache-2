40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{concept of}} 2 ̆ 2 property 2 ̆ 2 is often rudely tested in taxation cases. The rules {{laid down in}} statutes and decisions have often been constructed {{with the idea that}} property is a physical res-an object of sensation. As such, property would always have a “situs”- 2 ̆ 7 a relation in space to other objects of sense. But a chose in action is also property, although it is not a thing or res-an object of sense.

And finally, 2 ̆ 2 property 2 ̆ 2 has ceased to describe any res, or object of sense, at all, and has become merely a bundle of legal relations-rights, powers, privileges, immunities.

5000|$|This {{limitation}} {{means that}} acts of common-law larceny cannot be committed against land [...] or items attached to or forming part of land, such as buildings, trees or shrubbery, crops {{growing in the}} field, or minerals. Acts of common law larceny cannot be committed against intangible things, such as love or affection, identity (identity theft {{is a type of}} fraud), or intellectual property, such as information and ideas. For example, if a person stole the Coca-Cola formula, the crime would be larceny but the grade of the offense would be determined by the value of the paper on which the formula was recorded not the value of the recipe. (Theft of trade secrets would be a different offense). Services and labor, as well as intangible personal property (<b>incorporeal</b> <b>rights)</b> such as contract rights and choses in action, wills, codicils, or other testamentary documents; wild animals [...] and items having no economic value [...] cannot be the subjects of acts of common-law larceny.|$|R
