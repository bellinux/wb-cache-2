5|$|Less {{expensive}} cloth paintings (tüchlein) {{were more}} common in middle-class households, and records show {{a strong interest in}} domestically owned religious panel paintings. Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specified subject matter. Alterations varied from having individualised panels added to a prefabricated pattern, to the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> donor portrait. The addition of coats-of-arms were often the only change – an addition seen in van der Weyden's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin, which exists in several variations.|$|E
5|$|Medals {{were awarded}} in 24 events contested in 4 sports (8 disciplines). The {{programme}} for the 1956 Winter Games saw two new events {{added to the}} four sports and twenty-two events from the 1952 Olympics, namely the men's 30kilometre cross-country ski race and the women's 3x5kilometre cross-country relay race.

Norton Productivity Control enables users to filter Internet content and block newsgroups.

5|$|The World Is Not Enough {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics and was frequently compared to Rare's Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. It was also considered {{superior to its}} PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multiplayer mode. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and smooth frame rate, but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence. In the United States, the game sold {{more than one million}} copies.|$|E
5|$|The Ypsilanti Heritage Festival Parade {{began in}} 1979, {{and has been}} held every year. In 2007, the parade {{attracted}} wider attention when parade organizers approved the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group protesting a proposed city income tax and subsequently revoked the permission. Festival coordinators explained that their rule was to exclude groups marching to represent controversial or political issues, and that the initial approval was an error.|$|E

Overall, the episode received mixed reviews: critics praised Maslany's performance but found Tony's character underdeveloped and gimmicky and found the plot disorganised.|$|E
5|$|As with Gearbox's {{previous}} expansion pack , Blue Shift {{returns to}} the setting and events of the original game, but portrays the story {{through the eyes of}} another person. The protagonist in Blue Shift is a security guard, Barney Calhoun, employed by the Black Mesa Research Facility. After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The game received mostly positive reception. Many reviewers were critical of the short length of the game and the lack of new content, although the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> High Definition pack that upgraded the models and textures in both Blue Shift and the preceding Half-Life games was praised.|$|E
5|$|Clear Rivers {{made her}} {{literary}} debut in January 2006 when Natasha Rhodes released a novelization {{of the film}} entitled Final Destination I: The Movie. The book follows {{the events of the}} film, but expands on Clear's backstory regarding her parents. The last adaptation to feature Clear was Final Destination II: The Movie, released 28 days following its precursor. Likewise co-written by Rhodes and Nancy A. Collins, the novel follows the events of Final Destination 2, with the substitution of a birthday cake in conducting the combustion and the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hospital orderly among the victims.|$|E

5|$|During 1973, B Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment—designated the Medium Tank Trials Unit (MTTU)—evaluated the German Leopard 1 {{against the}} American M60A1 Patton as a {{replacement}} for the obsolete Centurions. The Leopard was judged the superior tank, and 90 gun tanks, eight Leopard 1 Armoured Recovery Vehicles Medium and five Leopard 1 bridge layer tanks were ordered. The Australian tanks were designated the Leopard AS1, and were based on the Leopard 1A3 which had been built for the German Army. The main difference between the Australian and German tanks was the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> SABCA fire control system, equipment to allow the tank to better operate in the tropics, additional storage boxes {{on the sides of the}} tank as well as improved trunnion bearings and combustion cleaners. These tanks were delivered to Australia in batches between 1976 and 1978. During the Leopard's service very little in the way of upgrades were undertaken, and by the 1990s they had become obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{was first}} {{released}} to the public as an open beta in December 2005. After several more minor releases throughout 2006 which mostly fixed bugs and made small adjustments to the modification, the next major release of Europa Barbarorum was version 0.80 in December 2006. Its changes included the addition of the Sabaean faction, new music, and the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new military–industrial complex system. There were three more 0.8-series releases {{during the first half of}} 2007 which primarily made minor adjustments to the modification and fixed bugs. In total, over 135,000 downloads of the 0.80–0.81 versions were tracked.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{retained}} the anti-German sentiment {{that he had}} first considered for King Ottokar's Sceptre through the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German villain, Dr. Müller, who {{would go on to}} become a recurring character in the series. He based the character largely on Georg Bell, a Scottish forger who had been a vocal supporter of the Nazi regime, and who he had learned about from an article in anti-conformist Belgian magazine La Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell). Rather than Germans, Müller's henchmen were given the Russian names Ivan and Wronzoff, although the latter would be renamed Puschov by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper for the English translation.|$|E

5|$|Hergé's book {{sales were}} higher than ever, and {{translations}} were being produced for the British, Spanish, and Scandinavian markets. He was receiving international press attention, with articles on his work appearing in France-Observateur, The Listener, and Times Literary Supplement. Paul Vandromme authored an un-critical book on Hergé, Le Monde de Tintin ("The World of Tintin"), published by Gallimard; Hergé vetoed the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> proposed preface by Roger Nimier after finding its praise for his own work too embarrassing. Radio adaptations of The Adventures of Tintin were produced, as was an animated cartoon series produced by Belvision, Hergé's Adventures of Tintin. Two live-action films were also produced, Tintin and the Golden Fleece (1961) and Tintin and the Blue Oranges (1964), the former of which Hergé had been closely involved with.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006, Manchester Phoenix {{were granted}} {{planning}} permission {{to construct a}} new rink in Altrincham. A few weeks later Cardiff Devils also received planning permission {{for the construction of}} a new rink. The Wales National Ice Rink was earmarked for demolition and a campaign for the council to provide a new facility proved successful. With both clubs confirming their intent to take part the following season, speculation began about the possible <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tenth team to replace London Racers. After the season was over, rumours about the possible admission of either Hull or Dundee became more and more widespread. On 22 June 2006, Hull Stingrays were formally elected into the Elite Ice Hockey League as the tenth active member.|$|E
5|$|In an {{analysis}} of its components, IHS's iSuppli estimated that the production cost of the 16GB model of the Nexus7 is $159.25 per unit, $19 more per unit than Amazon.com's competing tablet, the Kindle Fire. The Nexus7's higher production costs were attributed to its use of a higher-quality display, a quad-core processor (instead of the Fire's dual-core), and its <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> camera and near field communications (NFC) functionality. The firm's senior analyst Andrew Rassweiler suggested {{that the success of}} the HP TouchPad's fire sale helped increase the commercial viability of low-cost tablets from major brands, and the failures of other high-end tablets helped reduce the cost of parts, making tablets like the Kindle Fire and Nexus7 possible. However, he also noted that both tablets were being sold at thin profit margins, primarily due to their respective ties to content services.|$|E
