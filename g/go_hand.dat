Wesleyan theology rejects the doctrine of eternal security, believing that salvation can be rejected. Wesley emphasized that believers must continue to grow in their relationship with Christ, through the process of Sanctification.|$|E

25|$|The Reichstag was {{dissolved}} in June 1878 because it refused Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Law.

Bismarck helped foster support from these conservatives by enacting several tariffs protecting German agriculture, and incidentally industry, from foreign competition.|$|E

25|$|In 1951 Herbert Callen and Theodore Welton {{proved the}} quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) which was {{originally}} formulated in classical form by Nyquist (1928) {{as an explanation}} for observed Johnson noise in electric circuits.

25|$|The rate {{of human}} {{trafficking}} has directly increased in correlation with globalization. Globalization has increased cross-border {{trade and the}} demand for cheap labor; however, migration policies of the U.S. and other countries have not changed with the level of demand for cheap labor, thus forcing people illegally to immigrate. Illegal immigration then creates ideal conditions for organized criminal operations to form trafficking circles. With increased trade of foreign goods to rural areas, import competition in the rural markets has also forced people in poor areas to migrate to industrialized economies for better livelihoods. Their desperate positions often make them subject to exploitation and trafficking into different forms of forced labor to support that economy. Lastly, the technological advances that <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> in hand with globalization have facilitated the ease with which organized crime circles may conduct trafficking operations.|$|E

Levi was an acquaintance of Stojanović's from his visits to Vienna in 1921 and 1922. During his tour of Grmeč, Stojanović met the young writer Branko Ćopić, and encouraged him to write poetry about the fight of the Partisans. Stojanović said poetry was more acceptable for the Partisans than prose. [...] "Poetry and revolution," [...] he remarked, [...] "always <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> in hand." [...] He stayed in the area until mid-February 1942. The Partisan leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina considered that Stojanović had successfully countered the Italian propaganda and improved {{the condition of the}} 1st Krajina Detachment during his tour.|$|E

500|$|Johnson's {{term in the}} House expired March 3, 1819, but by August, he had {{returned}} to the state legislature where he helped secure passage of a law that abolished imprisonment for debtors in Kentucky. In December 1819, he resigned his post in the state legislature to fill the Senate seat vacated by the resignation of John J. Crittenden. He was re-elected to a full term in 1822, so that in total, his Senate tenure ran from December 10, 1819 to March 4, 1829. In 1821, he introduced legislation chartering Columbian College (later The George Washington University) in Washington, D.C. During this time period, his views on Western expansion were clear. He believed that [...] the US [...] "empire of liberty" [...] should extend across the continent, arguing in debates leading up to the Missouri Compromise that western expansion and emancipation should <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> in hand, acknowledging issues with white racism but advocating for gradual emancipation. Furthermore, he went against the ideas put forward by sympathizers of the Colonization movement, arguing in [...] "favor of meaningfully incorporating people of color into a multiracial empire." ...|$|E

500|$|Wisden noted Willis' {{achievements}} against Australia in 1977, {{stating that}} [...] "the new-ball fire power of Bob Willis, which yielded 27 wickets, was of special significance in England's high summer of success. No England bowler of authentic speed can boast a comparable record {{in a home}} series against Australia". In continued: [...] "It was singularly appropriate that team and personal triumph should <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> in hand, for few players have given such loyal and unstinted service to England as the wholehearted Willis... Happily determination is one virtue Willis does not lack, and his re-emergence as a top ranking fast bowler was well and truly deserved." [...] Across all first-class matches that year, Willis had taken 65 wickets at 18.41, {{the most of any}} season of his career. His 35 List-A wickets was also the second highest he would achieve for a season behind the 45 of 1983. Wisden also praised him for refusing to partake in Kerry Packer's World Series cricket, and proclaimed him a Wisden Cricketer of the Year along with Botham, Hendrick, Alan Jones and Ken McEwan.|$|E
500|$|The band, and {{especially}} Richards, are noted for their perfectionism. In a post-Sunset Studies interview with Grok magazine in 2000, Williams criticised the song [...] "The Good Gardener (On How He Fell)", {{to which the}} interviewer noted [...] "the Augie March perfectionism ... a slavish, romantic, almost passionate pursuit". This meme continued throughout Augie March's career; following the release of Moo, You Bloody Choir, Richards {{said he was not}} truly happy with anything he had produced so far. Ammendola agreed, and added that the band considered Moo, You Bloody Choir the weakest of their first three albums, and Sunset Studies the best. Richards later stated that he considered Watch Me Disappear his best album yet. Andrew Murfett wrote in The Age that for Augie March, [...] "creative tension, adverse circumstances and perfectionism seem to <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> in hand". Whereas Augie March's first two albums saw Richards maintain control over production, Moo, You Bloody Choir and Watch Me Disappear [...] "became community projects", and for that reason Richards declared he was not as much a fan of the latter works, though other band members have described the songs on Watch Me Disappear as the band's best yet.|$|E
500|$|The Commentaries had a {{particular}} influence in the United States; James Iredell, an original Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States wrote that the Commentaries were [...] "Books admirably calculated for a young Student, and indeed may instruct the most learned [...] [...] Pleasure and Instruction <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> in hand". When the Commentaries were first printed in North America, 1,400 copies were ordered for Philadelphia alone. Academics have also noted the early reliance of the Supreme Court on the Commentaries, probably {{due to a lack}} of US legal tradition at that time. The US academic Robert Ferguson notes that [...] "all our formative documents – the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Federalist Papers and the seminal decisions of the Supreme Court under John Marshall – were drafted by attorneys steeped in Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. So much was this the case that the Commentaries rank second only to the Bible as a literary and intellectual influence on the history of American institutions". Even today, the Commentaries are cited in Supreme Court decisions between 10 and 12 times a year.|$|E
