5000|$|Major {{national}} parties {{since the}} peace accords have not been responsive {{to the demands of}} the movement and the accords. Self-identified <b>indigenous</b> <b>representatives</b> in congress are still low; since the 1980s, indigenous congressional representation only rose from 8.0% to 13.9%. Even those self-identified <b>indigenous</b> <b>representatives</b> have not moved forward in working on the goals of the movement. [...] The lack of higher representation may be due to the discrimination and violence that has made indigenous members fearful of taking part of politics.|$|R

50|$|Following {{a series}} of {{disputes}} regarding the participation of indigenous peoples in the Panama UN-REDD National Programme, the National Coordinating Body of the Indigenous Peoples of Panama (COONAPIP) announced their withdrawal from the climate change mitigation program on February 25, 2013. COONAPIP, which brings together the country´s seven indigenous peoples and their 12 traditional <b>indigenous</b> <b>representative</b> structures, cited a failure to ensure guarantees of respect for indigenous rights and the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples, and a breach of agreements made {{during the process of}} the program´s approval. In March 2013, the Panama UN-REDD National Programme was suspended pending the results of an independent investigation and evaluation. The dispute was highlighted as an important development in the broader context of global policy efforts to implement initiatives to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+), which were at the time grappling with issues around the participation of indigenous peoples and forest communities in related initiatives, including the implementation of Free, Prior and Informed Consent. Preliminary results of an independent investigation and evaluation commissioned by the UN-REDD Programme were published, as well as a study of the conflict by a Central American non-governmental research center.|$|E
5000|$|Stephanie Greco Larson, {{writing in}} Media & Minorities: The Politics of Race in News and Entertainment, said Diff'rent Strokes (1978-1986) and Webster (1983-1987) were [...] "shows in which white {{families}} adopt black children" [...] and represented versions of [...] "the white man's burden theme on television". Robin R. Means Coleman said, [...] "In these comedies, Black children are rescued from their dysfunctional families or communities by Whites." [...] In particular, Diff'rent Strokes featured the white millionaire character Philip Drummond. Film historian Donald Bogle said, [...] "The millionaire Drummond becomes {{a great white}} father figure, able to provide the material comforts (as well as the subliminal emotional ones) and the cultural milieu that the Black community supposedly could never hope to match." [...] Dustin Tahmahkera writes that Coleman labeled Drummond a [...] "white savior" [...] type who uses [...] "his representational power to save the day by determining a conflict resolution that appeases all parties" [...] including the <b>indigenous</b> <b>representative</b> Longwalker in the episode [...] "Burial Ground". Tahmahkera also said a 1985 episode of Punky Brewster featured the girl protagonist telling a ghost story about her alter-ego Princess Moon helping [...] "ancient Indians who suddenly appear... as cave dwellers who need a white savior... to defeat an evil spirit and help keep their Last of the Dogmen-like secret existence intact." ...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{increased}} {{engagement of}} <b>Indigenous</b> <b>representatives</b> as participants on consultative panels charged with processes of natural resource management, concerns {{have been raised}} by both <b>Indigenous</b> <b>representatives</b> and management agencies regarding the ability of Indigenous people to have quality input into the decisions these processes produce. In order {{to determine how to}} more effectively engage Australian Aboriginal peoples in the management process, this article describes the results of interviews with Elders of the Bundjalung Nation and other community representatives who represent their community 2 ̆ 7 s interests on natural resource management boards within their traditional country. Community representatives identified the factors they considered important in understanding natural resource management and administrative processes and where training would enable them to make a significant contribution to the consultation process.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that organizations and their organizational arrangements {{are important in}} understanding development (Cowell et al., 2001). This chapter seeks to answer the question: what does 2 ̆ 7 organization 2 ̆ 7 mean for social impact assessment (SIA) ? There are many organizational forms that can influence SIA outcomes and processes, such as political parties, government agencies, regulatory bodies, family units, corrununity groups, landowner associations, local and. regional councils, <b>Indigenous</b> <b>representative</b> bodies, consulting firms, financing organizations and project proponents. The focus of this chapter is on the project proponent and, in particular, large, hierarchical, multinational organizations in heavy footprint industries such as the extractive industries (e. g. mining, oil and gas) and construction (e. g. for dams and other large scale infrastructure). Specifically, this chapter considers {{the degree to which}} project proponent organizations influence SIA processes and outcomes. It remains a fact that in most contexts, particularly jurisdictions that are pro-development, project proponents hold considerable power and are able to significantly influence outcomes.

40|$|The {{system needs}} {{attitudinal}} change {{as much as}} it needs Nicola Roxon’s proposed legislative reforms, writes Sean Brennan in Inside Story • IN TOWNSVILLE last week for the twentieth anniversary of the High Court’s Mabo decision, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon outlined four proposed amendments to the Native Title Act designed to “speed up” the determination process, encourage agreement-making and help Indigenous people “unlock” the economic benefits of their native title. Reactions were mixed. The Coalition took a notably adversarial position, with Senator George Brandis reportedly arguing that the consequences of the changes would be “complete confusion” and a fall in rural property values. Bryan Wyatt, who heads an alliance of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>representative</b> bodies, the National Native Title Council, said the changes fell well short of what was needed. The mining industry peak body, the Minerals Council of Australia, backed the government; the National Farmers Federation echoed Brandis’s warning about uncertainty… Read the full article Photo: Bidgee/ Wikimedi...|$|E
