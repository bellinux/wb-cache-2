5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known nativity scene in America is the Neapolitan Baroque Crèche {{displayed}} annually in the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Its backdrop is a 1763 choir screen from the Cathedral of Valladolid and a twenty-foot blue spruce decorated {{with a host of}} 18th-century angels. The nativity figures are placed at the tree's base. The crèche was the gift of Loretta Hines Howard in 1964, and the choir screen was the gift of The William Randolph Hearst Foundation in 1956. Both this presepio and the one displayed in Pittsburgh originated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> of Eugenio Catello.|$|E
5|$|The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were {{inherited}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> of William IV (William the Wise), the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), {{a pioneer}} of astronomical research. William himself died in 1592, so it has been surmised that his son and successor, Maurice, purchased the globes for the collection. They were first mentioned in 1765 in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the Fürstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel, {{during the reign of}} Landgrave Frederick III. Only a celestial globe survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.|$|E

5|$|The {{acceptance}} of the relics required the intercession of Pope Leo XIII, after an initial refusal by the church in France. Upon their arrival in England, they were housed in the Fitzalan Chapel at Arundel Castle, prior to their translation to Westminster. Although the relics had been verified and catalogued in 1644 for interment in the new shrine and in 1874 when two pieces were given to Cardinal Manning, concerns were raised about their validity by Dr. Montague James and Dr Charles Biggs in The Times. They remained at Arundel {{under the care of}} the Duke of Norfolk, whilst a historical commission was set up by Cardinal Vaughan and Archbishop Germain of Saint-Sernin. They remain to this day at Arundel. In 1966, three teeth <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> of relics from France were donated to Douai Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The {{respective}} remits of the National and Tate Galleries, {{which had}} long been contested by the two institutions, were more clearly defined in 1996. 1900 was established as the cut-off point for paintings in the National Gallery, and in 1997 more than 60 post-1900 paintings <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> {{were given to the}} Tate on a long-term loan, in return for works by Gauguin and others. However, future expansion of the National Gallery may yet see the return of 20th-century paintings to its walls.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State University Libraries {{house one}} of the largest {{collections}} of documents in the state of Florida. The Libraries' collections include over 3.2 million volumes, with a website offering access to more than 1,064 databases, 119,385 e-journals, and over 1.1 million e-books. In total, Florida State has thirteen libraries and millions of books and journals to choose <b>from.</b> <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> covers virtually all disciplines and includes a wide array of formats – from books and journals to manuscripts, maps, and recorded music. Increasingly collections are digital and are accessible on the Internet via the library web page or the library catalog. The FSU Library System also maintains subscriptions to a vast number of online databases which can be accessed from any student account on or off campus. The current dean of the Library System is Julia Zimmerman, who oversees a staff of over 268 employees and a $17.5million annual budget recorded in 2013.|$|E

5|$|The museum's Film and Video Archive {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} film {{archives}} in the world. The archive preserves a range of historically significant film and video material, including the official British film record of the First World War. Notable among the archive's First World War holdings is The Battle of the Somme, a pioneering 1916 documentary film (which was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 2005), and Der Magische Gürtel, a German 1917 propaganda film about the submarine U-35. The archive's Second World War holdings include unedited film shot by British military cameramen, which document combat actions such as the British landings on D-Day in June 1944, and the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945. The archive also holds government information films and propaganda features such as Target for Tonight and Desert Victory. The archive's post-Second World War collections include material from the Korean War, Cold War material, the former film library of NATO, and material produced by the United Nations UNTV service in Bosnia. As an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, the archive continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. The archive also seeks to acquire amateur film taken by both service personnel and civilian cameramen. Material <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> was used to make a number of well-known TV documentary series including The Great War and The World at War. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its film archive as being in excess of 23,000 hours of film, video and digital footage.|$|E
5|$|The palace, like Windsor Castle, {{is owned}} by the reigning monarch in right of the Crown. It is not the monarch's {{personal}} property, unlike Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle. Many of the contents from Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Kensington Palace, and StJames's Palace are part of the Royal Collection, held in trust by the Sovereign; they can, on occasion, be viewed by the public at the Queen's Gallery, near the Royal Mews. Unlike the palace and the castle, the purpose-built gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>collection.</b> It occupies the site of the chapel destroyed by an air raid in World WarII. The palace's state rooms have been open to the public during August and September and on selected dates throughout the year since 1993. The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire devastated many of its state rooms. In the year to 31 March 2016, 519,000 people visited the palace, and 194,000 visited the gallery.|$|E
