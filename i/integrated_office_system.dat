40|$|This paper {{considers}} different assessment {{techniques in}} the context of a study of users learning a commercial <b>integrated</b> <b>office</b> <b>system.</b> The purpose of the study was to trace the development of different aspects of the cognitive processes and representations which support user performance during the learning of a system. Since it is acknowledged that no single assessment technique could deliver this, several different techniques were used. In order to incorporate the results delivered by these different techniques, it is necessary to develop explicit models of what each test delivers, and the view of the user onto which such results will be mapped. An attempt will be made in this paper to be explicit about both. The initial view taken of user learning is characterisable by a general model of skill acquisition (after Fitts, 1964). This model divides learning into three phases. In the first, users acquire sufficient fragments of knowledge about a system to support the performance of some tasks. In the second phase, the knowledge recruited to perform tasks is 'compiled' into procedures. In the third phase, users draw on these compiled procedures and exhibit performance which can be considered 'expert like'. A further distinction exists in this model between the accessibility of the representations of knowledge in the first and third phases. It is assumed (after Anderson, 1983) that the knowledge in the first phase is accessible to the processes of verbalisation, whereas the compiled procedures drawn on in the third phase would not be articulatable. When task performance is described by users who have reached the third phase of learning for those tasks, the explanation will not be based on the 'compiled' knowledge which actually supports performance, but on other knowledge t [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{persistent}} problem among {{researchers in}} office automation {{has been the}} absence of a comprehensive theory of office information systems. Commercial software such as spreadsheet and financial packages provide only limited support for tasks such as developing balance sheets and income statements. It also supports only limited software integration, usually at the interface and data levels. A model of an office is proposed as a basis for developing integrated office systems. Prior approaches to this problem have been mostly limited to only one or two aspects of the office with the exclusion of others. These approaches have been characterized as forms, data, information, procedural, functional, communication, and decision oriented. The integrated model synthesizes these different views of the office. The proposed model consists of macroscopic and microscopic components. The macroscopic structure is modelled with a semantic network which describes how "functions" of the office are related to one another. The lower level component of the model consists of "procedures" which support the functions described by the functional structure. These procedures use utilities and tools at a lower level of accomplishing standard operations. Thus support for functions is provided through procedures which rely on utilities at a lower level. The model is operationalized with a knowledge base/database containing the necessary knowledge/data for accomplishing the functions and procedures. Detailed designs of the components of the architecture are presented. A prototype based on the design has been implemented in Prolog. The contribution of the dissertation has five dimensions: these are the literature review, the office study, the conceptual model, and a prototype office system. The literature review provides a clarification of concepts and identification of research problems. The office study contributes {{to a better understanding of}} analyzing offices from the point of view of modelling. The conceptual model is a good starting point for designing and developing integrated office systems. The prototype system demonstrates the feasibility of the model for developing an <b>integrated</b> <b>office</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

Particular emphasis is given to structural changes due to the introduction of newer information technologies in organizations. The new information technologies have restructed the average organization's middle banks and, as a consequence, they have shrunk drastically. Organizational pyramids have flattened with fewer levels since executives have realized that they can get ahold of the needed information via the new technologies quicker and directly and do not have to rely on middle-level managers. Power shifts are typically accompanied with the introduction of these technologies resulting in the generation of a new form of organizational power...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the area of}} user-involvement {{in the development of}} computerised <b>office</b> information <b>systems,</b> with particular reference to gender relations and to initiatives in 'Human-Centred' systems design. it is based on a review of literature in computer science and in social science, and on case-study research. The thesis forms a contribution to the interdisciplinary work of the Human-Centred <b>Office</b> <b>Systems</b> Project, at Sheffield Polytechnic. Interdisciplinary research into information systems development is expanding, partly in response to evidence that many systems fail to meet their stated objectives. There is increasing emphasis on issues of "user relations', including user-involvement. In offices, as in other contexts, women tend to be defined as users or operators of technology; however, there has been little research into the constraints and opportunities women office workers face specifically in connection with information systems development. Previous projects within Human-Centred Systems research have been located in areas in which men predominate, such as printing and engineering. The thesis makes a contribution to new interdisciplinary research on information systems in two main respects. Firstly, the scope for clerical involvement is examined. It is argued that clerical skills and experience can form a strong basis for involvement in <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> design; in addition, managerial reliance on clerical skill and cooperation appear to increase, with the advent of on-line, <b>integrated</b> <b>office</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the case study research also illustrates the ways in which gendered associations can play a part in the definition of 'social' and 'technical' aspects of systems development, tending to marginalise clerical contributions. Secondly, therefore, the thesis {{examines the}} potential of Human-Centred systems development approaches to address gender inequalities in opportunities for user-involvement. Methods for establishing a Human-Centred approach in a local authority department are proposed; an assessment of their use, in a case-study context, exposes a weakness in the Human-Centred tradition in relation to management practices. In conclusion, specific proposals are formulated to support the creation of new links between organisational strategies on information technology and those on gender inequality...|$|R

These include decomposition, analysis, storage, automatic classification and utilization of inter-letter references.

40|$|Teaching {{institutions}} {{around the}} world are using large, unwieldy, and expensive learning management system (LMS) packages that are beginning to have profound effects on their whole organizations. Such LMS packages in turn {{go to great lengths to}} interoperate with the desktop information productivity software that almost all institutions use, Microsoft <b>Office</b> <b>System.</b> Since a very large part of the instructional content is generated in Office, it seems sensible to investigate whether straightforward extensions of the <b>Office</b> <b>System</b> could become an LMS in their own right. This chapter describes research and development that <b>integrated</b> Microsoft <b>Office</b> <b>System,</b> SharePoint Windows Services, and SharePoint Portal server (SPS) as the heart of an off-the-shelf LMS. Already designed to work closely with Office, SPS features are compared against the list of features expected of an ideal LMS. Where gaps in the LMS features were discovered in SPS, a number of small extensions of standard Office applications were proposed to fill these gaps and create a credible LMS. These Microsoft tools and custom extensions were put to use in teaching and administration during a 2 -semester (8 -month) trial at Bond University. The SPS installation was hosted in partnership with G-Netech Pty Ltd.
