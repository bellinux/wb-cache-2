5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E

25|$|Wally Terzinsky (Scott Thompson) is a husband, father, and closeted homosexual.

He is prescribed GLeeMONEX by a frustrated therapist, (Dave Foley) ("You're gay. I know it, your family <b>knows</b> <b>it...</b> dogs know it!").

Wally finds himself standing considerably {{closer to his}} drill instructor when through fantasizing. Shortly after this, he finally admits (via song and dance) {{that he is in}} fact homosexual. The character is an obvious variation on the TV show's dimwitted Danny Husk (Kevin McDonald as his wife in both the movie and series).|$|E
