Uncle Bob said our fam'ly always believed that it brought 'em good luck to own this umbrella. He couldn't say why, not knowing its early history, but he was afraid that if I lost the umbrella, bad luck would happen to us. So he made me go right home to put the umbrella back where I got it. I was sorry Uncle Bob was so cross, and I didn't want to go home yet, where the governess was crosser 'n he was. I wonder why folks get cross when it rains?

40|$|Whenever a memoirist gives a reading, {{someone in}} the {{audience}} is sure to ask: <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> family react? Revisiting our pasts and exploring our experiences, we often reveal more of our nearest and dearest than they might prefer. This volume navigates the emotional and literary minefields that any writer of family stories or secrets must travel when depicting private lives for public consumption. Essays by twenty-five memoirists, including Faith Adiele, Alison Bechdel, Jill Christman, Judith Ortiz Cofer, Rigoberto González, Robin Hemley, Dinty W. Moore, Bich Minh Nguyen, and Mimi Schwartz, explore the fraught territory of family history told from one perspective, which, from another angle in the family drama, might appear quite different indeed. In her introduction to this book, Joy Castro, herself a memoirist, explores the ethical dilemmas of writing about family and offers practical strategies for this tricky but necessary subject. A sustained and eminently readable lesson in the craft of memoir, Family Trouble serves as a practical guide for writers {{to find their own}} version of the truth while still respecting family boundaries...|$|E

Likewise, we assume that Pahuateca's participation was due to the attempt of the regional political leaders to execute the mandates of the liberal state in terms that were locally acceptable; That is to say, they elaborated a local agenda that provided political and social stability in the municipality based on the defense of the local autonomy, and not in the necessity of an agrarian claim. From a local perspective, we observe how the specific characteristics acquired by the revolutionary movement in Pahuatlán are closely related to what happened at the national and state levels...|$|E

The MN Academic Standards that this lesson address is Grade 4, Earth Science. I {{thought it was a}} great lesson, however, I modified it slightly to focus more on Minnesota landforms.

Students will be asked to research the coastline of Lake Superior. They will be asked to answer these questions: Locate it on a map. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> the coastline develop? What forces of nature caused it to form? What is unique about it? What efforts are being made to preserve the landform? Once their research is complete they will be creating a display of their topic. Their displays should answer the questions from their research. I thought that this lesson would be valuable to a 4 th grade classroom because they are researching a landform that is located in their state and some of them may have even been there. I also liked it because they were able to create their research topic with their own hands to reinforce the ideas they learned while researching. ...|$|E
40|$|Champaign. His {{research}} interests {{are in the}} fundamentals of control and dynamical systems, {{as well as the}} applications of systems and feedback techniques in several physical and engi-neering problems. These areas include robust and optimal con-trol, distributed and networked control and dynamical systems, shear flow transition and turbulence, and the use of active control in thermoacoustic energy conversion devices. BASSAM BAMIEH Q. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> education and early career lead to your initial and con-tinuing interest in the control field? Bassam: I came to the field by a circuitous path. My undergraduate degrees were in physics and elec-trical engineering. When I started graduate school at Rice University, I wanted to do computer engineer-ing (digital hardware design), then I quickly switched to the systems area and did an M. S. in pattern recogni-tion and image processing, before I finally decided to do a Ph. D. in con-trol. I like to say that I took the “sce-nic route ” through grad school. What made me decide on the con-trol field was its mathematical rich-ness as well as the cross-disciplinary nature of the field. I remember being amazed at the concept of using com-mon mathematical models, like dif-ferential equations or transfer func-tions, to describe diverse physical phenomena from electrical, mechani-cal, chemical, and other fields. It really felt like a “grand unified theory’ ’ of engineering. We normally like to emphasize the concept of feedback as central to control, and indeed it is...|$|E
