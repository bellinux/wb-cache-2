5|$|For the operation, the Germans {{committed}} five Air Corps to the attack, comprising 1,100 aircraft. The {{operation was}} launched on 3 June 1940. British intelligence had warned the French {{of the impending}} attack, and the operation failed to achieve the strategic results desired by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force). <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe, {{the plight of the}} French ground and air forces at this stage meant that the failure of the operation would not impede the defeat of France.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Invaders, one {{of their}} members Mike Shonsey managed to slip from the barn {{and was able to}} contact Governor Barber the next day. Frantic efforts to save the WSGA group ensued and two days into the siege Governor Barber was able to {{telegraph}} President Benjamin Harrison a plea for help late on the night of April 12, 1892.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Old Bay Line, its freight and {{passenger}} traffic remained relatively strong in the 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted from coal to oil burning in 1933 and had sprinkler systems installed in 1938. In 1939, the State of Virginia was converted to oil burning and all three ships were equipped with radio direction finders and ship-to-shore telephones.|$|E

5|$|Site {{testing for}} both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The {{construction}} of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} fire rapidly increased, when enemy {{vehicles}} {{could be seen}} moving towards the villa from the nearby woods; this in particular worried Frost, as the radio sets the force had been issued failed to work, giving him no means of communication with his other detachments, including 'Nelson' who were tasked with clearing the evacuation beach. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> British, Flight Sergeant Cox and several sappers arrived at this time and proceeded to dismantle the radar equipment, placing the pieces on specially designed trolleys.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this defeat, and with rumours circulating in Constantinople of his death, Theophilos's position was precarious. He abandoned the campaign and withdrew to Dorylaion, whence he soon departed for the imperial capital. Ancyra itself was left abandoned, and plundered by the Arab army on 27 July. Then the united Abbasid army marched unopposed to Amorion, which fell after a siege of two weeks. Out of its entire population of some 70,000, only about half survived the brutal sack, to be sold as slaves. The fall {{of the city was}} one of the heaviest blows Byzantium suffered in the entire 9th century, both in material and symbolic terms. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Empire, news of a rebellion in the Caliphate forced al-Mu'tasim to withdraw soon after.|$|E
60|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> us, <b>the</b> {{schooner}} was anchored nearer down stream {{than the}} remainder of the craft, and there was no difficulty in running the Avenger alongside.|$|R
60|$|Things, however, {{turned out}} <b>fortunately</b> <b>for</b> Oswald. <b>The</b> army had {{advanced}} a week {{across the border}} when a messenger arrived at Ludlow, with a letter from London <b>for</b> <b>the</b> king.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> Oswald, <b>the</b> {{doll and}} the lynx spot {{him in the}} sky. They then use the lynx's long beard to cushion his fall. Oswald and the doll give each other a smooch.|$|R
5|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Germans, Emirau {{was one of}} the few {{islands in}} the region to not have a Royal Australian Navy-supplied radio to contact the Australian authorities. The two European {{families}} on the island provided the released prisoners with supplies, and sent a canoe to Kavieng in New Ireland to notify the Australian colonial government. A schooner was dispatched to bring additional supplies to Emirau, and arrived there on 24December. The colonial administrator of New Britain and further supplies was also flown to Emirau on board a flying boat. The released prisoners were embarked onto the steamer Nellore on 29December to be transported to Townsville in Queensland, where they arrived on 1 January1941. They provided useful intelligence on the German raiders' operations, and the German Naval Staff issued a directive on 19February 1941 prohibiting raiders from releasing further prisoners.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{future of}} the Spitfire, many of the {{production}} jigs and machine tools had already been relocated by 20 September, and steps were being taken to disperse production to small facilities throughout the Southampton area. To this end, the British government requisitioned the likes of Vincent's Garage in Station Square Reading, which later specialised in manufacturing Spitfire fuselages, and Anna Valley Motors, Salisbury, which was to become the sole producer of the wing leading-edge fuel tanks for photo-reconnaissance Spitfires, as well as producing other components. A purpose-built works, specialising in manufacturing fuselages and installing engines, was built at Star Road, Caversham in Reading. The drawing office in which all Spitfire designs were drafted was relocated to Hursley Park, near Southampton. This site also had an aircraft assembly hangar where many prototype and experimental Spitfires were assembled, but since it had no associated aerodrome no Spitfires ever flew from Hursley.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> party, {{the reunification}} of worlds has opened the {{pathways}} to ancient sites where weapons and powers used to quell Enuo's rise a thousand years past lay in wait. So armed, the party enters the Rift, seeking out Exdeath {{at the center of}} the inter-dimensional nexus where they, too, fall prey to the Void. With help from their fallen allies, the party survives and is returned before Exdeath, now manifested as a demonic sylvan, battling him until he weakens and is swallowed by his own power. He then transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying the very essence of reality, himself with it. Exdeath is ultimately defeated, and, using the power of the Crystal shards, the heroes seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its Crystals. The game's ending varies based on how many party members are still alive at Neo Exdeath's defeat, detailing the events after the world's resurrection. At the end, the remaining group visits the Guardian Tree, and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> McGuerinn, <b>the</b> police {{discover}} that the gangster is {{the man behind the}} wanted anonymous criminal Frisco Ghost, and after a series of events the rivalry ends with Louis being arrested by the police.|$|R

50|$|The tiny {{invasion}} force captured Guiria, a {{small town}} on the gulf coast of Venezuela. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> them, <b>the</b> main body of 500 Royalist troops had recently moved inland, leaving only the local militia which was quickly overcome.|$|R
5|$|Murdoch {{had been}} {{concerned}} lest {{he and his}} men should be engaged when they reached the Kapyong River in an exhausted condition and with little ammunition. Luck was with the Australians, and due to difficulties of communication and navigation along the ridge line in the dark, elements of A Company had become separated and the last two platoons descended to the river too early to strike the ford. However, reaching a deserted part of the bank they realised their mistake and immediately turned west again, following the river-bank to the ford. The Chinese did not follow this sudden final turn and plunged on into the river, giving A Company an unexpected opportunity to break free. The Chinese were subsequently detected by the Canadians on Hill 677 and were fired on. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Australians, the Canadian fire did not hit them. This possibility had been foreseen earlier; however, problems with the radio relay between the Canadians and Australians meant that there had been no guarantee that the withdrawing force would not be mistaken for Chinese as they crossed the river.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 1944 General Sir Harold Alexander, {{commanding}} the Allied Armies in Italy, launched Operation Diadem, which finally {{broke through the}} Gustav Line and forced the Tenth Army to withdraw. In the process, a gap opened up between the Tenth and Fourteenth Armies, threatening both with encirclement. For this failure, Kesselring relieved von Mackensen of his command, replacing him with General der Panzertruppe Joachim Lemelsen. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Germans, Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, obsessed with the capture of Rome, failed {{to take advantage of}} the situation and the Tenth Army was able to withdraw to the next line of defence, the Trasimene Line, where it was able to link up with the Fourteenth Army and then conduct a fighting withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{expected}} Italy (with its African possessions) {{to join the}} war on Germany's side {{as soon as it}} began, but <b>fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Allies this did not immediately occur. No.1 Squadron SRAF was already in northern Kenya, having been posted to the Italian East African frontier at Britain's request in late August. The first Southern Rhodesian ground forces to be deployed abroad during World War II were 50Territorial troops under Captain TG Standing, who were posted to Nyasaland in September {{at the request of the}} colonial authorities there to guard against a possible uprising by German expatriates. They returned home after a month having seen little action. White Rhodesian officers and non-commissioned officers left the colony in September and October 1939 to command units of black Africans in the west and east of the continent, with most joining the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF) in Nigeria, the Gold Coast and neighbouring colonies. The deployment of white Rhodesian officers and NCOs to command black troops from elsewhere in Africa met with favour from the military leadership and became very prevalent.|$|E
60|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> Leigonyer, <b>the</b> commissioners of the Convention {{reported}} most favourably of {{the activity}} and energy that he had personally shown and, although {{he was accused of}} treachery in the Assembly, this report saved him from the guillotine.|$|R
60|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> him <b>the</b> creak and dip of the oars, the clank of chains, and the lashes beating sharply {{upon the}} wretched Jew were {{sufficient}} to muffle his voice. But the Moor heard him, and {{his dark eyes}} gleamed.|$|R
5|$|The Latvian city of Mitau (Jelgava) fell to Polish-Lithuanian forces {{commanded}} by Aleksander Hilary Połubiński in January 1660 and the allies were preparing {{an invasion of}} Zeeland; the outlook was not good <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Swedes. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> them, <b>the</b> war would soon end.|$|R
5|$|As soon as Gibraltar was captured, the Alliance {{set about}} {{preparing}} for a Bourbon counter-attack. The Alliance fleet sailed a short distance across the strait to Tetuan in Morocco, where it took on fresh water. On 22 August, a French fleet was sighted in the strait but began to withdraw after being spotted. Rooke {{caught up with the}} French off Málaga on 24 August and attacked, in a bid to prevent the French from slipping past him and attacking Gibraltar. The two fleets were evenly matched but the French ships were faster and had more ammunition than the confederates. They did not manage to make this advantage count, however, and the Battle of Vélez-Málaga was effectively fought to a draw. No ships were sunk but both fleets took very heavy casualties with around 3,000 killed or wounded on each side, including the French commander. The Anglo-Dutch fleet was hampered by a shortage of shot and gunpowder, much of which had already been used in bombarding Gibraltar during the operation to capture it, and Sir George Byng's squadron was forced to pull back when it ran out of ammunition. The rest of the fleet was dangerously low on ammunition but <b>fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> confederates, the French withdrew the following day, leaving the Anglo-Dutch fleet to limp back to Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in the game, Florida State was fully {{committed}} to running down the clock and executed three straight rushing plays to keep the time running out. Virginia Tech was forced to use two of its timeouts to stop the clock, but was eventually successful in forcing a Seminole punt. The kick rolled inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line before being downed, pinning the Hokies deep in their territory. The first play of Tech's drive was almost a disaster for Virginia Tech, as Marcus Vick fumbled the ball while attempting to avoid a sack. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hokies, the ball was leapt on by Tech's Duane Brown and the drive stayed alive. Virginia Tech moved the ball downfield through the air with difficulty. Due to the limited time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to rely mainly on passing plays, which stopped the clock when incomplete or were completed for a first down. A 14-yard pass to Josh Morgan and a 10-yard throw to Cedric Humes moved the Hokies to their 47-yard line. Vick then completed a 19-yard pass to Jeff King and Florida State committed a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty on Marcus Vick, which was tacked onto the end of the play. After the penalty, Virginia Tech's offense was deep in Florida State territory, and two plays later, Marcus Vick ran into the end zone on a one-yard quarterback scramble. Rather than attempt another two-point conversion, the Hokies kicked the extra point, and with 1:44 remaining, Virginia Tech had closed the gap to 2722.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August 1782, Hector {{separated}} {{from the rest of}} the prize ships in heavy weather and on 22 August encountered two large French frigates, Aigle of 40 guns and Gloire of 32 guns. Together these vessels significantly outclassed the leaky ship of the line in weight of shot, but Captain John Bourchier determined to resist the French attack, preparing Hector as the French approached. The French ships surrounded Hector at 02:00 and the engagement was furiously contested, with Bourchier wounded early on and many of his officers following him below with serious injuries. Within a short period, Inman was the only officer remaining on deck, but he was able to successfully drive the French away following a failed attempt to board, although Hector was left in a severely damaged state with 75 men killed or wounded. A hurricane that followed the battle inflicted further damage and the ship was badly flooded, seawater ruining the food supplies and threatening to sink the ship completely. Some of the crew were so ill and exhausted that they collapsed and died while manning the pumps. Inman only managed to prevent the remaining sailors from fleeing below decks by carrying loaded pistols and threatening men who refused his orders. Once the storm had abated it was clear that Hector was foundering; her rudder and masts had been torn away and the pumps were unable to keep pace with the water leaking through the battered hull. For two weeks Inman made desperate efforts to keep the ship afloat, as food and water supplies ran low and the hull began to collapse in on itself. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> men aboard Hector, the tiny snow Hawke appeared and approached the ship of the line to render assistance. Throwing his cargo overboard, Captain John Hill worked with Inman to supervise the transfer of all of Hectors remaining men, many of whom were wounded or sick, into Hawke as Hector rapidly sank. No men were lost in the operation and Inman was the last to leave, Hector disappearing ten minutes after the boat carrying him reached Hawke. The snow set sail for St John's in Newfoundland, its crew and passengers subsisting on short rations; they arrived off the port on the same day they consumed the last water supplies.|$|E
50|$|After {{the signing}} of the peace on 20 October 1883 with the {{government}} of Iglesias, Lizardo Montero tried to resist in Arequipa, but <b>fortunately</b> <b>for</b> Chile, <b>the</b> arrival of the its men stampeded Montero's troops and Montero went for a Bolivian asylum.|$|R

25|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> team, {{there was}} an {{ownership}} prospect waiting in the wings, and after spending much of the summer hammering out the deal, on August 11 Wojtek Wojcicki was officially introduced as the new owner of the indoor side.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the year}} 1916 was spent by the Turks with {{organizational}} and operational changes in the Caucasian front. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman commanders, the Russians were quiet during this period.
