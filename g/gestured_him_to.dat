2500|$|During the Award {{ceremony}} {{after the}} finals, Ricky Ponting tapped {{the shoulders of}} BCCI President [...] Sharad Pawar and <b>gestured</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> handover the trophy. Soon after the trophy was handed over, Damien Martyn nudged Sharad Pawar off the stage eager to relish the moment and to pose for the waiting photographers. Former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar who was also present in the stage, later disclosed {{that one of the}} Australian team members referred to Pawar as [...] "Hiya Buddy".|$|E
6000|$|As {{he passed}} near Madame de Chevreuse, {{she made a}} <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come to her. [...] "You did not accept my warning," [...] she said sadly. [...] "Remember, a storm is not past because the first flash of {{lightning}} does not strike." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was quite}} {{in vain for}} me to {{endeavor}} <b>to</b> make <b>him</b> sensible {{that he ought to}} speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he persisted in being to Me.|$|R
60|$|One night, {{after all}} in Tom's cabin were sunk in sleep, he was {{suddenly}} aroused by seeing her face at the hole between the logs, that served for a window. She made a silent <b>gesture</b> for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come out.|$|R
50|$|Later {{during the}} {{birthday}} celebration, Edoardo Jr. receives a surprise visit from Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), the chef who defeated {{him in the}} race earlier that day. Antonio brings a beautiful cake as a gift, and Edoardo, flattered by the <b>gesture,</b> introduces <b>him</b> <b>to</b> his mother.|$|R
60|$|He {{passed his}} hand over his eyes with that weary <b>gesture</b> {{peculiar}} <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and then fell silent.|$|R
60|$|She {{rose from}} her chair and settled down {{in a corner of}} the settee. With a little half-conscious <b>gesture</b> she invited <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take the place by her side.|$|R
50|$|The first December 1 {{national}} holiday saw the largest celebrations in Alba Iulia, the location {{in which the}} union of Transylvania with Romania was signed. They were marked by significant political polarization: Corneliu Coposu, then {{the leader of the}} anticommunist opposition, was interrupted several times during a speech by boos from the crowd. Petre Roman, then the prime minister, showed such pleasure at these repeated interruptions that Ion Iliescu had <b>to</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stop. This signal was captured on filmed and spread widely by the mass media.|$|R
60|$|Maud {{needed no}} more. To {{save the life}} of Bob, her well-beloved, he who had so long been beloved in secret, she would have gone with one far less known and trusted than the Tuscarora. She made an eager <b>gesture</b> for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> proceed, and they were soon {{on their way to the}} mill, {{threading}} the mazes of the forest.|$|R
50|$|Prior to his swims, Condorelli {{gives the}} {{finger to his}} father, who returns the <b>gesture</b> back <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{as a way to}} boost {{confidence}} and relieve stress.|$|R
60|$|Maurice paused: once more, with a <b>gesture</b> {{habitual}} <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{he crossed}} {{his arms over his}} chest and resumed his restless march up and down the narrow room.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{gave him}} a startled look, {{but before he could}} take in the meaning of his words, Athelny, fixing his glasses on his nose with the <b>gesture</b> {{habitual}} <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> went on.|$|R
5000|$|Diana {{pulled up}} a carpet in an upstairs room at Kensington Palace, to show Jephson what she {{believed}} was evidence of bugging: fresh sawdust and disturbed planks: [...] "She pointed silently at the sawdust, and nodded significantly." [...] Jephson tried to reassure her that this was simply {{the result of the}} rewiring of all the Royal palaces, following the 1992 fire at Windsor Castle, but Diana, after <b>gesturing</b> for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> remain silent, was evidently unconvinced.|$|R
50|$|A twentieth-century Kerala Hindi scholar, Dr. Muhammad Kunj Mettar, {{established}} Dakhni as {{a source}} for modern Hindi. Dr. Suniti Kumar Chattopadhyay also maintained that it was Dakhni that established the use of Khari Boli replacing Braj in the North. In fact, even the name Hindi for the language originated in the South. A Tamilian, Kazi Mahamud Bahari in 17th century used the word Hindi for Dakhni in his Sufi poetry called Man Lagan. Renaming Dakhini as Hindi was probably a symbolic <b>gesture</b> by <b>him</b> <b>to</b> extend the geographical reach of this language.|$|R
50|$|Villainous wrestler Tracy Smothers {{debuted in}} the first season of Juggalo Championship Wrestling's {{internet}} wrestling show SlamTV! by cutting a series of promos in which he insulted the company, the owners (Insane Clown Posse), and the Juggalo fanbase. It became a common <b>gesture</b> for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> hide behind the curtain and flip off the crowd prior to entering the ring. He flaunted his PWU Hardcore Championship, which he proclaimed the only championship that he respected, while verbally abusing the fans on the mic. On occasion, Smothers would even get in physical altercations with fans.|$|R
6000|$|An officer then arose to {{read the}} charge. The king made a <b>gesture</b> for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be silent. He, however, persisted in his reading, {{although}} the king once or twice attempted <b>to</b> interrupt <b>him.</b> The president, too, ordered <b>him</b> <b>to</b> proceed. The charge recited the evils and calamities which had resulted from the war, and concluded by saying that [...] "the said Charles Stuart is and has been the occasioner, author, and continuer of the said unnatural, cruel, and bloody wars, and is therein guilty of all the treasons, murders, rapines, burnings, spoils, desolations, damages, and mischiefs to this nation acted and committed in the said wars, or occasioned thereby." ...|$|R
60|$|The cruel {{time had}} come. They made their last promises; shared their last kisses; {{held each other}} in the last embrace. She threw herself on the sofa, as he left her--with a <b>gesture</b> which entreated <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go, while she could still control herself. Once, he looked round, when he reached the door--and then it was over.|$|R
60|$|But Maud heard {{neither the}} {{compliment}} nor {{the expression of}} countenance which accompanied it. She merely made an impatient gesture to proceed. Nick gazed intently at the excited girl; {{and there was an}} instant when he seemed to waver in his own purpose; but the <b>gesture</b> repeated, caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> turn, and lead the way up the glen.|$|R
60|$|When Mark Heathcote {{saw that}} the man who had so rudely broken in upon the {{peaceful}} habits of his family was ready to proceed, he advanced steadily in his front, like one who boldly invited inquiry, and by a grave <b>gesture</b> desired <b>him</b> <b>to</b> follow. The stranger, perhaps as much from habit as from any settled design, first cast a free glance around at the bevy of fluttered maidens, leered even upon the modest and meek-eyed Ruth herself, and then took the direction indicated by him who had so unhesitatingly assumed the office of a guide.|$|R
5000|$|According to the legend, Adi Shankaraachaarya, {{was on his}} way to {{the temple}} after {{finishing}} his bath. Suddenly he saw a chandaala (an outcaste) and his four dogs on the way, and <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> keep a distance, as per the custom in those days. The outcaste then asked him some questions which form the substance of two verses which are a prelude to the main work.Among the questions asked, the significant one was like this-"Whether My body should give way to you or my Soul?". On hearing these questions, Sri Shankara assumed (realized) that the person before him was no ordinary person but Lord Shiva himself, and the dogs, the four Vedas. Shankara replies to these questions in five verses. These five verses have been collectively given the name ‘Maneeshaapanchakam’. The word ‘maneeshaa’, meaning ‘conviction’ appears in the last line in all the five verses.|$|R
60|$|Karakoee {{stood near}} the edge of the water with a large roll of cotton-cloth thrown over one arm, and holding two or three canvas bags of powder, while with the other hand he grasped a musket, which he {{appeared}} to be proffering to several of the chiefs around him. But they turned with disgust from his offers, and seemed to be impatient at his presence, with vehement <b>gestures</b> waving <b>him</b> off <b>to</b> his boat, and commanding <b>him</b> <b>to</b> depart.|$|R
6000|$|The Professor had {{intended}} to say [...] "our world," [...] but hesitated, not feeling positive at the moment to which he himself belonged; Malvina's or Mrs. Muldoon's. So he made it [...] "the" [...] world instead. Another <b>gesture</b> conveyed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that Malvina was entirely in his hands.|$|R
60|$|A little awed by {{the manner}} of the Commander, Hurlstone bowed and {{followed}} him across the courtyard. It was filled with soldiers, and near the gateway a double file of dragoons, with loaded carbines, were standing at ease. Two sentries were ranged on each side of an open door which gave upon the courtyard. The Commander paused before it, and with a <b>gesture</b> invited <b>him</b> <b>to</b> enter. It was a large square apartment, lighted only by the open door and a grated enclosure above it. Seated in his shirtsleeves, before a rude table, Senor Perkins was quietly writing. The shadow of Hurlstone's figure falling across his paper caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> look up.|$|R
6000|$|... "What can the {{prejudice}} {{of the world}} reproach me with? Have I provoked his confidence? No! Have I by a single word, look, or <b>gesture</b> given <b>him</b> reason <b>to</b> suppose that I accepted his trust in me? No! It is true that I consented {{to go and see}} his Ziemianitch. Well, I have been <b>to</b> see <b>him.</b> And I broke a stick on his back too--the brute." ...|$|R
25|$|However, Mannerheim and {{his guests}} {{chose to go}} to a car that did not have a {{microphone}} in it. Damen acted quickly, pushing a microphone through one of the car windows to a net shelf just above where Hitler and Mannerheim were sitting. After eleven minutes of Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation, Hitler's SS bodyguards spotted the cords coming out of the window and realized that the Finnish engineer was recording the conversation. They <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stop recording immediately, and he complied. The SS bodyguards demanded that the tape be immediately destroyed; but YLE was allowed to keep the reel, after promising to keep it in a sealed container. It was given to Kustaa Vilkuna, head of the state censors' office, and in 1957 returned to YLE. It was made available to the public a few years later. It is the only known recording of Hitler speaking in an unofficial tone.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, Hines {{visited his}} idol, Sammy Davis, Jr., {{as he was}} dying of throat cancer, unable to speak. After Davis died, an {{emotional}} Hines spoke at Davis's funeral of how Sammy had made a <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "as if passing a basketball … and I caught it." [...] Hines spoke of the honor that Sammy thought that Hines could carry on from where he left off.|$|R
5000|$|The ranch owner, realizing his ruin if {{the cattle}} are not sold, drives with his {{daughter}} to the stockyard. The owner tells him that no cattle have arrived yet. Defeated, the ranch owner prepares to leave when he sees Friendless leading the herd into the stockyard. Overjoyed, the ranch owner tells Friendless that his house and anything he owns is his to ask for. Friendless says that he only wants [...] "her," [...] <b>gesturing</b> behind <b>him</b> <b>to</b> where the ranch owner's daughter is. The owner is surprised and the daughter flattered, but they quickly realize that it's Brown Eyes that he's referring to. The three drive back to the ranch, with Brown Eyes beside Friendless in the back seat.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story is}} told {{in the first person}} by John Wiltshire, a British copra trader on the fictional South Sea island of Falesá. Upon {{arriving}} on the island, he meets a rival trader named Case, who (in an apparently friendly <b>gesture)</b> arranges for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "married" [...] to a local girl named Uma in a ceremony designed to impress the natives but to be completely non-binding in the view of Europeans.|$|R
500|$|Considered for Speaker of the House, Breckinridge {{believed}} his election unlikely {{and refused to}} run against fellow Kentuckian Linn Boyd. Boyd was elected, and despite Breckinridge's <b>gesture,</b> assigned <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the lightly-regarded Foreign Affairs Committee. Breckinridge resisted United States Democratic Review editor George Nicholas Sanders' efforts <b>to</b> recruit <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the Young America movement. Like Young Americans, Breckinridge favored westward expansion and free trade, but he disagreed with the movement's support of European revolutions and its disdain for older statesmen. On March 4, 1852, Breckinridge made his first speech in the House, defending presidential aspirant William Butler against charges by Florida's Edward Carrington Cabell, a Young American and distant cousin, that Butler secretly sympathized with the Free Soilers. He denounced Sanders for his vitriolic attacks on Butler and for calling all likely Democratic presidential candidates except Stephen Douglas [...] "old fogies".|$|R
5000|$|The {{election}} of Stephen Harper {{as leader of}} the Alliance resulted in the dissolution of the PC-DRC coalition and in most of the DRC members returning to the Alliance fold. Pankiw also applied for re-admission. However, by this time he was involved in another controversy, after an Aboriginal lawyer alleged that an inebriated Pankiw had made lewd <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in a Saskatoon bar, and challenged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> a fight. [...] For this reason, he was denied re-admission to the Alliance and became an independent MP. He was refused membership in the merged Conservative Party of Canada for the same reason.|$|R
5000|$|... "Human Resources": TDO {{is at work}} {{complaining}} to the Human Resources manager about him constantly being harassed at work. While his co-workers make obscene <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> outside the office, after TDO asks the manager what she's gonna do about it, she replies, [...] "Honestly... I'd say you're asking for it!" [...] and closes the blinds on the two men, and TDO's scream can be heard. The chili dog then flees, screaming (like he always does).|$|R
50|$|The Narrator {{is staying}} with Gilberte {{at her home}} near Combray. They go for walks, on one {{of which he is}} stunned to learn the Méséglise way and the Guermantes way are {{actually}} linked. Gilberte also tells him she was attracted <b>to</b> <b>him</b> when young, and had made a suggestive <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as he watched her. Also, it was Lea she was walking with the evening he had planned to reconcile with her. He considers Saint-Loup's nature and reads an account of the Verdurins' salon, deciding he has no talent for writing.|$|R
5000|$|Kavousifar and his nephew, Hossein Kavousifar, were hanged {{in public}} in August 2007 in a Tehran square.Hossein Kavousifar looked distressed as he awaited his execution, but his uncle <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and smiled {{in an attempt}} to reassure him.Majid Kavousifar showed no remorse to Iranian police {{officers}} in his last words, telling them [...] "I reached the point at which I decided to eradicate any injustice." [...] According to Tehran's public prosecutor, the two were also convicted of armed robbery and other murders.|$|R
50|$|Khayman's {{flesh is}} hard, smooth and white as marble, {{and he is}} no longer {{vulnerable}} to the sun's destroying rays. He no longer experiences the bloodthirst either, but enjoys the refreshment and clarity it provides. He now has the power to kill humans and animals through telekinesis, but will not take blood from any mortal who has made a friendly <b>gesture</b> toward <b>him,</b> preferring <b>to</b> take only anonymous victims. At 7000 years old, Khayman can also kill any vampires weaker than himself by telekinetically igniting their combustible blood.|$|R
6000|$|... [NAPOLEON {{can now be}} seen, {{across the}} valley, pushing forward a [...] new scheme of some sort, urged to it {{obviously}} by the visible [...] nearing of further Prussian corps. The EMPEROR is as critically [...] situated as WELLINGTON, and his army is now formed in a right [...] angle ["en potence"], the main front to the English, the lesser [...] to {{as many of the}} Prussians as have yet arrived. His <b>gestures</b> [...] show <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be giving instructions of desperate import to a [...] general whom he has called up.] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{director}} {{visits a}} deserted beach on a dreary day. The wind sweeps the sand across the beach. He finds an old {{photograph of a}} seaside town cradled on a hillside. In Portofino, Italy, while exploring the quaint passageways above town, the director encounters a beautiful woman (Sophie Marceau) and follows her to a seaside clothing shop where the woman works. In the shop, {{she gives him a}} look of recognition. They do not speak, but seem drawn to each other. As the director leaves, she <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> but he does not respond.|$|R
