40|$|During March–May 2006, an extensive, multi-institution, multi-instrument, and {{multi-platform}} integrated {{field experiment}} ‘Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget’ (ICARB) {{was carried out}} under the Geosphere Biosphere Programme of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO-GBP). The objective of this largest and most exhaustive field campaign, ever conducted in the Indian region, was to characterize the physico-chemical properties and radiative effects of atmospheric aerosols and trace gases over the Indian landmass and the adjoining oceanic regions of the Arabian Sea, northern Indian Ocean, and Bay of Bengal through intensive, simul-taneous observations.

25|$|Ships in Eve Online come in four size classes. Small starships include frigates (small, mobile ships {{good for}} {{disruption}} and harassment) and destroyers (slightly {{larger and more}} offensively oriented than frigates).

Battleships (heavily armed and armoured <b>dedicated</b> combat <b>ships)</b> make up the large size class. Extra-large (or capital-class) starships include carriers (mobile bases that can launch fighters and are adept at repairing other <b>ships),</b> dreadnoughts (<b>dedicated</b> siege <b>ships</b> for attacking structures and other capitals), supercarriers (larger versions of carriers focused more on damage to capital class ships) and titans (supermassive mobile battle stations, capable of equipping doomsday devices which do massive amounts of damage to other capital ships).|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of turbulence instrumentation on underwater gliders is addressed, and two methods for glider-inferred dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy are evaluated against a ship-based vertical microstructure profiler. The well-established ship-based measurements {{are used as}} a reference for the analysis. A Slocum glider was deployed for one week in the Faroe Bank Channel, equipped with a MicroRider with turbulence sensors for velocity shear and temperature microstructure. Dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy are calculated from velocity shear by integrating the wavenumber spectrum after fitting it to the Nasmyth universal spectrum. Survey-averaged profiles from the glider's shear-derived dissipation rates have similar shape as that measured by the vertical microstructure profiler, but overestimate dissipation rates by up to a factor of 3 in the vicinity the turbulent interface, attributed to the glider's slanted path and inability to penetrate sufficiently undisturbed through the swift plume interface. Microstucture temperature profiles are used to calculate dissipation rates, which is done by fitting temperature gradient spectra to the universal Batchelor form using the maximum likelihood estimate. This method allows for automatic rejection criteria, which are applied to remove bad fits. Results compare reasonably well with the vertical microstructure profiler measurements, but are underestimated close to the bottom, which is a caveat of the Batchelor fit, consistent with a previous study. Overall, measurement of dissipation rates from gliders is a powerful addition to traditional shipborne turbulence profilers, as they {{make it possible to}} survey large areas by deploying several gliders. Measurements are reasonably accurate, and require much less <b>dedicated</b> <b>ship</b> time...|$|E
40|$|The SEMAPHORE (Structure des Echanges Mer-Atmosphère, Propriétés des Hétérogénéités Océaniques: Recherche Expérimentale) {{experiment}} {{has been}} conducted from June to November 1993 in the Northeast Atlantic between the Azores and Madeira. It was centered {{on the study of}} the mesoscale ocean circulation and air-sea interactions. The experimental investigation was achieved at the mesoscale using moorings, floats, and ship hydrological survey, and at a smaller scale by one <b>dedicated</b> <b>ship,</b> two instrumented aircraft, and surface drifting buoys, for one and a half month in October-November (IOP: intense observing period). Observations from meteorological operational satellites as well as spaceborne microwave sensors were used in complement. The main studies undertaken concern the mesoscale ocean, the upper ocean, the atmospheric boundary layer, and the sea surface, and first results are presented for the various topics. From data analysis and model simulations, the main characteristics of the ocean circulation were deduced, showing the close relationship between the Azores front meander and the occurrence of Mediterranean water lenses (meddies), and the shift between the Azores current frontal signature at the surface and within the thermocline. Using drifting buoys and ship data in the upper ocean, the gap between the scales of the atmospheric forcing and the oceanic variability was made evident. A 2 °C decrease and a 40 -m deepening of the mixed layer were measured within the IOP, associated with a heating loss of about 100 W m - 2. This evolution was shown to be strongly connected to the occurrence of storms at {{the beginning and the end}} of October. Above the surface, turbulent measurements from ship and aircraft were analyzed across the surface thermal front, showing a 30 % difference in heat fluxes between both sides during a 4 -day period, and the respective contributions of the wind and the surface temperature were evaluated. The classical momentum flux bulk parameterization was found to fail in low wind and unstable conditions. Finally, the sea surface was investigated using airborne and satellite radars and wave buoys. A wave model, operationally used, was found to get better results compared with radar and wave-buoy measurements, when initialized using an improved wind field, obtained by assimilating satellite and buoy wind data in a meteorological model. A detailed analysis of a 2 -day period showed that the swell component, propagating from a far source area, is underestimated in the wave model. A data base has been created, containing all experimental measurements. It will allow us to pursue the interpretation of observations and to test model simulations in the ocean, at the surface and in the atmospheric boundary layer, and to investigate the ocean-atmosphere coupling at the local and mesoscales...|$|E
