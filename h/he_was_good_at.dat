5|$|Watts was {{selected}} to attend Atlanta University Laboratory High School, a school created for exceptional students who were college bound, located at Spelman College's campus. He then enrolled at Morehouse College where during his first year his father died. At that time, {{he and his brother}} worked a paper route, delivering copies of the Atlanta Constitution every morning to support their education. Watts was encouraged to attend medical school by his Morehouse College biology teacher, Samuel Nabrit, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> science subjects, especially biology. Watts received a degree in mathematics in 1938 from Morehouse College. After working at the Washington, D.C., post office to support his education, Watts attended Howard University College of Medicine.|$|E

25|$|He {{made his}} Test debut versus Pakistan at Karachi in 1990/91 {{and in his}} third test took test best figures of 11-152, {{including}} 7-52 in the first innings. The match and the series was dogged by controversy as both teams were accused of ball tampering. He appeared intermittently for the test side, gaining more success in the one day game. From his seemingly uncoordinated action <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> bowling yorker length deliveries in the closing overs.|$|E
25|$|Hyder Ali who overtook the Mysore {{from the}} Wodeyars ruled from Srirangapattana. Though {{he was not}} educated, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> {{military}} tactics. Although he took the empire, he did not call himself the emperor but called him the Prime Minister of the empire. He continued some traditions of the Hindu Wodeyars. Tipu Sultanwho became the ruler after Hyder Ali was also very able at military tactics. He defeated and repelled the British several times. But {{due to lack of}} administrative skills he was defeated by a confideration of British, Maratha and Hyderabad Nijamas. He died on battle field in 1799 CE.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the story, Saya finds Kohta cringing in the hallway as students run about in a panic. They hide in a classroom where Hirano is able to put together a nail gun rifle powered by gas cartridges. Kohta has an unrequited crush on Saya. Kohta provides long-range cover when Takashi rescues Alice Maresato from approaching zombies after Alice's father is killed. At Saya's mansion, Kohta is confronted by some of Takagi's followers who demand that he surrender his weapons, but Kohta refuses saying this is the one thing <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> and that he wants to protect Saya.

500|$|Talpade, who {{previously}} featured {{as the title}} character of Kukunoor's Iqbal (2005), observed the bahuroopiyas in Rajasthan and incorporated their dialect, accent, and their body language for his character. About Kukunoor, he said that, [...] "though one tends to go overboard as an actor most of the times, the way he handles the character as a director, Nagesh makes you {{feel that it is}} very simple for you to delineate the character." [...] Through his character of a bahuroopiya, Talpade was required to perform mimicry. While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> mimicry in college, it was during the filming of Iqbal, Kukunoor noted this talent of his and thus Dor came into Talpade's hands.

500|$|Graham {{became the}} Browns' uncontested leader, {{but he was}} also [...] "just one of the guys", tackle Mike McCormack said in 1999. [...] "He was not aloof, which {{you see a lot of}} times today." [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> {{spinning}} and moving in the pocket, skills he learned playing basketball. In his autobiography, Paul Brown praised Graham's ability to anticipate his receivers' route-running by watching their shoulders. [...] "I remember his tremendous peripheral vision and his great athletic skill, as well as his ability to throw a football far and accurately with just a flick of his arm", Brown said. His short passes were hard and accurate, teammates later said, and his long balls were soft. [...] "I used to catch a lot of them one-handed", Lavelli said. [...] "He had great touch in his hands." [...] He was nicknamed [...] "Automatic Otto" [...] for his consistency and toughness.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} {{some of its}} most negative reviews from the British and Irish press. A review for NME was critical of the album's personal lyrics, and claimed that Manson had emasculated himself by opening up. In a one-star review, The Guardian called the album unconvincing, and criticized it for a lack of experimentation; whilst Entertainment.ie writer Lauren Murphy chastised several songs for sounding too experimental and [...] "completely misplaced", summarizing: [...] "If he'd stuck to what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> – ear-piercing yelps, liberal dashes of real controversy and big, brawny metal songs with tough beats – he may have [...] a 'comeback' on his hands." [...] Conversely, Mayer Nissim from Digital Spy commended the album for its diversity, but was critical of its length and [...] "ill-advised attempts at stadium anthems." [...] He awarded the album three stars out of five and said: [...] "It's far from awful, but not for the first time, you can't help but feel that Manson could do so much better." ...|$|E

500|$|When Hewett {{was named}} {{as one of}} the Five Batsmen of the Year by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1893, the {{publication}} described him as [...] "the finest left-handed batsman in England". He played in an unorthodox but attractive fashion, which prompted W.G. Grace to praise [...] "his dashing and fearless hitting", while remarking that he had an awkward style. In Somerset, Cider and Sixes, David Foot described that he was [...] "possessed of an eagle eye, considerable meat and the ability to make his forcing shots attractive." [...] In Peter Roebuck's From Sammy to Jimmy, he offered a similar portrait of Hewett's batting style, adding that [...] "he saw it as his task to conquer". Hewett's batting received praise in H. S. Altham and E. W. Swanton's A History of Cricket, where he is described as a [...] "singularly determined and venomous" [...] batsman who [...] "hit the ball in unexpected and demoralizing directions." [...] He frequently scored his runs rapidly, as described by the Reverend R.S. Holmes, who wrote of his batting against Nottinghamshire; [...] "the Captain scored at his usual rate – three out of four runs notched, represent his pace. Against Surrey he got 61 out of 81, this time 60 out of the same total. That's the kind of example every captain should set – a run a minute, or thereabouts." [...] In summary of the 1892 season The Cricket Annual notes that [...] "the Somerset player, in fact, had established the reputation of being the most punishing batsman and rapid scorer of the day, and on last season's form no representative eleven could be considered complete without him." [...] Sammy Woods claimed that Hewett disliked fielding, but offered the view that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> point. Woods also related how Hewett would chew on a toothpick, which he always had in his mouth when fielding, when his team was losing.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{and after}} the October Revolution {{overturned}} the Provisional Government and brought the Bolshevik (communist) movement to power in Russia, Gherman Pântea played a game of intricate diplomacy. According to Ion Constantin, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> seizing political opportunities [...] "in those murky, troubled times, subject to fast and radical changes to the map of East-Central Europe". By early October 1917, Pântea was realizing that Kerensky and the Provisional Government could lose the battle. In a bid to discover the other side's intentions regarding Bessarabia, he traveled to Petrograd and met Bolshevik ideologue Vladimir Lenin. As Pântea later stated, Lenin declared himself for revolutionary self-determination in the national issue—some researchers regard this claim as an urban legend, with which Bessarabian intellectuals tried to convince communists that Lenin himself validated their national aspirations. Returning to Bessarabia, Pântea attended meetings of the Bolshevik club, alongside Ion Buzdugan.|$|E
2500|$|Sima Qian’s {{biography}} of Han Fei is as follows: [...] "Han Fei was a prince of Han, {{in favor of}} the study of name/form and law/art which takes its root in the Huang-Lao philosophy. He was born a stutterer and was not able to dispute well, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> writing papers. Together with his friend, Li Si, he served Xun Qing, and Si himself admitted that he was not as competent as Fei. Seeing Han was on the decline, he often remonstrated with the king of Han by submitting papers, but the king did not agree to employ him. At this, Han Fei was frustrated with the reality that, in governing a state, the king did not endeavour to refine and clarify the juridical system of the state, to control his subjects by taking over power, to enhance state property and defence, or to call and employ the wise by enhancing the state.|$|E

6000|$|At last, however, an {{incident}} occurred {{which called for}} different treatment. There was among the Indians a long-legged, wiry fellow who had been named Attick, or Reindeer, {{because he was a}} celebrated runner. Those who disliked him--and they were numerous--said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> running away from his foes. However that might be, he was undoubtedly dexterous in the use of his fingers--and it was through this propensity that we were first introduced to him. It happened thus: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> {{games of}} skill, too. Tom staked him with marbles to play [...] "keeps" [...] with, {{and then took}} all the {{winnings}} away from him. In the winter season Chambers was on hand, in Tom's worn-out clothes, with [...] "holy" [...] red mittens, and [...] "holy" [...] shoes, and pants [...] "holy" [...] at the knees and seat, to drag a sled up the hill for Tom, warmly clad, to ride down on; but he never got a ride himself. He built snowmen and snow fortifications under Tom's directions. He was Tom's patient target when Tom wanted to do some snowballing, but the target couldn't fire back. Chambers carried Tom's skates {{to the river and}} strapped them on him, then trotted around after him on the ice, so as to be on hand when he wanted; but he wasn't ever asked to try the skates himself.|$|E

60|$|This {{was the way}} {{in which}} people lived when Ulysses was young, and wished to be married. The worst thing in the way of life was that the {{greatest}} and most beautiful princesses might be taken prisoners, and carried off as slaves to the towns of the men who had killed their fathers and husbands. Now at that time one lady was far the fairest in the world: namely, Helen, daughter of King Tyndarus. Every young prince heard of her and desired to marry her; so her father invited them all to his palace, and entertained them, and found out what they would give. Among the rest Ulysses went, but his father had a little kingdom, a rough island, with others near it, and Ulysses had not a good chance. He was not tall; though very strong and active, he was a short man with broad shoulders, but his face was handsome, and, like all the princes, he wore long yellow hair, clustering like a hyacinth flower. His manner was rather hesitating, and he seemed to speak very slowly at first, though afterwards his words came freely. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> everything a man can do; he could plough, and build houses, and make ships, and he was the best archer in Greece, except one, and could bend the great bow of a dead king, Eurytus, which no other man could string. But he had no horses, and had no great train of followers; and, in short, neither Helen nor her father thought of choosing Ulysses for her husband out of so many tall, handsome young princes, glittering with gold ornaments. Still, Helen was very kind to Ulysses, and there was great friendship between them, which was fortunate for her in the end.|$|E
60|$|He {{declared}} to himself that, let the newspaper {{say what it}} would, he would not of his own motion throw himself among the lion's teeth which were prepared for him. But in so resolving {{he did not know}} what further external force might be applied to him. When the old tenant had sternly told him that he should go like a man into the witness-box and tell his own story on his oath, that had been hard to bear. But there came worse than that,--a power more difficult to resist. On the following morning Mr Apjohn arrived at Llanfeare, having driven himself over from Carmarthen, and was at once shown into the book-room. The lawyer was a man who, by his friends and by his clients in general, was considered to be a pleasant fellow as well as a cautious man of business. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> a dinner-table, serviceable with a gun, and always happy on horseback. He could catch a fish, and was known to be partial to a rubber at whist. He certainly was not regarded as a hard or cruel man. But Cousin Henry, in looking at him, had always seen a sternness in his eye, some curve of a frown upon his brow, which had been uncomfortable to him. From the beginning of their intercourse he had been afraid of the lawyer. He had felt that he was looked into and scrutinised, and found to be wanting. Mr Apjohn had, of course, been on Isabel's side. All Carmarthenshire knew that he had done his best to induce the old squire to maintain Isabel as his heiress. Cousin Henry was well aware of that. But still why had this attorney always looked at him with accusing eyes? When he had signed that declaration at Carmarthen, the attorney had shown by his face that he believed the declaration to be false. And now this man was there, and there was nothing for him but to endure his questions.|$|E
