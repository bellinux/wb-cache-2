This paper examines dominant discursive framings of forest plantation projects in the climate regime. A central proposition is that these projects represent a microcosm of competing and overlapping discourses that are mirrored in debates of global environmental governance. While the win-win discourse of ecological modernization has legitimized the inclusion of sink projects in the Kyoto Protocol, a green governmentality discourse has provided the scientific rationale necessary to turn tropical tree-plantation projects operational on the emerging carbon market. A critical civic environmentalism discourse has contested forest sink projects depicting them as unjust and <b>environmentally</b> <b>unsound</b> strategies to mitigate climate change.

40|$|While many developing-country policymakers see heavy {{fertilizer}} subsidies {{as critical}} to raising agricultural productivity, most economists {{see them as}} distortionary, regressive, <b>environmentally</b> <b>unsound,</b> and argue that they result in politicized, inefficient distribution of fertilizer supply. We model farmers as facing small fixed costs of purchasing fertilizer, and assume some are stochastically present-biased and not fully sophisticated about this bias. Even when relatively patient, such farmers may procrastinate, postponing fertilizer purchases until later periods, when they may be too impatient to purchase fertilizer. Consistent with the model, many farmers in Western Kenya fail {{to take advantage of}} apparently profitable fertilizer investments, but they do invest in response to small, time-limited discounts on the cost of acquiring fertilizer (free delivery) just after harvest. Later discounts have a smaller impact, and when given a choice of price schedules, many farmers choose schedules that induce advance purchase. Calibration suggests such small, time-limited discounts yield higher welfare than either laissez faire or heavy subsidies by helping present-biased farmers commit to fertilizer use without inducing those with standard preferences to substantially overuse fertilizer. ...|$|R

In this remote region, the intermingling of black and white water systems creates unique aquatic habi-tats that harbor diverse assemblages of fishes, including Prochilodus nigricans, a migratory species of high ecological and socioeconomic importance throughout the Amazon. In the lower Pastaza basin, freshwater fishes provide a major source of food and income for in-digenous communities such as the Kandozi.

Lithuania has a large amount of thermal energy along the Baltic Sea coast which could be used to heat hundreds of thousands of homes, as is done in Iceland. In addition, iron ore deposits have been found in the southern region of Lithuania.

40|$|Global {{dependence}} {{on fossil fuels}} is not only finite, but also <b>environmentally</b> <b>unsound.</b> A move from petroleum-based chemicals to an alternative based on renewable sources such as agricultural lignocellulosic waste materials could provide significant environmental and economic gains. Lignin, a component of such feedstocks represents an abundant source of aromatic compounds if an effective method for controlled conversion to fine chemicals can be discovered. Despite the many potential benefits of chemicals derived from lignin, it still remains an unlocked source of more valuable substances. Lignin is a complex polymer that gives rigidity and protection to plant cell walls. By its very nature it is inherently very hard to break down. Pre-treatments so far have revolved around removing lignin to access the more exploitable sugars from cellulose and hemicellulose. If a biocatalytic approach to valorisation could combine the natural microbial breakdown of lignin with advances in genetics, then potentially this may offer a method to derive useful aromatic by-products. In the present thesis, a combined approach was taken for the valorisation of natural state and industrial sources of lignin. Genetic mutants of lignin-degrading bacteria were prepared by targeting enzymes for deletion based on hypothetical lignin degradation pathways. These mutants were used in incubations with different sources of lignin. A chemical approach using mechanism-based and commercially available enzyme inhibitors is also proposed. These techniques were investigated and various procedures explored and employed, to varying degrees of success, most notably the production of up to 96 mg/L after 144 h of vanillin using a Δvdh mutant of Rhodococcus jostii RHA 1 in incubations with 2. 5...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste {{has become a major}} issue lately in the province of Québec, Canada. Most of it is landfilled today, which increases the burden on landfills and is <b>environmentally</b> <b>unsound.</b> In order to comply with new government guidelines, municipalities have to develop solutions to recover and recycle organic waste. In this context, this study examines two solutions for treating organic waste: home-composting and a separate biodegradable waste collection system combined with large-scale composting. The two scenarios are compared in terms of costs and environmental performance to a reference scenario where all waste is landfilled, using as a case study a fictional city of 50 000 inhabitants. Results indicate that a centralized collection system, combined to large-scale composting, has greater environmental benefits than home-composting. It cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 240 % compared to the reference scenario, while emissions from home-composting remain at the reference level. However, when compared to the reference scenario, home-composting reduces waste management costs by 15 % while they represent an increase of 4 % with large-scale composting. The study concludes that separate biodegradable waste collection combined to large-scale composting is the best way for a municipality to achieve high environmental goals, despite a slight increase of municipal costs. The participation rate of citizens is suggested to be a crucial parameter for the success of organic waste management in the two scenarios and it should be enhanced by different means to ensure the successful implementation of the chosen solution...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{cells have}} been poised {{to enter the}} energy market as a viable {{alternative}} to non-renewable resources for years, but due to prohibitive costs and reliability concerns they remain commercially untenable. One of the primary concerns facing PEMFCs today are the platinum group metals (PGM) catalysts which represent {{a significant portion of the}} total manufacturing cost of these devices. Recovery programs could provide an alternative source for the metals, but current processes are expensive, hazardous, and <b>environmentally</b> <b>unsound.</b> We propose an alternative methodology based on electrochemical assisted dissolution in halide solutions, with a specific focus on platinum and ruthenium recovery in strong iodide solutions. An electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) was used to accurately determine the change in mass of the system during the initial stages of the project. Using an EQCM a controlled deposition of the target metals was achieved. This new electrode was then placed into varying halide solutions at room temperature in order to determine the effective dissolution rate at differing pHs and electrical potentials. Rotating ring disk electrode experiments were also conducted in order to determine if a recovery process from halide solution would be possible. Results suggest native pH solutions are likely unsuitable for Ru dissolution, but acidified solutions are more suitable, as predicted by E-pH diagrams. Surface oxide or halide complex formation complicates recovery process as these moieties must be removed before dissolution can occur. Rotating ring disk experiments show that the dissolution process is possible at ambient conditions, but may progress too slowly for a viable industrial process. Future work will investigate dissolution processes at elevated temperature...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the financing of}} U. S. public airports in a turbulent era of change, and projects toward the future. It begins by briefly outlining historical patterns that have changed the industry, and airport facilities in particular. It then develops basic principles of public finance as applied to public infrastructure, followed by the applicable principles of management. Following that, the current airport financing system is analyzed and contrasted with a socially optimal financing system. A concluding section suggests policy reforms and their likely benefits. The principles of finance and management discussed here are elementary. However, their implications are radical for U. S. airport policy. There {{is a great deal}} of room to improve the allocation of aviation infrastructure resources. The application of these basic principles makes it evident that in many cases, current practice is wasteful, <b>environmentally</b> <b>unsound,</b> overly costly, and inequitable. Future investments in public aviation capital will continue to be wasteful until more efficient pricing systems are instituted. Thus, problem in the U. S. is not one of insufficient investment in airport infrastructure, but investment in the wrong types of infrastructure. In the U. S., the vast majority of publically-owned airports are owned by local governments. Thus, while the federal government bad a great deal of influence in financing airports, ultimately these are local decisions. The same is true with many other public infrastructure issues. Katz and Herman (1997) report that in 1995, U. S. net public capital stock equaled almost $ 4. 6 trillion, 72 % of which ($ 3. 9 trillion) was owned by state and local governments, most of it in buildings, highways, Streets, sewer systems, and water supply facilities. Thus, public infrastructure finance is fundamentally a local government issue, with implications for federal and state governments in the design of their aid programs...|$|R

40|$|In this research, I am {{using an}} {{understanding}} of visual communication that holds that design {{is more than a}} spontaneous creative act &ndash; it can be studied and used as part of a research project that examines the design process itself. This project seeks to re-position design as a mode of questioning, with an emphasis on exploring the nature of communication design practice and how to extend it, rather than creating and reflecting on new design activities. The works explore assumptions about design and provokes a fresh consideration of communication design practice that will have operational significance. To appropriate words used to describe the work of the 2011 Nobel Prize winner for Literature, Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer, I was looking for a design approach that would &lsquo;find a fresh way into reality&rsquo;. As Faust states, &lsquo;When we reframe design through a discourse, designing on a meta level, we are actually designing design, as we are giving design a different meaning, changing frame to include or exclude what we do or don&rsquo;t consider {{as a part of the}} field&rsquo; (Faust 2010, p. 109). This highlights the potential of a design to reframe communication design and to broaden traditional boundaries to trigger a challenge to the conventions of communication design. This moves the conversation about sustainable design away from discussions of materials and message, and onto the underlying ideas of design culture and the frameworks that create received ideas about design norms. The research process helped me reimagine the role of both the designer and design audience. This kind of exploration is an underdeveloped area in sustainable design research. Sustainable design often fails to reference a wider consideration of the conceptual framework of communication design practice. Sustainable design needs to engage with the culture of consumption and its unsustainable demand for resources (Jackson 2009) and the social effects of communication design. The concepts of sustainable communication design practice are largely undeveloped, beyond minimising the environmental impact of communication design within a commercial context &ndash; for example, by using paper from a sustainable source, using soya-based inks, minimising the practice&rsquo;s energy use and avoiding working for clients with <b>environmentally</b> <b>unsound</b> practices. Although these considerations are important, their scope is not broad enough to address or halt the damage being done to the world&rsquo;s ecosystems (United Nations 2011, Jackson 2009). This research attempts to harness the full potential of communication designers to create social change through critical engagement with design practice...|$|R

40|$|After a long {{decline of}} gold {{production}} in Ghana since 1986 the gold mining sector is recovering and mainly foreign investment led to substantial exploration efforts {{as well as}} to the opening up of new mines and/or rehabilitation and expansion of the existing mines after their divestiture (privatization). Foreign junior exploration and mining companies and established international mining houses are currently exploring the country in search of large, therefore commonly low-grade gold deposits which are amenable to highly mechanized open pit mining. Beside such orebodies of the disseminated type or in granites, Ghana is endowed with many occurrences of gold quartz veins and banket reefs, which vary in width from a few centimetres to several metres and have striking length from a few 10 meter to several kilometer. Whilst such larger orebodies with ore reserves of above 1 Mio. tons are a target for industrial mining operations, the smaller "stringer"-occurrences are not of interest, if not only as indicators in prospection for possible adjacent disseminated mineralization. Such restricted orebodies could offer investment and employment opportunities for Ghanaian owned mining groups and companies and should therefore contribute also to economic development of the hinterland. Some of these orebodies as well as the ubiquitous gold bearing alluvials are currently mined by artisanal small scale miners, commonly called "galamsey", which use manual labour only and employ simple handtools in their operations. A visit to such operations will convince any observer that in almost all cases the operations are either inefficient, including the skimming of orebodies, or dangerous, or <b>environmentally</b> <b>unsound</b> or a combination of these. This is due to the long oppression of small scale mining activities first by the Colonial Government from about 1920 ongoing, later by the Ghanaian authorities after Independence. Only in 1986 under the Minerals and Mining Law, PNDC-Law 153 was the small miner legally recognized and a basis laid for his operations. Vast experience in narrow vein mining, which was available among African small scale miners before and around the advent of this century has been lost. To prove this point, mention should be made of the African engineer T. B. F. Sam, who managed and operated singlehandedly the Adja Bippo Mine near Tarkwa before 1900, the only mine of all the mines in operation since 1880 which was profitable and declared dividends (Rosenblum, 1974). Today it can still be assumed that there will be no re-juvenation of skilfull vein mining by African small scale miners as long as it has not been proved to Ghanaian investors that such operations could be viable. The proof can be presented best by a few reference operations applying durable, locally available machinery, simple and sound mining and extraction methods, basic safety standards and bearable working conditions as well as in their effect on the environment controlled operations. Such reference mines could also provide the necessary information in respect of day-to-day running problems, required amounts of investment, minimum working capital, maintenance and repair needs and problems with unskilled labour drawn from the surroundings of such small mines, to mention only a few areas of missing experience...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of urban {{systems and the}} uncertainty of the impact of urbanization and climate change ask for new ways of thinking about planning objectives and solidarity in action. Cities are complex, adaptive systems of networked services and infrastructures. Growing urban populations, the concentration of resources and capital, unclear contingency planning, the often inadequate and <b>environmentally</b> <b>unsound</b> water supply and sewage management, the menacing continual destruction of ecosystems, and out-dated infrastructures and buildings, all present massive challenges to city planning. With the goal of strengthening resilience, there has been a lasting change of perspective in planning. The scope has been broadened from a specialized viewpoint to an interdisciplinary understanding of interactions and processes within the cityscape. Resilience is an anticipatory principle that transcends risk reduction and attempts to mitigate the effects of system failures while increasing capacities. The overall aim is to combine resilience strategies and sustainability by: i) enhancing sustainable urbanization ii) improving ecosystems and nature-based solutions iii) developing climate change adaptation and mitigation iv) strengthening community-based approaches and social resilience Developing a network is an important step to promote resource-sensitive urban design and enable educational and professional shift towards resilience and sustainability. Thus, the International Workshop at UIC Barcelona in cooperation with UN-Habitat’s City Resilience Profiling Programme (CRPP) and TU Darmstadt will offer the possibility to bring innovative ideas on resilience to discussion. The joint research hub, Urban Resilience Institute (URI), in cooperation with UN-Habitat CRRP aims to analyse practices and processes in the design of resilient and sustainable cities. The hub will gather young researchers from the European Joint Doctorate Programme within the Mundus Urbano Consortium, and from the Fellowship Programme on “Urban Infrastructures in Transition: The Case of African Cities,” as well as the research group on Critical Infrastructures at TU Darmstadt. Currently working from academic institutions based in Europe, researchers from Germany, India, Italy, Kenya, Lebanon, Uganda, and Spain, will present their research projects in four sessions covering the topics of: critical infrastructures, resource-sensitive urban design, housing and land management, and post-crisis emergency reconstruction; opening for discussion on conceptional approaches “towards urban resilience” with international researchers, Master- and PhD-students. Sessions: A_Critical Infrastructures: As the dependency on technology increases, there is a growing need to reflect on the role of infrastructures to sustain human activities. Infrastructures are critical for the functioning of society, not only as the physical components in cities, or ‘hardware,’ but also as structures embedded with the intangible essence of human groups and our understanding of them in specific contexts and throughout time. B_Resource-sensitive Urban Design: In face of rapid urbanization and the negative impacts of climate change on natural and built environments, this session calls analysis of practices and processes of resource-sensitive urban design. Urban design can contribute towards an educational and professional shift towards resilience and sustainability by focusing on integrative approaches, such as district-based networks, low-impact approaches, and climate-adaptive planning and building. C_Resilience and Multi-level Governance: This session seeks cross-scalar and multi-level frameworks which help in understanding cities as complex and adaptive systems. Contributions should problematize urbanization processes and include tools and strategies which explain scalar arrangements of nature and power. The role of international and global frameworks will deem necessary in laying the base for transition and transformation of cities, and to {{contribute to the development of}} urban resilience. D_Post-Crisis Emergency Reconstruction and Upgrading: This session aims at understanding refugee camps as a form of urbanization and sets the basis for rethinking camp design and their temporality. Contributions should bridge social structures and their physical transformations, as a means for their integral regeneration. This session looks at examples where resilience in the social fabric of informal settlements and low housing estates can create a sense of belonging and act as a force for their physical upgrading...|$|R
