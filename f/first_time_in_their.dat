5|$|Campbell {{finished}} {{the season as}} Hull's top scorer, with 15 goals in 32 appearances. On 24 May 2008, {{he played in the}} Hull City team that achieved promotion to the top flight for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> 104-year history.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Millwall's form was poor, {{and they were}} relegated into (and became a {{founding}} member of) Division Four. The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history they had competed in the fourth tier of English football, which they remained in for four seasons until 1962. They returned for the 1964–65 season, but were immediately promoted. This {{is the last time}} Millwall played in the fourth tier.|$|E
25|$|Arkansas {{hosted the}} No.25 Kansas Jayhawks at Baum Stadium on March 2. The Razorback offense exploded, with Jarrod McKinney and Monk Kreder both leaving the yard for the <b>first</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> careers. TJ Forrest began {{the game for}} the Hogs, and Geoffrey Davenport earned the win in relief.|$|R

5|$|Fischer {{was second}} in a super-class field, behind only former World Champion Tal, at Bled, 1961. Yet, Fischer {{defeated}} Tal head-to-head for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> individual game, scored 3½/4 against the Soviet contingent, and finished as the only unbeaten player, with 13½/19 (+8−0=11).|$|E

On 5 October, he scored an added-time winner against Slovenia which confirmed England's qualification to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The late 1950s saw a sharp {{downturn}} in Sunderland's fortunes, {{and the club}} was once again implicated in a major financial scandal in 1957. Found guilty of making payments to players {{in excess of the}} maximum wage, they were fined £5,000 (£ today), and their chairman and three directors were suspended. The following year, Sunderland were relegated from the highest division for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> 68-year league history.|$|E
5|$|A {{turning point}} in the club's history came in the late 1970s. Singer, {{shareholder}} and lifelong Watford supporter Elton John became chairman in 1976, and appointed Graham Taylor as manager in 1977. The club achieved consecutive promotions between 1977 and 1979, and reached the First Division for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history in 1982. Furthermore, in 198283 Watford finished second in the First Division, and Luther Blissett was the division's top scorer with 27 goals. Consequently, Watford qualified for the UEFA Cup in 198384. They also reached their first FA Cup final, losing 20 to Everton at Wembley Stadium. Following Taylor's departure in 1987, Watford were relegated in 1988.|$|E
5000|$|Wicklow win the Leinster Championship for the <b>first</b> {{and only}} <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history.|$|R
50|$|The women's {{football}} {{section was}} founded in 1982. The team won the Naisten Liiga for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 2010 <b>in</b> <b>their</b> debut <b>in</b> the championship; they had been promoted after winning the second-tier Naisten Ykkönen in 2009. They thus made their UEFA Champions League debut in the 2011-12 season, where they were knocked out by Rayo Vallecano in the Round of 32.|$|R
50|$|They were {{promoted}} to the Premier League for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 2002. <b>Their</b> <b>first</b> spell <b>in</b> this league lasted four years, but {{in the four years}} from 2006 to 2009 they were relegated twice and promoted twice.|$|R
5|$|Cardiff were relegated for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{history in}} 1929 and entered {{a period of}} decline, {{dropping}} into the third tier two years later. The club did manage {{to return to the}} top tier in 1952, but their relegation in 1962 led to a decline in the club's fortunes that saw them outside the top division for 51 years, the longest absence in the club's history, not returning until 2013. Relegation from Division Two in the 1984–85 season saw the club enter a downward period that culminated with their joint lowest ever finish in the Football League, 22nd in the fourth tier in the 1995–96 season.|$|E
5|$|City {{reached the}} FA Cup final for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history in 1949, losing 3–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. The club, however, was celebrating {{a week later}} when a draw {{on the last day}} of the season ensured {{survival}} in Division Two. Leicester won the Division Two championship in 1954, with the help of Arthur Rowley, one of the club's most prolific strikers. Although they were relegated from Division One the next season, under Dave Halliday they returned in 1957, with Rowley scoring a club record 44 goals in one season. Leicester remained in Division One until 1969, their longest period ever in the top flight.|$|E
5|$|For the {{following}} four seasons Palace achieved respectable top half finishes, and poached the Bury manager Bert Head after persistence from chairman Arthur Wait in early 1966. Head had been with Bury less than a season. The new manager promoted from the youth team and transferred in players new and old, and delighted fans by re-signing Johnny Byrne. His work paid dividends in the 1968–69 season when Palace, not fancied as promotion candidates {{at the beginning of}} the season, finished second behind Derby County who were managed by Brian Clough. Palace had achieved a place in the top flight for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history, clinching promotion with a 16-game unbeaten run to end the season.|$|E

5|$|Fàbregas was {{selected}} {{as a part of}} del Bosque's 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. With del Bosque preferring a starting midfield of Sergio Busquets, Xabi Alonso, Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, Fàbregas did not start in any of Spain's games in the competition. He featured as a substitute in four of their seven matches, in which Spain lost their opening game before winning the next six en route to the final. In the Final itself, Fàbregas set up the extra-time winner for Iniesta to win Spain the World Cup for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history.|$|E
5|$|He {{has been}} a first–team regular since his move, and was the club's Player of the Year for the 2009–10 season, a season in which the Hertfordshire side won {{promotion}} to the Football League for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history. His success as a Stevenage player continued the following season, as he played an integral role in the club's 2010–11 campaign, helping Stevenage earn promotion to League One. He left Stevenage when his contract expired in 2012, and joined Preston North End. Laird has also represented Scotland at youth level, captaining the Scotland U16 team. However, Laird was called up for the England C side in April 2009, starting {{in a game against}} the Belgium U21 team.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Navy {{became the}} first team other than Hopkins to defeat Maryland since 1954. That same year marked the start of Navy's eight-year {{national}} championship streak that lasted through 1967. That season, Navy beat Maryland 10–8, before traveling to Homewood Field. There, Johns Hopkins upset Navy, 9–6, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> last ten meetings. The Blue Jays and Terrapins met for the season finale where Hopkins needed a victory to win the national title outright. Maryland acted as a spoiler, however, and beat Johns Hopkins, 9–5, to take {{a share of the}} championship. Hopkins went on to win or share the next four national titles.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} Wigan Athletic Football Club starts in 1932, when the club were founded. They were elected to The Football League in 1978, {{and reached the}} Premier League for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 2005. <b>Their</b> <b>first</b> major honour was victory in the 2013 FA Cup Final.|$|R

5|$|Lawrie McMenemy {{was brought}} in as manager in 1985, but Sunderland reached the lowest point in their history in 1987, when they {{suffered}} relegation to the Third Division after losing a two-leg play-off to Gillingham. The return of 1973 FA Cup winning manager Bob Stokoe, appointed caretaker manager following the sacking of McMenemy, could not help Sunderland avoid relegation. It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history that they {{had fallen into the}} Third Division. However, under new manager Denis Smith, promotion was gained at the first attempt; Sunderland returned to the Second Division as Third Division champions in 1988.|$|E
5|$|On 31 March 2015, Fàbregas captained Spain for the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> 0–2 {{friendly}} defeat to the Netherlands at the Amsterdam Arena. He {{earned his}} 100th cap on 12 October 2015, becoming the tenth Spaniard to do so, in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Ukraine with Spain already qualified. In his milestone match at the Olympic Stadium in Kiev, {{he won a}} first-half penalty when fouled by Oleksandr Kucher, but his spot kick was saved by Andriy Pyatov.|$|E
