25|$|Drones carry {{only one}} type of allele at each {{chromosomal}} position, because they are haploid (containing only one set of chromosomes from the mother). During the development of eggs within a queen, a diploid cell with 32chromosomes divides to generate haploid cells called gametes with 16chromosomes. The result is a haploid egg, with chromosomes <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> combination of alleles at the various loci. This process is also called arrhenotokous parthenogenesis or simply arrhenotoky.|$|E

25|$|The first {{production}} F-15A {{was accepted}} in September 1946. However, {{the contract was}} abruptly canceled in 1947, possibly because {{the performance of the}} aircraft was rapidly being overshadowed by jets, with the last of only 36 examples being accepted by the United States Army Air Forces in April of that year. The last F-15 to be produced (serial number 45-59335) was produced as an F-15A-5-NO, which differed from the Block-1 version mainly in <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> internal camera installation in the nose. It seems that this change had been contemplated for the last 20 F-15s as well, since some records indicate that these were all eventually re-designated as F-15A-5-NO.|$|E

500|$|Multiple {{critics have}} noted that the {{portrayal}} of Doofenshmirtz and Perry's relationship in the episode features a somewhat of a homosexual subtext. The concept behind it is a parody of stereotypical teen romance film, casting Perry and Doofenshmirtz—two males who are of different species—as the teenage couple who is [...] "breaking up." [...] Perry's initial suspicions over Doofenshmirtz <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> nemesis are portrayed as if a person discovers their significant other is cheating on them. Perry discovers a paw print on Doofenshmirtz's face, resembling a lipstick mark on the cheek {{as if from a}} lover, and Peter the Panda emerges from Doofenshmirtz's closet. Doofenshmirtz initially tries to deny <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> nemesis, but eventually admits to the accusation, noting that he [...] "didn't want [...] to find out this way," [...] overtly detailing a common way couples discover their partner is cheating on them. Perry is depressed about their [...] "break up" [...] and reminisces about their past [...] "relationship" [...] together, while music resembling a love song plays in the background. After feeling depressed himself, Doofenshmirtz [...] "dumps" [...] Peter and reunites with Perry on a talk show prone to featuring romantic confrontations.|$|E

This is analogous to physical properties of the brain giving rise to a mental state. Emergentists try to solve the notorious mind–body gap this way. One problem for emergentism is the idea of [...] "causal closure" [...] in the world that does not allow for a mind-to-body causation.|$|E
