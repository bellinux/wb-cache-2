25|$|A {{fiber bundle}} is a {{structure}} (E, B, π, F), where E, B, and F are topological spaces and π : E → B is a continuous surjection satisfying a local triviality condition outlined below.

25|$|It now is {{explored}} just in {{what way}} the polarization density P(r) that enters Maxwell's equations {{is related to the}} dipole moment p of an overall neutral array of charges, and also to the dipole moment density p(r) (which describes not only the dipole moment, but also the array location). Only static situations are considered <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>follows,</b> so P(r) has no time dependence, and there is no displacement current. First is some discussion of the polarization density P(r). That discussion is followed with several particular examples.|$|E
25|$|Suppose {{the edges}} of a {{complete}} graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue. Pick a vertex, v. There are 5 edges incident to v and so (by the pigeonhole principle) at least 3 of them must be the same colour. Without loss of generality we can assume at least 3 of these edges, connecting the vertex, v, to vertices, r, s and t, are blue. (If not, exchange red and blue <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>follows.)</b> If any of the edges, (r, s), (r, t), (s, t), are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle. If not, then those three edges are all red {{and we have an}} entirely red triangle. Since this argument works for any colouring, any K6 contains a monochromatic K3, and therefore R(3, 3) ≤ 6. The popular version of this is called the theorem on friends and strangers.|$|E
