Partnerships failing the two <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> tests above will still be deemed to have <b>economic</b> <b>effect,</b> provided that as {{of the end of}} each partnership taxable year a liquidation of the partnership {{at the end of the}} year or at the end of any future year would produce the same economic result to the partners as would occur had the test above been satisfied.

[...] There are now three methods, or [...] "tests," [...] for determining whether an allocation has <b>economic</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|R

40|$|Process of {{regional}} economic integration in Europe has in the last decades been determined by expansions in various dimensions – substantially as well as geographically. Market integration is thereby presented as an instrument to enhance prosperity. The article analyses <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> of the EU internal market, i. e. whether and to what extend has the internal market enhanced economic prosperity and income in Europe in the last half-century. From methodological point of view {{we are dealing with}} a very complex question, which has been approached in various ways by various economic studies. The article is based on a study performed by a Dutch bureau CPB, which was assessing additional <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> of the EU internal market – i. e. in addition to alternative forms of market integration, existing also in economic relations with third countries. The authoress concludes that the EU internal market has achieved the highest <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> in the field of foreign direct investments; <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> of free movement of goods is comparable to foreign direct investments, whereas the <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> of free movement of services is being more moderate, however, having considerable potential for increase. <b>Economic</b> <b>effect</b> of free movement of workers is not analysed in the article considering low level of migration flows between the EU member states...|$|R

40|$|Biotechnology {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a key technology with high potential for far-reaching social, environmental and economic impacts. Among others, the development and diffusion of biotechnology may have considerable <b>economic</b> <b>effects</b> on production and employment. This paper analyses the economic impacts of different prospective diffusion paths of biotechnology in some major application fields for Germany. Bottom-up technology information from the literature, expert judgements and explicit scenario assumptions for various impact factors are combined and integrated in an input–output framework to calculate direct and indirect production and employment effects. The impact on net production and employment differs greatly between the different application sectors and depends on the respective importance of the various impact mechanisms. The indirect <b>economic</b> <b>effects</b> are rather high and exceed the direct <b>economic</b> <b>effects.</b> These findings show {{the importance of a}} bottom-up approach as well as the consideration of the indirect <b>economic</b> <b>effects</b> for appropriate analyses of the impact of biotechnology...|$|R
40|$|Concentrating on {{consuming}} coefficient, partition coefficient, and Leontief inverse matrix, relevant {{concepts and}} algorithms are developed for estimating {{the impact of}} meteorological services including the associated (indirect, complete) <b>economic</b> <b>effect.</b> Subsequently, quantitative estimations are particularly obtained for the meteorological services in Jiangxi province by utilizing the input-output method. It is found that the <b>economic</b> <b>effects</b> are noticeably rescued by the preventive strategies developed from both the meteorological information and internal relevance (interdependency) in the industrial economic system. Another finding is that the ratio range of input in the complete <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> on meteorological services is about 1 [*]:[*] 108. 27 – 1 [*]:[*] 183. 06, remarkably different from a previous estimation based on the Delphi method (1 [*]:[*] 30 – 1 [*]:[*] 51). Particularly, <b>economic</b> <b>effects</b> of meteorological services are higher for nontraditional users of manufacturing, wholesale and retail trades, services sector, tourism and culture, and art and lower for traditional users of agriculture, forestry, livestock, fishery, and construction industries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of standards and standard-setting processes. It describes the <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> of technology standards – de facto as well as de jure – and differentiates between the impact on competition and welfare that various levels of standards have. It argues that most of what is claimed for “open standards ” in recent policy debates was already well encompassed by the term “standards”; a different term is needed only if it is defined clearly in order to provide a distinct <b>economic</b> <b>effect.</b> This paper argues that open standards, properly defined, can have the particular <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> of allowing “natural ” monopolies to form in a given technology, while ensuring full competition among suppliers of that technology. This is a distinct <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> that deserves to be distinguished by the use of a separate term, hence “open ” rather than “ordinary ” standards – referred to as “semi-open ” in this paper. The paper explains why open standards must allow all possible competitors to operate on a basis of equal access to the ability to implement the standard, and why this means that the <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> of open standards may require different conditions for different markets.
