25|$|While in New York, Stevens {{composed}} {{and recorded}} {{the music for}} his second album, <b>Enjoy</b> <b>Your</b> Rabbit, a song cycle based around the animals of the Chinese zodiac that delved into electronica.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, 2009 Stevens' label {{released}} {{an album of}} versions of his 2001 album <b>Enjoy</b> <b>Your</b> Rabbit rearranged for strings and performed by the Osso String Quartet, entitled Run Rabbit Run.|$|E
25|$|Stevens has {{released}} albums of varying styles, from the electronica of <b>Enjoy</b> <b>Your</b> Rabbit and the lo-fi folk of Seven Swans to the symphonic instrumentation of Illinois and Christmas-themed Songs for Christmas. Stevens {{makes use of}} a variety of instruments, often playing many of them himself on the same recording, and writes music in various time signatures. Though his songs are imbued with his Christian faith, he has repeatedly stated an intent to separate his beliefs from his music.|$|E

500|$|The Age of Adz {{marked a}} radical {{departure}} in musical style from that of Stevens' previous album Illinois. Robin Hilton summarised the changes as Stevens [...] " [...] delicately plucked banjo lines, wispy vocals and sentimental melodies with glitchy soundscapes, hip-hop [...] beats and heavily filtered vocals." [...] Amongst his other work, the 2001 electronic album <b>Enjoy</b> <b>Your</b> Rabbit was regarded as being the most close in style to this album. Nevertheless, critics highlighted the first track [...] "Futile Devices" [...] as being stylistically consistent with his earlier acoustic work.|$|E
500|$|After {{approximately}} {{less than}} a minute, Sideshow Bob suddenly cuts off Jeremy's signal and takes control of the screen, telling the riders that he has taken over every area of Krustyland {{and that there is}} no place for the riders to be safe from him. He then announces [...] "And now, <b>enjoy</b> <b>your</b> ride, that's about to be DEMOLISHED! WHILE YOU'RE RIDING IT!!! MWA HA HA HA HAAAA!!!!!" [...] as he flips a switch from [...] "thrilling" [...] to [...] "killing", which activates the vehicles and makes them rise out of the room, starting the ride with the Simpsons in front of them. The roller coaster begins going down various drops before Homer gets hit by a wrecking ball controlled by Sideshow Bob before it smashes into the track and breaks it. Homer and the riders fly into {{a different part of the}} roller coaster track before the [...] "steel" [...] wrecking ball breaks free from its cable and starts chasing them.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Zap2it, Andrea Reiher {{considered}} {{it to be}} [...] "another excellent episode" [...] {{and gave it a}} ranking of three out of four. She expressed appreciation for the [...] "charismatic and captivating" [...] Robert Carlyle, but wished that she could see Schram and other guest stars every week instead of infrequently. [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Shaunna Murphy was confused as to why Ashley and Sean received a happy ending, wondering that because of the accepted mythology of the curse, [...] "aren't people supposed to have happy endings in Fairy Tale, and miserable lives over in Storybrooke?" [...] The episode also made Murphy appreciate the [...] "bold and bright" [...] Snow White, when compared to Cinderella's naive agreement with Rumpelstiltskin. TV Fanatic writer Christine Orlando was not shocked by the affair, but was surprised that [...] "Emma fell into Mr. Gold's clutches so easily." [...] Orlando added that she enjoyed the few appearances of Regina, opining that [...] "who else could tell you to <b>enjoy</b> <b>your</b> cocoa and make it sound menacing?" ...|$|E

500|$|David Williams {{from the}} DVD Movie Guide gave Volume One of the Family Guy a {{positive}} review, {{saying that the}} first season did well in introducing the characters of the series; he ended his review as [...] "If you’re a fan of shows like The Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, or Married... with Children and <b>enjoy</b> <b>your</b> humor topical, dry, and with tongue firmly planted in cheek, then Family Guy is right up your alley". Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk said {{at the end of}} his review, [...] "Often brilliant, extremely witty and darkly hilarious, Family Guy was unfortunately cancelled after Fox bumped it around six or seven different time slots. Fans of the show should definitely pick up this terrific sets , while those who haven't seen it should consider giving it a look. Highly recommended". Josh Wolk of Entertainment Weekly gave volume one a B, saying that [...] "Family Guy Volume One: Seasons 1 & 2 rips through edgy gags, TV references, and fantasy sequences (some of which are hilariously inspired), but Fox's other buffoonish family has none of The Simpsons heart. As Homer and family have shown, a cartoon doesn't always have to be this cartoonish".|$|E

2500|$|Partly in {{response}} to the campaign three different Christian groups have launched advertising campaigns.

Don't worry and <b>enjoy</b> <b>your</b> life." [...] The Christian Party's adverts were the most-complained about of 2009, with the ASA receiving 1,204 complaints regarding them.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was created}} by comedy writer Ariane Sherine and {{launched}} on 21 October 2008, with official support from the British Humanist Association and Richard Dawkins. The campaign's original goal was to raise £5,500 to run 30 buses across London for four weeks early in 2009 with the slogan: [...] "There's probably no god. Now stop worrying and <b>enjoy</b> <b>your</b> life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Freud and Jung both {{used the}} father complex {{as a tool}} to {{illuminate}} their own personal relations. For example, as their early intimacy deepened, Jung had written to Freud asking him to [...] "let me <b>enjoy</b> <b>your</b> friendship not as that of equals but as that of father and son". In retrospect, however, both Jungians and Freudians would note how Jung was impelled to question Freud's theories in a way that pointed to the existence of a negative father complex beneath the positive one — beneath his chosen and overt stance of the favorite son.|$|E
2500|$|Gilby Clarke's {{contract}} was not renewed {{and he was}} gone from the band by 1995. Slash stated in his book that Rose fired Clarke without consulting anyone, claiming he was only a [...] "hired hand". Clarke was not involved in the recording of 'Sympathy for the Devil', stating [...] "I knew that that was the ending [...] because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me". Clarke also mentioned that before the final show of the Use Your Illusion Tour, Rose came up to him and told him [...] "Hey, <b>enjoy</b> <b>your</b> last show". Clarke later sued the band over the use of his likeness in Guns N' Roses Pinball.|$|E

2500|$|Having been {{a person}} of {{considerable}} stature during his life Gromyko held an unusual combination of personal characteristics. Some were impressed by his diplomatic skills, while others called Gromyko mundane and boring. An article written in 1981 in The Times said, [...] "He {{is one of the}} most active and efficient members of the Soviet leadership. A man with an excellent memory, a keen intellect and extraordinary endurance [...] Maybe Andrey is the most informed Minister for Foreign affairs in the world". Gromyko's dour demeanour was shown clearly during his first term in Washington and echoed throughout his tenure as Soviet foreign minister. There is a story that Gromyko was leaving a Washington hotel one morning and was asked by a reporter; [...] "Minister Gromyko, did you <b>enjoy</b> <b>your</b> breakfast today?" [...] His response was [...] "Perhaps." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{then head}} to the nearby village to look for Alverez' family. The gate to town is locked, but in return for freeing his soul, Horace opens it. They then {{encounter}} a broken bridge, but, impressed with Torque's efforts to kill him, Hermes helps them cross. As they near the village, however, they are separated by a fire, and Alverez goes on alone, telling Torque {{to get to the}} docks. As he arrives, he encounters Killjoy, who tells him to cure himself he must face what awaits him, and only by using the Rebirth Machine can he defeat it. Torque heads to the docks where he encounters a massive creature with a miniature version of himself protruding from its stomach. Torque fights and defeats the creature, finally remembering what happened to his family; they were murdered by two hitmen, one of whom told Torque [...] "the Colonel sends his regards. Back in Eastern, he warned you, but you didn't listen. He said to leave you alive. Only you. <b>Enjoy</b> <b>your</b> new life." [...] Torque heads to the docks and is picked up by the coastguard. On the boat, the captain recognizes him, and reveals that his case has been reopened after the prosecutor was indicted, and Torque will likely have a retrial. The game ends with the boat sailing away from Carnate.|$|E
