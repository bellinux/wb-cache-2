5|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the problem of the}} {{excessive}} growth of phumdis that affects the lake ecosystem and local community, a study sponsored by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets, which could be used to meet both energy demands within the region. Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was <b>densified</b> to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHot {{isostatic}} compression {{involves the}} simultaneous {{application of pressure}} and elevated temperature to materials. The pressure applied, usually by a gas, is isostatic because it's developed in a suitable pressurized vessel by a fluid. Therefore in prin ciple no alteration in component geometry occurs. Under these conditions of heat and pressure, internal pores or defects within a solid body or a powder compact collapse and weld up. Encapsulated powder and sintered components <b>densify</b> easily and faster than due to sintering alone. Therefore HIP is today used {{for a lot of}} applications, like upgrading castings (removing shrinkage pores in interdendritic space), <b>densifying</b> pre-sintered components, consolidation of powders and interfacial bonding.

25|$|When {{solid biomass}} {{is already in}} a {{suitable}} form (such as firewood), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from , which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce wood pellets, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with {{a broad range of}} input feedstocks. The resulting <b>densified</b> fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.|$|E

2500|$|Aluminium oxide can {{be grown}} as a coating on {{aluminium}} by anodizing or by plasma electrolytic oxidation (see the [...] "Properties" [...] above). Both the hardness and abrasion-resistant characteristics of the coating originate from the high strength of aluminium oxide, yet the porous coating layer produced with conventional direct current anodizing procedures is within a 60-70 Rockwell hardness C range [...] which is comparable only to hardened carbon steel alloys, but considerably inferior to the hardness of natural and synthetic corundum. Instead, with plasma electrolytic oxidation, the coating is porous only on the surface oxide layer while the lower oxide layers are much more compact than with standard DC anodizing procedures and present a higher crystallinity due to the oxide layers being remelted and <b>densified</b> to obtain α-Al2O3 clusters with much higher coating hardness values circa 2000 Vickers hardness.|$|E

Mechanisms 4-6 are <b>densifying</b> mechanisms - atoms are moved from the bulk to the surface of pores thereby eliminating porosity and increasing the density of the sample.|$|R
