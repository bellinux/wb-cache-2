40|$|Niche {{separation}} {{is likely to}} {{play a key role}} in the formation of mixed-species groups. Saddle-backed tamarins (Saguinusfuscicollis) were studied at three sites with different primate communities in northern Bolivia: (1) with red-bellied <b>tamarins,</b> <b>S.</b> labiatus; (2) with emperor <b>tamarins,</b> <b>S.</b> imperator; and (3) without a congeneric species. The degree of association is higher between S. labiatus and S. fuscicollis than between S. imperator and S. fuscicollis and is related to differences in forest utilization between associating pairs. Niche {{separation is}} found to be greater between S. labiatus and S. fuscicollis than between S. fuscicollis and S. imperator. The mean height and habitat utilization of S. fuscicollis does not differ greatly across the three sites, nor does the height of tamarins in and out of association. It is concluded that combined with differences in body size and dietary overlap, vertical segregation plays an important role in tamarin polyspecific associations (increasing the potential of both foraging and anti-predatory benefits) and that this is not a consequence of vertical displacement of S. fuscicollis by its dominant congeners...|$|R
40|$|<b>S.</b> mystax Summary. <b>Tamarins</b> of {{the genus}} Saguinus feed {{on a wide range}} of {{arthropods}} and small vertebrates, which compose a critical component of their diet. This paper examines the foraging patterns and capture success of the Avila-Pires saddle-back (S. fuscicollis avilapiresi) and the red-capped moustached <b>tamarin</b> (<b>S.</b> mystax pileatus) in very stable mixed-species groups, and whether and how any foraging benefits for either species resulted from their association. Moustached tamarins actively searched for prey items which were mainly well exposed on the midstorey foliage. Saddle-back tamarins, on the other hand, foraged at lower heights, largely by manipu-lating a variety of microhabitats potentially concealing embedded prey. The foraging activity of the numerically dominant and larger-bodied moustached tamarins often resulted in prey items escaping to lower substrates, usual-ly the forest leaf-litter. The "beating effect " of this species substantially facilitated captures of large, mobile prey items by saddle-backs, which were highly adept at locat-ing and retrieving flushed prey. It is estimated that, while saddle-backs obtained 66 - 73 % of their prey biomass from flushed items, this proportion was substantially lower (2 - 9 %) for moustached tamarins. Commensal in-sectivory appears to involve a highly asymmetric benefit to saddle-backs, and a low cost to moustached tamarins, which partly explains the stability of mixed-species groups...|$|R
50|$|There are {{seventeen}} {{species in}} this genus, but {{there seems to}} be some debate over the placing of S. tripartitus. In field observations in South America, scientists compared feeding habits and heights between golden-mantled <b>tamarins</b> (<b>S.</b> tripartitus) and brown-mantled tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis) and they concluded that patterns of height were very similar to those observed in S. fuscicollis. The similarity and the lack of evidence for sympatry with either S. fuscicollis or the black-mantled tamarin (Saguinus nigricollis) lead to the suggestion that S. tripartitus should be reconsidered as a subspecies of S. fuscicollis rather than a species on its own; alternatively, other subspecies of S. fuscicollis should be raised in taxonomic rank.|$|R
40|$|We examine {{vigilance}} {{within a}} mixed-species troop of saddleback (Saguinus fuscicollis) and moustached (<b>S.</b> mystax) <b>tamarins</b> over a complete year. Saddleback tamarins were consistently more vigilant than moustached tamarins. This {{may be linked}} to their preference for lower strata. In accordance with previous studies of other primates, vigilant tamarins of both species were significantly further away from their nearest neighbours, and were also at lower heights in the forest than non-vigilant individuals. There was no observed sex difference in {{the amount of time spent}} vigilant. In terms of modes of scanning, the saddleback tamarins looked up significantly more frequently than the moustached tamarins, whereas there was no difference between the species in the frequency of side sweeps. There were no differences between the sexes in the frequencies of either type of vigilant behaviour. The proportion of time spent vigilant was higher than average immediately prior to entering a sleeping site for saddleback tamarins, but not for moustached tamarins. Both species were more vigilant immediately after exiting a sleeping site than at other times of the day. There was significant variation in the amount of time devoted to vigilance over the course of the year. These findings are discussed with respect to the social structure, ecology and main predator threats facing these species...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} factors that may affect {{patterns}} of gum feeding by primates. These are then examined for mixed-species troops of saddleback (S. fuscicollis) and mustached (<b>S.</b> mystax) <b>tamarins.</b> An important distinction is made between gums produced by tree trunks and branches {{as a result of}} damage and those produced by seed pods as part of a dispersal strategy as these may be expected to differ in their biochemistry. Feeding on fruit and Parkia seed pod exudates was more prevalent in the morning whereas other exudates were eaten in the afternoon. This itinerary may represent a deliberate strategy to retain trunk gums in the gut overnight, thus maximising the potential for microbial fermentation of their β-linked oligosaccharides. Both types of exudates were eaten more in the dry than the wet season. Consumption was linked to seasonal changes in resource availability and not the tamarins’ reproductive status pro-viding no support for the suggestion that gums are eaten as a pri-mary calcium source in the later stages of gestation and lactation. The role of availability in determining patterns of consumption is further supported by the finding that dietary overlap for the trunk gums eaten was greater between species within mixed-species troops within years than it was within species between years. These data and those for pygmy marmosets (Cebuella pygmaea) suggest that patterns of primate gummivory may reflect the interaction of prefer-ence and availability for both those able to stimulate gum production and those not...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Disseminated encephalitozoonosis was {{diagnosed}} in 2 sibling, juvenile, cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) and 3 sibling, neonatal, emperor <b>tamarins</b> (<b>S.</b> imperator) {{by use of}} histologic examination, histochemical analysis, electron microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis with nucleotide sequencing. All tamarins were captive born at zoos in North America and died with no premonitory signs of disease. The main pathologic findings were myocarditis (4 / 5), hepatitis (3 / 5), interstitial pneumonia (3 / 5), skeletal myositis (3 / 5), meningoencephalitis (2 / 5), adrenalitis (2 / 5), tubulointerstitial nephritis (1 / 5), myelitis (1 / 5), sympathetic ganglioneuritis (1 / 5), and retinitis (1 / 5). Central nervous system lesions were the most prominent findings in cotton-top tamarins. The inflammation was predominantly lymphocytic and suppurative in cotton-top tamarins, whereas emperor tamarins had granulomatous or lymphoplasmacytic lesions. Intralesional periodic acid–Schiff-, gram-, or acid–fast (or all 3) -positive, oval-to-elliptical shaped organisms were found in 1 cotton-top and the 3 emperor tamarins. By electron microscopy, these organisms were consistent with microsporidia of the genus Encephalitozoon. E. cuniculi genotype III was detected by PCR analysis and sequencing in paraffin-embedded brain, lung, and bone marrow specimens from the cotton-top tamarins.

50|$|Tamarin {{species were}} {{once thought to}} be a monogamous species, but {{observations}} of emperor tamarins in the wild show that they have a polyandrous mating system, with one dominant female mating with multiple males. This mating system works to ensure paternal investment in offspring. If a female mates with multiple males and give birth to a litter, males are more likely to invest because of the possibility that one of the infants will carry their genes onto the next generation. Due to high rates of twinning or multiple births in Emperor tamarins, parental care and paternal investment is important to infant survival. Previously the only knowledge of tamarin infant care came from captive studies on Cotton-top <b>tamarins</b> (<b>S.</b> oedipus), which demonstrated that infant survival is dependent on helpers. Helpers are either older female offspring of the dominant female that have remained in their natal group or the males that most frequently interact with the dominant female. Infant carrying has a high energetic cost due to the relatively large fetal weight of infants to the weight of adults. Helpers provide the extra support to remove some of the cost of caring for multiple infants. Male emperor tamarins have been observed to spend the most time with infants, often carrying both infants while the dominant female forages. Male emperor tamarins are reported to be more observant of the infants and more protective. For example, they are known to react faster to infant distress calls than females. Infant mortality in the wild is at its highest during weeks 5-15 of their lives, when they begin to move around and explore on their own, this is because one of the greatest threats to infant survival is falling from the canopy.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{predator}} avoidance behaviour of associated saddle-back (Saguinus fuscicollis) and moustached <b>tamarins</b> (<b>S.</b> mystax). It was investigated, whether the tamarins utter different alarm calls for different predator types and if the calls are 'functionally referential' or graded signals. Analyses of inter-specific communication and species-specific patterns of vigilance and predator detection were conducted to clarify if an advantage of the polyspecific associations consists in an improved success of predator avoidance. Vocal recordings and behavioral observations of S. fuscicollis and S. mystax were carried out in naturally occurring encounters with predators and presentations of predator models. Playback experiments were conducted to test if the predator-specific reactions could be elicited by the alarm calls alone. Also focal animal samples were taken to determine scanning rates for the measurement of vigilance. Predator models were presented to test for species-specific differences in predator detection. S. fuscicollis and S. mystax showed different vocal and non-vocal reactions to aerial, terrestrial and snake predators. The call types towards the three predator categories differed both intra- and inter-specifically in duration, height and modulation of the peak frequency, and the trend line of the call. The predator-specific reactions could be elicited by playback of the alarm calls alone. The tamarins reacted in the same way as if the predator itself was present. By that it was confirmed that S. fuscicollis and S. mystax posses 'functionally referential' alarm call systems. The aerial and terrestrial alarm calls were inter-specifically recognized by both species and responded to with the predator-specific reactions. S. fuscicollis, who use mostly the lower strata, looked more often upwards, and S. mystax, who use mostly the higher strata, looked more often downwards. The scanning rates upwards of S. mystax decreased with increasing height. No indication could be found for a better detection of terrestrial predators by S. fuscicollis. Both species decreased levels of individual vigilance with closer proximity of conspecifics, but not of heterospecific group members. The scanning rates upwards of S. fuscicollis were dependent on the distance to the next S. mystax individual. Thus the individual vigilance was diminished neither by a shared vigilance according to the differences in height use nor by the proximity of the associated species. It seems that the vigilance patterns are formed more strongly by visibility in different heights, proximity of conspecifics and inter-specific competition. In sum the results indicate that under high predation pressure by different predator types specific acoustic warning systems can increase the survival probability. The limited visibility in dense forest habitats increases the selective pressure on the acoustic channel and at the same time the relevance of the alarm vocalization in contrast to the visual vigilance. The inter-specific acoustic communication therefore plays a crucial role in improving the success of predator avoidance in the associations of S. fuscicollis and S. mystax...|$|R
