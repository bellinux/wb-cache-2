50|$|Wyse Technology {{was founded}} in 1981 by Garwing Wu, Bernard Tse, and Grace Tse. The company became famous in the 1980s as a {{manufacturer}} of character terminals. Most of these terminals can emulate several other terminal types {{in addition to their}} native escape sequences. These terminals were often used with library card catalogs such as Dynix. In 1983, Wyse began shipping the WY50, a terminal that was priced some 44 percent lower than its nearest competitor. It became their first big-selling product, and had a larger screen and higher resolution than competitor products at the time. Following the WY50 was the WY60, the best-selling <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>terminal</b> of all time. In addition to standard character-mode operation, the WY60 supported box graphics {{that could be used to}} produce more attractive displays. The Wyse 99GT and 160 terminals added graphical capability through Tektronix 4014 emulation. The WY325 and 375 models added color support with Tektronix graphics.|$|E
40|$|CAPP Terminal Device, Size # 2 for teenaged {{and adult}} amputees offers an {{alternative}} to hooks and hands available today. CAPP T D 2 {{is intended to be}} pleasing in appearance; it blends with the forearm in shape, colour and material to give a continuous flowing natural look. It was designed to provide secure grip through the combined action of a closing spring, a full frictional, resilient cover and a n automatic lock. The lock operates as part of the voluntary opening control system and requires no conscious action by the amputee. CAPP T D 2 is a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>terminal</b> device which especially serves unilateral amputees by performing functions usually carried out by the non-dominant hand. CAPP TD 2 comes with a built-in wrist connector which is available in two models; both offer quick disconnect. One wrist unit has adjustable friction and the other attaches to an existing friction wrist unit so CAPP T D 2 can be applied to an existing prosthesis. Ten patients have completed the evaluation programme with promising results. Prototypes of CAPP T D 2 are available for patients interested in evaluating it...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} we describe a scheme for distributed 3 D interactive rendering system, which allows high performance rendering at a remote location and the interactive visualization {{of the resulting}} rendered images at a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> workstation <b>terminal</b> connected through highspeed network. The key to this approach is a video compression scheme of this system which has been designed for the transmission of interactive 3 D rendered video stream (i 3 D-RVS). Most video compression techniques heavily rely on the prediction of block motion. This paper particularly presents a fast numerical technique for motion vector prediction for such block coding compression of rendered animation video. This scheme {{takes advantage of the}} model movement information for block motion prediction. Unlike regular video, such information can be extracted in 3 D visualization both for the case of animated models and for the interactive model navigation. We demonstrate the application of this new technique {{in the context of a}} distributed radiation treatment planning system...|$|R
40|$|Based on Space Station and {{planetary}} spacecraft communication time delays and bandwidth limitations, {{it will be}} necessary to develop an intelligent, <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> ground monitor <b>terminal</b> capable of sophisticated data display and control of on-orbit facilities and remote spacecraft. The basic elements that make up a Monitor and Simulation Terminal (MASTER) include computer overlay video, data compression, forward simulation, mission resource optimization and high level robotic control. Hardware and software elements of a MASTER are being assembled for testbed use. Applications of Neural Networks (NNs) to some key functions of a MASTER are also discussed. These functions are overlay graphics adjustment, object correlation and kinematic-dynamic characterization of the manipulator...|$|R
40|$|Genetic Programming (GP) has {{a proven}} {{capability}} to routinely evolve software {{that provides a}} solution function for the specified problem. Prior {{work in this area}} has been based upon the use of relatively small sets of pre-defined operators and terminals germane to the problem domain. This paper reports on GP experiments involving a large set of <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> operators and <b>terminals.</b> Specifically, a microprocessor architecture with 660 instructions and 255 bytes of memory provides the operators and terminals for a GP environment. Using this environment, GP is applied to the beginning programmer problem of generating a desired string output, e. g., "Hello World". Results are presented on: the feasibility of using this large operator set and architectural representation; and, the computations required to breed string outputting programs vs. the size of the string and the GP parameters employed...|$|R
50|$|In 1984, Wyse {{entered the}} {{personal}} computer marketplace. The first of these was the Wyse 1000, a computer based on the Intel 80186 (which did not see huge volumes because its integrated hardware was incompatible with the hardware used in the original IBM PC). Next came the WYSEpc, an IBM-compatible computer based on the 8088 processor, which had a good following due to its slim-line design. Later, Wyse introduced personal computers compatible with the IBM PC/AT based on the 80286 and 80386, which were top sellers. Wyse sold through 2-tier distribution, which limited growth in the late 1980s as mail order companies like Dell and Gateway entered the marketplace. In 1984 Wyse {{became one of the}} leaders in the <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> text (GPT) <b>terminal</b> industry and on August 17, 1984 went public on the New York Stock Exchange. In the following years, Wyse added the PC product line Wyse pc3216. The Wyse 3216 was based on Intel’s newest 386 chip. It sold for $1,500 less than a comparable Compaq DeskPro, $2,000 less than an IBM System 80, and performed at a higher speed than both. In 1989, Wyse developed LAN-attached communication devices.|$|R

To motivate any further discussion, let us answer some questions that may arise in one's mind. Why should we talk of a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> transport protocol ? Obviously because a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> protocol would provide high degree of flexibility, orthogonality and user-configurability to cater to the various complex user applications today.
