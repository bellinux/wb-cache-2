[...] Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times expressed that [...] "X-Men Origins: Wolverine will most likely manage to cash in on the popularity of the earlier episodes, but it is the latest evidence that the superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue." [...] On a more negative note, Philip French of The Observer said that the film's [...] "dull, bone-crushing, special-effects stuff" [...] is [...] "of interest only to hardcore fans who've probably read <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> Marvel comics." ...|$|E

In May 1985, USA for Africa officials estimated that they had sold between $45million and $47million worth of official merchandise around the world.
