40|$|Remote <b>delivery</b> <b>tubes</b> (RDTs) in Collins {{and similar}} types of helium liquefiers {{interconnect}} the liquefier with the storage dewar. In these liquefiers the Joule-Thompson (J-T) valve is separately {{situated in the}} liquefier cryostat. Therefore there is a regime of J-T heating during the initial cool down of the liquefier, since {{there is a time}} lag in reaching the inversion temperature for the J-T valve. The note describes the design, fabrication, and testing of a RDT with an integral J-T valve. A demountable copper cold seal working at a pressure of 15 bar was successfully tested. The J-T valve seat made of Cu-Cr-Zr alloy provided excellent sealing with the stainless-steel valve tip at liquid-helium temperatures. The testing of this RDT with integral J-T showed substantial reduction in cool down time for the liquefier as well as better control of the dewar pressures. ...|$|R

50|$|Perhaps the easiest, most {{trouble-free}} {{method of}} refilling ink cartridges {{is through the}} use of a CISS (Continuous Ink Supply System). A CISS consists of a set of cartridges that have tubes connected to them, through which the ink continuously flows from ink reservoirs on the outside of the printer. Instead of refilling the cartridges themselves, the user simply refills the bottles on the outside of the printer. Early CIS systems were composed of OEM cartridges that had been drilled and outfitted with fittings to accept the ink <b>delivery</b> <b>tubes,</b> a set of 'ribbon' tubes, and plastic bottles with holes drilled in the caps for the tubes and the vents. Today's CIS systems are mass-produced in China, often incorporating all ink bottles into one partitioned container. They typically utilize auto-reset chips, which means the cartridges rarely have to be removed from the printer.|$|R

50|$|HFT, {{a source}} of oxygen is usually blended with {{compressed}} air. Hospitals usually have 50 psi compressed oxygen and air available for therapeutic use.

50|$|Mixing of {{the strike}} water, water used for mashing in, and milled grist must be done {{in such a way}} as to {{minimize}} clumping and oxygen uptake. This was traditionally done by first adding water to the mash vessel, and then introducing the grist from the top of the vessel in a thin stream. This has led to a lot of oxygen absorption, and loss of flour dust to the surrounding air.

50|$|The precursor, {{typically}} a single- or mixed-metal alkoxide, or carboxylate dissolved in ethanol at 1-10 wt% is {{introduced to the}} combustion chamber via twin, high-shear fluid (Bernoulli) aerosol generators with oxygen as the atomizing gas. The aerosol generator is composed of a precursor <b>delivery</b> <b>tube</b> oriented perpendicularly to a high-velocity oxygen flow tube. The twin aerosol generators provide high throughput of the precursor solution and stabilize the flame. Two methane pilot torches made of alumina are used to ignite the aerosol. The ensuing combustion results in flame temperatures of 1500-2000 °C, depending on the solvent, precursor loading, and rate of aerosolization. The precursor vaporizes on combustion and subsequently gets converted to nanoparticles in the flame. Temperatures drop to 300-500 °C over a 1.5 m length of the combustion chamber, which is equivalent to a 1000 °C quench in ≤ 100 ms.
