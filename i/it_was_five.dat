5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience in Something for the Boys. He sat ready to work in his dressing room for two weeks without being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> weeks before he was actually called to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director had no idea who he was.|$|E

25|$|Work on the {{colliery}} – one of {{the pioneering}} mines of the East Durham coalfield, began on 19 February 1838 but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> years before the first coals were drawn. Problems with pockets of shifting sand {{and the depth of}} the magnesium limestone overlying the coal delayed the work, making the project hugely expensive. Late shifts were even introduced for the first time, so that excavation could be carried out around the clock to finish the three-shafted pit as quickly as possible.|$|E

The stadium hosted eight World Series and two MLB All-Star Games, in 1943 and 1952, with the latter game holding the {{distinction}} of being the only All-Star contest shortened by rain (to five innings). In May 1939, it was the site of the first night game played in the American League.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the spiral-can {{system was}} {{essentially}} a rotating version of a conventional A-scope display. In the A-scope, a time base generator pulls the CRT beam across the screen horizontally, and blips indicate the range to the target along the line the radar is currently pointed. For spiral-scan the only difference was that the line was no longer always horizontal, but was rotating around {{the face of the}} display at the same speed as the dish. Blips on the screen now indicated two values, the angle of the target relative to the centreline, and the range to the target represented by the distance from the centre. What was lost in this display was a direct indication of magnitude of the angle from the centre; a blip to the upper right indicated the target was in that direction but did not directly indicate if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>five,</b> ten or twenty degrees off.|$|E
25|$|C.J. Barnes, {{portrayed by}} David Spade (2004–2005), is Cate's nephew. He was {{once in the}} Army and claims to have studied aerial {{photography}} during the Gulf War, and to have received a Purple Heart in combat, which is in complete contrast with his generally childish attitude. He is {{a teacher at the}} school and often pursues women, albeit unsuccessfully. When C.J. first arrives, the family is initially surprised. He reveals to them that he was ashamed that he did not live up to be the person Paul had once said he would be and avoided them because of that. He lives along with his grandfather, Jim, in the basement (having previously lived in a van, which was burned by that same grandfather). He once dated Mrs. Krupp, his cousins' (Kerry and Bridget) math teacher, but he ended up cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend Cheryl. He once revealed that his first initial stands for Corey, but Rory said that was untrue. C.J. previously smoked marijuana heavily (and in fact used to smoke with Kyle's older brother), but at the start of his appearances, he claims not to have touched it in two years (he originally claimed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>five,</b> though he relented after Jim expressed disbelief).|$|E

The book was published in 1928 and sold well. At {{the end of the decade}} Shaw produced his final Fabian tract, a commentary on the League of Nations. He described the League as [...] "a school for the new international statesmanship as against the old Foreign Office diplomacy", but thought that it had not yet become the [...] "Federation of the World".|$|E
500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post also praised Ramirez's performance, {{calling her}} [...] "the most genuine character".

There were so many pre-episode pictures up that I thought the funeral would take up half the show, then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> minutes and it wasn't sad at all.

500|$|From 1923 to 1925, though Tech {{failed to}} claim a conference title, it had one of its best-ever players: fullback Doug Wycoff, [...] "the {{outstanding}} back of the South {{for the past two}} years." [...] Coach Alexander recalled [...] "The work of Douglas Wycoff against Notre Dame two years in succession was brilliant in the extreme, as was his plunging against Penn. State when we defeated them twice." [...] Tech and UGA renewed their annual rivalry game in 1925 after an eight-year [...] Quarterback Ike Armstrong thought the game clock read five seconds remaining in the game when in actuality <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> minutes.

500|$|Cambridge won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Middlesex station. [...] Oxford took an early lead with their stroke Sawyier making a good start. [...] Despite this, by the Mile Post, Oxford were just one-third of a length clear, and while Cambridge's stroke rate was lower than their Dark Blue opposition, they {{remained}} in contention. [...] By Hammersmith Bridge, Oxford held a two-length lead, and despite favourable wind and ride, Cambridge failed to respond. [...] At Chiswick Steps, the lead had extended to four lengths and by Barnes Bridge <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>five.</b> [...] Oxford passed the finishing post in a record-breaking time of 17 minutes 35 seconds, breaking the existing record from the 1948 race, five-and-a-half lengths clear of the Light Blues. [...] Railton commented: [...] "Tideway records reflect conditions more than comparisons with previous Boat Race crews" [...] but noted [...] "considering the slow conditions ... Oxford's performance must have been particularly inspired." [...] The winning time was two seconds faster than the best time over the course, set by Oxford in practice in 1965, and 15 seconds quicker than the race record, set in the 1948 race by Cambridge.|$|E
500|$|... "Ron and Tammy" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Troy Miller. The episode featured comedian and actress Megan Mullally in a guest appearance as Ron's ex-wife, Tammy. Mullally is the real-life wife of Nick Offerman, who plays Ron. Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur conceived {{the idea for the}} story, and asked Offerman whether he and Mullally would be opposed to her playing such a terrible character. Offerman was extremely responsive to the idea. Mullally said she enjoyed the script, particularly the dialogue of Ron describing Tammy, more than Tammy's part herself. Offerman and Mullally improvised many of their on-screen fights, as well as the varied methods of unusual kissing between the two characters. During the diner scene, in which Ron and Tammy switch between violent fighting and passionate kissing, Offerman accidentally pulled a diner table out of the wall after placing Mullally on top of it and kissing her. The scene was used in the final episode. Offerman said of filming the diner scenes, [...] "At the end of doing that for a few hours, we said, you know that feels like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> weeks worth of really good therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{several days}} {{following}} D-Day, the squadron flew patrols and received credits for many kills. In one instance, Warrant Officer (W/O) W.F. Price and P/O J.G. Costello shot down two Do.217 {{aircraft in the}} space of twenty minutes. and the Cougars destroyed twelve German bombers in all. Following this success, however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> days before the squadron scored another kill. In the interval, the crews, still maintaining their schedule of nine sorties per night, had little to report. One night an engine in W/C Hiltz’s Mosquito failed on the take-off run and the aircraft, swerving off the runway, crashed into [...] "A" [...] Flight dispersal. The crews escaped injury, but many buildings went up in flames. During an operation that resulted in the thirteenth kill of the period, one aircraft crashed and its crew was unable to bail out. For the next week the weather was poor, which restricted night operations. Most of the crews that did go out had to be diverted to other bases on their return. German activity had also diminished by then and the beachhead was much quieter {{than it had been in}} mid-June. On the first two nights in July there were no sorties at all. Then the weather improved and the nightly round of nine patrols was resumed.|$|E
