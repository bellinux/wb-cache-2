5|$|Some common uses {{of heavy}} metals {{depend on the}} <b>general</b> <b>characteristics</b> of metals such as {{electrical}} conductivity and reflectivity or the <b>general</b> <b>characteristics</b> of heavy metals such as density, strength, and durability. Other uses depend {{on the characteristics of}} the specific element, such as their biological role as nutrients or poisons or some other specific atomic properties. Examples of such atomic properties include: partly filled d- or f- orbitals (in many of the transition, lanthanide, and actinide heavy metals) that enable the formation of coloured compounds; the capacity of most heavy metal ions (such as platinum, cerium or bismuth) to exist in different oxidation states and therefore act as catalysts; poorly overlapping 3d or 4f orbitals (in iron, cobalt, and nickel, or the lanthanide heavy metals from europium through thulium) that give rise to magnetic effects; and high atomic numbers and electron densities that underpin their nuclear science applications. Typical uses of heavy metals can be broadly grouped into the following six categories.|$|E

The start of construction was delayed for nearly eight months over concerns about her stability and <b>general</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Her keel was laid down on 1 June 1889, at Portsmouth, Virginia, by the Norfolk Navy Yard. She was launched on 28 June 1892, sponsored by Miss Madge Houston Williams, granddaughter of Sam Houston; and commissioned on 15 August 1895, with Captain Henry Glass in command.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo 14 {{crew members}} sampled {{boulders}} in the ejecta of Cone crater. These boulders {{appeared to be}} layered and fractured breccias, contrasting from {{the appearance of the}} surrounding area because of their older age. As these boulders increase in size and number closer to Cone crater, it is believed that they originate from the greatest depth of excavation of Cone crater. These boulders show what is believed to be <b>general</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the Fra Mauro formation: clastic texture, stratification, and jointing or fracturing.|$|E

5|$|The first section, {{entitled}} Definitions and Distinctions, {{consists of}} five chapters and details how Wellek and Warren define literature. This section also contrasts Wellek and Warren's definition {{with those of}} others, such views of literature as everything in print and as only belles-lettres (accepted literary canon). They define literary scholarship as beyond the personal ("super-personal") and contrasted with the literary arts by its more scientific approach. Wellek and Warren suggest that neither a purely objective nor a purely subjective approach {{would be able to}} properly describe literature. They note that literary scholarship should not only examine what makes a work or author unique, but also its <b>general</b> <b>characteristics</b> that allow it to be compared to other works.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the <b>general</b> <b>characteristics</b> of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the bullet, and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For the {{development}} of Semantic Web technology, researchers and developers in the Semantic Web community {{need to focus on}} the areas in which human reasoning is particularly difficult. Two studies in this paper demonstrate that people are predisposed to use class-inclusion labels for inductive judgments. This tendency appears to stem from a <b>general</b> <b>characteristic</b> of human reasoning – using heuristics to solve problems. The inference engines and interface designs that incorporate human reasoning need to integrate this <b>general</b> <b>characteristic</b> underlying human induction. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>general</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the {{closed-loop}} T-system {{of round}} in-feed grinding is determined and its function is magnitude of actual metal removal. The specified characteristic as the uniform index characterises rigidity of T-system and cutting {{ability of a}} grinding wheel in aggregate. Possibility of experimental definition of the <b>general</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the closed-loop T-system is considered, and this allows to increase accuracy of working cycle calculation during technical normalization of circular grinding operations.
