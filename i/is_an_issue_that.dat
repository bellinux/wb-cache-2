She also believes the government should address concerns about the mental health of unemployed young people.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} issues {{that can occur}} with horses' legs that may not necessarily cause lameness. Stocking up <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> occurs in horses that are held in stalls for multiple days after periods of activity. Fluid collects in the lower legs, producing swelling and often stiffness. Although it does not usually cause lameness or other problems, prolonged periods of stocking up can lead to other skin issues. Older horses and horse with heavy muscling {{are more prone to}} this condition. A shoe boil is an injury that occurs when there is trauma to the bursal sac of the elbow, causing inflammation and swelling. Multiple occurrences can cause a cosmetic sore and scar tissue, called a capped elbow, or infections. Shoe boils generally occur when a horse hits its elbow with a hoof or shoe when lying down. Windpuffs, or swelling {{to the back of the}} fetlock caused by inflammation of the sheaths of the deep digital flexor tendon, appear most often in the rear legs. Soft and fluid-filled, the swelling may initially be accompanied by heat and pain, but can remain long after the initial injury has healed without accompanying lameness. Repeated injuries to the tendon sheath, often caused by excessive training or work on hard surfaces, can cause larger problems and lameness.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the varying}} levels that water can reach in regions of cultivation, flood {{tolerant}} varieties {{have long been}} developed and used. Flooding <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> many rice growers face, especially in South and South East Asia where flooding annually affects 20 million hectares. Standard rice varieties cannot withstand stagnant flooding of more than about a week, mainly as it disallows the plant access to necessary requirements such as sunlight and essential gas exchanges, inevitably leading to plants being unable to recover.|$|E
25|$|In {{almost every}} country in the world, men are put above women. Although this case is not true for every country, it applies to most of the world. Gender {{equality}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> is being developed and is essential for women and men to participate equally in society and in the economy. An organization called the World’s Bank’s Africa Region Gender is dedicated to improving the lives of women and men by supporting government partners with knowledge and finance.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} Warhol's {{homosexuality}} influenced {{his work and}} shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications (e.g., Popism: The Warhol 1960s). Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of Liza Minnelli, Judy Garland, and Elizabeth Taylor, and films such as Blow Job, My Hustler and Lonesome Cowboys) draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters.|$|E
25|$|In general, we {{absolutely}} condemn {{acts of violence}} and human rights violations committed against individuals in Iraq because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> we've been following very closely since we have been made aware of these allegations, and {{we are aware of}} the allegations. Our training for Iraqi security forces includes instruction on the proper observance of human rights. Human rights training is also {{a very important part of}} our and other international donors' civilian capacity-building efforts in Iraq. And the US embassy in Baghdad has raised, and will continue to raise, the issue with senior officials from the government of Iraq, and has urged them to respond appropriately to all credible reports of violence against gay and lesbian Iraqis.|$|E
25|$|I think {{global warming}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> is {{currently}} relevant, time sensitive, and {{a symptom of}} the shortsightedness of the U.S. As a broader metaphor, the drowning Statue of Liberty, a revered icon of the U.S., symbolizes the eminent demise of many of the ideals upon which the nation was founded. Civil liberties, freedom of speech, privacy, etc. have been decreasing since 9/11. The sun in the image could either be setting or rising and this ambiguity shows that there is still hope to turn things around... The U.S. is the dominant global force. When things are going wrong in the U.S. they are probably going wrong around the world. I think this image conveys both the U.S. situation and its larger global implications.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the usage}} of 'not' in {{splitting}} infinitives <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> has not attracted much attention from the English users, contemporary English grammar puts the phrase into {{the same category as}} above. This appears to be because the traditional idiom, placing the negation before the marker (I soon learned not to provoke her) or with verbs of desire, negating the finite verb (I don't want to see you anymore) remains easy and natural, and is still overwhelmingly the more common construction in British English. On the other hand, in the case of American English, a search on the corpus of contemporary American English displays a different aspect. Its usage is more commonly found in the American context, where we can find at least 2,200 cases of {{the usage of}} 'not' in splitting infinitives.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan {{does not}} have its own {{equivalent}} to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. There is also no federal ministry that looks after veteran affairs. Most of Pakistan's infantry come from lower income, poor families, mainly from the rural areas of the country. They remain unknown {{from the time of}} their recruitment, and for the most part, to the time of their leave or death. Because there is no network of support that goes out to veterans, some believe that Pakistan's veterans are facing similar issues like those faced by Vietnam veterans. Politicians hardly ever mention the veterans in speeches or statements. This is because civil society hardly ever inquires or hears about the physical and mental challenges facing Pakistan's veterans. How to re-integrate veterans in to society <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> has yet to be addressed.|$|E
25|$|Women {{artists have}} also been at the {{forefront}} of the hip hop movement since its inception in the Bronx. Nevertheless, as gangsta rap became the dominant force in hip hop music, there were many songs with misogynistic (anti-women) lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion. The negation of female voice and perspective <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> has come to define mainstream hip hop music. The recording industry is less willing to back female artists than their male counterparts, and when it does back them, often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities. Since the turn of the century (the beginning of the 2000s decade), female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention, with only a few, such as older artists like the female duo Salt N' Pepa to more contemporary ones like Lil' Kim and Nicki Minaj, reaching platinum status.|$|E

500|$|Itchy and Scratchy {{cartoons}} {{are often}} added when a show needs expanding or when there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> the writers wish to satirize. In some cases, notably in [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show," [...] the writers use Itchy & Scratchy {{as a way}} to comment on The Simpsons. The shorts are often difficult for the writers, and take much time to develop and devise a title, and in the end they fill little time. Writing the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons is quite often a group effort, with it being pitched out one gag after another. Itchy & Scratchy are a favorite of John Swartzwelder, who has written many of the episodes that center on them and quite often pitches the ideas for the shorts. In the early seasons, fans wanted more Itchy & Scratchy, so the writers decided to do [...] "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge," [...] an episode also dealt with censorship issues which would allow them to show several cartoons. The cartoons are often kept short, because according to David Silverman, [...] "it doesn't really work as a long cartoon." ...|$|E

That <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> is still debated today and is the primary difference between the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) and the American Psychological Association (APA). APA only recognizes doctoral degrees where as NASP approves school psychology specialist and doctoral programs that meet their standards.|$|E

He viewed the payments as a normal business practice: If your girlfriend goes to buy stockings at a supermarket, the racks that display those stockings are usually paid for by the company that manufactured the stockings. Order flow <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> attracted a lot of attention but is grossly overrated.|$|E
2500|$|The Itchy & Scratchy Show {{is a show}} {{within a}} show that appears {{occasionally}} in episodes of The Simpsons. They typically appear {{in the form of}} 15-60 second cartoons that are filled with over-the-top violence, usually initiated by Itchy the mouse against Scratchy the cat; Itchy is almost always the victor. The show is usually a parody of traditional cartoons or takeoffs on famous films, but the plot and content are always violent. The most direct and obvious example is Tom and Jerry, an animated series which was also about a constant battle between a cat and a mouse, with the mouse usually victorious. Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are often added when a show needs expanding or when there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> the writers wish to satirize.
