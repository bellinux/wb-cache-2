40|$|The {{electrical}} and plasma characteristics of radio frequency (13. 56 MHz) inductively coupled argon plasma (RF ICP) were studied in this project. On the electrical breakdown properties, the breakdown voltage has a general appearance of Paschen’s curve and the minimum is achieved at 0. 1 mbar. After ignition, two modes of discharge exist, namely, the E mode at low RF power and <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> at high RF power. Mode transition that occurs {{is accompanied by}} abrupt changes in both {{electrical and}} plasma characteristics. Hysteresis is observed in the mode transitions and has a minimum at 0. 1 mbar. The resistance reflected into the electrical circuit due to <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> plasma is 9. 8 times higher when compared to E mode (Rp= 0. 10 ± 0. 01) Ω. Therefore, the impedance matching scheme used is most efficient at E mode where the antenna coil resistance Ra is (1. 12 ± 0. 01) Ω. Ra doubles in the <b>H</b> <b>mode.</b> However, the transfer of power is more efficient in the <b>H</b> <b>mode.</b> This efficiency {{is reflected in the}} much higher electron density of ne = (3. 6 − 12. 2) × 1017 m− 3 measured in the <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> at 0. 10 ± 0. 1 mbar. Consequently, the increased electron collisions tend to lower the electron temperature Te in the <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> (1. 7 − 2. 0 eV) as compared to that in E mode (Te = 2. 3 - 2. 8 eV). The measured electron energy distribution function EEDF in <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> is inclined towards Maxwellian-type especially at 200 W.

40|$|Abstract: Results from an {{extensive}} database analysis of JET density profiles {{show that the}} density peaking factor ne 0 / in JET H-modes increases form near 1. 2 at high collisionality to around 1. 5 as the plasma colli-sionality decreases towards the values expected for ITER. This result confirms an earlier observation on AUG. The density peaking behaviour of L modes is remarkably {{different from that of}} <b>H</b> <b>modes,</b> scaling with overall plasma shear as (ne 0 /∝li), independently of collisionality. H-mode density profiles show no shear dependence, except at the lowest collisionalities. No evidence for additional LTe, LTi, Te/Ti, β or ρ * dependences has been obtained. Carbon and neon impurity density profiles from Charge Exchange Spectroscopy are less peaked than electron density profiles and usually flat in <b>H</b> <b>modes.</b> The possibility of heavy impurity accumulation at ITER collisionalities remains an issue. The peaking of the electron density profiles, together with the flatness of the light impurity density profiles, are favourable for fusion performance if they can be extrapolated to ignited conditions. Peaked density profiles would help to recover the fusion performance loss resulting from a possible lower-than-expected density limit in ITER. 1.

40|$|While on orbit, {{disturbance}} torques on a three axis stabilized spacecraft tend {{to increase}} the system momentum, which is stored in the reaction wheels. Upon reaching the predefined momentum capacity (or maximum wheel speed) of the reaction wheel, an external torque must be used to unload the momentum. The purpose of the Delta <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> is to manage the system momentum. This is accomplished by driving the reaction wheels to a target momentum state while the attitude thrusters, which provide an external torque, are used to maintain the attitude. The Delta <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> is {{designed to meet the}} mission requirements and implement the momentum management plan. Changes in the requirements or the momentum management plan can lead to design changes in the mode. The momentum management plan defines the expected momentum buildup trend, the desired momentum state and how often the system is driven to the desired momentum state (unloaded). The desired momentum state is chosen based on wheel capacity, wheel configuration, thruster layout and thruster sizing. For the Solar Dynamics Observatory mission, the predefined wheel momentum capacity {{is a function of the}} jitter requirements, power, and maximum momentum capacity. Changes in jitter requirements or power limits can lead to changes in the desired momentum state. These changes propagate into the changes in the momentum management plan and therefore the Delta <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> design. This paper presents the analysis and design performed for the Solar Dynamics Observatory Delta <b>H</b> <b>mode.</b> In particular, the mode logic and processing needed to meet requirements is described along with the momentum distribution formulation. The Delta <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> design is validated using the Solar Dynamics Observatory High Fidelity simulator. Finally, a summary of the design is provided along with concluding remarks...|$|E

40|$|The {{dimensionless}} parameter scaling {{approach is}} increasingly useful for predicting future tokamak performance and guiding theoretical models of energy transport. Experiments {{to determine the}} {rho}* (gyroradius normalized to plasma size) scaling {{have been carried out}} in many regimes. The electron {rho}* scaling is always ``gyro-Bohm``, while the ion {rho}* scaling varied with regime. The ion variation is correlated with both density scale length (L mode, <b>H</b> <b>mode)</b> and current profile. The ion {rho}* scaling in the low-q, H-mode regime is gyro-Bohm, which is the most favorable confinement scaling observed. New experiments in {beta} scaling and collisionality scaling have been carried out in low-q discharges in both L mode and <b>H</b> <b>mode.</b> In L mode, global analysis shows that there is a slightly unfavorable {beta} dependence ({beta}{sup {minus} 0. 1 }) and no {nu}* dependence. In H-mode, global analysis finds a weak {beta} dependence ({beta}{sup 0. 1 }) and an unfavorable dependence on {nu}*. The lack of significant {beta} scaling spans the range of {beta}{sub N} from 0. 25 to 2. 0. The very small {beta} dependence in L mode and <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> is in contradiction with the standard global scaling relations. This contradiction in <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> may be indicative of the impact on the H-mode database of low-n tearing instabilities which are observed at slightly higher {beta}{sub N} in the {beta} scaling experiments. The measured {beta} and {nu}* scalings explain the weak density dependence observed in engineering parameter scans.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{challenge facing}} the basic long-pulse high-confinement operation scenario (<b>H</b> <b>mode)</b> for ITER is {{to control a}} magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instability, known as the edge localized mode (ELM), which leads to cyclical high peak heat and particle fluxes at the plasma facing components. A breakthrough {{is made in the}} Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak in achieving a new steady-state <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> without the presence of ELMs for a duration exceeding hundreds of energy confinement times, by using a novel technique of continuous real-time injection of a lithium (Li) aerosol into the edge plasma. The steady-state ELM-free <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> is accompanied by a strong edge coherent MHD mode (ECM) at a frequency of 35 – 40 kHz with a poloidal wavelength of 10. 2 cm in the ion diamagnetic drift direction, providing continuous heat and particle exhaust, thus preventing the transient heat deposition on plasma facing components and impurity accumulation in the confined plasma. It is truly remarkable that Li injection appears to promote the growth of the ECM, owing to the increase in Li concentration and hence collisionality at the edge, as predicted by GYRO simulations. This new steady-state ELM-free H-mode regime, enabled by real-time Li injection, may open a new avenue for next-step fusion development...|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of renewable energies as power generators in the electricity grid {{is necessary to}} overcome the dependence and pollution linked to fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the variability of these renewable resources limits their quantity in the system. In addition, there exists a trend to change the transport sector {{by means of the}} electrification of the existing conventional vehicles based on internal combustion engine (ICE). A solution to mitigate the mentioned variability and to enable a higher integration is the use of energy storage systems, such as batteries and supercapacitors (SCs). Nonetheless, batteries are nowadays very expensive, so using them only for this back-up function is unviable. Electric Vehicles’ batteries could be used for this purpose and be consequently repaid sooner. In order to provide this support service, the chargers of the electric vehicles (EVs) should work with a bidirectional power flow, in two modes: as dynamic loads, when they are charging, which corresponds to Grid-to-Vehicle (G 2 V) mode; or as generators, when they are discharging, which corresponds to Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G) or Vehicle-to-Home (V 2 <b>H)</b> <b>modes.</b> Even if this first mode is broadly deployed, the V 2 G and V 2 <b>H</b> <b>modes</b> are still in developing process and they are not commercialized yet.

An assessment of the most typical AC/DC and DC/DC converters’ topologies is carried out, and their benefits and drawbacks are highlighted.

40|$|This {{new edition}} {{presents}} the essential theoretical and analytical methods {{needed to understand}} the recent fusion research of tokamak and alternate approaches. The author describes magnetohydrodynamic and kinetic theories of cold and hot plasmas in detail. The book covers new important topics for fusion studies such as plasma transport by drift turbulence, which depend on the magnetic configuration and zonal flows. These are universal phenomena of microturbulence. They can modify the onset criterion for turbulent transport, instabilities driven by energetic particles as well as alpha particle generation and typical plasma models for computer simulation. The fusion research of tokamaks with various new versions of <b>H</b> <b>modes</b> are explained. The design concept of ITER, the international tokamak experimental reactor, is described for inductively driven operations as well as steady-state operations using non-inductive drives. Alternative approaches of reversed-field pinch and its relaxation process, stellator including quasi-symmetric system, open-end system of tandem mirror and inertial confinement are also explained. Newly added and updated topics in this second edition include zonal flows, various versions of <b>H</b> <b>modes,</b> and steady-state operations of tokamak, the design concept of ITER, the relaxation process of RFP, quasi-symmetric stellator, and tandem mirror.

The retention of helium {{was found to be}} sufficient with respect to the requirements in a next step device, with helium enrichment factors exceeding 0. 1 in high density ELMy <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> discharges. With increasing core plasma density the helium partial pressure in the exhaust channel increases. While in L mode plasmas the helium enrichment decreases with increasing core plasma density, it remains almost constant in ELMy <b>H</b> <b>mode</b> plasma.

These experimental results {{can be explained by the}} significant differences between the penetration depths of the impurity neutrals and by their subsequent different impurity transport mechanisms. Analytical and numerical analyses of these plasmas using the impurity code package DIVIMP/NIMBUS support the proposition that, owing to their much longer ionization mean free path, helium particles can escape from the divertor chamber as neutrals, while neon escapes by means of ion leakage. Consequently, the divertor plasma conditions strongly influence the noble gas compression and enrichment. Variations of the divertor plasma configuration and modifications to the divertor geometry have enhanced the pumping capabilities of the tokamak, but have been found not to affect the helium enrichment...|$|E

Withm the E-to-H instability window, gross spatial mhomogeneities (plasmoids) have been observed. We report the observation of plasmoids in a cylindrical inductively coupled rf plasma. Observations show plasmoid lobes as regions of higher plasma density and light emission distributed symmetrically around the antenna. They may also rotate and the number of lobes may change depending of plasma power, pressure, and gas mixture. In order to explain the behaviour of plasmoids we present the discharge as plasma transmission line with associated line capacitance and inductance as defined by the plasma.
