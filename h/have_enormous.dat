5|$|Potbelly monuments are {{generally}} crude in-the-round sculptures of extremely fat human figures; {{they are usually}} seated cross-legged and <b>have</b> <b>enormous</b> swollen stomachs gripped in the figure's arms and legs. The heads are round and normally have the eyes closed and possess puffy eyelids and prominent lips. The monuments {{are generally}} of indeterminate gender and are usually carved from porphyritic basalt, a kind of rock {{with a combination of}} large and small grains of mineral that is common along the foothills of Central America. There are occasional examples of potbelly figures crafted from other materials, such as pottery or from other types of rock.|$|E

25|$|Disarming can <b>have</b> <b>enormous</b> symbolism, as {{with the}} Independent International Commission on Decommissioning in Northern Ireland. There may well be {{situations}} where an insurgency will not hand over its arms to the government, but will accept face-saving measures such as having a third party verify that the weapons {{are no longer a}} threat. Reintegration may mean that people perceived as having been involved in violence still can reenter the political process.|$|E
25|$|Touch is the {{earliest}} sense {{to develop in}} the fetus. The development of an infant's haptic senses and how {{it relates to the}} development of the other senses such as vision has been the target of much research. Human babies have been observed to <b>have</b> <b>enormous</b> difficulty surviving if they do not possess a sense of touch, even if they retain sight and hearing. Infants who can perceive through touch, even without sight and hearing, tend to fare much better.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, there are {{enormous}} positive consequences {{that would follow}} from rendering tractable many currently mathematically intractable problems. For instance, many problems in operations research are NP-complete, such as some types of integer programming and the travelling salesman problem. Efficient solutions to these problems would <b>have</b> <b>enormous</b> implications for logistics. Many other important problems, such as some problems in protein structure prediction, are also NP-complete; if these problems were efficiently solvable it could spur considerable advances in life sciences and biotechnology.|$|E
25|$|The {{swallows}} and martins have {{a worldwide}} cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. One species, the Pacific swallow, occurs as a breeding bird {{on a number of}} oceanic islands in the Pacific Ocean, the Mascarene martin breeds on Reunion and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, and a number of migratory species are common vagrants to other isolated islands and even to some sub-Antarctic islands and Antarctica. Many species <b>have</b> <b>enormous</b> worldwide ranges, particularly the barn swallow, which breeds over most of the Northern Hemisphere and winters over most of the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Dyer {{was born}} at the Royal Greenwich Hospital, England to John Dyer and Eliza (Seager). He was the fifth of the eight Dyer children. His father was a {{secretary}} of the Royal Hospital for Seaman, and later became Chief clerk of the Admiralty in 1820. John was also an acquaintance of Robert Morrison, who was soon {{to become the first}} Protestant missionary to China, a connection that would <b>have</b> <b>enormous</b> implications in the life of his son, Samuel. Morrison and his Chinese tutor Yong Sam-tek visited the Dyer home in Greenwich during Morrison's period of study in medicine and astronomy between 1805 and 1806.|$|E

25|$|Use {{of methods}} that allow early {{detection}} of possible failures, in safety engineering, are integrated into the design process. At the same time, decisions made {{at the beginning of}} a project whose consequences are not clearly understood can <b>have</b> <b>enormous</b> implications later in the life of a system, and it is the task of the modern systems engineer to explore these issues and make critical decisions. No method guarantees today's decisions will still be valid when a system goes into service years or decades after first conceived. However, there are techniques that support the process of systems engineering. Examples include soft systems methodology, Jay Wright Forrester's System dynamics method, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML)—all currently being explored, evaluated, and developed to support the engineering decision process.|$|E
25|$|Colonization of {{asteroid}}s {{would require}} space habitats. The asteroid belt has significant overall material available, the largest object being Ceres, {{although it is}} thinly distributed as it covers a vast region of space. Unmanned supply craft should be practical with little technological advance, even crossing 500 million kilometers of space. The colonists would have {{a strong interest in}} assuring their asteroid did not hit Earth or any other body of significant mass, but would have extreme difficulty in moving an asteroid of any size. The orbits of the Earth and most asteroids are very distant from each other in terms of delta-v and the asteroidal bodies <b>have</b> <b>enormous</b> momentum. Rockets or mass drivers can perhaps be installed on asteroids to direct their path into a safe course.|$|E
25|$|Splay : This type of natal chart is {{noteworthy}} {{because of the}} presence of at least two, but usually three pairs (or conjunctions) of planets randomly distributed in a 'splay' shape around the chart. A person with this pattern will <b>have</b> <b>enormous</b> talent and potential that needs deliberate attention to be developed into worthwhile skills. The person will be an individualist, with no desire for a regimented or highly organized way of life, and they will seek to avoid becoming trapped in routine. However, there is often the difficulty that there is a lack of relevance between the different skill sets, so that the person may not derive the full benefit from them. Such a person needs to concentrate on 'getting their act together'.|$|E

25|$|The rise of state-subsidised theatre, and the {{emergence}} of kitchen sink drama undermined Beaumont's pre-eminence beginning in the 1950s. He disapproved of both, and stuck to his style of lavish, starry West End productions, even when they began to go out of fashion. He alienated both Coward and Terence Rattigan with his arrogant and sometimes duplicitous behaviour. Beaumont attempted to sabotage the former's new play Waiting in the Wings by telling him that the actresses Coward wanted to cast refused to play in it, whereas in reality Beaumont had not consulted them. He continued to <b>have</b> <b>enormous</b> successes: in 1958, he presented the first British productions of both West Side Story (1040 performances) and My Fair Lady (2281 performances). The latter cost an unprecedented sum to stage, but, thanks to a sustained publicity campaign by Tennent's, advance bookings meant that the show was in net profit two months before it opened.|$|E
25|$|Acts {{was read}} as a {{reliable}} history of the early church well into the post-Reformation era. By the 17th century, however, biblical scholars began to notice that it was incomplete and tendentious—its picture of a harmonious church is quite at odds with that given by Paul's letters, and it omits important {{events such as the}} deaths of both Peter and Paul. The mid-19th-century scholar Ferdinand Baur suggested that Luke had re-written history to present a united Peter and Paul and advance a single orthodoxy against the Marcionites. (Marcion was a 2nd-century heretic who wished to cut Christianity off entirely from the Jews). Baur continues to <b>have</b> <b>enormous</b> influence, but today there is less interest in determining Luke's historical accuracy (although this has never died out) than in understanding his theological program. In How Jesus Became Christian Canadian religious historian Barrie Wilson has renewed Baur's charge that Acts is a work of historical revisionism whose main purpose was to link Paul's new and separate Christ religion to Jesus and Judaism.|$|E

500|$|While {{the editor}} of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a {{chimpanzee}} with the machine above the strapline [...] "Editor benchtests the ZX81". (The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will <b>have</b> <b>enormous</b> appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that.
