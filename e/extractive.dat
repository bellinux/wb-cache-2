5|$|Historically, <b>extractive</b> {{industries}} have contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing {{at different times}} on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which {{provided the basis for}} strong economic growth in New Zealand. High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression. Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank. In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period. Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy.|$|E
5|$|Trappers and explorers {{arrived in}} {{southern}} Idaho {{in the early}} 19thcentury. They established immigrant trails in the region by 1849, including the Oregon and California trails. The forest was used by early settlers primarily for <b>extractive</b> industries. Fur trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company discovered the Stanley Basin {{in the northern part}} of the forest in the 1820s, but mostly avoided it due to the scarcity of beaver. For early settlers, the welfare of their community was dependent upon timber supply, regulation of stream flow for irrigation, and use of the land for cattle range. Mining began in the 1860s, peaked in the 1880s, and fluctuated over the following century with the extraction of gold, silver, lead, and zinc. The Black Pine Division of the forest was explored in the late 1800s, and the Tallman Mine began producing gold in the 1920s with production peaking from 1949 to 1954. The Black Pine Mine again produced gold from 1992 through November 1997, when the mine's parent company, Pegasus Gold, declared bankruptcy. The location of the mine has since been reclaimed.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in <b>extractive</b> foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E

3000|$|Sources of {{variations}} in dynamic mechanical properties of wood include cell arrangement and grain angle, microfibril angle within the cell wall, proportions of constitutive polymers, {{as well as}} the presence of additional compounds [5 – 9]. Although in lower quantities than cell wall constitutive polymers, <b>extractives</b> can have a considerable effect on mechanical and damping properties of wood. Exceptionally low damping of some musically important woods was somehow correlated with their <b>extractives.</b> <b>Extractives</b> impact can be studied either through correlations between their amounts and vibrational properties variation resulting by their removal, or by the re-injection of extracts into a “neutral” wood. Methanol extraction increased the tanδ of heartwood by 15 – 37 % in red cedar (Thuja plicata) and up to 60 % in African Padauk (Pterocarpus soyauxii), while E′/γ slightly decreased [10, 11]. Impregnation of water-soluble <b>extractives</b> of pernambuco (Caesalpinia echinata) into spruce decreased tanδ by a half [12]. The formation of hydrogen bonds between <b>extractives</b> and cell wall matrix was proposed as a possible cause of tanδ reduction [13]. Impregnation of Sitka spruce with isolated key chemical compounds from muirapiranga (Brosimum rubescens), a Moraceae as is mulberry, decreased tanδ by up to 25 %, both in axial and radial directions. This was explained by motion restriction of matrix macromolecules due to <b>extractives</b> entering [14]. Contrary to these studies, water-soluble <b>extractives</b> of Reed (Arundo donax L.) increased both tanδ and E′ [15, 16]. <b>Extractives</b> can also change wood equilibrium moisture content (EMC) [17]. Higher EMC induces higher tanδ and lower [...] E′/γ [18, 19]. The potential effect of <b>extractives</b> on vibrational properties could come from their chemical structure, cellular location and relation with basic polymers [11, 13]. Removing <b>extractives</b> using solvents of different polarities could give a first idea about their polarity and possible cellular location.|$|R

30|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for Norway spruce as prime raw material for high-yield pulping, recent interest has focused on Scots pine as an alternative.

A study was therefore conducted on the variations in the spatial distribution and redistribution of lipophilic <b>extractives</b> in spruce and pine wood and thermomechanical pulp (TMP) using cytochemical staining methods and chemical analysis.

Pulp and paper industry effluents contain mostly natural compounds which {{are part of}} the trees. They are toxic to aquatic life but harmless in nature, as they are present in low concentrations. Processing tons of wood, such as in a pulp mill, strongly increases the concentrations of the toxic compounds (Ali, M. and Sreekrishnan, T., 2001) which have to be treated before transferring to the aquatic environment. <b>Extractives</b> can be found in different forms, as micelles soluble in water, unprocessed in fibers or absorbed on the surface of fibers. It is important to know in which forms <b>extractives</b> are mostly present in the effluent, {{so that they can be}} treated more efficiently. It is desired to have <b>extractives</b> absorbed on the fibers and fibrils present in the waste water, so they can be separated from the water and treated separately, e. g. burned for energy recovery.
