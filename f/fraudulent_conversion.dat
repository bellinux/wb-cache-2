50|$|Larceny is a {{crime of}} {{criminal}} trespass on the possessory rights of another. A person lawfully possessing another's property who converts the property to his own use, or otherwise deprives the owner of its use cannot be guilty of larceny because he lawfully received the property; the possessor, however, could be guilty of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>conversion.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 2005 Detremmerie's {{fortunes}} {{went into}} sharp reverse, which was reflected by various allegations of misfeasance which {{he himself has}} always contested. The driving issue involved his local football club, Royal Excelsior Mouscron, of which for many years Detremmerie was the president. In 2004-05 Mouscron reached fifth position in the premier league rankings, and in 2006 the club celebrated its tenth year in the Belgian premier league. By that time it had become apparent that the club had been overspending, however, and was badly overburdened by debt: although it remained a premier league club till the end, {{for the rest of}} the decade it sat resolutely in the bottom half of the league, with a corresponding decline in ticket sales. On 28 December 2009, Mouscron announced its third forfeit in a row because of enduring financial problems, and was thus, according to Belgian league rules, excluded from competition, with all its previous results in the ongoing competition being scrapped. The club in its current form ceased to exist, with all its players (and staff) becoming free agents.Responding to the looming financial crisis Detremmerie resigned his presidency of the club in 2005, but remained closely involved in trying to save it, successfully attracting massive cash injections, notably from the wealthy businessman Philippe Dufermont who took over the presidency. However, the financial rescue proved temporary, and in 2011 Detremmerie's role became the subject of criminal charges involving alleged covert funding, forgery, making used of forged documents with intent to defraud, misappropriation and <b>fraudulent</b> <b>conversion.</b>|$|E
