40|$|BepiColombo is an <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>mission</b> to Mercury {{scheduled}} for launch in 2015, arriving at Mercury in 2021. It {{is a joint}} mission between ESA and JAXA consisting of 2 complementary spacecraft, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO). Some of the instruments on the MPO either rely on certain solar events or are interested in variations of the magnetic or plasma environment around Mercury, which cannot be predicted or planned for. Traditionally, these instruments would measure continuously, downlink all their data back to Earth and the Scientists would identify the interesting periods. The Selective Data Downlink approach would allow experiments to have the possibility to detect these variations {{in a way that}} only interesting data will be selected for downlink. This approach would make far better use of the limited available data downlink volume, returning only high-resolution science data for the interesting periods. To achieve this, the instruments would have to generate simultaneously low-resolution and high-resolution data of the same observation that will be stored in the on-board SSM...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This essay {{comments}} on Stuart Henry’s {{important contribution to}} our thinking about the administration of interdisciplinary programs. Though I quibble {{with a few of}} the arguments he makes in the last volume of Issues, I focus my remarks on adding to Henry’s suggested strategies for defending interdisciplinarity. I conclude with brief observations on the question of academic appointments and on teaching and learning. Stuart Henry has performed a valuable service to the <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>mission</b> by clearly articulating the dangers faced by interdisciplinary programs. He is entirely correct in suggesting that we not be lulled into complacency by the fact that our enrollments are increasing in both absolute and relative terms. Interdisciplinary programs are particularly vulnerable in times of budgetary stringency. While the attendance and comments at our roundtable at the national 2005 AIS/AGLS conference suggest that his concerns resonate widely, I likely have a more Pollyannish outlook on the future than Henry. I also quibble with a few elements of Henry’s argument. I {{think we have to be}} exceedingly careful with respect to arguments that interdisciplinar...|$|E

We measured the power spectrum and two-point correlation function for the randomly fluctuating free surface on the downstream side of a stationary flow with a maximum Froude number F_ max≈ 0. 85 reached above a localised obstacle. On such a flow the scattering of incident long wavelength modes is analogous to that responsible for black hole radiation (the Hawking effect). Our measurements of the noise show a clear correlation between pairs of modes of opposite energies. We also measure the scattering coefficients by applying the same analysis of correlations to waves produced by a wave maker.

40|$|On-Board Control Procedures (OBCPs) are self-standing {{procedures}} executed autonomously on-board of the spacecraft. They are started via ground command, mission time line, or {{by events}} generated on-board. OBCPs {{are used as}} a supplement to the on-board software, to act as intelligent procedures for routine on-board operations and to increase spacecraft on-board autonomy. BepiColombo, being in collaboration with ISAS/JAXA the 5 th cornerstone mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision scientific program, is an <b>Interdisciplinary</b> <b>Mission</b> to the planet Mercury of Japan with Astrium GmbH as space segment prime. It consists of two scientific orbiters, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO), which are dedicated to the detailed study of the planet and of its magnetosphere. OBCP are excellently suited for mastering the complexity and operational demands of this deep space mission in a challenging environment. They are used to optimize mission operations (e. g. by saving bandwidth for regular operation) and to implement operational sequences which are known in detail only at a late stage of the project with a high flexibility to modify them, if necessary, even during the mission. The BepiColombo OBCPs can be loaded into a dedicated storage area of the on-board memor...|$|E
40|$|PublishedWe numerically study water wave packets on a {{spatially}} varying countercurrent in {{the presence}} of surface tension. Depending on the details of the velocity profile, we show that traversable and bidirectional analogue wormholes exist in fluid mechanics. The limitations on traversability of wormholes in general relativity are absent here because of the dispersion of water waves and the ability to form flow profiles that are not solutions of Einstein’s equations. We observe that negative energy can be trapped between analogue horizons forming a laserlike cavity. Six horizons are involved in the trapping cavity because of the existence of two dispersive scales, in contrast to previous treatments which considered two horizons and one dispersive scale. This research was supported by the University of Poitiers (ACI UP on Wave-Current Interactions 2013 – 2014), by the <b>Interdisciplinary</b> <b>Mission</b> of CNRS (PEPS PTI 2014 DEMRATNOS) and by the University of Tours in a joint grant with the University of Poitiers (ARC Poitiers-Tours 2014 – 2015).

40|$|Letttre d'information de la Mission Interdisciplinaire Française du Sindh (MIFS), co-éditée par Michel Boivin et Rémy Delage, [URL] {{aim of the}} French <b>Interdisciplinary</b> <b>Mission</b> in Sindh (MIFS) is {{to bring}} to light the {{historical}} and sociological heritage of Pakistan which, by and large, has been largely neglected by researchers. Pakistan's rich heritage stems largely from its geographic position as a hinge between the Middle East, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. To date, the media and, to a lesser extent, academia, are largely responsible for having circulated catastrophic approaches on this region. The MIFS is carrying out an interdisciplinary study of a pilgrimage centre (ziyârat), Sehwan Sharif, by drawing on diverse fields of expertise such as history, anthropology, literature, geography, topography, architecture and epigraphy. It seeks to highlight the many facets of the historical heritage of this site, {{as well as the}} processes of integration of various segments of the local population, particularly groups discriminated and marginalized such as women, musicians, Hindu castes, outcastes and hijrah. No major study has yet been done on Sehwan itself. Nor has a multidisciplinary approach of the Islamic heritage of such a site ever been conducted in South Asia. This first issue of the MIFS newsletter, presents the research program and its participants, as well as information pertaining to the history and geography of Sufism in South Asia. The activities of the MIFS will be followed by upcoming issues presenting fieldwork activities and research seminars, as well as through a Web site presently under construction...|$|E
40|$|BepiColombo is an <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>mission</b> {{to explore}} the planet Mercury through a {{partnership}} between ESA and Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). From their dedicated orbits two spacecraft, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO), will be studying the planet and its environment. They will be launched together on a single Soyuz-Fregat. The launch is foreseen for May 2012 with arrival in January 2017. Solar electric propulsion {{will be used for}} the journey to Mercury. The MMO provided by JAXA focuses on investigating the wave and particle environment of the planet from an eccentric orbit. The MPO, a three-axis-stabilized and nadir-pointing spacecraft in a low-eccentricity polar orbit, is dedicated to the characterization of Mercury. It will provide high accuracy measurements of the planet’s interior structure, a characterization of Mercury’s exosphere and a full coverage of the planet surface at high resolution, whereby surface morphology will be correlated to surface composition. Major effort was put into optimizing the scientific return by defining the payload complement such that individual measurements can be interrelated and complement each other. In November 2004, the BepiColombo scientific payload has been officially approved. The MPO payload comprises 11 instruments/instrument packages; the MMO payload consists of 5 instruments/instrument packages. Together, the scientific payload of both spacecraft will provide the detailed information necessary to understand Mercury and its magnetospheric environment and to find clues to the origin and evolution of a planet close to its parent star.

40|$|The {{value of}} Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) {{measurements}} to atmospheric science, space physics, and ocean science, is now emerging or showing a potential {{to play a}} major role in the evolving programs of NASA, NSF and NOAA. The objective of this communication is to identify and articulate the key scientific questions that are optimally, or perhaps uniquely, addressed by GPS or GPS-like observations, and discuss their relevance to existing or planned national Earth-science research programs. The GPS-based ocean reflection experiments performed to date have demonstrated the precision and spatial resolution suitable to altimetric applications that require higher spatial resolution and more frequent repeat than the current radar altimeter satellites. GPS radio occultation is promising as a climate monitoring tool because of its benchmark properties: its raw observable is based on extremely accurate timing measurements. GPS-derived temperature profiles can provide meaningful climate trend information over decadal time scales without the need for overlapping missions or mission-to-mission calibrations. By acquiring data as GPS satellites occult behind the Earth's limb, GPS also provides high vertical resolution information on the vertical structure of electron density with global coverage. New experimental techniques will create more comprehensive TEC maps by using signals reflected from the oceans and received in orbit. This communication will discuss a potential future GNSS Earth Observing System project which would deploy a constellation of satellites using GPS and GPS-like measurements, to obtain a) topography measurements based on GPS reflections with an accuracy and horizontal resolution suitable for eddy monitoring, and h) climate-records quality atmospheric temperature profiles. The constellation would also provide for measurements of ionospheric elec tron density. This is a good example of an <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>mission</b> concept, with broad science objectives of high societal relevance, al l resting on common cost-effective technology...|$|E
40|$|LPSC 14037 Scientific data {{collected}} with modern sensors or dedicated detectors exceed very often {{the perimeter of}} the initial scientific design. These data are obtained more and more frequently with large material and human efforts. A large class of scientific experiments are in fact unique because of their large scale, with very small chances to be repeated and to superseded by new experiments in the same domain: for instance high energy physics and astrophysics experiments involve multi-annual developments and a simple duplication of efforts in order to reproduce old data is simply not affordable. Other scientific experiments are in fact unique by nature: earth science, medical sciences etc. since the collected data is "time-stamped" and thereby non-reproducible by new experiments or observations. In addition, scientific data collection increased dramatically in the recent years, participating to the so-called "data deluge" and inviting for common reflection in the context of "big data" investigations. The new knowledge obtained using these data should be preserved long term such that the access and the re-use are made possible and lead to an enhancement of the initial investment. Data observatories, based on open access policies and coupled with multi-disciplinary techniques for indexing and mining may lead to truly new paradigms in science. It is therefore of outmost importance to pursue a coherent and vigorous approach to preserve the scientific data at long term. The preservation remains nevertheless a challenge due to the complexity of the data structure, the fragility of the custom-made software environments as well as the lack of rigorous approaches in workflows and algorithms. To address this challenge, the PREDON project has been initiated in France in 2012 within the MASTODONS program: a Big Data scientific challenge, initiated and supported by the <b>Interdisciplinary</b> <b>Mission</b> of the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). PREDON is a study group formed by researchers from different disciplines and institutes. Several meetings and workshops lead to a rich exchange in ideas, paradigms and methods. The present document includes contributions of the participants to the PREDON Study Group, as well as invited papers, related to the scientific case, methodology and technology. This document should be read as a "facts finding" resource pointing to a concrete and significant scientific interest for long term research data preservation, as well as to cutting edge methods and technologies to achieve this goal. A sustained, coherent and long term action in the area of scientific data preservation would be highly beneficial...|$|E
