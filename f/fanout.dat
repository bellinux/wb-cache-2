25|$|The {{growth of}} digital {{technologies}} like the microprocessor {{has provided the}} motivation to advance MOSFET technology faster than {{any other type of}} silicon-based transistor. A big advantage of MOSFETs for digital switching is that the oxide layer between the gate and the channel prevents DC current from flowing through the gate, further reducing power consumption and giving a very large input impedance. The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a MOSFET in one logic stage from earlier and later stages, which allows a single MOSFET output to drive a considerable number of MOSFET inputs. Bipolar transistor-based logic (such as TTL) does not have such a high <b>fanout</b> capacity. This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently. That extent is defined by the operating frequency: as frequencies increase, the input impedance of the MOSFETs decreases.|$|E

Under {{the assumptions of}} a Poisson uniform traffic pattern, random packet assigning policy, and random packet scheduling policy, we derive the packet delay and service time under different <b>fanouts.</b> To verify this analysis, extensive simulations are conducted with various <b>fanouts,</b> the numbers of queues, and packet arrival rates. It is shown that the theoretical results agree with the simulation results well. The analysis proves {{that it is possible}} to predict how much the packet delay could be decreased through introducing more input queues per input buffer...|$|R

The SVT is made of five layers of double-sided silicon microstrip detectors covering the polar angles between 17. 2 degrees and 150 degrees (in the Upsilon(4 S) center-of-mass reference frame this corresponds to - 0. 95 < cos theta < 0. 87). Due to mechanical constraints, the strip signals must {{be brought to the}} readout electronics with flexible Upilex circuits (<b>fanouts)</b> where copper traces are deposited with a pitch of approximate to 50 mu m.

This allows the individual fibers to be terminated without splicing, and without needing a protective enclosure such as a splicebox. This is normally an option with fiber distribution cable, or sometimes loose-buffer or ribbon cable, because these types of cable contain multiple strands that are designed for a permanent termination.The ribbon <b>fanout</b> pigtails include: Ribbon cable, <b>Fanout</b> kit, <b>Fanout</b> tubing and Connectors.|$|E

40|$|A latch-based timing {{analyzer}} {{is an essential}} tool for developing high-speed pipeline designs. As process variations increasingly influence the timing characteristics of DSM designs, a {{timing analyzer}} capable of handling process-induced timing variations for latchbased pipeline designs becomes in demand. In this work, we present a static statistical timing analyzer, STAP, for latch-based pipeline designs. Our analyzer propagates statistical worst-case delays as well as critical probabilities across the pipeline stages. We present an efficient method to handle correlations due to reconvergent <b>fanouts.</b> We also demonstrate the impact of not including the analysis of reconvergent <b>fanouts</b> in latch-based pipeline designs. Comparing to a Monte-Carlo based timing analyzer, our experiments show that STAP can accurately evaluate the critical probability that a design violates the timing constraints under a given statistical timing model. The runtime comparison further demonstrates the efficiency of our STAP. 1...|$|R

25|$|With the {{development}} of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) technology, Yannis Tsividis' group at Columbia University has been revisiting analog/hybrid computers design in standard CMOS process. Two VLSI chips have been developed, an 80th-order analog computer (250nm) by Glenn Cowan in 2005 and an 4th-order hybrid computer (65nm) developed by Ning Guo in 2015, both targeting at energy-efficient ODE/PDE applications. Glenn's chip contains 16 macros, {{in which there are}} 25 analog computing blocks, namely integrators, multipliers, <b>fanouts,</b> few nonlinear blocks. Ning's chip contains one macro block, in which there are 26 computing blocks including integrators, multipliers, <b>fanouts,</b> ADCs, SRAMs and DACs. Arbitrary nonlinear function generation is made possible by the ADC+SRAM+DAC chain, where the SRAM block stores the nonlinear function data. The experiments from the related publications revealed that VLSI analog/hybrid computers demonstrated about 1–2 orders magnitude of advantage in both solution time and energy while achieving accuracy within 5%, which points to the promise of using analog/hybrid computing techniques in the area of energy-efficient approximate computing.|$|R

40|$|Absfract- We {{report for}} the first time a {{bidirectional}} opti-cal backplane bus for a high performance system containing nine multi-chip module (MCM) boards, operating at 632. 8 and 1300 nm. The backplane bus reported here employs arrays of multiplexed polymer-based waveguide holograms in conjunction with a waveguiding plate, within which 16 substrate guided waves for 72 (8 x 9) cascaded <b>fanouts,</b> are generated. Data transfer of 1. 2 GbUs at 1. 3 -pm wavelength is demonstrated for a single bus line with 72 cascaded <b>fanouts.</b> Packaging-related issues such as transceiver size and misalignment are embarked upon to provide a reliable system with a wide bandwidth coverage. Theoretical treatment to minimize intensity fluctuations among the nine modules in both directions is further presented and an optimum design rule is provided. The backplane bus demonstrated, is for general-purpose and therefore compatible with such IEEE stan-dardized buses as VMEbus, Futurebus and FASTBUS, and can function as a backplane bus in existing computing environments.

40|$|We {{show that}} the depth of quantum {{circuits}} in the realistic architecture where a classical controller determines which local interactions to apply on the kD grid Z k where k ≥ 2 is the same (up to a constant factor) as in the standard model where arbitrary interactions are allowed. This allows minimum-depth circuits (up to a constant factor) for the nearest-neighbor architecture to be obtained from minimum-depth circuits in the standard abstract model. Our work therefore justifies the standard assumption that interactions can be performed between arbitrary pairs of qubits. In particular, our results imply that Shor’s algorithm, controlled operations and <b>fanouts</b> can be implemented in constant depth, polynomial size and polynomial width in this architecture. We also present optimal non-adaptive quantum circuits for controlled operations and <b>fanouts</b> on a kD grid. These circuits have depth Θ (k √ n), size Θ(n) and width Θ(n). Our lower bound also applies to a more general class of operations...|$|R

40|$|Gate level fault models, {{although}} simplify {{test pattern}} generation and permit to gather different faults into equivalence classes, in some case are unrealistic and may lead to test invalidation since they do {{not take into account}} the physical aspects of the problem. In general all the faults that may affect a circuit may be divided into shorts and opens, a logic test may not be able to detect all the possible shorts and opens. The detectability or not of a fault is strictly tied to physical factors such as layout structure and technology used, since these parameters may determine whether the output of a faulty gate is indeterminate or not. The presence of indeterminate logic values at a faulty gate output is an hard-to-solve problem in high level test generation, because, if the faulty gate has multiple <b>fanouts,</b> it is not guaranteed the fault to propagate along all the <b>fanouts.</b> The necessity of a test strategy closer to the physical nature of a fault has led to the exploitation of curr [...] ...|$|R
