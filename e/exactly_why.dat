5|$|The {{most recent}} {{pandemic}} occurred in 2009, {{but none of}} the last three has caused anything near the devastation seen in 1918. <b>Exactly</b> <b>why</b> the strain of influenza that emerged in 1918 was so devastating is a question that still remains unanswered.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> Thomas {{decided to build}} Dunstanburgh. Although it was located on a strong defensive site, it was {{some distance from the}} local settlements and other strategic sites of value. Thomas held some lands in Northumberland, but they were insignificant in comparison to his other estates in the Midlands and Yorkshire, and until 1313 he had paid them little attention.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} as to <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> John emigrated to Serbia instead of assuming a high-ranking position in Bulgaria, as his ancestry and family ties would suggest. Bulgarian historian Ivan Bozhilov {{is of the}} opinion that John was not seeking political refuge in Serbia. Instead, it is most likely that he moved to that country with the belief that Serbia's territorial expansion and political influence in that period would secure him better career opportunities. Presumably, John accompanied his sister Helena when she moved to Serbia to marry Stephen Dušan in 1332.|$|E

5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. <b>Exactly</b> <b>why</b> he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E
5|$|Tom later {{searches}} Black's office, stealing his gun {{and finding}} Green's name and address. Tom confronts Green at his home, demanding to know where his wife is. The police, who have been watching Green's house, intervene and take Tom home before anyone is harmed. Black apologizes for keeping information from Tom, but warns him that his outburst is <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> he did so. Watts has meanwhile tracked forensic evidence from the abandoned car to a cabin in the woods; blood found there matches both Green and Helen, and a ring is discovered which is identified as Helen's wedding ring.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was {{to look out for}} the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after, the {{religious}} reformers (and protégés of Cromwell) Robert Barnes, William Jerome and Thomas Garret were burned as heretics. Cromwell, meanwhile, {{fell out of}} favour although it is unclear <b>exactly</b> <b>why,</b> for {{there is little evidence}} of differences of domestic or foreign policy. Despite his role, he was never formally accused of being responsible for Henry's failed marriage. Cromwell was now surrounded by enemies at court, with Norfolk also able to draw on his niece's position. Cromwell was charged with treason, selling export licences, granting passports, and drawing up commissions without permission, and may also have been blamed for the failure of the foreign policy that accompanied the attempted marriage to Anne. He was subsequently attainted and beheaded.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{take the}} view that Gregory {{initiated}} the mission, although <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> remains unclear. A famous story recorded by Bede, an 8th-century monk who wrote {{a history of the}} British Church, relates that Gregory saw fair-haired Anglo-Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people. Supposedly Gregory inquired about the identity of the slaves, and was told that they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels. The earliest version of this story is from an anonymous Life of Gregory written at Whitby Abbey about 705. Bede, as well as the Whitby Life of Gregory, records that Gregory himself had attempted to go on a missionary journey to Britain before becoming pope. In 595 Gregory wrote to one of the papal estate managers in southern Gaul, asking that he buy English slave boys in order that they might be educated in monasteries. Some historians have seen this as a sign that Gregory was already planning the mission to Britain at that time, and that he intended to send the slaves as missionaries, although the letter is also open to other interpretations.|$|E

25|$|The third {{possible}} {{approach was}} a very broad view of the First Amendment, one not focused {{on the impact of}} a government victory on the life of a democratic society if prior restraint were granted; but that the publication of just these sorts of materials—governmental misjudgments and misconducts of high import—is <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> the First Amendment exists.|$|E
25|$|There is, however, {{hardly any}} {{agreement}} as to <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> such a murder occurred or {{who was behind}} it. Marlovians say that this confusion arises from scholars asking the wrong question. Instead of {{trying to find out}} why he was killed, they should be asking why those particular people would have met at that particular place on that particular day. The Marlovian theory argues that the most logical reason for that meeting to have taken place would have been to fake his death.|$|E
25|$|The next vassal {{kingdom of}} Mali {{to break away}} was the {{province}} of Jolof. The Wolof inhabitants of this kingdom united under their own emperor and formed the Jolof Empire around 1360 during a succession crisis that followed the death of Mansa Suleyman. It is unknown <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> the Wolof broke away, but the destructive reign of Suleyman’s predecessor and nephew Maghan I {{may have played a}} role in Jolof’s motives if not the very reason why future mansas could not do anything about it.|$|E

25|$|Locomotive {{construction}} {{ended in}} 1965. It is not recorded <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> the works was closed but three facts {{seem to have}} all had an influence on the decision. Firstly the market for new locomotives was shrinking rapidly {{with a number of}} other manufacturers closing around this time. Secondly, most of the USC works were fully equipped with YEC locomotives. Thirdly, nationalisation of the British steel industry was to take place in 1967 and {{it is unlikely that the}} locomotive business was wanted as part of the new corporation.|$|E
25|$|Exactly a {{week after}} his 84th {{birthday}} and while in good health, Denis McLoughlin committed suicide. He used a Colt revolver that {{had been part of}} his reference collection for years and that friends and family thought was non-functioning.

However, he had survived all of the persons dearest to him including his wife, Dorothy, and brother, Colin. Denis and Dorothy had no children.|$|E
25|$|<b>Exactly</b> <b>why</b> males 'comply' {{with this}} aspect of female control over the site of mating is unclear, {{especially}} as male P. cavernis appear {{to be able to}} penetrate the abdomen at a number of points independent of the presence of an ectospermalege. One possibility is that mating outside the ectospermalege reduces female fecundity {{to such an extent that}} the mating male's paternity is significantly reduced... The ectospermalege appears to act as a mating guide, directing the male's copulatory interest, and therefore damage, to a restricted area of the female's abdomen.|$|E

Such an approach {{does not take into account}} the simple fact that Opel prices in the table above always include VAT while Ford prices never include it.

25|$|Riker and Ordeshook {{developed}} the modern understanding of D. They listed five major forms of gratification that people receive for voting: {{complying with the}} social obligation to vote; affirming one's allegiance to the political system; affirming a partisan preference (also known as expressive voting, or voting for a candidate to express support, not to achieve any outcome); affirming one's importance to the political system; and, for those who find politics interesting and entertaining, researching and making a decision. Other political scientists have since added other motivators and questioned some of Riker and Ordeshook's assumptions. All of these concepts are inherently imprecise, {{making it difficult to}} discover <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> people choose to vote.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{inspected}} the Loos area (24 June) and expressed {{dissatisfaction with the}} ground; slag heaps and pit head towers which made good observation points for the Germans. French later did the same and agreed. French and Haig {{would have preferred to}} renew the attack at Aubers Ridge. Joffre was not pleased and called another conference (11 July) to urge a British attack on Loos. Haig pushed for Aubers Ridge again (22 July) – French at first agreed until dissuaded by Foch (29 July), who felt that only a British attack at Loos would pull in enough German reserves to allow the French to take Vimy Ridge. French wrote to Joffre saying he was willing to go along with these plans for the sake of Anglo-French cooperation, but then wrote to Joffre again (10 August) suggesting an artillery bombardment with only limited British infantry attacks. This was not what Joffre wanted. Kitchener, who had been invited to tour the French Army (16–19 August) listened sympathetically to Joffre's suggestion that in future Joffre should set the size, dates and objectives of British offensives, although he only agreed for the Loos attack for the moment. Kitchener met with Haig first and then with French. It is unclear <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> Kitchener and then Haig agreed to go along with Joffre's wishes – possibly the disastrous plight of the Russians, but it may be that a promise that poison gas could be used may have persuaded Haig. Having got their own way, the French then postponed the attack as they picked new attacking ground in Champagne and arranged for extra shelling at Vimy, in both cases because of the very reasons – German-held villages and other obstructions – to which the British generals had objected.|$|E
