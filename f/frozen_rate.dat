50|$|Second, {{customers}} {{would be forced}} to stay on POLR rates for a number of years. During this time, POLR rates would remain frozen at a certain rate. This <b>frozen</b> <b>rate</b> was set between 3% and 7.5% lower than 1999 prices. Some companies, like BGE, had not increased their electricity rates since 1993. Therefore, in this period, {{customers would}} be paying less than for electricity than they had six years prior. Once that time was over, customers could shop for a different supplier and POLR rates would change from the capped rate to the market rate. The amount of time that rates would be frozen varied by company and by customer class (residential, commercial, industrial, etc.). Over a period of 6 years, various customers’ rates became unfrozen without incident. In 2007, however, that changed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{cosmetic}} {{manufacturing process}} requires a mold that is inevitable for mass production. Cosmetic containers {{are one of}} major factors affecting the customer's purchase decision. In addition, the manufacturing cost in cosmetic container comprises {{a large portion of}} the entire product cost. Therefore, a mold satisfying the economical feasibility, aesthetics and functionality is necessary. Among the cosmetic containers, square shape containers have a tendency of having a short shot defect product. The square shaped cosmetic containers are mostly produced as a side gate shape on the two-plate molds. On the other hand, there are two disadvantages, such as gate trace and post processing requirement. The overlap-gateproposed in this study has the characteristics of intaglio gate cutting and no need for post processing. The delivery system of the overlap gate was simulated and compared with the side gate via Moldflow. The improvement in flow, <b>frozen</b> <b>rate,</b> density, and Air trap was confirmed. Based on the simulation results, the mold and performed injection molding was fabricated. In this study, the possibility of the mass production of high aesthetic and functionality cosmeti...|$|E

Fertile eggs obtained from native chicken were incubated for 56 hours to obtain embryo at stage of 14 - 16. PGCs were isolated from the blood using modified Nycodenz Gradient Centrifugation technique.

After the temperature reached - 30 oC, then they were plunged directly into the liquid nitrogen. Recovery rate and viability of PGCs after freezing and thawing were measured. The results of this study showed that the average recovery rate of PGCs that have been <b>frozen</b> at <b>rate</b> of temperature reduction of 1, 0. 5, and 0. 3 oC per minute were 35. 6, 43. 9, and 44. 9 % respectively.

The predominant, functional conformation is characterized by a low turnover <b>rate</b> (<b>frozen</b> state), during which the septins are phosphorylated.

It will concentrate on discussing the gridded text product from the core satellite retrievals. However, all aspects of the GPROF GMI changes in this product are equally appropriate to the other two gridded text products. The GPM mission reprocessed its products in May of 2017 as part of a continuing improvement of precipitation retrievals. This lead to important improvement in the retrievals and therefore also necessitated reprocessing the gridded test products. The V 05 GPROF changes not only improved the retrievals but substantially alerted the format and this compelled changes to the gridded text products. Especially important in this regard is the GPROF 2017 (used in V 05) change from reporting the fraction of the total precipitation rate that occurring as convection or in liquid phase.
