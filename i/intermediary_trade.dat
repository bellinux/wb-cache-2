This paper investigates the tax evasion motive through indirect trade, using Chinese export data at transaction level. We provide strong evidence that, under the partial export VAT rebate policy of China, production firms can effectively evade value-added taxes (VAT) by under-reporting their selling prices to domestic <b>intermediary</b> <b>trading</b> firms, {{especially when they}} sell differentiated products. Even for a moderate level of under-reporting, the revenue loss is close to one billion U. S. dollars.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to evaluate the role and application of Decision Support Systems (DSS) adopted to improve the decision-making capability and visibility of the operations of <b>intermediary</b> <b>trading</b> organisations in upstream commodity supply chains. This research investigates the nature and source of specific challenges associated with upstream commodity supply chains that affect supply chain performance, namely, supply chain governance, access to finance, risk management and operational efficiency. Upstream commodity markets are characterised by high price volatility and low unit value, high risk and lack of visibility. Upstream supply chains are highly complex involving multiple parties, cross-border transactions, information asymmetry and a lack of standardised rules and regulations (Ahumada, 2009). <b>Intermediary</b> commodity <b>trading</b> companies participate as mediators between the supply and demand of commodities worldwide and facilitate the transaction of goods between distant countries which allows them to adopt a key position in managing critical supply chain information and material flows (de Haan et al., 2003). Hence, the performance of intermediaries within the upstream supply chains have great impact on the supply chain overall. Academic literature on DSS, upstream supply chains and intermediation have been reviewed in order to establish a reliable and contextual knowledge base. The relational view provides a theoretical grounding for the work. In order to achieve the research objectives, qualitative multiple case study research was undertaken. The case studies were designed to analyse the changes in the case study company processes and operations before and after the implementation of the DSS, using cross-functional process maps. Three case studies with <b>intermediary</b> <b>trading</b> companies in rubber, coffee and cotton supply chains were undertaken. The research found a positive relationship between DSS adoption and business performance. The findings also reveal a significant mediating effect of DSS on supply chain performance. A triangulation research approach was chosen between collected qualitative data, observation and reviewed literature. Based on this finding and conceptual model, the study has contributed to body of knowledge concerning upstream supply chain practice...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 17th century during the Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1867), the first shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu {{intended}} to subject the kingdom to enable <b>intermediary</b> <b>trade</b> with China, and in 1603 ordered the Ryukyuan king {{to pay his}} respect to the shogunate. As the king did not react, with the instruction of the shogun, the Satsuma feudal domain of Shimazu clan in Kyūshū incorporated some of kingdom's territory during the 1609 Invasion of Ryukyu. They nominally let {{a certain level of}} autonomy and independence to the kingdom due to Ming's prohibition of trade with the shogunate, but forbade them trade with other countries except China. The Amami Islands became part of Shimazu's territory, taxes were imposed, making them subordinate in the relations between Japan and China. Until the invasion, the Shimazu clan lords for four centuries had a vague title of the [...] "Lords of the Twelve Southern Islands" [...] or [...] "Southern Islands", although initially meaning the near Kyushu islands, then covering all the Ryukyu Islands. Later in the 1870s this was used as a [...] "justification" [...] of Japan's sovereignty. From 1609 the Ryukyuan missions to Edo started which lasted until 1850.|$|E
50|$|The sakoku {{policy was}} also a way of {{controlling}} commerce between Japan and other nations, as well as asserting its new place in the East Asian hierarchy. The Tokugawa had set out {{to create their own}} small scale international system where Japan could continue to access the trade in essential commodities such as medicines, and gain access to essential intelligence about happenings in China, while avoiding having to agree to a subordinate status within the Chinese tributary system. Japan's generally constructive official diplomatic relationship with Joseon Korea allowed regular embassies (Tongsinsa) to be dispatched by Korea to Japan. Together with the brisk trade between Tsushima and Korea, as well as the presence of Japanese in Pusan, Japan was able to access Chinese cultural, intellectual and technological developments throughout the Edo period. At the time of the promulgation of the strictest versions of the maritime prohibitions, the Ming dynasty had lost control of much of China and it was unnecessary, and perhaps undesirable, for Japan to pursue official diplomatic relations with either of the Ming or the Qing governments while the issue of imperial legitimacy was unsettled. Japan was able to acquire the imported goods it required through <b>intermediary</b> <b>trade</b> with the Dutch and through the Ryukyu Islands. The Japanese actually encouraged the Ryūkyū Kingdom's rulers to maintain a tributary relationship with China, even though the Shimazu clan had surreptitiously established great political influence in the Ryukyu Islands. The Qing became much more open to trade after it had defeated the Ming loyalists in Taiwan, and thus Japan's rulers felt even less need to establish official relations with China.|$|E

40|$|PresentationPantar Island's coastal {{communities}} {{like many other}} {{coastal communities}} in eastern Indonesia have a high dependency on marine resources for income, food security and other benefits. Fish products (comprising several species of demersal and pelagic species) are particularly valuable (in addition to other products harvested and traded for export markets) as they {{are a source of}} cash income andfood for other coastal and mountain dwelling people in Pantar and neighboring islands. Understanding how the fish trade operates and identifying the interventions that can enhance the position and participation of local communities along the value chain is one approach to improving their livelihoods. This paper examines the fish products traded in Pantar Island, eastern Indonesia through a value chain analysis (VCA). The VCA explores the core processes (e. g. input, production, collection, <b>intermediary</b> <b>trade,</b> wholesale and retail marketing, and consumption) involved and actors (including gendered analysis) who provide services and goods at each point of the value chain. The analysis also identifies the relationships and power differential among actors and how price is determined. The research is based on data collected through focus group discussions with fishers in four villages in Pantar and interviews with local and intermediary traders. The intent was to identify effective pathways to enhance the participation of local producers in the fish product value chain. This paper discusses key issues, potential risks faced by coastal communities, and potential strategies for upgrading of the value chain as one of way to enhance the livelihoods of coastal communities. The results also show how household engagement in the fish trade contributes significantly to household food security...|$|E

40|$|Since market scoring {{rules have}} become popular {{as a form}} of market maker, it seems worth {{reviewing}} just what such mechanisms are intended to do. The main function performed by most market makers is to serve as an intermediary between people who prefer to trade at different times. Traders who have the same favorite times to trade can show up together to an ordinary continuous double auction, and then make and accept offers to trade. But when traders have different favorite times, a market maker can help them by first making offers that some of them will accept, and then later making opposite offers which others will accept. By adjusting prices in his favor, a market maker can even profit from providing this service. By making offers, however, a market maker opens himself up to the risk of losing to informed traders who know more than he about asset values.

40|$|Today, {{with the}} {{prevailing}} global culture {{of modern technology}} and mass media, {{it is almost impossible}} to deal with the issue of cultural identity. Architecture, as such, has not only become a reflection of individuals, but its meanings are often diluted by the disillusioned designers. This is particularly apparent in countries undergoing intensive economic development. Singapore is just one of example of these industrializing nations. Singapore is a relatively young independent city-state with no known natural resources but its people and strategic geographic location. Its key to survival is to plug into the global market. Thus there is no escaping from the reality of global exposure. To keep up with the pace and challenge of today's economic forces, Singapore will have to shift her traditionally <b>intermediary</b> <b>trade</b> pOSition into a main role in the economic arena. To achieve this role, her existing port-city will have to gear-up to internationalize her economy, hence, the hypothetical proposal of a Singapore Trade Center in Boston. The imperative question is, how are we going to present the intrinsic qualities of Singapore in Boston, and at the same time deal with the issues of architectural identity in the present situation? This thesis will begin, firstly, with a discourse into architectural identity for Singapore, and secondly with an exploration into the critical relationship between the building and its context. The design of this trade center can be regarded as a conscious attempt to seek a physical experience pertinent to Singapore's culture in the western environment. The goal of this thesis is to raise the level of awareness in the field of architectural design, while not arriving at a conclusive solution. by Lim, Chai Boon. Thesis (M. Arch.)

40|$|Austria's transit exports (foreign {{exchange}} receipts) totaled AS 90 {{billion in}} 1993, transit imports reached AS 79. 5 billion. The surplus in transit trade was AS 10. 5 billion, {{an order of}} magnitude that has consistently been achieved since 1990. Thus, transit trade is (following tourism) {{one of the most important}} positive items in Austria's current balance, covering about 10 percent of the deficit in the trade balance. Trade mediated by Austrian enterprises in international trade is called transit trade. Austrian enterprises buy merchandise abroad and sell it in a third country. Transactions of this kind are included in the balance of payments but not in the foreign trade statistics. In the past, Austria was mainly active in mediating trade flows between East and West. The demise of the centrally planned economies in the East eliminated important reasons for the existence of transit trade. Nonetheless, the turnover of Austria's transit trade did not drop after the collapse of the Communist systems but has even shown a slight upward trend. Austria's transit trade managed to find new tasks even under vastly changed circumstances. This includes, in particular, mediating foreign trade between the Eastern countries as well as functioning as wholesaler for small and medium-sized private enterprises in Eastern Europe. In 1993, 43 percent of Austria's transit exports were destined for Eastern Europe. The most important buyer was Hungary (11 percent), ahead of Russia (6 ½ percent), the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Poland (each about 5 ½ percent). 33 percent of Austria's transit exports were sold to Western Europe (Germany 13 percent). EFTA's share in 1993 (6 ½ percent) was only half as high as in 1982. 22 percent of goods in transit went to developing countries, with East-Asia an important market. Almost half of transit imports originated in Western Europe, with Germany (17 percent) the most important supplier. Almost one third of the transit merchandise was imported from the Eastern countries, mainly Russia (8 percent) and Hungary (6 percent). Merchandise from developing countries accounted for 15. 6 percent in 1993. The value of trade flows mediated by Austrian firms between the various regions can only be estimated. In 1993, West-East transit trade may have totaled some AS 25 billion, and East-West transit trade AS 11 to 12 billion. Intra-East transit trade and trade from the East to developing countries each amounted to between AS 7 and 8 billion. Hungary's statistics on <b>intermediary</b> <b>trade</b> with the Eastern countries yield rough estimates of the size of Austria's transit trade in intra-Eastern trade. About 30 percent of Hungary's exports to the Eastern countries and about 30 percent of Hungary's imports from the Eastern countries were mediated by third countries in 1991 and 1992. Transit trade has evolved in market economies as an instrument to surmount trade barriers. This suggests that Austria's role as middleman between the successor states of the Soviet Union and some successor states of Yugoslavia and the West, Eastern Europe, and the developing countries might not diminish but even increase in the near future. Austria's role in mediating trade between East-Central Europe and the West and also within East-Central Europe is likely to be maintained, however, only if transit trade takes on additional functions.

2500|$|Bezanozano society {{reached its}} golden {{age in the}} 18th century, acting as <b>intermediaries</b> in <b>trade</b> between the Merina in the {{highlands}} and the European and Arab slave traders and merchants that landed along the east coast. Occasionally Bezanozano villagers would negotiate directly with French traders; some of these were captured and sold into slavery themselves. This <b>intermediary</b> <b>trading</b> role allowed the Bezanozano to amass considerable wealth in slaves and cattle. Some of this wealth was gained by engaging in slave raids in the communities in the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina, which was then {{in the throes of}} a destabilizing civil war. The town of Moramanga became a major hub of Bezanozano trade. [...] The population of slaves owned by the Bezanozano had grown so large by the mid-18th century that in 1768 a slave rebellion erupted; the Bezanozano solicited the aid of Europeans to put it down. To further strengthen their economic position, the Bezanozano entered into an alliance with the powerful Betsimisaraka Kingdom to the east. They were in regular enough economic relations with Europeans that they were able to offer Spanish piastres in addition to slaves in exchange for the guns provided by European traders. The villages neighboring Bezanozano territory were in many instances invited to assist in transporting Bezanozano trade goods because the demand for Bezanozano services exceeded the manpower available to satisfy it. In the late 18th century the Bezanozano were spread out over a territory twice the size of the area they consider their homeland today, extending from Angavokely in the west to the Betsimisaraka cliffs to the east, and southward to around twelve kilometers beyond Beparasy. The first and only Bezanozano king, Randrianjomoina, emerged around this time.|$|R
