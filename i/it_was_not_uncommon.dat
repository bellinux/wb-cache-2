5|$|Between World War I and World War II, the Auxois was {{the pride}} of {{regional}} farmers. Before the advent of motorization, it was the preferred pulling animal, even for slow work, winning out over the local Charolais cattle breed used as oxen. The Auxois was bred solely for agricultural work, and used exclusively for this purpose. The strongest horses were used for multi-horse hitches {{in the fields and}} for logging. The Auxois competed in popularity with the Nivernais horse, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> for farmers in the region to have both the black-coated Nivernais and the red-coated Ardennais and Auxois to satisfy the color preferences of all potential buyers.|$|E
5|$|Each team in {{the league}} has a manager, who is {{responsible}} for team strategy and leadership on and off the field. Assisted by various coaches, the manager sets the line-up and starting pitcher before each game, and makes substitutions throughout the game.

5|$|Courtly {{love was}} the eroticisation of love between the nobility. Emphasis {{was placed on}} {{restraint}} between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments, where knights would fight wearing a token from their lady, {{it could also be}} private and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other, although the man might be married to someone else. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous– Henry I of England had over 20bastards for instance– but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.|$|E

5|$|The ZX81 {{was also}} sold {{for a while}} in {{duty-free}} shops at UK airports. However, this fell foul of government export restrictions aimed at preventing the Soviet bloc countries from obtaining Western high technology goods. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> for visitors from the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries to pick up gadgets in Western countries with the aim of transferring their technology to their own states' industries. In 1983 the government ordered that the ZX81s were to be withdrawn from sale at airports. There was no such restriction on sales to communist China and in November 1983 Sinclair Research announced that it had signed an agreement to export ZX81 kits to a factory in Guangzhou, where they would be assembled for the Chinese market.|$|E

5|$|The {{eastern part}} of the hill fort {{remained}} in use for at least the first few decades of the Roman occupation, although the duration and nature of habitation is uncertain. Many 1st-century Roman artefacts have been discovered near the east entrance and in the centre of the hill fort. It has been suggested that Maiden Castle was occupied as a Roman military outpost or fort and the settlement discontinued, as there is no known fort in the area and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> for hill forts in the southwest to have been occupied by Roman forces. This was a characteristic of Vespasian's campaign in the region; there was military occupation at Cadbury Castle in Somerset, Hembury in Devon, and Hodd Hill in Dorset.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine {{moving to a}} strange place where {{she does not know}} the local {{language}} is replicated in Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). The heroine has a dilemma; because she does not know the language in Delhi she can barely socialise with local people, and she is at loggerheads with the only person with whom she can relate. According to Rangan, the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is the first instance in Tamil cinema where a man invites a woman for a cup of coffee. He compared it to Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam said that he was inspired by the Doors and the Beatles and, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> to invite a woman for a cup of coffee, it was not reflected in the Tamil cinema of the time.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> {{for wealthy}} or {{powerful}} families {{to facilitate the}} construction of large temple complexes, usually by donating {{a portion of their}} family estate to a Buddhist sect. Often the land already contained buildings that could be re-purposed for religions use. The Fei (費) family of the town of Jinze, located just west of Shanghai, converted a mansion on their property into a Buddhist sutra-recitiation hall, and later built several other religious buildings around the hall. This spurred a boom in temple construction in the area, causing Jinze to become a major center of the White Lotus sect of Buddhism, which in turn spurred the construction of more temples and lead the town to become a significant location within the Song. The nearby town of Nanxiang gained prominence shortly {{after the fall of the}} Song in large part to the construction of temples and other religious buildings, which spanned the entire Song empire.|$|E

5|$|The 48th Panzer Corps {{had fewer}} than 100 {{serviceable}} modern tanks to combat Soviet armor. Furthermore, they lacked fuel, and {{the shortage of}} tanks forced commanders to organize tank crews into infantry companies; the 22nd Panzer Division, which formed part of the corps, was almost completely destroyed in the fighting that ensued. The 22nd had entered the fighting with fewer than thirty working tanks, and left with a company of tanks. The Romanian 1st Armored Division, attached to the 48th Panzer Corps, engaged the Soviet 26th Tank Corps after having lost communications with their German corps commanders, and were defeated by 20 November. As the Soviets continued to advance southwards, many Soviet tank crews began to suffer from the worsening blizzard, which affected men and equipment, and blocked gunsights. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> for tanks to lose traction on the ground, and for a crew member to have an arm broken as he was thrown around inside the hull. However, the blizzard also neutralized the German corps' coordination.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and {{asked him why he}} had broken up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him she wanted to talk about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy {{recalled}} the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E
