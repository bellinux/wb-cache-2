60|$|The Pussum sat near to Gerald, and {{she seemed}} to become soft, subtly to infuse herself into his bones, as if she were passing into him in a black, <b>electric</b> <b>flow.</b> Her being suffused into his veins like a {{magnetic}} darkness, and concentrated {{at the base of his}} spine like a fearful source of power. Meanwhile her voice sounded out reedy and nonchalant, as she talked indifferently with Birkin and with Maxim. Between her and Gerald was this silence and this black, electric comprehension in the darkness. Then she found his hand, and grasped it in her own firm, small clasp. It was so utterly dark, and yet such a naked statement, that rapid vibrations ran through his blood and over his brain, he was no longer responsible. Still her voice rang on like a bell, tinged with a tone of mockery. And as she swung her head, her fine mane of hair just swept his face, and all his nerves were on fire, as with a subtle friction of electricity. But the great centre of his force held steady, a magnificent pride to him, at the base of his spine.|$|E
60|$|But love {{is really}} blind. Without sight or scent or hearing the {{powerful}} magnetic current vibrates from the hypogastric plexus in the female, vibrating {{on to the}} air like some intense wireless message. And there is immediate response from the sacral ganglion in some male. And then sight and day-consciousness begin to fade. In the lower animals apparently any male can receive the vibration of any female: and if need be, even across long distances of space. But the higher the development the more individual the attunement. Every wireless station can only receive those messages which are in its own vibration key. So with sex in specialized individuals. From the powerful dynamic center the female sends out her dark summons, the intense dark vibration of sex. And according to her nature, she receives her responses from the males. The male enters the magnetic field of the female. He vibrates helplessly in response. There is established at once a dynamic circuit, more or less powerful. It would seem as if, while ever life remains free and wild and independent, the sex-circuit, while it lasts, is omnipotent. There is one <b>electric</b> <b>flow</b> which encompasses one male and one female, or one male and one particular group of females all polarized in the same key of vibration.|$|E

Firstly, the combined flow field where the cellular secondary motion occured owing to the field's interaction was characterized in conjunction with the bulk flow velocity and the electric field strength.

40|$|Reasons of {{development}} of life-threatening arrhythmias {{that lead to}} sudden and total death in cases of cardiovascular diseases are still unclear, though cardiac research of this problem is conducted throughout the world. Damage of connective tissues insulation cover of the heart’s conductive pathways with oxidation of ectopic nodes can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias.

Accordingly, treatment of such patients should change, and consequently should reduce the total number of sudden deaths due to cardiovascular diseases. The speed of electricity conduction from the heart to the nervous system and its distribution throughout the body remains underestimated. Slowdown of electric magnetic induction (acceleration) between the heart and the central nervous system as well as slowdown of its distribution results in insufficient speed of <b>electric</b> <b>flow</b> and reduction of bioelectric processes of the body.
