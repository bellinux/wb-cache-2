50|$|One <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{isometry}} group, applying {{in every}} dimension, is that generated by inversion in a point. An n-dimensional parallelepiped is <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object invariant under such an inversion.|$|R

5|$|There are {{two types}} of geysers: {{fountain}} geysers which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, is an <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, is an <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fountain geyser.|$|E

50|$|Francis Webb of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) built 282 <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{compound}} 0-8-0 locomotive between 1892 and 1904. <b>A</b> further 290 <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simple expansion version {{were built}} by his successor between 1910 and 1922.|$|R

5|$|A late {{piece of}} Elgar's, the Nursery Suite, {{was an early}} <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> studio premiere: its first {{performance}} was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, dedicated to the wife and daughters of the Duke of York, Elgar once again drew on his youthful sketch-books.|$|E
5|$|An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{developing}} nation establishing its own {{model of}} emergency medicine {{may be seen}} in southern Brazil. Elements of both of the major conventional models have been incorporated, with the EMS system following French influences and the ambulances being staffed by physicians, while an American approach to emergency medical residency training is also present.|$|E
50|$|Hence, {{self-determination}} {{has been}} held to be <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> advancement <b>of</b> the fundamental political rights of politically bounded 'peoples' at work, but also as <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> abstract theory that has been implemented in contexts with sometimes severe political and national conflict.|$|R

5|$|An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{non-agricultural}} calendar is the Tzolk'in {{calendar of}} the Maya civilization of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, {{which is a}} cycle of 260 days. This count {{is based on an}} earlier calendar and is found throughout Mesoamerica. This formed part of a more comprehensive system of Maya calendars which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.|$|E
5|$|An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{processed}} {{pizza cheese}} is Provel, which uses Cheddar, Swiss, and Provolone cheeses as flavorants. Some analogue types {{are made with}} casein, a by-product of milk, and vegetable oil, rather than milk fat. Casein-based Mozzarella-like imitation processed cheeses prepared using rennet are also used as a Mozzarella substitute on frozen pizzas.|$|E
5|$|An old {{qualitative}} {{test for}} the presence of the alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin with some of the dibromoalkane also produced. The reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic bromonium intermediate. This is an <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> halogen addition reaction.|$|E

50|$|In {{the more}} general case where V is {{hypothesized}} to be a Banach space, there is <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> operator without an invariant subspace due to Per Enflo (1976). <b>A</b> concrete <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> operator without an invariant subspace was produced in 1985 by Charles Read.|$|R

5|$|Another <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{divergent}} electron {{transport chain}} is the alternative oxidase, which {{is found in}} plants, {{as well as some}} fungi, protists, and possibly some animals. This enzyme transfers electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, Linwood House {{was a rare}} <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> late Georgian / Regency style {{house in}} Canterbury. It had {{historical}} importance {{as one of the}} oldest surviving houses in Christchurch. The building's association with Joseph Brittan and especially William Rolleston made it socially important.|$|E
5|$|Attempts at {{crossing}} species, whether from different sections or {{within the same}} section, of Erythranthe are not always successful. E. peregrina is an <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful naturally occurring hybrid that not only arose independently in two different locations, but is also a rare example of evolutionary recent allopolyploidization, complete chromosomal inheritance.|$|E

5|$|Eventually comics {{appeared}} {{aimed at}} a gay audience: the first documented <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> widely circulated underground gay comic was Gay Heart Throbs, which produced several issues in the mid-1970s, but struggled to find an audience.|$|E
