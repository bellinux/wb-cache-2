2500|$|There {{are three}} [...] "pillars" [...] of the UK pension system, which aim to ensure dignity and a <b>fair</b> <b>income</b> in retirement. The first pillar {{is the state}} pension, {{administered}} by the government, and funded by National Insurance contributions. The third pillar is private, or [...] "personal pensions", which individuals buy themselves. The second pillar, and deriving from the contract of employment, is occupational pensions. Traditionally, these came from a collective agreement, or from an employer setting one up. The Pensions Act 2008 gives every [...] "jobholder" [...] (defined as a worker, age 16 to 75, with wages between £5,035 and £33,540) {{the right to be}} automatically enrolled by the employer in an occupational pension, unless the jobholder chooses to opt out. This is a simple [...] "defined contribution" [...] scheme: whatever the jobholder contributes, they get out. Although collectively invested, benefits are individualised, meaning the risk of living longer and running out of money grows. To reduce administration costs, a non-departmental trust fund called the National Employment Savings Trust was established as a [...] "public option" [...] competing with private asset managers. Employers set aside an agreed percentage of jobholders' wages, and negotiate how much they will contribute. This is particularly important for people who do not created a union and collective bargained for an occupational pension. Collectively bargained pensions are often better, and historically had [...] "defined benefits": on retirement, people receive money based either on their final salary, or a career average of earnings {{for the rest of their}} lives. Living longer does not become an individual risk, but is collectivised among all contributors. In principle, the rules for pension trusts differ from ordinary law of trusts as pensions are not gifts and people pay for their benefits through their work. Pensions operating through contracts also engender mutual trust and confidence in the employment relationship. An employer is under a duty to inform their staff about how to make the best of their pension rights. Moreover, workers must be treated equally, on grounds of gender or otherwise, in their pension entitlements. The management of a pension trust must be partly codetermined by the pension beneficiaries, so that a minimum of one third of a trustee board are elected or [...] "member nominated trustees". The Secretary of State has the power by regulation, as yet unused, to increase the minimum up to one half. Trustees are charged with the duty to manage the fund in the best interests of the beneficiaries, in a way that reflects their preferences, by investing the savings in company shares, bonds, real estate or other financial products.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the {{relation}} between the real option accounting and the fair value accounting, and describe the calculation method of the <b>fair</b> value <b>income.</b> The followings are stated: (1) Current cost, sale value, and present value are the special concepts of fair value, and real option value is the general concept. (2) The method of preparing a fair value balance sheet is to calculate corporate value by present value accounting first, then calculate corporate value by real option accounting, and prepare the fair value balance sheet based on these proceedings. (3) There are general approach and individual approach as the method of calculating <b>fair</b> value <b>income,</b> and the difference between both <b>fair</b> value <b>incomes</b> is the change of the good will in one period. (4) The general approach is the real option accounting, and this accounting can calculate the true income of a corporation.

This public goods institution exploits the idea that people are conditionally cooperative (i. e., they match at least the minimum contribution of the others) rather than opportunistic in order to implement the Pareto-optimal outcome.

For 2002, the IMR and U 5 MR in Taiwan were 6 ‰ and 8 ‰, respectively, both ranking 20 th among 21 industrialized countries. In explaining cross-national differentials in child mortality, we found that Gini coefficient, an indicator of income inequality, was positively associated with IMR and U 5 MR, and that social expenditure was negatively associated with U 5 MR. Our study shows that prevention of child mortality in Taiwan has not yet reached the highest attainable standard, and underscores the importance of a <b>fairer</b> <b>income</b> distribution and social investment in child health care.
