This ground and the path leading from it to the temple nearby, was out of bounds to those of the lower rungs of the society. A change in this law came about only after the Temple <b>Entry</b> <b>Declaration.</b>|$|E

40|$|Today {{logistic}} {{systems are}} business document based, e. g. processing ship manifest, load lists, declarations, and shipping instructions. Business processes are organized in handling these business {{documents in the}} context of framework contracts with business partners. Implementations of new requirements like the <b>Entry</b> Summary <b>Declaration</b> 24 hours before the goods are actually loaded on a vessel are therefore difficult to implement in those systems. Furthermore, these systems have difficulties in configuring business processes in a dynamic environment in which processes are configured for one specific business transaction. This paper proposes a high level logistic process modeling environment supporting logistic services according the business document choreography defined for these services...|$|R
50|$|From manuscripts left by Levinz was {{published}} in 1702 a folio volume of reports in French (with an English translation chiefly by Salkeld); it reappeared under the title, The Reports of Sir Creswell Levinz, Knight, London, 1722, 2 vols. fol. A third edition in English only, revised by Thomas Vickers, {{was published}} at Dublin in 1793-7, 3 vols. 8vo. Levinz also compiled A Collection of Select and Modern <b>Entries</b> of <b>Declarations,</b> Pleadings, Issues, Verdicts, Judgments, &c., referring to the Cases in Sir Creswell Levinz's Reports, {{the judgment of the}} Court being added to each President (sic), which {{was published in}} London in 1702, fol. There has been some division of opinion among English judges as to Levinz's merits as a reporter.|$|R
40|$|Since 9 / 11, the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) was an {{initiative}} to increase container security. Through the <b>Entry</b> Summary <b>Declaration</b> (ENS), authorities require shipping lines to timely submit {{data to the}} first port of call in the EC [...] However, an ENS contains insufficient data for proper risk analysis. This paper presents an IT infrastructure to capture so-called upstream data that allows customs to match delivery - with container data. It proposes Semantic Web technology for secure, global trade, with a gradual migration strategy of all stakeholders. In its final stage, only export and import declaration based on commercial documents is required; all other data can be captured by various authorities for risk analysis. Transport security will increase, whilst the administrative burden will decrease...|$|R
50|$|The {{paperless}} {{computer system}} has substantially curtailed processing period which has in turn reduced {{cost of doing}} business. This has not only simplified a number of procedures, but also brought transparency (less interaction with the customs staff) and certainly more revenues for the exchequer. Needless to mention that in the redundant system each bill of <b>entry</b> (goods <b>declaration)</b> for imports required 34 signatures & 62 verifications. Furthermore, multiple copies and numerous mandatory documents were required to be attached with the GD. All these documents were carried from desk to desk by the importer. For shipping lines various documents had to be submitted to many customs offices. Several customs offices {{were involved in the}} process {{depending on the type of}} GD i.e., imports, temporary imports, exports, warehousing, baggage etc.|$|R
5000|$|In 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed {{that the}} Declaration had been signed on July 4, {{pointing}} out that some signers were not present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date. [...] "No person signed it on that day nor for many days after", he later wrote. His claim gained support when the Secret Journals of Congress were published in 1821. The Secret Journals contained two previously unpublished <b>entries</b> about the <b>Declaration.</b>|$|R
25|$|Shares {{had been}} issued {{in the names}} of Peto, Betts, Crampton and their acquaintances, and the LCDR {{accounts}} written up to make it look as though either the associated cash payment had been made directly to Peto and Betts to fund the construction of the line, or the money, having been paid to the railway company, had temporarily been lent back to the new shareholders. In fact, no cash had changed hands at all, but on the strength of these fictitious <b>entries,</b> the statutory <b>declaration</b> was made before a justice of the peace and authority given to raise loans.|$|R
50|$|SBA Customs control tax-free imports at the {{airports}} and the crossing points within the territory by regulating {{the value and}} amount of goods such as cigarettes or alcohol that can be carried through the control and <b>entry</b> points without <b>declaration.</b> The main airport is RAF Akrotiri which has regular flights {{to and from the}} UK and the Middle East. The SBAs in Cyprus also provide the opportunity for a stop off point for 36 hours for soldiers that have recently experienced combat to participate in decompression activity before returning home. In April 2004 over 100,000 cigarettes were seized and the largest isolated attempt to smuggle cigarettes involved a Turkish Cypriot man from Lapithos, who tried to smuggle a total of 29,200 across the Pergamos checkpoint near Larnaca.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{targeted}} on {{the area}} of modernization of customs clearance in the EU and the Czech Republic {{is focused on the}} specification of the systems and procedures used in the modernization of customs clearance when the electronic customs declaration is used. Mainly about the status of transition from the paper declaration to the electronic paperless customs declaration, not only in the Czech Republic but throughout the European Union. Assessment data is carried out primarily for the period between the years 2012 to 2014, in some cases, for better assessments, in the period between the years 2009 to 2014. The thesis is focused on the evaluation of the situation with modernisation the customs clearance in the Czech Republic and comparing the results between chosen EU member states and the Czech Republic. The usage of the electronic <b>Entry</b> Summary <b>Declarations</b> and Exit Summary Declarations have increased several times in last two years. Implementation of systems for lodgement and processing of customs declarations for more effective and efficient control of goods within the EU member states has also very fast growing trend with very low error rate. The rate of electronically lodged customs declarations is reaching in most of the EU member states almost 100 %. Numbers of customs declarations lodged within the simplified procedures in chosen EU member states is more or less stable. The last part of my thesis contains the benefits for business community {{as well as for the}} state administratio...|$|R
40|$|States with {{additional}} protocols [1] to comprehensive safeguards agreements in force are required under Article 2. a. (iii) {{to submit to}} the IAEA a map for each site. As the current guidelines [2] do not specify a special format for the map submission, they are typically delivered in a variety of formats. Using modern geographic information systems (GIS) to assist with the site map creation and annual updates, a joint Member State Support Programme (MSSP) task on Digital Declaration Site Maps (DDSM) is investigating how the submission procedures could be improved in line with new Information Technology (IT) infrastructure and software developments at the IAEA. Specifically, this includes the Protocol Reporter 3 (PR 3) and the Geospatial Exploitation System (GES) software. This paper provides an overview of some of the activities under the MSSP task, including the typical submission process beginning with the creation of an operatorâ€™s site map through the submission process cycle for the annual updates using Protocol Reporter or the Commission's Additional Protocol Editor (CAPE) software. To demonstrate how site maps are created by operators and how these new procedures might benefit operators, State or regional authorities (SRA) and the IAEA, this paper will document some of the common challenges in converting site maps from paper maps to digital GIS data formats. It will also address the preparation of site <b>entries</b> and <b>declarations</b> using the Protocol Reporter software for the submission to the IAEA...|$|R
