25|$|MIPS is {{a reduced}} {{instruction}} set computer (RISC) <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> <b>architecture</b> (<b>ISA)</b> developed by MIPS Technologies (formerly MIPS Computer Systems). The early MIPS architectures were 32-bit, with 64-bit versions added later. There are multiple versions of MIPS: including MIPS I, II, III, IV, and V; {{as well as}} five releases of MIPS32/64 (for 32- and 64-bit implementations, respectively). As of April 2017, the current version is MIPS32/64 Release 6. MIPS32/64 primarily differs from MIPS IV by defining the privileged kernel mode System Control Coprocessor in addition to the user mode architecture.|$|E

2500|$|A reduced {{instruction}} set computer, or RISC (pronounced 'risk', [...] ), is one whose <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> <b>architecture</b> (<b>ISA)</b> has {{a set of}} attributes that allows it to have a lower cycles per instruction (CPI) than a complex {{instruction set}} computer (CISC). Various suggestions have been made regarding a precise definition of RISC, but the general concept is that of a computer that has a small set of simple and general instructions, rather than a large set of complex and specialized instructions. Another common RISC trait is their load/store architecture, where memory is only accessed through specific instructions, rather than as a part of most instructions.|$|E

This paper presents improvements {{that have been made}} to our methodology for soundly decompiling machine-code programs to functions expressed in HOL logic. These advancements have been facilitated by the development of a domain specific language, called L 3, for the specification of <b>Instruction</b> <b>Set</b> <b>Architectures</b> (<b>ISAs).</b> As a result of these improvements, decompilation is faster (on average by one to two orders of magnitude), the <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> specifications are easier to write, and the proof tools are easier to maintain...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} method to {{precisely}} model implementations of <b>Instruction</b> <b>Set</b> <b>Architectures</b> (<b>ISA)</b> using term rewriting systems (TRS). Our method facilitates understanding of important micro-architectural differences without delving into low-level implementation details. More importantly, the use of TRS allows us to prove rigorously the equivalence of different implementations. We first define AX, a simple RISC ISA, by specifying its operational semantics using a simple in-order execution model. We then give an AX implementation which uses register renaming and permits out-of-order instruction execution. The equivalence of the two models is proved by showing that the two TRS's can simulate each other. 1 Introduction Modern microprocessors embody increasingly complex micro-architectures to achieve high performance. Optimization techniques such as out-of-order and speculative execution, write buffers and split-phase bus transactions, can make the semantics of certain instructions difficult [...] ...|$|R

PEUF is an extension of the logic of Equality with Uninterpreted Functions, introduced by Burch and Dill [4], that allows us to use distinct constants for the data operands and instruction addresses needed in the symbolic expression for the correctness criterion. We present several techniques that make PEUF scale very efficiently for the verification of pipelined microprocessors with large ISAs.

50|$|A general {{protection}} fault (GPF) in the Intel x86 and AMD x86-64 <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> <b>architectures</b> (<b>ISAs),</b> {{as well as}} other ISAs, is a fault (a type of interrupt) initiated by ISA-defined protection mechanisms in response to an access violation caused by some running code, either in the kernel or a user program. The mechanism is first described in Intel manuals and datasheets for the 80286 CPU, which was introduced in 1983; it is also described in section 9.8.13 in the Intel 80386 programmer's reference manual from 1986. A {{general protection}} fault is implemented as an interrupt (vector number 13 in decimal) in both the x86 and the AMD64 architectures. Some operating systems may also classify some exceptions not related to access violations, such as illegal opcode exceptions, as general protection faults, even though they {{have nothing to do with}} memory protection.|$|R
30|$|The {{recently}} proposed reactive processing architectures {{are characterized}} by <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> <b>architectures</b> (<b>ISAs)</b> that directly support reactive control fow including concurrency and preemption. These architectures provide efficient execution platforms for reactive synchronous programs; however, they do require novel compiler technologies, notably {{with respect to the}} handling of concurrency. Another key quality of the reactive architectures is that they have very predictable timing properties, which make it feasible to analyze their worst-case reaction time (WCRT). We present an approach to compile programs written in the synchronous language Esterel onto a reactive processing architecture that handles concurrency via priority-based multithreading. Building on this compilation approach, we also present a procedure for statically determining tight, safe upper bounds on the WCRT. Experimental results indicate the practicality of this approach, with WCRT estimates to be accurate within 22 % on average.|$|R

The shared codes in a MPI program (MPI library function call) are treated by executing local libraries, and the other parts are done by dynamic binary translation. Also, {{during the course of}} dealing with local library functions, we propose a method of program flow redirection by designing two algorithms along with hierarchically encapsulating local libraries.

40|$|Introduction The {{importance}} of multimedia processing on generalpurpose computing platforms has prompted processor designers to add multimedia instructions to microprocessor <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> <b>architectures</b> (<b>ISAs).</b> These include MAX- 2 for the PA-RISC architecture [1], MMX, SSE and SSE- 2 for the Intel IA- 32 architecture [2], and a superset of these to the Itanium IA- 64 architecture [3]. Although these multimedia instructions {{may be very}} effective, they still incur the overhead of their base microprocessor ISA. PLX [4] is a new ISA designed from scratch for fast and efficient multimedia processing. Prior work has demonstrated its effectiveness for integer media applications [4]. This paper describes the new floating-point ISA for PLX version 1. 3, designed to enable support for very fast 3 D graphics.

40|$|Many {{embedded}} {{systems such as}} digital cameras, digital radios, high resolution printers, cellular phones, etc. involve heavy use of signal processing and are thus based on Digital Signal Processors (DSPs). DSPs such as the TMS 320 C 2 x and the DSP 5600 x have irregular data-paths that typically result due to application specic needs (such as chaining multiply-accumulate operations, etc). Efficient code generation for such embedded DSP processors is a challenging problem.

40|$|Abstract. Microfluidic {{devices are}} {{emerging}} as an attractive technology for automatically orchestrating the reactions needed in a biological computer. Thousands of microfluidic primitives {{have already been}} integrated on a single chip, and recent trends indicate that the hardware complexity is increasing at rates comparable to Moore’s Law. As {{in the case of}} silicon, it will be critical to develop abstraction layers—such as programming languages and <b>Instruction</b> <b>Set</b> <b>Architectures</b> (<b>ISAs)</b> —that decouple software development from changes in the underlying device technology. Towards this end, this paper presents BioStream, a portable language for describing biology protocols, and the Fluidic ISA, a stable interface for microfluidic chip designers. A novel algorithm translates microfluidic mixing operations from the BioStream layer to the Fluidic ISA. To demonstrate the benefits of these abstraction layers, we build two microfluidic chips that can both execute BioStream code despite significant differences at the device level. We consider this to be an important step towards building scalable biological computers. ...|$|R
