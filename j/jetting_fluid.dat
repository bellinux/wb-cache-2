40|$|Literature {{regarding}} {{the influence of}} inlet conditions on cooling hole flows is reviewed. A general failure to fully quantify inlet conditions and an inconsistent terminology for describing them is noted. This paper argues for use of an inlet velocity ratio (IVR) defined as {{the ratio of the}} coolant passage velocity to the jet velocity, together with additional parameters required to define the velocity distribution in the coolant supply passage. Large scale experimental investigations of the internal flow field for a laterally expanded 50 times scale fan-shaped hole are presented, together with a computational investigation of the flow, for three inlet velocity ratios. Inlet lip separation causes a jetting effect that extends throughout the length of the cooling hole. A low velocity region of separated fluid exists on the downstream wall of the diffuser which deflects the <b>jetting</b> <b>fluid</b> towards the upstream side of the hole. This effect is most pronounced at low IVR values. The exit velocity profiles and turbulence distributions are highly dependent on the IVR...|$|E

Nevertheless, the role of high-pressure vapor–liquid equilibria, <b>jet</b> <b>fluid</b> dynamics and mass transfer in determining particle size and morphology is still debated. In this work, CO 2 has been adopted as supercritical antisolvent and elastic light {{has been used to}} acquire information on <b>jet</b> <b>fluid</b> dynamics using thin wall injectors for the investigation of the liquid solvents acetone and DMSO at operating conditions of 40 °C in the pressure range between 6 and 16 MPa. The results show that two-phase mixing after jet break-up is the phenomenon that characterizes the <b>jet</b> <b>fluid</b> dynamics at subcritical conditions. When SAS is performed at supercritical conditions a transition between multi-phase and single-phase mixing is observed by increasing the operating pressure. Single-phase mixing is due to the very fast disappearance of the interfacial tension between the liquid solvent and the fluid phase in the precipitator. The transition between these two phenomena depends on the operating pressure, but also on the viscosity and the surface tension of the solvent. Indeed, single-phase mixing has been observed for acetone very near the mixture critical point, whereas DMSO showed a progressive transition for pressures of about 12 MPa. In {{the second part of the}} work, a solute was added to DMSO to study the morphology of the microparticles formed during SAS precipitation at the different process conditions, to find a correlation between particle morphology and the observed jet. Expanded microparticles were obtained working at subcritical conditions; whereas spherical microparticles were obtained operating at supercritical conditions up to the pressure where the transition between multi- and single-phase mixing was observed.

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel method for making instantaneous, quantitative, planar measurements of fluid mixed {{at the molecular}} level in gaseous flows. The method relies on the effective oxygen quenching of the phosphorescence of luminescent tracers, such as acetone and biacetyl. The tracers fluorescence emission is used to obtain information about the passive scalar, regardless of its molecular mixing state, whereas the phosphorescence emission from the same tracer displays mixing-state-dependant behavior and reveals the presence of moleculary-unmixed fluid. By combining the information from both fluorescence and phosphorescence signals, the instantaneous, quantitative measurements of molecularly-mixed fluid fraction can be obtained at each pixel of the detector. This method accomplishes the same objectives as the dual-tracer LIF method of King et al. (1997, 1999), but with a single tracer and a much reduced burden on the instrumentation and experimental setup. The new technique is demonstrated in a study of mixing in a forced acetone-seeded nitrogen jet discharging into ambient air.

40|$|Abstract. Different {{methods of}} cutting fluid {{application}} are used on turning of a difficult-to-machine steel (SAE EV- 8). A semi-synthetic cutting fluid was applied using a conventional method, minimum quantity of cutting fluid (MQCF), and pulverization. By the minimum quantity method was also applied a lubricant of vegetable oil (MQL). Thereafter, a cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> under high pressure (3. 0 MPa) was singly {{applied in the}} following regions: chip-tool interface; top surface of the chip; and tool-workpiece contact. Two other methods were used: an interflow between conventional application and chip-tool interface jet and, finally, three jets simultaneously applied. In order to carry out these tests, {{it was necessary to}} set up a high pressure system using a piston pump for generating a cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>jet,</b> a Venturi for fluid application (MQCF and MQL), and a nozzle for cutting fluid pulverization. The output variables analyzed included tool life, surface roughness, cutting tool temperature, cutting force, chip form, chip compression rate and machined specimen microstructure. It can be observed that the tool life increases and the cutting force decreases with the application of cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>jet,</b> mainly when it is directed to the chip-tool interface.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{discharge}} of a vertical round jet into an unsteady cross-flow that consists of a mean flow and a sinusoidally oscillating component. An experimental technique is devised to simulate the unsteady cross-flow situation in the laboratory. A vertical jet-pipe-nozzle assembly is physically oscillated backward and forward in the steady flow stream of a laboratory flume, and the flow patterns are viewed by an observer moving with the jet. Dispersion patterns of the dye-marked <b>jet</b> <b>fluid</b> are studied with a phase-locked analysis of digitized flow images. Oscillations in cross-flow velocity are found to organize the <b>jet</b> <b>fluid</b> into regular large-scale fluid patches, which, after time averaging, lead to a widened jet width and enhanced dilution. Experiments are also carried out on a vertical jet discharging into a current with surface waves, a situation that approximates to a genuine oscillating cross-flow with a nonzero mean velocity. The two sets of experimental observations are found to match with each other. The validity of the experimental simulation technique is further supported by a computational fluid dynamics study of the flow problem, {{in which it is}} possible to produce an idealized oscillating cross-flow situation. The numerical results agree well with the experimental observations. © ASCE,. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In this essay, large-eddy simulation, NPLS, and PIV techniques are applied to study the flow characteristics of a sonic jet with different flow rates after rearward-facing step interacting with supersonic turbulent flow. Results show that since a big recirculation zone is generated by rearward-facing step before the jet, the barrel shock in the windward side is not so obviously compressed so that <b>jet</b> <b>fluid</b> enters the recirculation zone providing a flammable region for ignition and combustion stabilization. Besides, <b>jet</b> <b>fluid</b> bypassing the Mach disk comes directly into interaction with the turbulent boundary layer separated from the rearward-facing step to enhance vortices development in the further downstream. The comparisons of average boundaries abstracted from NPLS images with empirical penetration height equations show that mixing enhancement of transverse injection into supersonic flow after rearward-facing step has a close relationship with the jet to free-stream momentum. In small jet to free-stream momentum case, the mixing shear layer grows mainly in the near field of the jet, while in big jet to free-stream momentum case, the growth of the mixing shear layer could extend to the far-field wake flow zone of the transverse jet...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between a conventional rectangular (primary) air jet and a co-flowing synthetic jet is investigated experimentally. The nozzles of both jets {{have the same}} long dimension but the aspect ratio of the synthetic jet orifice is 25 times larger. Detailed particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the flow in the midspan plane show that primary <b>jet</b> <b>fluid</b> is directed into the synthetic jet orifice and the {{interaction between}} the jets leads to the formation of a closed recirculating flow domain. The concomitant formation of a low-pressure region between the jets results in deflection of the primary jet toward the actuator jet despite the absence of an extended control surface (e. g. a diffuser or collar) and is balanced by a force on the primary jet conduit. For a given synthetic jet strength and primary jet speed, the vectoring force depends mainly on the volume flow rate of primary <b>jet</b> <b>fluid</b> that is diverted into the synthetic jet actuator. This flow rate is regulated by restricting the flow of entrained ambient fluid using a small streamwise extension of the synthetic jet orifice that scales with the orifice width.

The characteristic vectoring time and vectoring angle decrease monotonically with primary jet speed. 1...|$|R

With the broad application of various surfaces in optics, the sub-micrometric scale and the nanometric surface roughness accuracy are major challenges. <b>Fluid</b> <b>jet</b> polishing is a technology developed from abrasive water jet machining. This technology is a water jet cutting technology, which uses high-pressure flow to cut/remove materials. In this thesis, the working principle, and simulations, as well as verification of <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> polishing are thoroughly investigated. The verification of <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> polishing in this thesis includes velocity distribution and material removal derivations. The amount of material removed {{is directly related to}} the impact velocity of a particle with a surface, which helps define its abrasive particle velocity. During polishing, the particles travel in a solution called slurry. Due to the relatively similar velocity of the particles and the slurry, the particles and the slurry are assumed to be traveling at the same rate. In this thesis, three specific examples are investigated through the creation of an advanced model using FLUENT, a computational fluid dynamics software. The model simulates the particle path during the <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> polishing process, and this thesis compares the simulation results to prior analytical and experimental results.

Visualization experiments using both passive and chemically sensitive planar laser induced fluorescence (LIF) techniques show the importance of large scale transport in the jet far field, and suggest that entrainment, mixing and chemical reactions in the far field are dominated by a large scale organization of the flow. Successive instantaneous profiles of the <b>jet</b> <b>fluid</b> concentration along the axial and radial directions in the jet far field are measured by combining these LIF techniques with direct, high-resolution, linear photodiode array imaging and high-speed digital data acquisition.
