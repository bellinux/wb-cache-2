5|$|As {{a lifelong}} Democrat, Beauregard worked to end Republican rule during Reconstruction. His {{outrage over the}} {{perceived}} excesses of Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about remaining in the United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He was active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reform</b> Party, an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in favor of civil rights and voting for former slaves, hoping to form alliances between African-Americans and Democrats to vote out the Radical Republicans in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> process, the CPV devolved some {{powers of}} the party {{secretaries}} to the district-level committees. The party planned to decentralize some duties and responsibilities at departmental and sectoral levels while empowering ward-level party organs by strengthening their role in economic planning, market management and public security, and trying to improve {{the performance of the}} Control Commission and its lower-level bodies. The party leadership tried to make the cumbersome bureaucracy efficient.|$|E

5|$|A {{string of}} new {{peacekeeping}} missions were launched in Namibia, Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Angola by the Security Council which also triggered interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> of the 15-member body. Germany and Japan in particular, {{as well as}} India and Brazil, launched efforts to gain permanent seats and veto rights at the Council. In the late 1990s, Secretary-General Kofi Annan improved the coherence of the United Nations, with a better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures. The fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic was energized, and a new concept of partnership between the United Nations and international business developed under the Global Compact. Other reforms included the revamping of peacekeeping operations following the Brahimi Report. The World Summit in 2005 recognized, albeit mainly symbolically, an international ‘responsibility to protect’ populations from genocide and the Human Rights Council replaced the discredited Commission on Human Rights.|$|E
5|$|During Fineshriber's {{early years}} the {{congregation}} continued to modify its religious practices. At funerals, it encouraged mourners {{to leave the}} graveside, rather than having them wait until the coffin was lowered and cover it with earth themselves (as was the traditional practice). By this time, few members had bar mitzvah ceremonies for their 13-year-old boys; instead, boys and girls participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reform</b> Confirmation ceremony (though the synagogue still allowed those who wanted bar mitzvah ceremonies to have them). In 1916, the congregation eliminated the observance of the eighth days of Passover and Sukkot, required all worshipers to stand when mourners stood to recite the kaddish, and restored the Orthodox practice of blessing and naming babies in the synagogue {{as part of the}} services.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{ran for the}} Canadian House of Commons in the 1988 federal election, {{appearing}} on the ballot as Steve Harper in Calgary West and losing {{by a wide margin}} to Hawkes, his former employer. After Reform candidate Deborah Grey was elected as the party's first MP in a 1989 by-election, Harper became Grey's executive assistant, and was her chief adviser and speechwriter until 1993. He remained prominent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reform</b> Party's national organization in his role as policy chief, encouraging the party to expand beyond its Western base, and arguing that strictly regional parties were at risk of being taken over by radical elements. He delivered a speech at the Reform Party's 1991 national convention, in which he condemned extremist views.|$|E

5|$|In March 1549, {{the city}} of Strasbourg forced Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius to leave. Cranmer {{immediately}} invited the men to come to England and promised {{that they would be}} placed in English universities. When they arrived on 25 April, Cranmer was especially delighted to meet Bucer face to face after eighteen years of correspondence. He needed these scholarly men to train a new generation of preachers as well as assist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> of liturgy and doctrine. Others who accepted his invitations include the Polish reformer, Jan Łaski, but Cranmer was unable to convince Osiander and Melanchthon to come to England.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaders of}} these {{so-called}} Lords Ordainers were Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{on the side}} of the clergy, and Warwick, Lincoln and Lancaster among the earls. Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, was the most experienced of the earls, and took on a modifying role in the group. Thomas of Lancaster, who was Lincoln's son-in-law and heir, was the king's cousin and the wealthiest nobleman in the realm, but at this point he took a less active part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> movement. Warwick is described by some sources as the leader of the Ordainers; he was certainly the most aggressive. The set of Ordinances they drafted put heavy restrictions on the king's financial freedom, and his right to appoint his own ministers. It alsoonce moreordered Gaveston to be exiled, to return only at the risk of excommunication.|$|E
5|$|This victory did not {{delay the}} workhouse's fate; {{the site was}} duly sold to the Catholic Church for £110,000, and {{demolition}} began in January 1931. Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been appalled by the housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As {{a member of the}} council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform,</b> reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and child welfare issues.|$|E

5|$|The {{top five}} {{conglomerates}} in Indonesia {{prior to the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis—the Salim Group, Astra International, the Sinar Mas Group, Gudang Garam, Sampoerna and the Lippo Group—were all owned by ethnic Chinese, with annual sales totaling Rp112 trillion (US$47 billion). When the crisis finally hit the country, the rupiah's plunge severely disrupted corporate operations. Numerous conglomerates lost a majority of their assets and collapsed. Over the next several years, other conglomerates struggled to repay international and domestic debts. Reforms introduced following 1998 were meant to steer the economy away from oligarchic arrangements established under the New Order; however, plans for reform proved too optimistic. When President B.J. Habibie announced in a 19 July 1998 interview with The Washington Post that Indonesia was not dependent on ethnic Chinese businessmen, the rupiah's value plunged 5 percent. This unexpected reaction prompted immediate changes in policies, and Habibie soon began enticing conglomerates for their support <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> plans. Most were initially fearful of democratization, but the process of social demarginalization meant that the ethnic Chinese were regarded as equal members of society {{for the first time}} in the nation's history. Increased regional autonomy allowed surviving conglomerates to explore new opportunities in the outer provinces, and economic reforms created a freer market.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} Prayer Book, the origins and {{participants}} {{in the work of}} its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision. The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New rubrics noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the curate, thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead, as such prayers implied support for the doctrine of purgatory. The Act of Uniformity 1552, which authorised the book's use, specified that it be exclusively used from 1 November. However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute, due to Dudley's intervention. While travelling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, John Knox, then based in Newcastle. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On 27 September 1552, the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy. On 22 October, the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called Black Rubric, which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.|$|E
