40|$|AbstractThe {{brown meagre}} Sciaena umbra, an iconic {{demersal}} fish species in Mediterranean coastal habitats, is {{particularly vulnerable to}} fishing pressure and presents a worrying population decline. Fish numbers and sizes were surveyed by visual census at Scandola (Corsica) in and outside reserve zones subject to increasing levels of protection, including unprotected zones (UP) where all fishing activities are permitted, buffer zones (BZ) subject to partial protection and a totally <b>protected</b> no-take <b>integral</b> <b>reserve</b> zone (IR). The numerical abundance, individual size and biomass of the brown meagre were found to increase with levels of reserve protection. The abundance of the larger size classes and the numbers of fish per shoal were significantly lower in unprotected zones. A comparison with similar censuses performed in 1983 showed a significant increase of S. umbra abundance in IR, but no difference in UP. That increasing levels of protection resulted in increased abundance and biomass of the brown meagre suggested a prominent role of fishing, particularly spearfishing, activities in the persistence of its low abundance in the unprotected zones. As a consequence, protective action for the brown meagre (including a ban on both spearfishing and recreational hook-and-line fishing) has been introduced in France since January 2014...|$|R
50|$|California laws {{relating}} to <b>fully</b> <b>protected</b> species {{were among the}} first attempts in the nation to give protection to wildlife in risk of extinction, predating even the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). In the decades that followed, new laws were enacted that were more flexible to the needs of growing communities and the modern world. Thus, most <b>fully</b> <b>protected</b> species have also been given additional protection under more recent laws and regulations, and many have been listed under state and federal versions of the ESA. However, the laws {{relating to}} <b>fully</b> <b>protected</b> species are still in place. As mentioned above, California law states that no permit may be issued for take of <b>fully</b> <b>protected</b> species, under almost any circumstances. Thus, presence of a <b>fully</b> <b>protected</b> animal in an area such as a construction zone can literally bring the entire project to a halt. In contrast, the ESA carries stronger penalties, but has provisions built in for mitigation options in the event of unavoidable take. There is debate within conservation biology circles as to the modern-day applicability of the <b>fully</b> <b>protected</b> designation due to its inflexibility, the fact that new conservation laws have been enacted, and the fact that some <b>fully</b> <b>protected</b> species have undergone moderate population recovery while many other species that deserve the <b>fully</b> <b>protected</b> status have not been designated as such.|$|R
