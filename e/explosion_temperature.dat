The results demonstrated that mild explosion has an effect on opening wood structure, shown by increased release of glucomannans during alkaline extraction and faster delignification in kraft cooks for steam-exploded samples.

40|$|The authors compare {{two-dimensional}} model {{results with}} measurements for the thermal, chemical and mechanical {{behavior in a}} thermal explosion experiment. Confined high explosives are heated {{at a rate of}} 1 C per hour until an explosion is observed. The heating, ignition, and deflagration phases are modeled using an Arbitrarily Lagrangian-Eulerian code (ALE 3 D) that can handle a wide range of time scales that vary from a structural to a dynamic hydro time scale. During the pre-ignition phase, quasi-static mechanics and diffusive thermal transfer from a heat source to the HE are coupled with the finite chemical reactions that include both endothermic and exothermic processes. Once the HE ignites, a hydro dynamic calculation is performed as a burn front propagates through the HE. Two octahydrotetranitrotetrazine (HMX) -based explosives, LX- 04 and LX- 10, are considered, whose chemical-thermal-mechanical models are constructed based on measurements of thermal and mechanical properties along with small scale thermal explosion measurements. The present HMX modeling work shows very first violence calculations with thermal predictions associated with a confined thermal explosion test. The simulated dynamic response of HE confinement during the explosive phase is compared to measurements in larger scale thermal explosion tests.

40|$|The {{established}} {{mechanism of}} the hydrogen-oxygen reaction is reviewed and calculated results presented concerning the rates of reaction and the <b>explosion</b> <b>temperatures</b> expected with various concentrations of water vapor. A simplified theory is developed to predict the overall rate of reaction in the case where a strong temperature gradient exists. Experiments are described in which stoichiometric mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen are introduced to a closed, shallow, nickel plated, cylindrical combustion chamber and measurements made of the pressure change with time. The top surface of the chamber is heated while the bottom surface is either heated or cooled to provide isothermal or gradient conditions, respectively. A large catalytic reaction due to the nickel surfaces is observed. The measured reaction rates and the conditions for explosion with isothermal heating are consistent with predictions based on the established reaction scheme. With gradient heating the rates measured are larger than those predicted. by the simplified theory with temperatures of the top surface above 1300 [degrees]R. This fact {{is believed to be}} caused by the diffusion of active intermediate reaction products from hot regions into the cooler reactants.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the energy distributions of ions and electrons ejected in the interaction of clusters of several thousand noble-gas atoms with high-intensity (10 " 1 " 4 - 10 " 1 " 6 Wcm"-" 2) femtosecond laser pulses. The dependence of the ion energies on laser intensity and wavelength, cluster size and cluster medium has been studied. Ion energies of up to 1 MeV and electron energies of up to 2. 5 keV have been measured. The interaction with clusters is considerably more energetic than that with single atoms or small molecules irradiated at the same intensity. A numerical model, which treats the cluster as a spherical nanoplasma, is used to analyse the explosion of a single cluster. The model suggests that the superheating of the clusters arises from {{a sharp increase in}} the laser-driven collisional heating. This increase occurs when the electron density in the expanding cluster drops to three times the critical electron density, at which point the electric field inside the cluster plasma is resonantly enhanced compared to the external field. We have investigated the possibility of using two pulses with different frequencies to excite the resonance in the heating twice during the expansion of the cluster, thereby enhancing the electron heating. The numerical model has been adapted to simulate the irradiation of a cluster with a sequence of laser pulses. The results of this new model support the idea that using two pulses of different frequencies will enhance the heating. We have performed experimental investigations of the dynamics of clusters of a few thousand Xe atoms when irradiated by two laser pulses of different frequencies in sequence. The dependence of the <b>explosion</b> <b>temperature</b> on the delay between the two pulses and on their relative polarisations is examined.
