5|$|Andula is {{a working-class}} young woman {{living in a}} fading Czech factory town, where, due to an {{oversight}} in central state planning, women outnumber men 16–1. The film opens with an intimate scene between Andula and her fellow shoe-factory-worker friend as they lie in bed in their dormitory discussing the ring given to Andula by her boyfriend Tonda and gossiping about her mildly flirtatious encounter with a <b>forest</b> <b>ranger,</b> which is shown in flashback.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland {{and a lot of}} new designs and backgrounds had to be created for the wilderness scenes. The backgrounds were designed by animator Debbie Silver. The design of the <b>forest</b> <b>ranger</b> was based on then-Vice President Al Gore. In the episode, Marge watches an old film which includes a comment from naturalist John Muir. The impression of Muir was done by Dan Castellaneta, who originally based the voice on an impersonator he met at Yosemite National Park. However, the producers asked him to make the voice older and crazier.|$|E
5|$|Steinhaus, {{because of}} his Jewish background, spent the Nazi {{occupation}} in hiding, first among friends in Lwów, then in the small towns of Osiczyna, near Zamość and Berdechów, near Kraków. The Polish anti-Nazi resistance provided him with false documents of a <b>forest</b> <b>ranger</b> who had died sometime earlier, {{by the name of}} Grzegorz Krochmalny. Under this name he taught clandestine classes (higher education was forbidden for Poles under the German occupation). Worried about the possibility of imminent death if captured by Germans, Steinhaus, without access to any scholarly material, reconstructed from memory and recorded all the mathematics he knew, in addition to writing other voluminous memoirs, of which only a little part has been published.|$|E

Other revolvers in use were the Colt Navy [...]36 1851 model with open top frame. The Colt was favoured by the <b>Forest</b> <b>Rangers</b> because it was light and accurate being a single-action revolver. Von Tempsky's second company of the <b>Forest</b> <b>Rangers</b> also used the Bowie knife.|$|R

40|$|Forest is {{invaluable}} {{since it}} plays {{a crucial role}} for harmonizing and balancing the environment as the blessing from God the Almighty. The role, however, gets harmed due to a seriously harming factor, illegal logging. The thesis tries to answer the following questions (1) How the controlling activities are carried out by the <b>forest</b> <b>rangers</b> in Kotawaringin Timur District, Central Borneo Province? (2) What constraints are faced by the <b>forest</b> <b>rangers</b> in conducting control towards illegal logging? The study aims to find out the implementation control activities are carried out by <b>forest</b> <b>rangers</b> and the constraints they face in conducting control towards illegal logging in Kotawaringin Timur District, Central Borneo Province. The study uses the empirical method. The findings of the study indicate that the controlling activities were conducted through giving education and dissemination to community,conducting patrols, establishing security posts, and conducting repressive operation or taking harsh measures to illegal loggers. Meanwhile, the constraints refer to the insufficient number of <b>forest</b> <b>rangers,</b> limited support and infrastructures in conducting controlling activities. Therefore, the Regional Government of Central Borneo Province shall increase the number of <b>forest</b> <b>rangers</b> by recruiting new <b>forest</b> <b>rangers.</b> The recruitment mainly aims to improve the control and the protection towards forest and its surrounding areas to be more effective...|$|R
25|$|From 1863 to 1867 <b>Forest</b> <b>Ranger</b> {{volunteer}} {{units were}} formed, tasked with searching out Maori war parties, acting as scouts, and protecting lines of communication. They arose {{out of the}} need to prevent ambushes and random attacks on civilians near forest areas. The Rangers were well armed and more highly paid. These units used guerrilla style tactics, moving through areas under cover of darkness and ambushing war parties. The Forest Rangers were disbanded on 1 October 1867.|$|E
25|$|The Government's war {{policy was}} {{opposed by the}} British commander, General Duncan Cameron, who clashed with Governor Sir George Grey and offered his {{resignation}} in February 1865. He left New Zealand six months later. Cameron, who viewed the war {{as a form of}} land plunder, had urged the Colonial Office to withdraw British troops from New Zealand and from the end of 1865 the Imperial forces began to leave, replaced by an expanding New Zealand military force. Among the new colonial forces were specialist <b>Forest</b> <b>Ranger</b> units, which embarked on lengthy search-and-destroy missions deep into the bush.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, the Conservation Commission, {{which the}} FFGC had become, {{found that there}} was still a large area of the {{southern}} Catskills, in Sullivan and Ulster counties, poorly served by the existing towers. Red Hill was chosen as the site for a new tower (supposedly after political pressure forced the state to reconsider Sullivan County's Denman Mountain to the south), and early in 1920 a <b>forest</b> <b>ranger</b> brought the disassembled tower up to the summit via horse-drawn wagon. A state crew cut a road through the Dibble farm up from nearby Red Hill Road, strung the telephone line along it, and put up the tower and cabin later that year.|$|E

40|$|In this study, it {{was aimed}} to {{determine}} the problems of <b>forest</b> <b>rangers</b> playing {{an active role in}} the process of implementation of forestry activities in Turkey, and to develop recommendations for solving such problems. A questionnaire was applied to 114 <b>forest</b> <b>rangers</b> working in Artvin Regional Forest Directorate connected with General Directorate of Forestry. The purpose of questionnaire is to find out what kind of job related concerns and opinions the forest reangers may have. We found out the top three main problems of the <b>forest</b> <b>rangers</b> obligation to embezzlement, not benefiting the rights that are granted to the other law enforcement agencies, feeling undervalued in their organization. Yet, we also collected various suggestions about the issues related compensation, education, security of life, made by <b>forest</b> <b>rangers...</b>|$|R

25|$|On 2 September 1865 the {{government}} declared martial {{law on the}} east coast and announced a new expedition against Volkner's killers, threatening confiscation of land in the area if they were not handed over. The expedition was an entirely colonial force, consisting of Taranaki Military Settlers, Wanganui and Patea Rangers, Wanganui Yeomanry Cavalry, and the Wanganui Native Contingent under Major Thomas McDonnell, and all under the overall command of Major Willoughby Brassey. The 500 troops sailed from Wellington and Wanganui and rendezvoused off Hicks Bay on 7 September, joining additional troops who had sailed from Auckland, including former <b>Forest</b> <b>Ranger</b> commander Major Gustavus von Tempsky.|$|E
25|$|The cabin {{exists in}} a rural area off of Forest Road (FR) 245, just to the west of its {{intersection}} with Arizona State Route 373. In 1911, the U.S. Forest Service declared the area which includes the property where Butterfly Lodge sits as a protected area. As part of a program which encouraged U.S. citizens to develop public lands, a long-term lease was issued to Schultz by the local <b>forest</b> <b>ranger.</b> Schultz financial success as a writer and explorer enabled him to build the first cabin by a non-resident in the remote White Mountains. Two men from nearby Greer, Arizona, John T. Butler and Cleve Wiltbank, built the cabin in 1913, intending to be used by James Willard Schultz as a hunting lodge and retreat. The men used ponderosa pine and Douglas fir to build the cabin. Schultz son, Hart Merriam Schultz (also known as Lone Wolf), later put additions on the structure, including an artist's studio. The site was a clearing near a spring, purported to be the headwaters of the Little Colorado River. The plethora of butterflies in the area was the impetus for the name of the cabin. Between 1916 and 1929 three additions were made to the structure, including a bedroom and storage area, an artist's studio, and a kitchen.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} Worlds End State Park {{goes back to}} 1929, when the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, a {{precursor}} to the modern Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, began purchasing land devastated by logging and wild fire to create a state forest. The land that specifically became the park was purchased from the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company in 1929 and Mrs. [...] "Doc" [...] Randall in 1931. Worlds End State Park was established by <b>forest</b> <b>ranger</b> John Annabelle in 1932, with a budget of $50 that purchased four picnic tables.|$|E

500|$|Frederick {{conducted}} a perfunctory reconnaissance of his enemy's position, {{accompanied by a}} <b>forest</b> <b>ranger</b> and an officer who had previously been stationed in Frankfurt. He also consulted a peasant who, though garrulous, was uninformed about military needs: the peasant told the King that a natural obstacle between the Red Grange (a large farmstead between Kunersdorf and Frankfurt's outer city) and Kunersdorf was unpassable; what the peasant did not know was that the Russians had been there long enough to construct a causeway linking these two sections. [...] Looking to the east through his telescope, Frederick saw some wooded hills, called the Reppen Forest, and he believed he could use them to screen an advance, much like he had done at Leuthen. [...] He did not send scouts to reconnoiter the land or question locals about {{the ground in the}} forest. [...] Furthermore, through his glass he could see that the Russians were facing west and north, and their fortifications were stronger on the west. He decided that all the Allies were facing northwest and that the forest was readily passable.|$|E
