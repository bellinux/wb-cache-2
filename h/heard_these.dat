5|$|At Will Bloom’s wedding party, {{his father}} Edward recalls the day Will was born, {{claiming}} he caught an enormous catfish using his wedding ring as bait. Will, having <b>heard</b> <b>these</b> stories all his life, believes {{them to be}} lies and falls out with his father. Three years later, Edward is stricken with cancer, so Will and his pregnant French wife Joséphine return to his childhood home in Alabama {{to spend time with}} his father. Edward’s life is told through flashbacks, beginning with his encounter with a witch in his hometown, Ashton. She shows him his death but he reacts to it without fear. As he grows into adulthood, he finds his home too confining, and sets out into the world with a misunderstood giant, Karl, who has come to town with a traveling circus.|$|E
5|$|Mondo Cane {{consists}} of Mike Patton's arrangements and performances of 1950s and 1960s Italian pop songs. Patton had <b>heard</b> <b>these</b> songs {{while living in}} Bologna; the singer had adopted {{the city as a}} second home after marrying Italian artist Titi Zuccatosta, and had become a fluent speaker of Italian. Patton began exploring Italian popular music; although initially wishing to listen to contemporary music, he found nothing that interested him. However, he became drawn to pop music from the 1950s and 1960s, intrigued by singers using orchestras for backing rather than pop bands. Having considered making an album covering these songs for some time, Patton initially believed he would approach the project with a small band, but was offered the chance to compose music for an orchestra. Patton then opted to use this opportunity to record Mondo Cane instead.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I <b>heard</b> <b>these</b> words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

25|$|The {{most popular}} musical {{styles of the}} area is norteño ("northern"), which {{includes}} Banda. norteño music developed from the late 19th {{until the beginning of}} the 20th century, all along the borderlands of northern Mexico and southwestern United States, with the influence of waltz, polkas, mazurkas and corridos. One important instrument for the genre is the accordion, introduced to the area by German immigrants. Sonoran versions of this music developed from the 1920s to the 1960s. Many of the best known early works have anonymous composers. In the 1950s, with the widespread use of radio, the popularity of the genre rose as the norteño music of Nuevo León, Durango and other states were <b>heard.</b> <b>These</b> versions often included music written by Sonoran composers such as Amor de Madre by Jesús “El Chito” Peralta, Cuatro Milpas, Mundo Engañoso, El Venadito, La Higuerita and El Tarachi by Aristeo Silvas Antúnez and La Barca de Guaymas by José López Portillo. The music especially resonated with youth which worked in fields and on ranches.|$|E
500|$|Colbert's {{performance}} {{received a}} variety of reactions from the media. In Washington, the response from both politicians and the press corps was negative—both groups having been targets of Colbert's satire. The Washington press corps felt that Colbert had bombed. The Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen found that Colbert's jokes were [...] "lame and insulting" [...] and wrote that Colbert was [...] "rude" [...] and a [...] "bully". Politician Steny Hoyer felt that Colbert had gone too far, telling the newspaper The Hill that [...] " [...] is the President of the United States, and he deserves some respect". Conservative pundit Mary Matalin called Colbert's performance a [...] "predictable, Bush-bashing kind of humor". Columnist Ana Marie Cox chastised those who praised Colbert as a hero: [...] "I somehow doubt that Bush has never <b>heard</b> <b>these</b> criticisms before". She added, [...] "Comedy can have a political point {{but it is not}} political action".|$|E

500|$|At noon on September 27, Luce {{calculated}} the ship's position at roughly [...] south-east of Cape Race, in Newfoundland. Shortly afterwards, as Arctic {{slipped into a}} bank of fog, the lookout saw {{the shape of a}} steamer bearing down at a rate of around 10 knots. He gave the warning; the officer of the watch commanded [...] "Hard-a-starboard", and ordered the engine room to stop and reverse. [...] In the chartroom, the captain <b>heard</b> <b>these</b> orders and returned to the deck, just as Arctic was struck by the advancing steamer on the starboard side, between the bow and the paddle wheel. [...] Luce's first impression was that his ship was [...] "relatively uninjured", and to most of those on board, the bump seemed slight. Many of the passengers were gathered in the cabin prior to lunch, and some of them were engaged in drawing the numbers of the daily lottery, {{based on the number of}} miles run in the preceding twenty-four hours.|$|E
500|$|Chapters I.2 through I.4 {{follow the}} {{progress}} of this rumour, starting with HCE's encounter with [...] "a cad with a pipe" [...] in Phoenix Park. The cad greets HCE in Gaelic and asks the time, but HCE misunderstands the question as an accusation, and incriminates himself by denying rumours the cad has not yet <b>heard.</b> <b>These</b> rumours quickly spread across Dublin, gathering momentum until they are turned into a song penned by the character Hosty called [...] "The Ballad of Persse O'Reilly". As a result, HCE goes into hiding, where he is besieged at the closed gate of his pub by a visiting American looking for drink after hours. HCE remains silent – not responding to the accusations or verbal abuse – dreams, is buried in a coffin {{at the bottom of}} Lough Neagh, and is finally brought to trial, under the name Festy King. He is eventually freed, and goes once more into hiding. An important piece of evidence during the trial – a letter about HCE written by his wife ALP – is called for {{so that it can be}} examined in closer detail.|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} songs {{recorded}} for the album were [...] "Any Way The Wind Blows" [...] and [...] "Who Are the Brain Police?" [...] When Tom Wilson heard the latter, {{he realized that}} The Mothers were not merely a blues band. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa wrote [...] "I {{could see through the}} window that he was scrambling toward the phone to call his boss—probably saying: 'Well, uh, not exactly a [...] "white blues band", but... sort of.'" [...] In a 1968 article written for Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that when Wilson <b>heard</b> <b>these</b> songs, [...] "he was so impressed he got on the phone and called New York, and as a result I got a more or less unlimited budget to do this monstrosity." [...] Freak Out! is an early example of the concept album, a sardonic farce about rock music and America. [...] "All the songs on it were about something", Zappa wrote in The Real Frank Zappa Book. [...] "It wasn't as if we had a hit single and we needed to build some filler around it. Each tune had a function within an overall satirical concept." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a mixed review, Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club {{found the}} album {{to be too}} dance and R and felt {{that it should have}} {{explored}} her [...] "airy voice", as found on singles like [...] "Body Party", that recaptured the zeitgeist of her earlier work. At USA Today, Steve Jones said that [...] "bass-fueled club bangers and libido-driven ballads tend to hit their mark but ultimately, don't leave a lasting impression." [...] The Boston Globes Ken Capobianco criticized the album for [...] "missing [...] a unique lyrical or musical vision", further elaborating, [...] "we've <b>heard</b> <b>these</b> tropes before," [...] and concluding their review that [...] "now deep into her career, the real Ciara still proves elusive." [...] Jon Carmanica of The New York Times found the production [...] "vivid", but felt that Ciara's voice lacks personality and said that she sounds monotonous throughout the album.|$|E

[...] As he grew, he became known for his archery skills and his studiousness—although his studies were described to be surveys rather than careful readings, except for books on military strategy, which {{he spent much of}} his time on. [...] He often deprecated Wu Han and Deng Yu, instead comparing himself to the great Warring States general Le Yi, the great Han Dynasty prime minister Xiao He, and the Han general Cao Can (曹參). [...] When people <b>heard</b> <b>these</b> remarks, they often criticized him for being overly arrogant, but Liu Yuan's son Liu Cong respected him and remarked, [...] "Yongming should be compared to Shizu (the temple name of Emperor Guangwu of Han) and Emperor Wu of Wei (Cao Cao); Le, Xiao, and Cao Can cannot be compared to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hartwig Vens {{argues that}} hip hop {{can also be}} viewed as a global {{learning}} experience. Author Jeff Chang argues that [...] "the essence of hip hop is the cipher, born in the Bronx, where competition and community feed each other." [...] He also adds: [...] "Thousands of organizers from Cape Town to Paris use hip hop in their communities to address environmental justice, policing and prisons, media justice, and education.". While hip hop music has been criticized as a music that creates a divide between western music and music {{from the rest of the}} world, a musical [...] "cross pollination" [...] has taken place, which strengthens the power of hip hop to influence different communities. Hip hop's messages allow the under-privileged and the mistreated to be <b>heard.</b> <b>These</b> cultural translations cross borders. While the music may be from a foreign country, the message is something that many people can relate to- something not [...] "foreign" [...] at all.|$|E
2500|$|Bordwell {{has called}} the film opaque with {{characters}} {{that are difficult to}} interpret, unexplained conflicts, and major plot points that occur off-camera. Godard also sometimes frames characters to make them unrecognizable to the audience, films scenes with overlapping dialogue of characters on and off screen, and uses ellipses in scenes to create gaps in time. He also sometimes cuts to black frames, objects in the scene, or landscapes while dialogue from the scene is still <b>heard.</b> <b>These</b> techniques make the film both difficult to interpret and to comprehend. Bordwell believes [...] "we ought to find problems of comprehension fascinating. They remind us of storytelling conventions we take for granted, and they push toward other ways of spinning yarns, or unraveling them." [...] Bordwell believes that [...] "blocking or troubling our story-making process serves to re-weight the individual image and sound. When we can't easily tie what we see and hear to an ongoing plot, we're coaxed to savor each moment as a micro-event in itself, like a word in a poem or a patch of color in a painting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earl Hines {{was born}} in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, 12miles {{from the center of}} Pittsburgh, in 1903. His father, Joseph Hines, played cornet and was the leader of the Eureka Brass Band in Pittsburgh, and his {{stepmother}} was a church organist. Hines intended to follow his father on cornet, but [...] "blowing" [...] hurt him behind the ears, whereas the piano did not. The young Hines took lessons in playing classical piano. By the age of eleven he was playing the organ in his Baptist church. He had a [...] "good ear and a good memory" [...] and could replay songs after hearing them in theaters and park concerts: [...] "I'd be playing songs from these shows months before the song copies came out. That astonished {{a lot of people and}} they'd ask where I <b>heard</b> <b>these</b> numbers and I'd tell them at the theatre where my parents had taken me." [...] Later, Hines said that he was playing piano around Pittsburgh [...] "before the word 'jazz' was even invented".|$|E
