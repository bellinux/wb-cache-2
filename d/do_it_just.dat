500|$|Denis O'Hare {{joined the}} cast in late March 2011 as Larry Harvey. Jessica Lange joined the cast in April 2011 as Constance, marking her first regular role on television. Lange was {{attracted}} to the role because it didn't require a 22-episode commitment like a series on a broadcast network. [...] "That was huge for me!" [...] she said. [...] "I wasn't about to commit to, you know, six months. It was cable, rather than network... I've been offered network [...] before, and determined not to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>just</b> because I can't {{make that kind of}} time commitment." ...|$|E
500|$|Wood spotted Susie Blake in {{a musical}} at the King's Head Theatre and cast her {{in the role of}} the opinionated {{continuity}} announcer. Wood said of her casting at the time, [...] "I didn't think of her particularly for the continuity announcer, but she came in and could <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>just</b> like that. I'd love to cast her in a song-and-dance number – I feel so sorry for her always having to wear those terrible blouses". When As Seen On TV ended Blake said [...] "I'm very sad that this is the last time we will all work together but I understand why Vic wanted to stop. Anyway there were only two series of Fawlty Towers and, as far as I'm concerned, this rates with it, so I'm sure it'll be shown lots of times".|$|E
500|$|Hill {{repeatedly}} tells a {{story from}} when she was 14 years old and bouldering in Joshua Tree: she succeeded on a route when a man came over and commented how surprised he was that she could do the route because even he could not. [...] "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> <b>Just</b> because I was a small girl, was I {{not to be able}} to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically {{the track}} is written about a failing {{relationship}} {{caused by a}} partner who abuses alcohol. The singer speaks {{of a man who}} faces a disconnect between his personality while drunk and sober, causing the inability to forge a connection. During the second verse Gomez sings [...] "Why is it so different when we wake up? / Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch / Don't you know that you <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> enough, but not enough / But I know what's next, and I want so much", describing a lover who can only show his true emotions while intoxicated. Later in the song she expresses the pain she feels having wasted so much time into her relationship, and decides to leave her dysfunctional lover: [...] "You've got a hold on me / You're like a wasted dream / I gave you everything / But you don't know how to love me when you're sober".|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} March 2011, with Connie Britton {{first to be}} cast, portraying female lead Vivien Harmon. Britton stated that she took a risk in taking the role of Vivien. When Ryan Murphy presented the role to her he said, [...] "This is something we've never seen you do before. It will be turning what you've just been doing on its ear." [...] She was intrigued by what he had presented her and ultimately {{decided to take the}} part. Denis O'Hare joined the cast in late March as Larry Harvey. Jessica Lange joined the cast in April as Constance, marking her first regular role on television.

500|$|On October 1, Perot re-entered {{the presidential}} race, {{with a desire}} to further explain his {{economic}} plans to the American people. The New York Times commented that Perot's [...] "chances of winning are much less than when he quit in July. His only dim practical hope is to confuse and destabilize the contest." [...] He hoped to spend more resources using paid advertisements than holding traditional rallies to spread his message. During the last month of campaigning, Perot left his headquarters in Dallas only to appear in the presidential debates and seven rallies. One aide later commented: [...] "he wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> like he could go to the office every day, run for president, and go home and eat dinner." [...] Rather than using professional advisers, Perot employed [...] "political amateurs" [...] whose loyalty was unquestioned. Orson Swindle, whom he had known since the 1970s, was hired as the top aide. Perot's son-in-law Clayton Mulford, who was involved in the early draft effort, was hired as legal adviser. Sharon Holman, who worked for Perot since 1969, was hired as press secretary, and friend Murphy Martin was added as the media chief.|$|E

500|$|Miguel held a {{press conference}} at the Las Ventas {{building}} in Madrid, Spain on the album's launch date of 13 September 1999. Miguel confirmed that it was the first album where he was more involved in the tracks' composition. [...] "Here something special was done, probably because I had more time to write a few things," [...] he added. When asked why he opted not to record an English-language album as other Latin acts such as Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin had successfully done, Miguel replied: [...] "I think that Spanish is a good language. I like my language and I really feel proud of it. I'm not saying that I won't do it in the future, sing in English, I mean. But it's just that it's not the right time for me. Why should I <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>just</b> because everybody else is doing it?" [...] He was also asked about the lack of a duet with his then-girlfriend Mariah Carey to which he responded that he does not like to involve his personal life with his career. However, Miguel noted that the music he performs is based on his feelings at the time, and hinted the album's title was influenced by his relationship with Carey.|$|E

2500|$|Fat Joe {{was born}} on August 19, 1970, in the South Bronx area of New York City, where he was raised by parents of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent. He lived in public housing and began {{stealing}} {{at a young age}} to support his family. He also admits that he was a bully in his childhood. His brother introduced him to rap music. [...] As a teenager, he was highly influenced by fellow Latino rapper Big Pun. [...] Fat Joe explained the rapper's influence on him by saying [...] "Latinos before us who had the opportunity to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> didn't know how to do it. They came in trying to do this black music, waving flags. [...] we're trying to kick in the doors for other Latinos and represent our people, and it shows." ...|$|E

2500|$|Van Persie {{was born}} in Rotterdam to an artistic family. José Ras, his mother, is a painter and {{jewellery}} designer who also teaches special needs children. Bob, his father, is a sculptor. After Van Persie's parents divorced he was brought up by his father. At school, Van Persie {{was one of the}} most misbehaved children and was excluded from class almost daily. [...] After joining Arsenal in England, Van Persie settled in Hampstead, an affluent suburb of north London. Van Persie is married to Moroccan Bouchra Elbali and the couple have two children, a son named Shaqueel and daughter Dina. When asked if this caused him to convert to Islam, Van Persie said, [...] "It's not true. I am not a Muslim, nor a Christian or a Jew. I have been raised liberally. If you want to become a Muslim it should come from the heart. I would not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> to please my wife. To believe for me is a quest for being a good man." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Los Angeles Times said [...] "the Spanish-speaking {{world can}} hardly {{stop talking about}} [...] ", which {{provided}} [...] "fodder for satirists from Mexico City to Madrid". The reaction was apparent [...] "in newspaper headlines, cable television and on YouTube. His phrase was reproduced on T-shirts, and cellphone ring tones. In Mexico City, the dust-up became a satirical skit, [...] "El Chabo del 8". In El Salvador's capital, the phrase became a playful greeting". In Australia The Sydney Morning Herald reported the king could earn a multimillion-euro business if he claimed rights over the phrase, which generated a Benny Hill Show-style skit and a Nike ad, [...] "Juan <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Just</b> shut up", with the Brazilian football star, Ronaldinho. Canada's CBC News said an actor's voice was used to mimic the king's voice in the ringtone to avoid legal problems {{over the use of}} the phrase, which also generated sales of coffee mugs. The infamous phrase was also referred to in a comic song called [...] "Baila el Chiki-chiki", Spain's contribution to Eurovision 2008, and in the song [...] "La Plata", by the Brazilian band Jota Quest.|$|E
2500|$|... "Linda was {{a joy to}} work with. I {{remember}} we were doing a tracking shot, a camera car on tracks running about one hundred yards down this field. Linda and I were on this horse with no saddle, no reins, just the mane. If anybody fell, that camera truck is there to roll under. It was a very dodgey scene. You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club. Just hang on and if you feel you can't <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>just</b> don't do it. It's risky. There's no question about it, it's not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell.' But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead and we did it. I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,'You're crazy. I wouldn't have done that. It's too dangerous.' And he's probably right. I thought it was very foolish to have done it. Anyway, Linda was a gutsy little gal and she did it. So she was very pleasant to work with and very nice." ...|$|E
