2500|$|The Chevette's {{front end}} {{featured}} a more aerodynamic-looking nose than the Kadett, based loosely {{on the design}} of the [...] "droopsnoot" [...] Firenza, itself said to be inspired by the Pontiac Firebird, a sister GM product. In contrast the Kadett had a more conventional, flat-fronted design. In 1980, the Chevette underwent a facelift with flush fitting headlights, giving it a [...] "family look" [...] alongside the larger Vauxhall Cavalier version of the Opel Ascona B. Mechanical changes included the introduction of Bosch distributors, revised heater ducting and a simplified throttle linkage. It also received new wheel designs, revised C-pillar vent covers and revamped interior trim with re-designed front seats to increase rear <b>knee</b> <b>room</b> marginally. However, it was effectively the beginning of a phase-out in favour of the newer Astra, Vauxhall's version of the front wheel drive Kadett D, which was launched in January 1980; although it was not produced in Britain until November 1981. The phasing-out of the Chevette continued in April 1983, when the hatchback model was discontinued due to the launch of the Spanish built Nova.|$|E
50|$|Design wise, the Insignia offers 30 mm more <b>knee</b> <b>room</b> {{than the}} Vectra. The saloon and {{hatchback}} variants {{have the same}} 4.83 m length and wheelbase of 2.73 m. The estate version is slightly longer at 4.91 m on the same wheelbase.|$|E
6000|$|Those {{tears were}} sweet to her husband, {{and it was}} he who took Tommy on his <b>knee</b> in the <b>room</b> where the books were, and told him that there was no Reddy now. When Tommy knew that Reddy was a deader he cried bitterly, and the man said, very gently, [...] "I am glad you were so fond of her." ...|$|R
60|$|THE hot day was over, and {{the light}} failing rapidly when Appleby, who had just {{finished}} comida, sat by a window of the hacienda San Cristoval with an English newspaper upon his <b>knee.</b> The <b>room</b> behind him, where Harper lay in a cane chair, was already shadowy, but outside the saffron sunset still flamed beyond the cane, and {{here and there a}} palm tuft cut against it hard and sharp in ebony tracery. Inside the air was hot, and heavy with the smell of garlic‐tainted oil; but a faint cool draught flowed in between the open lattices, and Appleby, who had been busy since sunrise that day, sighed contentedly as he breathed it in. Beneath him the long white sheds still glimmered faintly, and a troop of men were plodding home along the little tram‐line that wound through the cane; while in the direction they came from the smoke of the crushing‐ mill floated, a long, dingy smear, athwart the soft blueness, out of which here and there a pale star was peeping.|$|R
50|$|The {{coaches have}} a two-by-two seating {{arrangement}} and more <b>knee</b> and leg <b>room</b> than single level coaches. The seats are also bigger {{and it has}} 15-30% more seating than on single level coaches. The intermediate levels have 5 inward-facing flip-up seats on each side, for wheelchairs or bicycles. On cab cars, a large equipment locker behind the cab replaces one row of seats. There are single-width side doors at intermediate levels for high-platform loading, and similar doors outboard of the bogies except at the cab position on cab cars. The latter doors of NJ Transit coaches have stepwell traps, allowing these doors {{to be used for}} both high and low-platform loading. RTM coaches have one-piece end doors without traps, which can be used only for low-platform loading. There are also an automated announcement system and LED destination screens.|$|R
50|$|A long-wheelbase sedan, {{designated}} F35, {{was produced}} for the Chinese market. The wheelbase is increased by 110 mm, which increases rear <b>knee</b> <b>room</b> by 90 mm. This vehicle {{was produced in}} BMW's Shenyang production plant, and chrome trim on the doors distinguishes it from the F30 sedans.|$|E
50|$|The {{seating area}} {{comprises}} one level, steeply raked for a nearly ideal viewing angle {{without resorting to}} steps. The seats are split into three parts, with a wide center and two smaller side seating areas to either side. Foot and <b>knee</b> <b>room</b> are comfortable, and the seats are comfortably reclined. The seating area also clings to its roots by using wood-backed seats and no modern-era cupholders.|$|E
50|$|Overall length (3,565 mm) and {{wheelbase}} (2,380 mm) {{are identical}} to the Santro with slightly more interior space; Ergonomic design was intended to accommodate tall drivers and increasing rear <b>knee</b> <b>room.</b> The width has been increased (and front and rear track) by 70 mm for more shoulder room. The height has been reduced by 40 mm. Boot space at 225 L is significantly {{lower than that of}} Getz.|$|E
50|$|This 7-seater {{limousine}} {{has four}} good doors and six side windows. Front seat is fixed as is unfortunately the windscreen but {{the screen is}} large and gives a good view. The back seat has three armrests. The occasional seats fold away neatly, give enough support to the back and <b>knee</b> and toe <b>room</b> is well arranged. Equipment includes such fittings as: two interior lights, five blinds, parcel net and ventilator in the roof, bag pockets on the doors. Upholstery in the rear is cord and in front is leather. There is a large cupboard {{to the left of}} the instruments. An amplifying telephone (to the driver) is provided. The gear lever has a catch for reverse and a quiet-second together with syncro-mesh is provided. There are just the four brakes which are applied by rods and cables by hand lever or by pedal. The half-elliptical springs have Silentbloc shackle bushes and zinc interleaves and are damped by hydraulic shock absorbers. Price £575.|$|R
40|$|Background: The goal {{of total}} knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) is to restore knee kinematics. Knee prosthesis design plays {{a very important}} role in successful restoration. Here, kinematics models of normal and prosthetic knees were created and validated using previously published data. Methods: Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans of a healthy, anticorrosive female cadaver were used to establish a model of the entire lower limbs, including the femur, tibia, patella, fibula, distal femur cartilage, and medial and lateral menisci, as well as the anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, medial collateral, and lateral collateral ligaments. The data from the three-dimensional models of the normal knee joint and a posterior-stabilized (PS) knee prosthesis were imported into finite element analysis software to create the final kinematic model of the TKA prosthesis, which was then validated by comparison with a previous study. The displacement of the medial/lateral femur and the internal rotation angle of the tibia were analyzed during 0 - 135 ° flexion. Results: Both the output data trends and the measured values derived from the normal knee′s kinematics model were very close to the results reported in a previous in vivo study, suggesting that this model can be used for further analyses. The PS knee prosthesis underwent an abnormal forward displacement compared with the normal knee and has insufficient, or insufficiently aggressive, "rollback" compared with the lateral femur of the normal knee. In addition, a certain degree of reverse rotation occurs during flexion of the PS knee prosthesis. Conclusions: There were still several differences between the kinematics of the PS knee prosthesis and a normal <b>knee,</b> suggesting <b>room</b> for improving the design of the PS knee prosthesis. The abnormal kinematics during early flexion shows that the design of the articular surface played a vital role in improving the kinematics of the PS knee prosthesis...|$|R
60|$|Without an instant's {{hesitation}} {{she entered}} the room. Though the door was open--though so short a time had elapsed since the fourth Pouring that but {{little more than half}} the contemplated volume of gas had been produced as yet--the poisoned air seized her, like the grasp of a hand at her throat, like the twisting of a wire round her head. She found him on the floor {{at the foot of the}} bed: his head and one arm were toward the door, as if he had risen under the first feeling of drowsiness, and had sunk in the effort to leave the room. With the desperate concentration of strength of which women are capable in emergencies, she lifted him and dragged him out into the corridor. Her brain reeled as she laid him down, and crawled back on her <b>knees</b> to the <b>room</b> to shut out the poisoned air from pursuing them into the passage. After closing the door, she waited, without daring to look at him the while, for strength enough to rise and get to the window over the stairs. When the window was opened, when the keen air of the early winter morning blew steadily in, she ventured back to him and raised his head, and looked for the first time closely at his face.|$|R
5000|$|The car is {{moderately}} fast, best run 50 mph but {{it seemed}} to have a minor fault and should have reached 55 mph. Seating is comfortable with unusually generous <b>knee</b> <b>room</b> in the front seat. Of 5-seater owner-driver cars that have been submitted to The Times for trial this car, said the reviewer, is the best. He did consider the car a little narrow for five passengers but decided there is sufficient legroom ...|$|E
50|$|On January 17, 2012, Southwest {{introduced}} {{a plan to}} retrofit its fleet with a new interior. Improvements include a modern cabin design, lighter and more comfortable seats made of eco-friendly products, increased under-seat space, new netted seatback pockets to provide more <b>knee</b> <b>room,</b> a new fixed-wing headrest and improved ergonomics. All Boeing 737-700s, 115 -800s and 78 737-300s have the Evolve Interior. Though not originally planned, because of space saved, Southwest was able to fit an extra row of seats on its planes. All Boeing 737-800s have the Boeing Sky Interior, which features sculpted sidewalls and redesigned window housings, along with increased headroom and LED mood lighting.|$|E
5000|$|The first 530 (badged Matra Sports M530A) {{was shown}} to the public on March 7, 1967 at the Geneva Motor Show. It had a 70 DIN hp Ford 1699 cc V4 engine, which gave the car {{a top speed of}} 175 km/h. It entered {{production}} a month later, incorporating modifications that included the addition of a chrome bumper bar to provide much-needed protection from parking shunts for the front grill, a modest reshaping of the dashboard to give the passenger a little more <b>knee</b> <b>room,</b> and the repositioning of the ignition key to facilitate access. [...] In its first two production years, the chassis was built by Carrier in Alençon and assembly was undertaken by French coachbuilder Brissonneau et Lotz at Creil. The engine bay of the early model 530 was accessible by removing the acrylic glass rear window.|$|E
