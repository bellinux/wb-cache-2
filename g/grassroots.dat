5|$|Brown {{became a}} member of <b>Grassroots,</b> a {{political}} organization which was founded in 1986 by a group of block club leaders. Brown eventually served as {{a vice president of the}} organization.|$|E
5|$|Green {{parties in}} Europe have {{programs}} based on ecology, <b>grassroots</b> democracy, nonviolence, and social justice. Green parties {{are found in}} over one hundred countries, and most {{are members of the}} Global Green Network.|$|E
5|$|Hanson and Heath {{estimate}} that Plato's {{rejection of the}} Homeric tradition was not favorably received by the <b>grassroots</b> Greek civilization. The old myths were kept alive in local cults; they continued to influence poetry and to form the main subject of painting and sculpture.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, Southall {{endorsed}} Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. He {{was impressed}} by Labour's plans to commit 5% of Premier League football's £8.3billion broadcasting revenue back into the <b>grassroots</b> game, among other reasons.|$|E
5|$|Its stated primary aim is spiritual reformation of Islam by {{reaching}} out to Muslims across social and economic spectra and working at the <b>grassroots</b> level, to bring them {{in line with the}} group's understanding of Islam.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Communist rule in China, the social status of women {{improved}} greatly. Women were empowered to work outside the home. Communist rule also brought {{about the end of}} practices such as foot binding, child marriages, prostitution, and arranged marriages. China has seen a decrease in domestic violence due to government-supported <b>grassroots</b> programs to counter these practices. Women in rural areas remain largely uneducated.|$|E
5|$|Bantu Stephen Biko (18 December 1946– 12 September 1977) was a South African anti-apartheid activist. Ideologically an African {{nationalist}} and African socialist, {{he was at}} {{the forefront}} of a <b>grassroots</b> anti-apartheid campaign known as the Black Consciousness Movement during the late 1960s and 1970s. His ideas were articulated {{in a series of articles}} published under the pseudonym Frank Talk.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner {{served as}} counsel to state {{committees}} investigating violence in motion picture strikes and conditions in children's boarding homes and in {{homes for the}} elderly. In 1944, Chotiner {{was elected president of}} the conservative California Republican Assembly, a <b>grassroots</b> organization of party activists; he had previously {{served as president of the}} Los Angeles Republican Assembly. In addition to his political involvement, he was active in the Los Angeles Jewish Community Relations Committee.|$|E
5|$|I {{have been}} {{increasingly}} perturbed over the blatant {{disparity between the}} major role which Negro women have played and are playing in the crucial <b>grassroots</b> levels of our struggle and the minor role of leadership they have been assigned in the national policy-making decisions. It is indefensible to call a national march on Washington and send out a call which contains the name of not a single woman leader.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{graduates}} of state-run Shinto schools, such as Kokugakuin University and Kougakkan University, were implicitly allowed to become public school teachers. A {{greater number of}} better-trained priests with educations at state-supported schools, combined with a rising patriotic fervor, is believed by some to have seeded {{an environment in which}} <b>grassroots</b> Emperor worship was possible, even without financial support for local shrines.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{instead of}} the annual fashion show, the Angels (Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum, Gisele Bündchen, Adriana Lima, and Alessandra Ambrosio) did an Angels Across America Tour, a <b>grassroots</b> {{campaign}} for the brand visiting four major cities: New York City, Miami, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|In the 2006 congressional primaries, Emanuel, {{then head}} of the Democratic congressional {{campaign}} committee, helped organize a run by Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran with no political experience, against <b>grassroots</b> candidate Christine Cegelis in Illinois' 6th district. Expedited withdrawal from Iraq was a central point of Cegelis' campaign and Duckworth opposed a withdrawal timetable.|$|E
5|$|Local Conservative Associations {{began to}} educate {{citizens}} about the Party's platform and {{encouraged them to}} register to vote annually, as mandated by the Act. Press coverage of national politics in the local press was joined by in-depth reports on provincial politics in the national press. <b>Grassroots</b> Conservatives therefore saw themselves {{as part of a}} national political movement during the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 2013, the Afghan Green Trend - the <b>grassroots</b> {{movement}} led by Amrullah Saleh - {{organized a}} large athletic demonstration {{in support of}} the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). It also aimed at denouncing corruption, calling for a clean city and a clean municipality. The demonstration passed through the Afghan parliament building. The demonstrators chanted against the parliament's alleged corruption and denounced MPs who take bribes.|$|E
5|$|As a vegetarian, Higgins {{promoted}} {{the health benefits}} of not eating meat in a 2005 advertising campaign by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA); and has supported their anti-fur stance. She is interested in environmental issues and is involved with the Sierra Club, a <b>grassroots</b> organisation based in California. She has protested against the proposed industrialisation of the Kimberley region of Western Australia and donated the royalties from her 2009 EP More Than This. Since early 2007, Higgins has tried to make her tours carbon neutral, she purchases green energy to power venues, uses hybrid cars where possible and purchases carbon offsets.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1974, the LCL had {{undertaken}} some progressive reforms. They brought in a less conservative membership at the <b>grassroots</b> level, although the old guard was still prominent in parliamentary roles. They tried to broach the possibility of reintegrating the LM. Wilson and the new {{executive director of the}} LCL, John Vial were at the forefront, but the LM was optimistic about its future and refused unless the LCL changed leaders and allowed for explicitly separate urban and rural factions, which did not happen.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2006, Living River Siam began {{training}} other <b>grassroots</b> {{organizations in}} Thai Baan research, {{beginning with the}} Vietnam Rivers Network and expanding to a Chinese group in 2007. In 2008 they worked with the Burma Rivers Network to conduct research on the Salween River. They also assisted a United Nations-funded NGO, the Mekong Wetlands Biodiversity Programme (MWBP), with running Thai Baan research in 2004. Living River Siam, along with the MWBP, organizes cross-basin coordination between Thai Baan research groups.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1986 election, the Centre Democrats {{worked on}} {{improving}} both its image and its <b>grassroots</b> support. The strategy paid off with Janmaat winning {{a seat in}} the House of Representatives in the 1989 general election. By contesting the election in all nineteen constituencies, the party won the right to state-sponsored television and radio time but still had no more than 300 registered members. In the 1990 local elections the Centre Democrats won eleven seats, then, in the 1991 provincial elections, three seats in the provincial parliament.|$|E
5|$|GCC's {{advocacy}} activities included lobbying government officials, <b>grassroots</b> lobbying through {{press releases}} and advertising, participation in international climate conferences, {{criticism of the}} processes of international climate organizations, critiques of climate models, and personal attacks on scientists and environmentalists. Policy positions advocated by the coalition included denial of anthropogenic climate change, emphasizing the uncertainty in climatology, advocating for additional research, highlighting the benefits and downplaying the risks of climate change, stressing the priority of economic development, defending national sovereignty, and opposition to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|Iginla is a {{part owner}} of the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League, for whom he played during his junior hockey days. He {{purchased}} a minority share in the franchise, along with fellow NHL players Shane Doan, Mark Recchi and Darryl Sydor, in October 2007. He is also an ambassador with the NHL Diversity program, which supports youth hockey organizations that offer economically disadvantaged kids the opportunity to play. Since 2008, {{he has been a}} hockey spokesperson for Scotiabank, appearing in commercials and at events supporting its <b>grassroots</b> hockey programs, as well as for Samsung Canada.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Prince Sadruddin, {{together}} with Denis de Rougemont {{and a few}} other friends, established a Geneva-based think-tank, Groupe de Bellerive (named after Bellerive, the municipality where he lived in Geneva), and a non-profit organisation, the Bellerive Foundation. The foundation collaborated with international institutions, British and Scandinavian bilateral aid organizations, and other NGOs such as the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It became a leading <b>grassroots</b> action group promoting environmental protection, natural resource conservation and the safeguarding of life in all its forms.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the later kick-off time, travelling supporters from Liverpool faced major difficulties getting {{to and from the}} final after Virgin Trains cancelled the majority of its direct services between Liverpool Lime Street Station and London Euston with maintenance work taking place over the May Day bank holiday weekend. Both teams were allocated 25,074 tickets for the final, which was 7,000 fewer than they received for the semi-finals. 17,000 tickets went to Club Wembley members, who are effectively season ticket holders at Wembley Stadium, while the remainder went to the <b>grassroots</b> football community.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to form their own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into <b>grassroots</b> organizations.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 1950s, Carson {{turned her}} {{attention}} to conservation, especially some problems that she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a <b>grassroots</b> environmental movement that {{led to the creation of}} the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|Many long-time {{employees}} of Olympus Corp were shocked and angry, and felt {{betrayed by the}} executives who were responsible for bringing public humiliation onto the company. Former director Koji Miyata started a web site, called Olympus <b>Grassroots,</b> demanding clean-up at the company they say they love. Miyata also circulated a petition targeted at employees calling on the reinstatement of Woodford. As Olympus has a 70-percent market share in endoscopy, the scandal caused anxiety and concern among the medical profession, which sees Olympus endoscopes as irreplaceable.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{talk of the}} descent's {{reconstruction}} {{has been}} going since 2006, when a local <b>grassroots</b> organization aimed at saving the Andriyivskyy Descent collected more than 1,000 signatures to petition local authorities to take action on the descent's reconstruction. On June 23, 2009, the Kiev City Council administration approved {{the reconstruction of the}} Andriyivskyi Descent, which was officially announced a year earlier by Mayor Leonid Chernovetsky. The exact timeline for reconstruction has not yet been adopted, although the reconstruction's budget has been drafted in the city's 2010 budget.|$|E
5|$|Ripken is {{considered}} one of the best shortstops and third basemen in baseball history. At , , he pioneered the way for the success of taller, larger shortstops. He is a member of the 3,000 hit club and is behind Derek Jeter and Honus Wagner for most hits by a shortstop. Ripken is a best-selling author and the President and CEO of Ripken Baseball, Inc., whose goal is to grow the love of baseball from a <b>grassroots</b> level. Since his retirement, he has purchased three minor league baseball teams. He has been active in charity work throughout his career and is still considered an ambassador of the game.|$|E
5|$|The Manitoba Schools Question {{showed the}} deep {{divergence}} of cultural {{values in the}} territory. The Catholic Franco-Manitobans had been guaranteed a state-supported separate school system in the original constitution of Manitoba, but a <b>grassroots</b> political movement among English Protestants from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for French Catholic schools. The French Catholic minority asked {{the federal government for}} support; however, the Orange Order and other anti-Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them.|$|E
5|$|The protests {{reached a}} new level of {{visibility}} during 1993 as part of a <b>grassroots</b> campaign where protesters came from outside the area to support local opposition to the road. The initial focus was on the removal of a tree on George Green, east of Wanstead, that attracted the attention of local, then national media. The activity peaked in 1994 with several high-profile protesters setting up micronations on property scheduled for demolition, most notably on Claremont Road in Leyton. The final stage of the protest was a single building on Fillebrook Road in Leytonstone, which, due to a security blunder, became occupied by squatters.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of <b>grassroots</b> support.|$|E
5|$|Alternative rock is {{a diverse}} {{grouping}} of rock bands that in America developed {{largely from the}} hardcore scene in the 1980s in stark opposition to the mainstream music scene. Alternative rock subgenres that developed during the decade include indie rock, Gothic rock, noise rock, grunge, and college rock. Most alternative bands were unified by their collective debt to punk, which {{laid the groundwork for}} underground and alternative music in the 1970s. Though the genre is considered to be rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, alternative rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the <b>grassroots</b> establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, alternative bands laid the groundwork for the breakthrough of the genre in the American public consciousness in the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Boganda {{was born}} into a family of {{subsistence}} farmers, and was adopted and educated by Roman Catholic Church missionaries. In 1938, he was ordained as the first Roman Catholic priest from Oubangui-Chari. During World War II, Boganda served in a number of missions and after was persuaded by the Bishop of Bangui to enter politics. In 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the French National Assembly, where he maintained a political platform against racism and the colonial regime. He then returned to Oubangui-Chari to form a <b>grassroots</b> movement in opposition of French colonialism. The movement led to the 1949 foundation of the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN), which became popular among villagers and the working class. Boganda's reputation was slightly damaged when he was laicized from the priesthood after marrying Michelle Jourdain, a parliamentary secretary. Nonetheless, he continued to advocate for equal treatment and civil rights for blacks in the territory well into the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|China has {{installed}} a <b>grassroots</b> network of officials throughout Xinjiang, its predominantly Muslim north-west frontier region, to address social risks and spot {{early signs of}} unrest: Hundreds of cadres have been transferred from southern Xinjiang, the region’s poorest area, into socially unstable neighbourhoods of Ürümqi; a policy has been implemented where if all family members are unemployed, the government arranges for {{one person in the}} household to get a job,; official announcements are calling upon university students to register for those payouts. The areas around slums are being redeveloped to reduce social risks, opening way to new apartment blocks. However, independent observers believe that fundamental inequalities need to be addressed, and the mindset must change for there to be any success; Ilham Tohti warned that the new policy could attract more Han immigration, and further alienate the Uyghur population.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, {{like most}} of the New York State Democratic establishment, Brown was a {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton, the United States Senator from New York. This marked a break from his earlier political organization, <b>Grassroots,</b> which supported Barack Obama from the outset. He even ran to be a delegate for Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In July 2008, Golisano announced that he would attempt to create change in Albany by spending $5million on targeted campaigns. During the New York state September primary elections for state office, The New York Times alleged that Brown was aiding Golisano's attempt to unseat Sam Hoyt in the New York State Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Gay men {{and lesbians}} came {{together}} to work in <b>grassroots</b> political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E
