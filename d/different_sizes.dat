5|$|The Pythagorean tiling may be {{generalized}} to a three-dimensional tiling of Euclidean space by cubes of two <b>different</b> <b>sizes,</b> which also is unilateral and equitransitive. Attila Bölcskei calls this three-dimensional tiling the Rogers filling. He conjectures that, in any dimension greater than three, there is again a unique unilateral and equitransitive way of tiling space by hypercubes of two <b>different</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Burns and Rigby {{found several}} prototiles, {{including}} the Koch snowflake, {{that may be}} used to tile the plane only by using copies of the prototile in two or more <b>different</b> <b>sizes.</b> An earlier paper by Danzer, Grünbaum, and Shephard provides another example, a convex pentagon that tiles the plane only when combined in two sizes. Although the Pythagorean tiling uses two <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> of squares, the square does not have the same property as these prototiles of only tiling by similarity, because it also is possible to tile the plane using only squares of a single size.|$|E

5|$|The Pythagorean tiling is {{the unique}} tiling by squares of two <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> {{that is both}} {{unilateral}} (no two squares have a common side) and equitransitive (each two squares {{of the same size}} can be mapped into each other by a symmetry of the tiling).|$|E

5|$|According to Keller's conjecture, any tiling of {{the plane}} by {{congruent}} squares must include two squares that meet edge-to-edge. None of the squares in the Pythagorean tiling meet edge-to-edge, but this fact does not violate Keller's conjecture because the tiles have <b>different</b> <b>sizes,</b> so they are not all congruent to each other.|$|E

5|$|As {{was normal}} in metal type fonts {{of the period}} from Monotype and other companies, the font was drawn {{differently}} at <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> by modifying Griffo's original single-size design, a quite large letter at an approximate size of 15 points. The changes made were looser spacing, higher x-height (taller lower-case letters) and a more solid colour of impression at smaller sizes, and a finer, more graceful and tightly spaced design at large sizes.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids also exhibit both {{schooling}} and shoaling behaviours. Very young bigfin reef squids will also stay close together (shoaling), {{but do not}} swim together {{parallel to each other}} (schooling). Unlike most other squid species, bigfin reef squids are rarely cannibalistic. Shoals can include animals of <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> without the threat of larger members attacking and consuming the smaller members. Whether bigfin reef squids recognise each other individually still remains unknown.|$|E

An iterative computation is used to model ascent to limit the combined volume of the gas phase.

5|$|Design {{management}} {{is not a}} standard model that can be projected onto every enterprise, nor is there a specific way of applying it that leads to guaranteed success. Design management processes are carried out by humans with different responsibilities and backgrounds, who work in different industries and enterprises with <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> and traditions, whilst having different target groups and markets to serve. Design {{management is}} multifaceted, {{and so are the}} different applications of and views on design management. The function of design management in an organisation depends on its tasks, authority, and practice.|$|E
5|$|Flag {{hoisting}} {{ceremonies and}} cultural programmes {{take place in}} governmental and non-governmental institutions throughout the country. Schools and colleges conduct flag hoisting ceremonies and cultural events. Major government buildings are often adorned with strings of lights. In Delhi and some other cities, kite flying adds to the occasion. National flags of <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> are used abundantly to symbolise allegiance to the country. Citizens adorn their clothing, wristbands, cars, household accessories with replicas of the tri-colour. Over a period of time, the celebration has changed emphasis from nationalism to a broader celebration of all things India.|$|E

5|$|French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously {{examined}} Manutius's work (and, it is thought, De Aetna in particular) as {{a source}} of inspiration. This examination extended to in some cases copying his first 'M' shown in De Aetna which had no serif pointing out of the letter at top right, a design considered very eccentric. (It has been suggested {{to be the result of}} defective casting, especially since Manutius' later fonts do not show it.) The Griffo font was only cut in a single size, so French punchcutters made modified versions of the design to suit <b>different</b> <b>sizes,</b> with a more delicate structure at larger sizes.|$|E

Overall, I Corps fielded about 134,000 soldiers; 84,000 were regular soldiers and 50,000 belonged to the Regional and Popular Forces. Those forces were equipped with 449 tanks and armored vehicles, 418 artillery pieces, 64 M-42 Duster light air-defense weapons, 373 aircraft of different types, and 165 naval vessels of <b>different</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in beak size {{may have}} affected behaviour. Such dimorphism is common in other parrots, for example in the palm cockatoo and the New Zealand kaka. In species where it occurs, the sexes prefer food of <b>different</b> <b>sizes,</b> the males use their beaks in rituals, or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing. Similarly, the large difference {{between male and female}} head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though it is impossible to determine how.|$|E
5|$|The first {{remains were}} found in a bonebed {{discovered}} in 1989, which produced numerous ribs and vertebrae from the back and tail, {{as well as many}} limb bones, but no skull material aside from one tooth. Four osteoderms of <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> and shapes were also recovered from this bonebed. This material comes from several different individuals.

The smaller A-tile, denoted AS, is an obtuse Robinson triangle, while the larger A-tile, AL, is acute; in contrast, a smaller B-tile, denoted BS, is an acute Robinson triangle, while the larger B-tile, BL, is obtuse.|$|E
