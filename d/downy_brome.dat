40|$|<b>Downy</b> <b>brome</b> is an {{introduced}} Mediterranean annual {{grass that}} now dominates millions of hectares of western U. S. rangelands. The {{presence of this}} grass has eliminated many native species and accelerated wildfire cycles. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify soil additives that allowed germination but inhibited emergence of <b>downy</b> <b>brome,</b> while not affecting germination or emergence of the native perennial grass Hilaria jamesii. On the basis of data from previous studies, we focused on additives that altered the availability of soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Most water-soluble treatments inhibited <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> germination and emergence. We attribute the inhibitory effects of these treatments to excessive salinity and ion-specific effects of the additives themselves. An exception to this was oxalic acid, which showed no effect. Most water-insoluble treatments had no effect in soils with high P but did have an effect in soils with low P. Zeolite was effective regardless of P level, probably due to the high amounts of Na‚Å∫ it added to the soil solution. Most treatments at higher concentrations resulted in lower <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> emergence rates in soils currently dominated by <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> than in uninvaded (but theoretically invadable) Hilaria soils. This difference is possibly attributable to inherent differences in labile soil P. In Stipa soils, where Stipa spp. grow, but which are generally considered to be uninvadable by <b>downy</b> <b>brome,</b> additions of high amounts of N resulted in lower emergence. This may have been an effect of NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫ interference with uptake of K or other cations or toxicity of high N. We also saw a positive relationship between <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> emergence and pH in Stipa soils. Hilaria development parameters were not as susceptible to the treatments, regardless of concentration, as <b>downy</b> <b>brome.</b> Our results suggest that there are additions that may be effective management tools for inhibiting <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> in calcareous soils, including (1) high salt applications, (2) K-reducing additions (e. g., Mg), and (3) P-reducing additions...|$|E

Previous research has shown that pyridine growth regulator herbicides can affect seed production in annual grasses including <b>downy</b> <b>brome,</b> Japanese brome, wheat, and other cereal grain crops. Aminocyclopyrachlor is a pyridine carboxylic acid growth regulator herbicide that has recently been registered for broadleaf weed and brush control in nonagricultural areas, which may help facilitate release of native perennial grasses in native plant restoration sites. The influence of aminocyclopyrachlor on <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> seed production was evaluated at multiple application rates and timings under controlled field conditions. The effect of aminocyclopyrachlor on seed production was compared with aminopyralid, another pyridine growth regulator herbicide. When applied to <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> plants in the early vegetative stage (EPOST) at approximately 580 growing degree days (GDD), aminocyclopyrachlor at 320 g ae ha⁻¹ reduced seed germination by 50 to 88 % in the first and second study years, respectively. Aminopyralid reduced seed germination by 94 % in the first study year, but only 20 % in the second year. When applied to <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> plants in the early heading stage at approximately 1, 235 GDD (LPOST), aminocyclopyrachlor at 320 g ae ha⁻¹ reduced seed germination by 100 % both years. Aminopyralid reduced seed germination by 95 % in the first year, and 81 % in the second year. Other than the observed reduction in seed germination, herbicides did not produce any visible changes in <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> aboveground plant growth or development. Because <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> seeds are relatively short-lived in soil, aminocyclopyrachlor and aminopyralid applications to downy brome–infested rangelands and other natural areas could result in reductions in <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> population densities over time.

The main objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate allelopathic potential of various plant species on <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus tectorum L.), a major pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). To screen for potential allelopathy, plants were grown to flowering stage in a greenhouse, separated into shoots and roots, dried, and ground. Five percent aqueous extracts (w/v) were prepared by extracting 5 g of dried, ground plant samples with 100 mL of deionized water. <b>Downy</b> <b>brome</b> seeds were germinated on extract-amended sand. Extracts from most plant species tested inhibited <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> and wheat seed germination. Extracts from broadleaf plants were more inhibitory than extracts from cereal plants. In most plant species, shoot extracts were more inhibitory to growth of the root and shoot of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> than root extracts. Meadowfoam seed meal (Limnanthes alba Hartw.), yard-long bean [Vigna sesquipedalis (L.)

These interrelationships were studied in two salt desert sites where the local abundance of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus tectorum L.) varied spatially and increased more than 12 -fold over a 3 -yr period. We measured <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> percentage cover, resource availability, and soil chemical and physical properties within 112 plots per site and found significant negative associations between <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> abundance and both soil water content (P < 0. 05; r = - 0. 27 to - 0. 49) and nitrate accumulation (P < 0. 05; r = - 0. 34 to - 0. 45), which corroborated with the direction and strength of multivariate factor loadings assessed with principal component analysis. We then applied factorial combinations of prescribed burning and preemergence herbicide at management-relevant scales (i. e., 6 to 46 ha) as well as biomass removal to smaller plots (12. 25 m²) at both sites to determine their impact on <b>downy</b> <b>brome,</b> soil resources, and resident plant species.

This involves {{the absence of}} tillage during the fallow season. At planting time, the strip-till planter creates a narrow band into which the wheat seed is placed. The area between the rows is undisturbed except for the deposition of a 2 -cm thick layer of soil displaced from the tilled area. Chemical weed control is required between the rows. Preliminary work has shown that metribuzin [4 -amino- 6 -tert-butyl- 3 - (methylthio) -as-triazin- 5 (4 H) -one] is a promising herbicide for this purpose. Factors influencing the application, effectiveness, and selectivity of metribuzin {{used in conjunction with}} strip-till planting were investigated in the laboratory and greenhouse. Application of metribuzin in combination with liquid fertilizer would be convenient and economical. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the physical compatibility of four liquid fertilizers: Solution 32 at 56 kg N/ha, 10 - 34 - 0 at 45 kg P₂ 0 ₅/ha, 0 - 0 - 15 at 22 kg K/ha, and 11 - 0 - 0 - 26 at 22 kg S/ha, with three metribuzin formulations each of Sencor and Lexone at 112 g a. i. /ha. Wettable powder, flowable, and dispersible granule formulations of both Sencor and Lexone were tested. Only the wettable powder formulations were sufficiently compatible with the liquid fertilizers tested to be recommended for practical commercial use. Large differences were seen between the other formulations. Their use with liquid fertilizers might require the addition of compatibility agents or mixing them with water first, before adding them to the fertilizers. When compatibility is obtained after mixing them with water first, continuous agitation might be required to maintain the suspension. No major differences were observed between comparable formula tions of Sencor and Lexone. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the biological compatibility of Solution 32 and metribuzin on <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus teetorum LJ, the effect of Solution 32 on <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> and wheat emergence, the effect of soil layer on metribuzin effectiveness for <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> control, and the effect of banding width over the wheat row and wheat seeding depth on metribuzin phytotoxicity to wheat. More effective <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> control was obtained when metribuzin was mixed with Solution 32 than when it was used alone. Solution 32 was used at 0, 36, 54, and 79 kg N/ha, and metribuzin at 0, 14, 28, 56, and 112 g a. i. /ha. Solution 32 itself had some phytotoxic effects on <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> at the high rates. Wheat was not affected as severely as <b>downy</b> <b>brome.</b> Application of metribuzin {{to the surface of the}} newly deposited soil layer was more effective in controlling <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> than when the herbicide was applied and then covered with the soil layer. Results suggested that better <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> control could be obtained with metribuzin applied after the strip-tiller had deposited the soil layer between the rows, especially if adequate rainfall is expected. Under such rainfall conditions, metribuzin covered with a soil layer may leach deeper out of the root zone and less effectiveness could result. Both seeding depth of wheat and width of the unsprayed area were factors influencing metribuzin phytotoxicity to wheat. Greater wheat injury was observed when the herbicide was applied on top of, or too close to, the seed row, particularly when wheat was planted shallow.

In fall 2011, oilseed radish reduced the fresh weight of grapevine shoots removed with summer hedging 46 % compared to the grower control. In 2012, spring oats increased the weight of grapevine shoots removed with summer hedging 160 % compared to the grower control.

Chemically mown sorghum-sudangrass reduced total soluble solids in grape must 7 % compared to the grower control in 2012. <b>Downy</b> <b>brome</b> produced the most ground cover and greatest weed control at bloom time in 2011 and 2012, and harvest time in 2011.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{influence}} of certain environmental and edaphic factors on the germination and emergence of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus tectorum L.) {{was investigated in}} the laboratory. A preliminary {{study was conducted to}} determine the osmotic stability of mannitol and polyethylene glycol 20, 000 (PEG) solutions, which are commonly used to simulate water stress in seed germination studies, and to compare osmotic versus matric potential effects on the germination of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Lacking a weed seed source of known genetic uniformity and high percentage germination, wheat, which has both of these traits, was used as the test plant. Solutions of mannitol, PEG, and KCL (standard), with water potentials ranging from - 3. 5 to - 18. 0 bars, were incubated at 10, 20, and 30 C and analyzed periodically for water potential using thermocouple psychrometry. In addition, percentage and rate of germination of wheat seeds placed in moist soil or in 27 -day-old or freshly prepared solutions of mannitol and PEG were compared. The osmotic potential of the different mannitol solutions and the - 9. 1 and - 17. 4 bar PEG solutions did not change with time. However, the osmotic potential of the - 4. 0 and - 6. 4 bar PEG solutions decreased about 1. 0 bar. Percentage and rate of germination of winter wheat was the same in the 27 -day-old and freshly prepared mannitol and PEG solutions; but at equal potentials, the germination rate was most rapid in the mannitol solutions. Wheat emergence rate from watered soil was linearly related to germination rate in PEG, but not mannitol solutions. Hence, the slight instability of PEG solutions appears to be of no biological consequence in seed germination studies. The interactive {{influence of}} soil matric potential and temperature on the percentage of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> seedling emergence was determined using soil ranging in matric potentials from - 2 to - 16 bars, and incubated at alternating and constant mean temperatures from 5. 1 to 20 C. The interactive effects of soil bulk density, ranging from 0. 9 to 1. 3 g cm⁻³, and soil matric potentials, from - 2 to - 13 bars, on the percentage of seedling emergence was also examined. Reductions in soil matric potential markedly reduced the percentage of emergence. Overall, emergence was better at constant than at alternating temperatures. At higher matric potentials, <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> emerged faster at warmer temperatures, while at very low matric potentials the percentage of seedling emergence was least restricted at cooler temperatures. Cold soil temperatures markedly reduced emergence at all levels of soil moisture. Soil matric potentials did not affect the percentage of emergence of seedlings grown from seed lots harvested during climatologically diverse years. Emergence, but not germination, was inhibited by increased levels of soil compaction. No significant soil compaction x moisture interaction was observed as measured by final seedling emergence. Under rangeland and wasteland conditions, the successful seedling establishment of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> is probably most limited by warm, dry soils or very cold soils (subzero temperatures for part of the day). All other moisture-temperature conditions appear intermediate to these two extremes in effect on establishment. Under cultivated field conditions soil compaction appears to be the major factor controlling successful seedling establishment. The effect of high-temperature on overcoming initial postharvest dormancy, and the possible occurrence of natural endogenous germination rhythms in <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> seeds were investigated. Afterripening temperatures from 0 to 50 C, for periods of 0 to 28 days, had little effect on <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> germination in petri dishes at 15 and 20 C incubation temperature. However, at 30 C germination temperature, the percentage of germination was significantly increased by short periods of afterripening at 50 C. Similar results occurred at 20 to 40 C afterripening after 14 to 28 days exposure. In general, high-temperature afterripening conditions (40 to 50 C) initially increased <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> germination at 30 C incubation temperature, with prolonged exposure tending to decrease germination.

Field experiments were conducted between 2007 and 2009 to quantify the influence of cover crops on weed emergence, biomass accumulation, and seed production. Field experiments were established near Garden City, KS with winter wheat or fallow as main plots and cover crop treatments as subplots including five spring- and five fall-sown individual or mixtures of crop species and a no-cover chemical fallow. Separate 1 -m 2 quadrats were seeded with kochia or <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> at 500 seed/m 2. Kochia density was reduced by 75 % and biomass reduced by 88 % in fall-sown cover crops compared to chemical fallow across growing seasons. Spring-sown cover crop mixtures reduced kochia biomass in 2009 when kochia emergence was delayed. <b>Downy</b> <b>brome</b> biomass decreased exponentially as cover crop biomass increased. A second field experiment was established near Manhattan, KS with soybean, winter wheat, or grain sorghum phases of the rotation as main plots and six cover crop treatments as subplots sown after winter wheat harvest. Paired Palmer amaranth 1 -m 2 quadrats were seeded with 500 seed/m 2 in each cover crop subplot. One quadrat was protected from any herbicide application made to the cover crop or to the grain sorghum. Combining burndown application with high biomass-producing cover crops reduced Palmer amaranth emergence and biomass. Influence of cover crop presence reduced early season Palmer amaranth emergence in the subsequent grain sorghum phase. Optimal seeding rate of forage soybean sown in winter wheat stubble and its impact on Palmer amaranth and <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> emergence and growth were evaluated in field studies established near Manhattan and Hesston, KS in 2008 and 2009. Soybean was no-till drilled after wheat harvest at five rates ranging from 100, 000 to 600, 000 seeds/ha. A no-cover chemical fallow treatment was included. Separate 0. 5 -m 2 quadrats were seeded with Palmer amaranth at 100 seed/ 0. 5 m 2 or with <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> at 250 seed/ 0. 5 m 2. Three termination methods evaluated were killing frost, glyphosate application, or crop rolling. Palmer amaranth density was not affected by treatments but biomass decreased as soybean seeding rate and crop biomass increased. <b>Downy</b> <b>brome</b> emergence was less with rolled or sprayed termination methods in one site year as timing of termination was optimal. High biomass producing cover crops sown during the fallow phase of a crop rotation reduced weed emergence, density, and biomass accumulation. Cover crops can be part of an integrated weed management plan in Kansas...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the competitive ability with weeds of the short-strawed Gaines variety wheat and taller growing varieties under different fertility levels at three experimental locations. The experiments were designed so that the effects of variety, nitrogen fertilization, and weed competition could be evaluated. The interactions between these factors were also studied. Ryegrass (Loolium app.) and <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus tectorum) were the two weed species studied. Under high winter rainfall and ryegrass competition yields of wheat were seriously impaired in both the short and tall growing wheat varieties tested. As rates of nitrogen increased yields of wheat did not increase where a medium or heavy stand of ryegrass was present. Yield of wheat was reduced under high nitrogen and high ryegrass competition. A response to 60 pounds of nitrogen per acre was noted where no ryegrass competition was present. One hundred twenty pounds of nitrogen did not increase yields appreciably, especially in the Gaines variety. In the two remaining experiments, response to nitrogen fertilization was not as prominent due to lack of moisture throughout the growing season. However, <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> competition decreased yields at one location under all three fertility levels. At the other location a poor stand of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> and arid conditions accounted for the lack of competitive effects. No differences were noted in competing abilities of the tall vs. the short growing varieties. In general it was concluded that in order to get maximum response from nitrogen fertilization in wheat, weeds would have to be controlled...|$|E

Wheat yields in plowed NT treatments were 30 and 9 % greater in the first and third crops following tillage, respectively, compared with undisturbed NT. Soil quality indicators assessed were organic C (OC), total N, inorganic N, pH, electrical conductivity, bulk density, water infiltration rate, and pore-size distribution. Five years after tillage, soil OC decline in the 0 - to 7. 5 -cm depth was 20 % in plowed compared with undisturbed NT; however, OC increased 15 % in the 7. 5 - to 15 -cm depth and was not different in the 0 - to 30 -cm depth.

Individual plants were grown in two-plant neighborhoods, and a K 15 NO 3 tracer was injected into the soil between plants and recovered from leaf material after 5 to 11 d. We also evaluated neighbor effects on shoot and root growth, leaf carbon:nitrogen ratio, and leaf nitrogen concentrations to better understand how these traits are associated with differences in nitrate acquisition and nitrogen allocation among the three growth forms. Nitrate acquisitions by crested wheatgrass and western yarrow were significantly lower when competing with <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> than with dyer 2 ̆ 7 s woad and prostrate kochia; however, competitors had similar, negative effects on nitrate acquisition by big sagebrush. Nitrate acquisition ratios between competing neighbors revealed that: (1) the grasses always acquired more nitrate than neighbors of a different growth form, (2) western yarrow was equally competitive with dyer 2 ̆ 7 s woad and prostrate kochia, and (3) all neighbors acquired more nitrate than big sagebrush.

This study also evaluated whether a cover crop could affect corn rootworm and other ground dwelling arthropods in the cornfield. In the first study, <b>downy</b> <b>brome,</b> Bromus tectorum L., was used as the winter cover crop. There were two trials repeated for three years each. Each trial included: two amounts of irrigation, <b>downy</b> <b>brome,</b> and herbicide to control weeds. In the first trial {{there were no significant differences}} in corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera LeConte, damage across treatments, because there were no differences in brome residue across the treatments. In the second trial, corn rootworm damage was significantly more in plots with higher amounts of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> residue. There were no differences in numbers of spider mites: Banks grass mites, Oligonychus pratensis (Banks) or twospotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae Koch, across treatments. Spider mite populations appeared to be suppressed by the predatory mite Neoseiulus spp., which also overwintered in the cover crop. Corn rootworm samples taken from a no-till irrigation experiment were variable among irrigation treatments but indicated a trend for rootworm damage to increase with increasing irrigation. In the second study, winter wheat, Triticum aestivum L., was used as the winter cover crop. There were three trials repeated for three years each. Each trial included two amounts of irrigation and winter wheat and three amounts of herbicide to control weeds. Upon completion of the agronomy trials, the plots were split into two subplots and one was tilled. Pitfall traps were installed to capture ground dwelling arthropods: (Coleoptera: Carabidae), wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) and crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Four carabid genera were more common under no-till conditions. One was more common in tilled plots. Five carabid genera were more common in plots with a history of high weed densities.

The published article is copyrighted by the Weed Science Society of America {{and can be found}} at: [URL] Weed Science Society of America has designated the publisher's version as an Open Access article. Farmers typically use three applications of glyphosate to control weeds in no-till fallow. Some are now experimenting with an unconventional modification to this widely used approach. This modified approach is based on an intentional delay in {{the time of the first}} spraying. Farmers delay their first spraying because they want to rely on competition from winter annual grasses to suppress the growth of Russian thistle and eliminate the need for a third application. Optimism for this kind of weed-control program is tempered by concerns related to soil water storage. The objective of this research was to evaluate effects of delayed control of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> and volunteer winter wheat on the plant-available water content of, and loss of water from, no-till fallow. Treatments, applied to plots arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications, were distinguished by the time of the initial glyphosate application. The initial early-season treatment was applied as soon as possible after emergence of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> and volunteer winter wheat. Initial mid-season and late-season treatments were applied 4 and 6 wk later, respectively. The amount of plant-available water in the soil profile ranged from 71. 8 to 153. 7 mm in May and 16. 5 to 80. 9 mm in September. Water loss was usually minimized in plots treated with the initial early-season treatment. An exception to this trend occurred at a site where the density of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> and volunteer winter wheat was greater than average. Abated water loss from the initial late-season treatment, at this site, may have been a consequence of reduced evaporation caused by a decrease in near-surface wind speed and deflection of solar radiation away from soil.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyJ. Anita DilleIntegrated weed {{management}} (IWM) is {{an ecological}} approach to weed control that reduces dependence on herbicides through understanding of weed biology and involves using multiple weed control measures including cultural, chemical, mechanical and biological methods. The critical period of weed control is {{the duration of}} the crop life cycle in which it must be kept weed-free to prevent yield loss from weed interference. Eight experiments were conducted throughout Kansas between October 2010 and June 2012 to identify this period in winter wheat grown under dryland and irrigated conditions. Impact of henbit and <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> density on winter wheat yields were evaluated on four farmer’s fields with natural populations and on a research station with overseeded populations. Henbit density up to 156 plants m- 2 did not affect winter wheat yield, while <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> at a density of 40 plants m- 2 reduced yield by 33 and 13 % in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In the presence of <b>downy</b> <b>brome,</b> winter wheat should be kept weed-free approximately 30 to 45 days after planting to prevent yield loss; otherwise, weeds need to be removed immediately following release from winter dormancy to prevent yield loss due to existing weed populations. Flumioxazin and pyroxasulfone are herbicides registered for use in winter wheat, soybean and corn for control of broadleaf and grass weeds. Flumioxazin and pyroxasulfone were evaluated for plant response to localized herbicide exposure to roots, shoots, or both roots and shoots utilizing a novel technique. Two weed species, ivyleaf morningglory and shattercane, as well as two crops, wheat and soybean, were evaluated for injury after localized exposures. The location and expression of symptoms from the flumioxazin and pyroxasulfone herbicides were determined to be the shoot of seedling plants. The utilization of preemergence herbicides in winter wheat is not a common practice, although application may protect winter wheat from early season yield losses as determined by the critical weed-free period. Kansas wheat growers should evaluate the presence and density of weed species to determine which weed management strategy is most advantageous to preserving winter wheat yield...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 <b>Downy</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus tectorum. L.), {{a serious}} grass weed in eastern Oregon can be {{partially}} controlled in wheat by metribuzin [4 -amino- 6 -tertbutyl- 3 -(methylthio) -as triazin - 5 (4 H) -one]. However, cultivars of many crops Lave {{been reported to}} differ in their level of tolerance to metribuzin. This lack of tolerance {{has led to the}} investigation of other compounds, such as the ethylthio analog of metribuzin [4 -amino- 6 -tert-butyI- 3 -(ethylthio) -as-triazin- 5 (4 H) -on], for selective control of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> in wheat. Greenhouse and growth chamber experiments on wheat, growing in soil or nutrient solution showed that: 1) GR 50 values for Stephens, Hill 81, Yanahill, and Malcolm in soil were 0. 41, 0. 23, 0. 25, and 0. 44 kg/ha, respectively, for metribuzin and 1. 89, 1. 29, 1. 37, and 1. 97 kg/ha, respectively, for ethyl metribuzin; 2) GR 50 values for these cultivars in nutrient solution were 3. 26, 1. 17, 1. 32, and 3. 87 uM, respectively, for metribuzin and 12. 69, 7. 20, 7. 19, and 13. 41 uM, respectively, for ethyl metribuzin; 3) Uptake of both herbicides.; by wheat was through the roots; 4) Cultivars did not show any differences in herbicide absorption from the nutrient solution. Therefore, differences in varietal tolerance may be are due to biochemical or physiological reasons, but are not due to differences in herbicide uptake. Increased growth at lower concentrations of these herbicides was observed in all cultivars studied. Metribuzin was five times more active than ethyl metribuzin. Both of these herbicides can be applied as an early postemergence treatment at the 3 leaf stage of wheat for effective control of <b>downy</b> <b>brome.</b> Yield components of the four cultivars were measured in response to metribuzin and ethyl metribuzin at two ecologically different sites.

A. to establish the relationship among weed competitive wheat growth parameters and dry weight of weeds. Attempts were made to identify high yielding, weed competitive winter wheat cultivars for the Central Great Plains region. Winter wheat cultivars were grown with and without <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus tectorum L.) in 1981 - 82 and the experiment was repeated in 1982 - 83 {{with the addition of}} field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.). ^ Significant reduction in the dry matter of both weeds occurred due to high canopy diameter and tiller number of wheat. Higher canopy diameter and tiller number cultivars probably possessed more leaf area index, occupied more land space, utilized more photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and more thoroughly shaded weeds. Continuous shading decreased photosynthetic efficiency of weeds and made them less vigorous competitors. Thus, less dry weight of weeds was observed with increasing wheat canopy diameter and tiller number. ^ The inverse linear regression of decreasing dry weight of weeds with increasing wheat canopy diameter and tiller number was significant irrespective of the weed species, location, and growing season. Experiments under heavy weed infested plots in 1982 - 83 indicated the importance of each centimeter of canopy diameter and tillers of crop in assisting with weed management. Dry weight of weeds at intercept was 1 kg m(2 ̆ 7 - 2) in each regression equation of crop parameters. Rate of decline in the dry weight of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> was 45 g cm(2 ̆ 7 - 1) m(2 ̆ 7 - 2) due to canopy diameter. Tillers reduced dry weight of <b>downy</b> <b>brome</b> by about 1 g tiller(2 ̆ 7 - 1) m(2 ̆ 7 - 2). ^ Choosing cultivars based solely on the relative weed competitiveness led to the identification of some low yeilding cultivars. In order to identify high yielding, weed competitive cultivars for weed infested areas, selection should be based both on grain yield and weed competition. NE 78798, SD 75284, and Vona were the high yielding, weed competitive cultivars. The widely grown Centurk 78 was not high yielding under heavy weed infested areas. Therefore, NE 78798, SD 75284, and Vona would be acceptable culivars for weed infested areas of the Central Great Plains. ...|$|E
