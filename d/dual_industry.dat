A <b>dual</b> <b>industry</b> structure refers to the simultaneous existence of two groups of firms within an industry which differ in terms of bargaining power and product and labor market performance: sales and job fluctuation levels should be higher in the dominated group, and job security lower. Empirical analysis of the clothing industry in the Netherlands for the period 1980 - 1992 confirms the hypotheses for the largest part.

40|$|For several decades, BC’s forest {{industries}} {{have been in}} crisis, experiencing a sequence of booms and busts. Beginning with the 1980 s recession, which is widely recognized as a paradigmatic turning point, the industry has undergone extensive restructuring. Simultaneously, harvest levels started to decline, marking entry onto the so-called plateau stage of the resource cycle. This thesis examines the industrial restructuring of BC’s {{forest industries}} since 1980. Conceptually, the theoretical framework integrates the industry life-cycle model with the resource cycle thesis to create the RILCM (resource industry life-cycle model). The RILCM recognizes the distinctive trajectories of resource industries {{as a result of}} their direct exploitation of nature, vulnerability to economic and non-economic influences, and booming and busting. This thesis argues that the high volatility of BC’s forest economy is not simply demand-driven but results from the combined influences of paradigmatic industrial change, declines in resource availability and increased trade, environmental and cultural conflicts that have initiated a significant re-regulation of BC’s forest economy. Empirically, this thesis applies both qualitative and quantitative research methods; those include time-series analysis, comparative static analysis based on information retrieved from industrial directories, a corporate case study of Canfor, BC’s largest forest firm, and a field survey of surviving sawmills. In evolutionary perspective, BC’s forest industries enjoyed stable growth from 1946 to 1970. Growth rates became more volatile during the 1970 s and have leveled off or declined from 1980. In terms of industrial organization, rationalization and consolidation resulted in aggregate job loss, factory closures and the breaking up of the large previously dominant Fordist corporations. Restructuring has led to the evolution of a <b>dual</b> <b>industry</b> structure and re-defined core-periphery relations. Thus commodity production in large sawmills and pulp mills continues in the periphery, a dynamic value-added segment has emerged in Metro Vancouver and other urban cores. More generally this thesis argues the need for understanding how regions and industries respond to prolonged periods of crisis and volatility. Evolutionary approaches to economic geography need to incorporate resource peripheries and crisis and acknowledge the role of non-economic factors in shaping regional transformation...|$|E
40|$|The {{chronicle of}} crises {{is added to}} {{regularly}} as major natural disasters and man-made conflicts hit populations from the wealthy West to the poorest quarters of the world's most remote regions. The resulting disruption generates fear and panic with repercussions that have far-reaching implications for everyday life and the modern systems that support it. Within these crises, tourism is a major casualty and its plight is exacerbated by the vector of {{media coverage of the}} event. This thesis studies the crisis relationship between tourism and media when news coverage is at its peak and holiday regions and business operators lose control over their immediate destiny. The research analyses through four case studies significant disasters that were of such magnitude that their impact was global: the UK‘s foot and mouth disease outbreak of 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States in September 2001, the Bali bombings in 2002 and the SARS contagion of 2003. Each disaster dominated the world‘s media from the outset and had far-reaching implications for global tourism systems. They are assessed within the <b>dual</b> <b>industry</b> context of media and tourism using qualitative analysis methods including ethnographic inquiry, media content analysis and case study analysis. An underpinning supplementary series of four vignettes outlines a contextual range of media and tourism operating activities, starting with a study of "normal" news coverage and ending with an ethnographic study of a newsroom during a developing crisis. While there has been much study of crisis management in tourism, and many models proposed, this research identifies stages in the assessed crises that conform to the principles of Chaos Theory. That is, when the intensity of a crisis is such that the contextual system of known order is destroyed. By comparing media and tourism actions during the case studies against Chaos Theory principals, a defining theoretical adjunct is provided to the findings. The research finds that the media is a constant force of stability in the non-linear dynamics of chaos unleashed by the case study disasters. The findings are used to develop a chaos-themed Protocol of Media Response for Tourism from which industry can develop strategies for earlier recovery from crisis, including acting within the chaotic environment to enhance post-crisis recovery prospects...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the evolution of market concentration and competition in Malaysian <b>dual</b> banking <b>industry</b> for the period of 1997 - 2013. This study utilized structural approach to investigate changes in the market structure particularly the level of concentration and competition that contributed by several structural changes which take place in the dual banking system. According to structural approach, concentration plays an important role in examining the link between concentration and competition. Therefore, present paper utilized the structural approach to measure various concentration indexes to provide significant evidence on the changes in the market structure of Malaysian banking industry for the largest available data set of 1997 - 2013. Pearson correlation analysis was also used to examine the consistency of those various measures used in this study. The paper found evidence that structural changes have altered the market structure of the banking industry which comprises of Islamic and conventional banking system. The results also indicate that <b>dual</b> banking <b>industry</b> operates in the monopolistic competition structure. Therefore, concentration indexes can be used by authorities to decide on the optimal number of banks operating in the industry...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to offer a complementary approach to the field of influence and the socalled 'Matrioshka principal' (Sonis and Hewings, 1990); the objectives are to identify simple row-column associations (i. e. statistical dependence), seek hierarchical associations between supply and demand in input-output systems and the decomposition of economic complexity into finite stages. For the identification of simple dependencies between rows and columns, we use a log-linear regression and for hierarchical associations and the identification of complexity stages, we use the data analysis technique known as dual scaling. Results of both approaches will be applied to input-output tables of the US and Canada. <b>Dual</b> scaling; <b>industry</b> associations; loops; economic complexity...|$|R

This work is aimed at evaluating the effects of three different welding technologies (GTAW, PAW, EBW) on dual phase DP 600 steel properties.

40|$|Aluminium alloys and {{advanced}} high strength steels have acquired {{a major role}} in the lightening of vehicle structures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, transport industry still lacks of efficient methods to join aluminium and steel in a dissimilar weld. Several efforts have been made to adapt friction stir welding (FSW) to join these two materials; however, the low advancing speeds achieved and the high wear of the tool remain major issues. In this framework, an innovative process, based on FSW and named as ‘friction melt bonding' (FMB), has been conceived for a lap-joint configuration and relies on the highly different melting temperatures of Al and steel and the formation of Fe/Al intermetallics, characteristics that have traditionally been drawbacks for other welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding. For this process, the sheets to be welded are stacked and clamped together, placing the material with higher melting temperature (steel) on the top and the one with lower melting temperature (aluminium) at the bottom. A pinless rotating cylindrical tool is pressed against the steel surface, generating heat as done in FSW, by both friction and plastic deformation of the steel under the tool. Subsequently, heat is transmitted through the steel to the aluminium,partially melting it at the interface. The molten aluminium reacts with the steel creating a controlled intermetallic layer (IML) establishing the mechanical bond. FMB shows as main advantages the simplicity of the tool and the high advancing speeds that can be reached, up to 1 m/min. Firsts campaigns of tests performed on nearly-pure grades (ultra-low-carbon steel and Al 1050) confirmed the strength of the bonding and intermetallic thicknesses that go down to 2 μm. The process is now adapted to two common grades of the automotive <b>industry,</b> <b>dual</b> phase steel and the age-hardenable Al 6061. The effect of the process parameters on the thermomechanical cycles, and, therefore, on the joint formation and the microstructure evolution is assessed. Welds were carried out at different rotational and advancing speeds with different back plates. During the welding, temperatures were measured placing thermocouples around the tool path in both advancing and retreating sides. SEM observations revealed that the IML layer thickness decreases as the advancing speed increases. Optical observations on the DP steel combined with micro-hardness measurements showed the evolution of the microstructure. In the heat affected zone the steel was tempered,while in the thermo-mechanically affected zone, the annealing temperatures and fast cooling rates lead to microstructures mainly dominated by martensite and bainite. Aluminium shows columnar dendritic microstructures and segregation in the fusion zone as well as some porosity for higher advancing speeds. Lap-shear and tensile tests were also performed in order to assess the mechanical behaviour of the welds...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{proposition}} that growth and development in the screen and creative industries {{is not confined to}} the major capital cities. Lifestyle considerations, combined with advances in digital technology, convergence and greater access to broadband are altering requirements for geographic location, and creative workers are being drawn away from the big metropolises to certain regional areas. Regional screen industry enclaves are emerging outside of London, in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, in Nova Scotia in Canada and in New Zealand. In the Australian context, the proposition is tested in an area regarded as a ‘special case’ in creative industry expansion: the Northern Rivers region of NSW. A key feature of the ‘specialness’ of this region is the large number of experienced, credited producers who live and operate their businesses within the region. The development of screen and creative industries in the Northern Rivers over the decade 2000 – 2010 has implications for regional regeneration and offers new insights into the rapidly changing screen industry landscape. This development also has implications for creative industry discourse, especially the dominance of the urban in creative industries thought. The research is pioneering in a number of ways. Building on the work conducted for my Masters thesis in 2000, a second study was conducted during the research phase, adapting creative industries theory and mapping methods, which have been largely city and nation-centric, and applying them to a regional context. The study adopted an action research approach as an industry development strategy for screen industries, {{while at the same time}} developing fine-grained ground up methods for collecting primary quantitative data on the size and scope of the creative industries. In accordance with the action research framework, the researcher also acted in the <b>dual</b> roles of <b>industry</b> activist and screen industry producer in the region. The central focus of the research has been both to document and contribute to the growth and development of screen and creative industries over the past decade in the Northern Rivers region. These interventions, along with policy developments at both a local and national level, and broader global shifts, have had the effect of repositioning the sector from a marginal one to a priority area considered integral to the future economic and cultural life of the region. The research includes a detailed mapping study undertaken in 2005 with comparisons to an earlier 2000 study and to ABS data for 2001 and 2006 to reveal growth trends. It also includes two case studies of projects that developed from idea to production and completion in the region during the decade in question. The studies reveal the drivers, impediments and policy implications for sustaining the development of screen industries in a regional area. A major finding of the research was the large and increasing number of experienced producers who operate within the region and the leadership role they play in driving the development of the emerging local industry. The two case studies demonstrate the impact of policy decisions on local screen industry producers and their enterprises. A brief overview of research in other regional areas is presented, including two international examples, and what they reveal about regional regeneration.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{barriers}} in the analysis and design of materials processing and industrial applications {{is the lack of}} accurate experimental data on the thermophysical properties of materials. To date, the measurement of most of these high-temperature thermophysical properties has often been plagued by temperature lags that are inherent in measurement techniques. These lags can be accounted for with the appropriate mathematical models, reflecting the experimental apparatus and sample region, in order to deduce the desired measurement as a function of true sample temperature. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) measurements are routinely used to determine enthalpies of phase change, phase transition temperatures, glass transition temperatures, and heat capacities. In the aluminum, steel, and metal casting industries, predicting the formation of defects such as shrinkage voids, microporosity, and macrosegregation is limited by the data available on fraction solid and density evolution during solidification. Dilatometer measurements are routinely used to determine the density of a sample at various temperatures. An accurate determination of the thermophysical properties of materials is needed to achieve accuracy in the numerical simulations used to improve or design new material processes. In most of the instruments used to measure properties, the temperature is changed according to instrument controllers and there is a nonhomogeneous temperature distribution within the instrument. Additionally, the sample temperature cannot be measured directly: temperature data are collected from a thermocouple that is placed at a different location than that of the sample, thus introducing a time lag. The goal of this project was to extend the utility, quality and accuracy of two types of commercial instruments -a DSC and a dilatometer - used for thermophysical property measurements in high-temperature environments. In particular, the quantification of solid fraction and density during solidification was deemed of critical importance. To accomplish this project goal, we redesigned sample holders and developed inverse mathematical methods to account for system lags. The desired property could then be correlated to the proper sample temperature. For the NETZSCH DSC 404 C instrument with a high-accuracy heat capacity sensor, a mathematical model was developed by assuming that each component was isothermal and that the heat transfer among components occurred by conduction and radiation. Model parameters included effective conduction time constants and radiation time constants. Several model cases were investigated to assess the effect of heat transfer interactions. New features that have not been considered in previous DSC models were included in the present study. These new features included (a) considering the sensor platform, (b) accounting for the heat loss through the stem, and (c) considering the lag between furnace temperature and set point temperature. Comparisons with experimental results showed that temperature lags in heat flux DSC instruments could be determined by performing a heat transfer analysis based on a comprehensive model. The proposed mathematical model yielded accurate results over a wide temperature range during heating and cooling regimes. The induced thermal lag in the Theta <b>Industries</b> <b>dual</b> push-rod horizontal dilatometer is apparent owing to the distance of the thermocouple from the actual sample. In a near steady-state mode of operation, this apparent problem is minimal. However, in a transient situation, where the density is varying as a function of time, the temperature output from the remote temperature sensor must be adjusted in order to reflect the sample temperature. The conventional push-rod dilatometer insert was modified significantly to allow an accurate correlation of the measured density to the predicted sample temperature of alloys in the phase-change regime. This new configuration made use of a standard furnace assembly; however, the specimen was symmetrically encased in a well-instrumented cylindrical graphite shell. The new insert was designed, fabricated, instrumented, calibrated, and tested. It was demonstrated, using an array of high-precision thermocouples, that a nearly uniform temperature distribution existed in the sample holder. The combination of system geometry and high-conductivity sample holder material promoted the development of a simplified but highly effective inverse heat transfer model. The prediction of this model properly correlated the measured density in the phase change regime to that of the actual sample temperature based on using remote, sample-holder temperature measurements. It was demonstrated (using A 356) that accurate modeling of the solid fraction was important for accounting for thermal lags in the phase-change regime. Additionally, the average heat transfer coefficient during phase change was also calculated and compared to existing results...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry {{has a unique}} dual role within society in that the companies within the industry develop and distribute health care products in a for-profit manner. Safety and ethical concerns have resulted {{in an industry that}} is one of the most highly regulated globally. Controversies have developed around perceived conflicts of interest emerging from this dual role due to the industry’s size, influence, and primary responsibility to society as a developer and provider of innovative medicines. While public awareness of these controversies has grown, so have global concerns regarding the financial, social, and medical health of individuals. Even as the industry faces persistent and increasing criticism for improperly managing the social responsibilities attributed to its <b>dual</b> role, the <b>industry</b> has increasingly engaged in CSR activities. Presently, companies in the {{pharmaceutical industry}} are under pressure to be even more comprehensive and strategic in their approaches to CSR engagement. The purpose of this study was to examine practices and perceptions of CSR within the pharmaceutical industry. Specifically, the study sought to gain an understanding of the perceptions of middle and senior managers of why and how their companies engage in CSR. The study consisted of two qualitative and complementary research methods. The primary research method was semi-structured interviews with managers lasting up to one hour. The secondary research method involved the collection and analysis of CSR-related publications from pharmaceutical companies. A multiple source approach was used for three specific reasons: 1) triangulate and confirm validity of primary data; 2) identify new areas or gaps in the literature not previously identified; and 3) create a more well-rounded understanding of why and how the pharmaceutical industry engages in CSR. For the interview portion of the study, the population consisted of middle-to-high-level managers of multinational pharmaceutical companies operating in North America, who either had significant responsibilities related to their company’s CSR decision-making process or were participants in such programs. The study population for the publication analysis included those pharmaceutical companies whose managers participated in the interview portion of the study. Formal e-mail correspondence was used to contact and invite potential study participants who were informed of the purpose and scope of the research. Non-random, purposive sampling was used to select those within the two key groups of managers deemed to be in a position to provide rich perspectives on the CSR decision-making process within their companies; those engaged with external stakeholders and those with defined roles in CSR. A constructivist grounded theory methodology was applied to the interview process, including the interview guide and data analysis, with the end goal of creating a substantive theory. Coding and categorizing began during the collection of data, and proceeded in a non-linear fashion to allow for the constant comparing and analyzing of the data. These iterative and circular processes developed into theoretical pathways that required further examining and provided additional data. Memos and diagrams were used as markers for thoughts and creative tools to further analyze the components of the developing theory. The result was a theory constructed from multiple perspectives and woven into a multi-story narrative. Managers from eleven companies (nine brand name and two generic) participated in the study. In total, 22 interviews were completed, and consisted of fifteen Canadian managers, six American managers, and one British manager. Additionally, there were three companies where interviews were conducted with managers from both Canadian and American affiliates of the same company. The positions held by respondents within their respective companies included those directly involved in creating, implementing, and reporting on CSR programs and policies, and those distanced from, but still affected by them. The range of perspectives based upon the positions held by participants provided an insightful range of interpretations regarding CSR within the pharmaceutical industry. The resulting substantive theory and its accompanying model present an evidence-based framework for the industry’s process of CSR evolution (core category) and articulate the relationships, interactions, and influences of its four subcategories: 1) social context; 2) CSR perspectives; 3) continual development and reinforcement process (CDRP); and 4) symbiotic continuum. The substantive theory suggests that the pharmaceutical industry is in a process of institutional change, with previously taken-for-granted perspectives and strategies in conflict with, and contested within, the social context of the industry. CSR is no longer just a pragmatic/moral strategy to gain, maintain, and repair legitimacy using loosely coupled practices and structures. Logical connections and framing developed and reinforced by institutional entrepreneurs and their resources have constructed the identity of CSR as an umbrella business strategy that can universally resonate with stakeholders and thereby create greater connectedness with operational locals and stakeholders. Subsequently, CSR can be used to mitigate risks and uncertainties while also fostering a motivated and controlled workforce by reinforcing the internalization of desired meanings relating to the role of CSR. By integrating and merging internal and external conceptions of what is considered ‘right’ and how to serve the self-interest of others in addition to their own, companies capture wider social movements in an attempt to find or construct opportunities to enhance their potential for long-term success and sustainability. If these opportunities mean diverting assets and expertise to address social needs, and in so doing, result in tangible (e. g. market entrance) and intangible (e. g. motivated workforce) returns on these investments, then CSR becomes justified and legitimized by bridging the changing institutional logic...|$|R
