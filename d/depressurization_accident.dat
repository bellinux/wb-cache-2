40|$|The present {{estimation}} of the HTR 500 design concept attempts to filter the risk-relevant accidents out of the whole spectrum of possible accident sequences and to assess the risk they cause using methods of risk analysis. Accidents with loss of forced convection, so-called core heatup accidents, represent the dominant risk; those with additional failure of the liner cooling system account for half of the integral societal risk of late fatalities, {{which is expected to}} be below 10 $^{- 3 }$ per annum despite the still comparatively large uncertainties of the analysis. Maximum late fatalities slightly exceed 3000 persons, no early fatalities are computed for anycase. Water ingress and <b>depressurization</b> <b>accidents</b> are of minor significance. The risk therefore keeps clear off figures for a pressurized water reactor of equal power. The selected safety concept proved to be well-balanced; the essential safety systems are acceptable in our view.

40|$|Accidents {{caused by}} the ingress of water into the reactor core, which are {{initiated}} by steam generator leaks» contribute - due to weaknesses in the design to the overall risk of the HTR- 1160. The water, which is able {{to enter into the}} primary circuit particularly as a result of non-orderly insulated steam generators, leads to an additional release of fission products into the coolant gas due to physico-chemical effects. The total coolant gas activity can be directly released into the atmosphere via a safety valve which is pressed open in the steam line. The accumulated release fractions of the relevant nuclides are» relative to the core inventory, in the range of a few per mil or decimil (iodine). The greatest contribution to risk originates from the group of medium-sized leaks in the steam generator. <b>Depressurization</b> <b>accidents</b> only make an insignificant contribution to the HTR- 1160 risk due to their low frequency and small consequences. The most probable cause of an depressurization of the primary circuit is the spontaneous opening and failure to close of the reactor pressure vessel's safety valves. In comparison, leakages or even complete failure of the primary circuit closures are distinctly less probable. Serious ingressses of air with graphite corrosion and increased release of fission products are not to be expected. ...|$|R
40|$|Fission {{products}} {{deposited in}} the coolant circuit outside of the active core play a dominant role in source term estimations for advanced small pebble bed HTRs, particularly in design basis accidents (DBA).

Contamination of the circuit also hinders maintenance work. Experiments, performed from 1972 to 88 on the AVR, an experimental pebble bed HTR, allow for a deeper insight into fission product transport behavior. The activity deposition per coolant pass was lower than expected and was influenced by fission product chemistry and by presence of carbonaceous dust. The latter lead also to inconsistencies between Cs plate out experiments in laboratory and in AVR. The deposition behavior of Ag was in line with present models. Dust as activity carrier is of safety relevance because of its mobility and of its sorption capability for fission products. All metal surfaces in pebble bed reactors were covered by a carbonaceous dust layer. Dust in AVR was produced by abrasion in amounts of about 5 [*]kg/y. Additional dust sources in AVR were ours oil ingress and peeling of fuel element surfaces due to an air ingress.

40|$|For decay heat removal {{systems in}} the {{conceptual}} Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) currently under development, passive emergency cooling using natural circulation of a gas at an elevated pressure is being considered. Since GFR cores have high power density and low thermal inertia, relative to the high temperature gas-cooled thermal reactor (HTGR), the decay heat removal (DHR) in <b>depressurization</b> <b>accidents</b> is a major challenge to be overcome. This is due to (1) a gas has inherently inferior heat transport capabilities compared to a liquid and (2) the high surface heat flux of the GFR strongly affects the gas flow under natural circulation. The high heat flux places the flow into a mixed convection regime, which is not yet fully understood. One of the issues of mixed convection is that the transition from laminar to turbulent flow is not clearly defined in the existing literature. Review of previous work on heat transfer mechanisms and flow characteristics of the mixed convection transitional regime shows that two transitional zones exist between laminar or laminar-like flow and fully turbulent flow for the upward heated case. Previous work has focused on liquids and thus is not applicable to gas mixed convection. (cont.) An experimental facility is designed to obtain the data in the regions not covered in previous work, using nitrogen, helium and carbon dioxide. The facility is expected to operate with heat fluxes up to 10 kW/m 2 and gas velocities up to 2. 5 m/s by natural circulation only. A velocity calibration method is designed {{in addition to the}} hotwire probe for velocity and temperature profiles measurement. Finally, computational simulations, using the commercial code FLUENT, are performed to select an appropriate turbulence model for investigating mixed convection transitional flow regimes. It was concluded that the basic models in FLUENT were not capable of predicting the transitional flow as the Launder-Sharma turbulence model does. Nevertheless, the advanced numerical algorithm and convenient post processor of FLUENT can still be utilized by using UDF to incorporate other turbulence models into the code. by Jeongik Lee.

40|$|The AVR {{pebble bed}} reactor (46 MWth) was {{operated}} 1967 - 88 at coolant outlet temperatures up to 990 °C. A principle difference of pebble bed HTRs as AVR to conventional reactors is the continuous movement of fuel element pebbles through the core which complicates thermohydraulic, nuclear and safety estimations. Also {{because of a}} lack of other experience AVR operation is still a relevant basis for future pebble bed HTRs and thus requires careful examination. This paper deals mainly with some insufficiently published unresolved safety problems of AVR operation and of pebble bed HTRs but skips the widely known advantageous features of pebble bed HTRs. The AVR primary circuit is heavily contaminated with metallic fission products (Sr- 90, Cs- 137) which create problems in current dismantling. The amount of this contamination is not exactly known, but the evaluation of fission product deposition experiments indicates that the end of life contamination reached several percent of a single core inventory, which is some orders of magnitude more than precalculated and far more than in large LWRs. A major fraction of this contamination is bound on graphitic dust and thus partly mobile in <b>depressurization</b> <b>accidents,</b> which has to be considered in safety analyses of future reactors. A re-evaluation of the AVR contamination is performed here in order to quantify consequences for future HTRs (400 MW$_{th]$). It leads to the conclusion that the AVR contamination was mainly caused by inadmissible high core temperatures, increasing fission product release rates, and not - as presumed in the past - by inadequate fuel quality only. The high AVR core temperatures were detected not earlier than one year before final AVR shut-down, because a pebble bed core cannot yet be equipped with instruments. The maximum core temperatures are still unknown but were more than 200 K higher than calculated. Further, azimuthal temperature differences at the active core margin of up to 200 K were observed, probably due to a power asymmetry. Unpredictable hot gas currents with temperatures > 1100 °C, which may have harmed the steam generator, were measured in the top reflector range. After detection of the inadmissible core temperatures, the AVR hot gas temperatures were strongly reduced for safety reasons. Thus a safe and reliable AVR operation at high coolant temperatures, which is taken as a foundation of the pebble bed VHTR development in Generation IV, was not conform with reality. Despite of remarkable effort spent in this problem the high core temperatures, the power asymmetry and the hot gas currents are not yet understood. It remains uncertain whether convincing explanations can be found on basis of the poor AVR data and whether pebble bed specific effects are acting. Respective examinations are however ongoing. Reliable predictions of pebble bed temperatures are at present not yet possible. [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{high temperature}} gas-cooled reactor building was developed at Texas A&M University {{to understand the}} response of an actual facility to a <b>depressurization</b> <b>accident</b> scenario. A set of scaling laws were established to preserve the major flow phenomena and the geometry of the facility was simplified to focus on characterizing the key phenomena that determine the reactor building atmospheric concentration over time without the complexity of modeling the detailed features of an actual reactor building. The facility was outfitted with several instruments to measure localized oxygen concertation, pressure and temperature with the flexibility for the addition of measurement devices for future testing. The design of the facility required computing the leak rate scaled {{to the amount of}} air leaked from the prototype facility in one day. After determining the target leak rate the facility leak paths were acclimated to allow for air to leak from the facility. This was achieved by adjusting a set of needle valves at select locations on the simplified facility. Comparison of the achieved leak rate with an analytical fit to the model was shown to have a high degree of statistical similitude from determination of the R^ 2 values. The analytical model was determined by assuming the helium and air inside the faculty behave as an ideal gas. Finally, several tests were conducted to characterize the phenomena for a sudden depressurization inside of the simplified test facility. The velocity in the flow path connecting two adjoining test volumes was determined from the response of the oxygen probes to air intrusion into the facility. Finally, PIV measurements were conducted to analyze a helium buoyant jet flowing through a check valve that operates at 1 psid. Temporal resolution of the velocity field displayed erratic behavior in the region downstream of the inlet near the steam generator wall and was suspected to be from the development of flow instabilities from the difference in density between the helium jet and air. Entrainment effects were hypothesized to have occurred due to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that resulted in the development of vortical structures and local acceleration of the flow field...|$|E
40|$|Decay heat removal at {{depressurized}} shutdown conditions {{has been}} {{regarded as one of}} the key areas where significant improvement in passive response was targeted for the GEN IV GFR over the GCFR designs of thirty years ago. It has been recognized that the poor heat transfer characteristics of gas coolant at lower pressures needed to be accommodated in the GEN IV design. The design envelope has therefore been extended to include a station blackout sequence simultaneous with a small break/leak. After an exploratory phase of scoping analysis in this project, together with CEA of France, it was decided that natural convection would be selected as the passive decay heat removal approach of preference. Furthermore, a double vessel/containment option, similar to the double vessel/guard vessel approach of the SFR, was selected as the means of design implementation to reduce the PRA risks of the <b>depressurization</b> <b>accident.</b> However additional calculations in conjunction with CEA showed that there was an economic penalty in terms of decay heat removal system heat exchanger size, elevation heights for thermal centers, and most of all in guard containment back pressure for complete reliance on natural convection only. The back pressure ranges complicated the design requirements for the guard containment. Recognizing that the definition of a loss-of-coolant-accident in the GFR is a misnomer, since gas coolant will always be present, and the availability of some driven blower would reduce fuel temperature transients significantly; it was decided instead to aim for a hybrid active/passive combination approach to the selected BDBA. Complete natural convection only would still be relied on for decay heat removal but only after the first twenty four hours after the initiation of the accident. During the first twenty four hour period an actively powered blower would be relied on to provide the emergency decay power removal. However the power requirements of the active blower/circulators would be kept low by maintaining a pressurized system coolant back pressure of {approx} 7 - 8 bars through the design of the guard containment for such a design pressure. This approach is termed the medium pressure approach by both CEA and the US. Such a containment design pressure is in the range of the LWR experience, both PWRs and BWRs. Both metal containments and concrete guard containments are possible in this pressure range. This approach is then a time-at-risk approach as the power requirements should be low enough that battery/fuel cell banks without diesel generator start-up failure rate issues should be capable of providing the necessary power. Compressed gas sources are another possibility. A companion PRA study is being conducted to survey the reliability of such systems...|$|E

Only in the 1800 °C experiment did the Kr release rise continuously, but still only reached 0. 01 % after 150 hours. During the heating experiments the fission products were released in sequence fission gases, iodine, strontium, caesium and, with the highest proportion, silver, which is of little significance for accident consequences. Due to their transport and deposition behaviour in the core, caesium and strontium release, is insignificant for MODUL accident impacts. After 300 hours at 1600 °C, more than 99 % of the caesium is still in the coated particles. However, considerable release begins with increasing heating temperature amounting to about 50 %from the compact at 1800 °C after 280 h. Strontium is more effectively retained in the fuel kernels and matrix graphite at 1600 °C than caesium. At 1700 and 1800 °C, the strontium release approaches that of caesium. All these tests, containing in total the equivalent number of particles of 5 fuel elements, show that - even after more severe irradiation conditions than those envisaged during HTR MODUL operation - no particle failures occured either during operation or during severe accident conditions...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the auspices}} of the CEA Cadarache/ANL-US I-NERI project a {{comprehensive}} investigation has been made of improvements to the Gen-IV GFR safety case over that of the GCFR safety case twenty five years ago. In particular, it has been concluded and agreed upon [1] that the GFR safety approach for the passive removal of decay heat in a protected <b>depressurization</b> <b>accident</b> with total loss of electric power needs to be different from that taken for the HTRs. The HTR conduction cooldown to the vessel wall boundary mode for an economically attractive core is not feasible {{in the case of the}} GFR because the high power densities (100 kW/ 1 compared to 5 kW/ 1 for pebble bed thermal reactor) require decay heat fluxes well beyond those achievable by the heat conduction and radiation heat transfer mode. A set of alternative novel design options has been evaluated for potential passive safety mechanisms unique to the GFR. In summary, from a technological risk viewpoint and R&D planning, the option which has been identified is the block/plate-based or a pin-based reactor with a secondary guard containment/vessel around the primary vessel to maintain the primary system pressure at a high enough level which would allow primary system natural convection removal of core generated decay heat to be effective. Dedicated emergency decay heat exchangers would have to be connected in a 'failure-proof' configuration to the primary system and have natural convection capability all the way to the ultimate heat sink. What has been collaboratively agreed upon and selected for further development is the natural convection option with a block/plate or pin type derated core and a hybrid passive/active approach. [2] The guard containment will be utilized but it will be sized for an LWR containment range backup pressure (5 - 7 bars) with an initial pressure of 1 bar. The assessment has shown that a significantly higher back pressure is required for total natural convection driven removal of significant decay heat levels at GFR target power densities. The lower back-up pressure, plus whatever natural convection is available at this pressure, will be utilized to significantly reduce the blower power of the active DHR system sized to remove 2 - 3 % decay power. The objective is to be able to have such low power requirements so that power supplies such as batteries without the need for startup, can be utilized. This lower back-up pressure should be sufficient to support natural convection removal of 0. 5 % decay heat which occurs at {approx} 24 hrs. So there should be no more need for active systems/power supply after the initial period of one day. Furthermore, since there will be a decay of the after-heat from 2 - 3 % to 0. 5 % in this time period, credit should be taken in probability space for loss of active systems during the 24 hours. The safety approach will then be a probabilistic one. In the future discussions with the regulatory authorities the approach which will then be taken is that this class of decay heat removal accidents should be treated in combination with the PRA rather than solely through deterministic calculations. Work is now ongoing in the U. S. -France I-NERI GFR project to further evaluate this hybrid passive/active approach to heat removal for depressurized decay heat accidents. The objective of the analysis documented in this report is to provide information on local and global temperature, pressure and flow distributions in the guard containment, during steady state, and reactor vessel depressurization conditions due to a small break in the reactor vessel bottom control rod drive system. This is for the 2400 MWt plant option. The results should lead to improved guard containment designs and enhanced margin for safety criteria...|$|E
