5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like <b>docetaxel),</b> doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, <b>docetaxel,</b> pemetrexed, etoposide or vinorelbine.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and <b>docetaxel,</b> the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Pre-treatment with {{corticosteroids}} {{has been}} used to decrease hypersensitivity reactions and oedema in response to <b>docetaxel</b> and has shown no effect on the pharmacokinetics of <b>docetaxel.</b> The efficacy of <b>docetaxel</b> was improved by treatment with oral capecitabine, and after more than 27 months follow-up the survival benefit has been confirmed. Doxorubicin was combined with <b>docetaxel</b> in one study of 24 patients and resulted in an increased AUC of <b>docetaxel</b> by 50 to 70%, indicating doxorubicin may affect the disposition of <b>docetaxel.</b> Etoposide has also been shown to decrease <b>docetaxel</b> clearance, though patient numbers for this observation have been low.|$|E
25|$|<b>Docetaxel</b> {{exhibits}} cytotoxic {{activity on}} breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, gastric, renal and prostate cancer cells. <b>Docetaxel</b> does not block disassembly of interphase microtubules {{and so does}} not prevent entry into the mitotic cycle, but does block mitosis by inhibiting mitotic spindle assembly. Resistance to paclitaxel or anthracycline doxorubicin does not necessarily indicate resistance to <b>docetaxel.</b> Microtubules formed {{in the presence of}} <b>docetaxel</b> are of a larger size than those formed in the presence of paclitaxel, which may result in improved cytotoxic efficacy. Abundant formation of microtubules and the prevention to replicate caused by the presence of <b>docetaxel</b> leads to apoptosis of tumour cells and is the basis of <b>docetaxel</b> use as a cancer treatment. It is unknown if pathophysiological interactions with <b>docetaxel</b> exist at this stage, however tumour type has been shown to have efficacy on cellular activity. <b>Docetaxel</b> activity is significantly greater in ovarian and breast tumours than for lung tumours.|$|E
25|$|Treatment with <b>docetaxel</b> {{increasing}} {{survival time}} {{in people with}} certain types of cancer. While some clinical trials show median survival times to be increased by approximately only three months, the range of survival time is large. Many people survive beyond five years with treatment from <b>docetaxel,</b> however {{it is difficult to}} attribute these findings directly to treatment with <b>docetaxel.</b> Improved median survival time and response indicates that <b>docetaxel</b> slows metastatic cancer progression and can lead to disease-free survival. Conjunctive treatment of prednisone with <b>docetaxel</b> has been shown to lead to improved survival rate as well as improved quality of life and reduction of pain compared with treatments with mitoxantrone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Docetaxel</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of various cancers, including breast, lung, prostate, gastric, head and neck, and ovarian cancer. Clinical data have shown <b>docetaxel</b> to have cytotoxic activity against breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, prostate, liver, renal, gastric, and head and neck cancers and melanoma. In hormone-refractory prostate cancer <b>docetaxel</b> improves life expectancy and overall life quality.|$|E
25|$|Premedication with {{corticosteroids}} {{is recommended}} before each administration of <b>docetaxel</b> to reduce fluid retention and hypersensitive reactions. Other medications will often {{be given to}} aid pain management and other symptoms. The treatment of breast cancer with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is enhanced by adjuvant treatment with <b>docetaxel.</b> <b>Docetaxel</b> is also used in combination with capecitabine, a DNA synthesis inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Docetaxel</b> binds to microtubules {{reversibly}} {{with high}} affinity {{and has a}} maximum stoichiometry of 1 mole <b>docetaxel</b> per mole tubulin in microtubules. This binding stabilizes microtubules and prevents depolymerisation from calcium ions, decreased temperature and dilution, preferentially at the plus end of the microtubule. <b>Docetaxel</b> {{has been found to}} accumulate to higher concentration in ovarian adenocarcinoma cells than kidney carcinoma cells, which may contribute to the more effective treatment of ovarian cancer by <b>docetaxel.</b> It has also been found to lead to the phosphorylation of oncoprotein bcl-2, which is apoptosis-blocking in its oncoprotein form.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{inhibiting}} mitosis, {{the presence}} of <b>docetaxel</b> {{has been found to}} lead to the phosphorylation of the oncoprotein bcl-2, which leads to apoptosis of cancer cells that had previously blocked the apoptotic inducing mechanism, leading to tumour regression. Enhanced effects of radiation therapy when combined with <b>docetaxel</b> has been observed in mice. <b>Docetaxel</b> has also been found to have greater cellular uptake and is retained longer intracellularly than paclitaxel allowing <b>docetaxel</b> treatment to be effective with a smaller dose, leading to fewer and less severe adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|Biodistribution of 14C-labelled <b>docetaxel</b> {{in three}} {{patients}} showed {{the bulk of}} the drug to be metabolised and excreted in bile to the faeces. Of the radioactively labelled <b>docetaxel</b> administered, 80% was eliminated to the faeces with 5% in the urine over seven days, an indication that urinary excretion of <b>docetaxel</b> is minimal. Saliva contributed minimal excretion and no excretion was detected through pulmonary means. The terminal half-life of <b>docetaxel</b> was determined as approximately 86 hours, through prolonged plasma sampling, contrary to the clinically stated terminal half-life of 10–18 hours.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{approaches}} to paclitaxel production {{led to the}} development of <b>docetaxel.</b> <b>Docetaxel</b> has a similar set of clinical uses to paclitaxel and is marketed under the name of Taxotere.|$|E
25|$|Erythromycin, {{ketoconazole}} and cyclosporine are CYP3A4 inhibitors {{and therefore}} inhibit the metabolic pathway of <b>docetaxel.</b> When used with anticonvulsants, which induce CYP3A4, an increased dose of <b>docetaxel</b> may be required.|$|E
25|$|<b>Docetaxel</b> and {{paclitaxel}} have comparable efficacy metastatic {{breast cancer}} but paclitaxel has less severe side effects. Additionally, {{it has been}} noted that <b>docetaxel</b> is prone to cellular drug resistance via {{a variety of different}} mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Docetaxel</b> is {{contraindicated}} for {{use with}} patients with a baseline neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/µL, a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to <b>docetaxel</b> or polysorbate 80, severe liver impairment and pregnant or breast-feeding women.|$|E
25|$|The cancer chemotherapic <b>docetaxel</b> {{has been}} used as {{treatment}} for CRPC with a median survival benefit of 2 to 3 months. A second-line chemotherapy treatment is cabazitaxel. A combination of bevacizumab, <b>docetaxel,</b> thalidomide and prednisone appears effective in the treatment of CRPC.|$|E
25|$|<b>Docetaxel</b> is a {{white powder}} and is the active {{ingredient}} available in 20mg and 80mg Taxotere single-dose vials of concentrated anhydrous <b>docetaxel</b> in polysorbate 80. The solution is a clear brown-yellow containing 40mg <b>docetaxel</b> and 1040mg polysorbate 80 per mL. 20mg Taxotere is distributed in a blister carton containing one single-dose vial of Taxotere (<b>docetaxel)</b> preparation in 0.5 mL sterile pyrogen-free anhydrous polysorbate 80, and a single dose Taxotere solvent vial containing 1.5 mL 13% ethanol in saline to be combined and diluted in a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose for administration. 80mg Taxotere is supplied identically but with 2.0 mL polysorbate 80 and 6.0 mL 13% ethanol in saline. The <b>docetaxel</b> and solvent vials are combined to give a solution of 10mg/mL and the required dose is drawn from this solution. Vials have an overfill to compensate for liquid loss during preparation, foaming, adhesion to vial walls and the dead volume. 20mg vials may be stored for 24 months below 25°C away from light and 80mg vials for 26 months in the same conditions.|$|E
25|$|A model {{based on}} {{electron}} crystallographic density and {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} deconvolution has been proposed to explain the binding of <b>docetaxel</b> to β-tubulin. In this T-shaped/butterfly model, a deep hydrophobic cleft exists near {{the surface of the}} β-tubulin where three potential hydrogen bonds and multiple hydrophobic contacts bind to <b>docetaxel.</b> The hydrophobic pocket walls contain helices H1, H6, H7 and a loop between H6 and H7 that form hydrophobic interactions with the 3’-benzamido phenyl, 3’-phenyl, and the 2-benzoyl phenyl of <b>docetaxel.</b> 3’-phenyl also has contact with β-sheets B8 and B10. The C-8 methyl of <b>docetaxel</b> has Van der Waals interactions with two residues, Thr-276 and Gln-281 near the C-terminal end of β-tubulin. Docetaxel’s O-21 experiences electrostatic attraction to Thr-276 and the C-12 methyl has proximity with Leu-371 on the loop between B9 and B10.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{significant}} hepatic dysfunction had an approximately 30% decrease in clearance of <b>docetaxel</b> and were also {{at a higher}} risk of toxicity poisoning from <b>docetaxel</b> treatment. Clearance has been shown from population pharmacokinetic studies to decrease significantly with age, increased alpha1 acid glycoprotein and albumin concentrations and decreased body surface area.|$|E
25|$|Side {{effects are}} {{experienced}} more frequently by patients of 65 years or older, but dosage {{is usually not}} decreased. Renal failure is thought {{not to be a}} significant factor for <b>docetaxel</b> dosage adjustment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency resulting in serum bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) should not be administered <b>docetaxel,</b> though this is not a stated contraindication. Dosage should be reduced by 20% in people who develop; grade 3 or 4 diarrhea following exposure to <b>docetaxel,</b> hepatotoxicity defined by liver enzymes at levels greater than five times the ULN, and grade 2 palmer-planter toxicity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Docetaxel</b> {{differs from}} {{paclitaxel}} at two positions in its chemical structure. It has a hydroxyl functional group on carbon 10, whereas paclitaxel has an acetate ester, and a tert-butyl carbamate ester {{exists on the}} phenylpropionate side chain instead of the benzamide in paclitaxel. The carbon 10 functional group change causes <b>docetaxel</b> to be more water-soluble than paclitaxel.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{chemotherapeutic}} agents, <b>docetaxel</b> administered to pregnant animals causes {{a variety of}} embryofetal toxicities, including death, when given {{during the period of}} organogenesis. Yet adequate studies investigating maternal and fetal effects in humans are lacking. One small systematic review that examined the use of taxanes to treat breast cancer in pregnancy showed that, out of 19 patients, only three congenital malformations occurred. Two cases of cerebral ventriculomegaly observed in the study were documented prior to the administration of chemotherapy, suggesting an alternate cause of congenital malformation. The third case involved pyloric stenosis in an infant whose mother received a combination regimen of <b>docetaxel,</b> doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel; because the fetus was exposed to multiple drugs in utero, it remains difficult to identify <b>docetaxel</b> as the causative teratogenic agent. Further studies are needed to better assess the safety of <b>docetaxel</b> in pregnancy and determine appropriate dosing in pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{bioavailability}} {{has been}} found to be 8% ±6% on its own and, when co-administered with cyclosporine, bioavailability increased to 90% ± 44%. In practice, <b>docetaxel</b> is administered intravenously only to increase dose precision. Evaluation of <b>docetaxel</b> pharmacokinetics in phase II and III clinical studies were with 100mg/m² dosages given over one-hour infusions every three weeks.|$|E
25|$|The concentration-time {{profile of}} <b>docetaxel</b> was {{consistent}} with a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model. An initial, relatively rapid decline, with an α half-life of mean 4.5 minutes is representative of distribution to peripheral compartments from the systemic circulation. A β half-life of mean 38.3 minutes and a relatively slow γ half-life of mean 12.2 hours represent the slow efflux of <b>docetaxel</b> from the peripheral compartment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Docetaxel</b> {{is of the}} {{chemotherapy}} drug class; taxane, and is a semi-synthetic analogue of paclitaxel (Taxol), {{an extract}} from the bark of the rare Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia. Due to scarcity of paclitaxel, extensive research was carried out leading to the formulation of <b>docetaxel</b> – an esterified product of 10-deacetyl baccatin III, which is extracted from the renewable and more readily available leaves of the European yew tree.|$|E
25|$|<b>Docetaxel</b> was {{patented}} in 1986 {{and approved}} {{for medical use}} in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Docetaxel</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 15.53 to 87.37 USD per 80mg vial. This dose in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 454.53 pounds.|$|E
25|$|Because microtubules do not {{disassemble}} in {{the presence}} of <b>docetaxel,</b> they accumulate inside the cell and cause initiation of apoptosis. Apoptosis is also encouraged by the blocking of apoptosis-blocking bcl-2 oncoprotein. Both in vitro and in vivo analysis show the anti-neoplastic activity of <b>docetaxel</b> to be effective against a wide range of known cancer cells, cooperate with other anti-neoplastic agents activity, and have greater cytotoxicity than paclitaxel, possibly due to its more rapid intracellular uptake.|$|E
25|$|Paediatric {{trials of}} <b>docetaxel</b> have been limited, and so safety of use in {{patients}} under 16 years {{has not been}} established.|$|E
25|$|Many more {{side effects}} have been {{reported}} for conjunctive and adjuvant treatment with <b>docetaxel</b> as well as rare post-marketing events.|$|E
25|$|Prednisone given with <b>docetaxel</b> led to {{improved}} survival, {{quality of life}} and pain management in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|The two-vial and one-vial {{formulations}} {{contain the}} same drug substance, <b>docetaxel</b> trihydrate, {{and the same}} excipients (ethanol, polysorbate 80 and citric acid).|$|E
25|$|Renal {{impairment}} {{is unlikely}} to affect metabolism or excretion of <b>docetaxel</b> as renal excretion contributes less than 5% of elimination. Limited data is available for <b>docetaxel</b> use in children with dosage between 55 and 75mg/m². Two paediatric studies have taken place that show a mean clearance of 33 L/h/m² and concentration-time profiles best fitted by a two-compartmental model of distribution and elimination. Mean distribution half-life was 0.09 hours and mean elimination half-life was 1.4 hours in paediatric studies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Docetaxel</b> {{was shown}} to be greater than 98% plasma protein bound {{independent}} of concentration at 37°C and pH 7.4 Docetaxel's plasma protein binding includes lipoproteins, alpha1 acid glycoprotein and albumin. Alpha1 acid glycoprotein is the most variable of these proteins inter-individually, especially in cancer patients and is therefore the main determinant of docetaxel's plasma binding variability. <b>Docetaxel</b> interacted little with erythrocytes and was unaffected by the polysorbate 80 in its storage medium. Polysorbate 80 may {{be the cause of}} hypersensitivity reasons in taxanes as recent studies indicated.|$|E
25|$|The main mode of {{therapeutic}} action of <b>docetaxel</b> is {{the suppression of}} microtubule dynamic assembly and disassembly, rather than microtubule bundling leading to apoptosis, or the blocking of bcl-2.|$|E
25|$|In the UK (in 2009) The cost of 6 cycles (18 weeks) of <b>docetaxel</b> at {{a dose of}} 75mg/m2 IV every 21 days is £5,262 (based on {{an average}} body surface area 1.75m2).|$|E
25|$|<b>Docetaxel</b> is a {{cytotoxic}} chemotherapeutic agent. As {{with all}} chemotherapy, adverse effects are common, and many side effects have been documented. Because <b>docetaxel</b> is a cell-cycle-specific agent, it is cytotoxic to all dividing {{cells in the}} body. This includes tumour cells as well as hair follicles, bone marrow and other germ cells. For this reason, common chemotherapy side effects such as hair loss occur; sometimes this can be permanent. North west France are conducting a survey to establish exactly {{how many people are}} affected in this way. Independent studies show it could be as high as 6.3%, which puts it in the 'common and frequent' classification.|$|E
