50|$|The effect Leidenfrost {{described}} is {{a phenomenon}} in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than its boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer which keeps that liquid from boiling rapidly. It is most commonly seen when cooking; one sprinkles drops of water <b>in</b> a <b>skillet</b> to gauge its temperature. If the skillet's temperature is {{at or above the}} Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the metal and takes longer to evaporate than it would <b>in</b> a <b>skillet</b> that is hot, but at a temperature below the Leidenfrost point. It has also been used in some dangerous demonstrations, such as dipping a wet finger in molten lead or blowing out a mouthful of liquid nitrogen, both enacted without injury to the demonstrator.|$|R

2500|$|By 1987, Abu Nidal {{had turned}} {{the full force of}} his {{paranoia}} and terror tactics inwards on the ANO itself. Members were routinely tortured by the [...] "Committee for Revolutionary Justice" [...] until they confessed to betrayal and disloyalty. Men would be hanged naked for hours and whipped until they lost consciousness, then revived with salt or chili powder rubbed into their wounds. A naked prisoner would be forced into a car tire with his legs and backside in the air, then whipped, wounded, and salted. Plastic melted under a flame would be dripped onto prisoners' skin. According to recruits who were able to escape, prisoners' genitals would be placed <b>in</b> <b>skillets</b> of boiling-hot oil and fried while the men were held down. Between interrogations, prisoners would be confined alone in tiny cells, bound hand and foot. If the cells were full, a prisoner might be buried alive, with a steel pipe in his mouth to allow him to breathe. Water would be poured into it occasionally. When word came that Abu Nidal wanted the prisoner executed, a bullet would be fired down the tube instead, then the pipe removed and the hole filled in.|$|R
