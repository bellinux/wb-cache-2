5|$|Charlie tells Mikhail {{about the}} cocaine, who is delighted. When Charlie returns to {{retrieve}} the case, Bhope and his men are waiting inside the van. One of Bhope's men recognises Guddu as Charlie's twin and Bhope demands that Charlie reveal Guddu's whereabouts. An inebriated Mikhail <b>interrupts</b> their conversation and is killed by Bhope.|$|E
5|$|Hamlet's soliloquies {{have also}} {{captured}} the attention of scholars. Hamlet <b>interrupts</b> himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.|$|E
50|$|In computing, <b>interrupt</b> latency is {{the time}} that elapses from when an <b>interrupt</b> is {{generated}} to when {{the source of the}} <b>interrupt</b> is serviced. For many operating systems, devices are serviced as soon as the device's <b>interrupt</b> handler is executed. <b>Interrupt</b> latency may be affected by microprocessor design, <b>interrupt</b> controllers, <b>interrupt</b> masking, and the operating system's (OS) <b>interrupt</b> handling methods.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} science, a vectored <b>interrupt</b> is a processing {{technique in}} which the <b>interrupting</b> device directs the processor to the appropriate <b>interrupt</b> service routine. This {{is in contrast to}} a polled <b>interrupt</b> system, in which a single <b>interrupt</b> service routine must determine the source of the <b>interrupt</b> by checking all potential <b>interrupt</b> sources, a slow and relatively laborious process.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>interrupt</b> is an {{indication}} to a thread that it should stop what it is doing and do something else. A thread sends an <b>interrupt</b> by invoking <b>interrupt</b> on the Thread object for the thread to be <b>interrupted.</b> The <b>interrupt</b> mechanism is implemented using an internal flag known as the <b>interrupt</b> status. Invoking [...] sets this flag. By convention, any method that exits by throwing an [...] clears <b>interrupt</b> status when it does so. However, it's always possible that <b>interrupt</b> status will immediately be set again, by another thread invoking <b>interrupt.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mahmud {{is sitting}} in his living room, lost in thought, as a {{newspaper}} hangs upside-down in his hands. His wife, Aminah, enters, and asks him what he is doing. When he answers that he is reading the newspaper, Aminah turns it right-side up and ridicules him. After she again <b>interrupts</b> him, Mahmud leaves the home.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Dechant returns home, and {{is about}} to take a bath when she is {{attacked}} by Connor. Black has followed her, and <b>interrupts</b> the attack; he and Connor struggle, with Black almost being strangled until he is able to hold Connor under the bathwater until he stops fighting. Connor is arrested and charged, while the now-cleared Dickerson resumes circling obituaries in the newspaper.|$|E
5|$|Much of the system's core, {{including}} the LWKT subsystem, the IPI messaging subsystem {{and the new}} kernel memory allocator, are lockless, meaning that they work without using mutexes, with each process operating on a single CPU. Critical sections are used to protect against local <b>interrupts,</b> individually for each CPU, guaranteeing that a thread currently being executed will not be preempted.|$|E
50|$|The design {{philosophy}} of the Propeller is that a hard real-time multi-core architecture negates the need for dedicated <b>interrupt</b> hardware and support in assembly. In traditional CPU architecture, external <b>interrupt</b> lines are fed to an on-chip <b>interrupt</b> controller and are serviced {{by one or more}} <b>interrupt</b> service routines. When an <b>interrupt</b> occurs, the <b>interrupt</b> controller suspends normal CPU processing and saves internal state (typically on the stack), then vectors to the designated <b>interrupt</b> service routine. After handling the <b>interrupt,</b> the service routine executes a return from <b>interrupt</b> instruction which restores the internal state and resumes CPU processing.|$|R
50|$|A FLIH {{implements}} {{at minimum}} platform-specific <b>interrupt</b> handling similar to <b>interrupt</b> routines. In {{response to an}} <b>interrupt,</b> there is a context switch, and the code for the <b>interrupt</b> is loaded and executed. The job of a FLIH is to quickly service the <b>interrupt,</b> or to record platform-specific critical information which is only {{available at the time}} of the <b>interrupt,</b> and schedule the execution of a SLIH for further long-lived <b>interrupt</b> handling.|$|R

5|$|The {{conventional}} Mozartian coda {{concludes with}} an orchestral tutti and no written-out {{part for the}} soloist. In this movement, Mozart breaks with convention: the soloist <b>interrupts</b> the tutti with a virtuosic passage of sixteenth notes, and accompanies the orchestra through to the final pianissimo C-minor chords.|$|E
5|$|As {{they read}} the end, Joan of Arc is being burnt at the stake, still waiting for God to save her (the real Joan had said several days earlier that her voices had spoken to her of martyrdom). Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then <b>interrupts,</b> {{claiming}} that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the last page and eats it, remarking that {{it is easier to}} chew than the video of Bambi.|$|E
5|$|During rehearsal, Marge {{struggles with}} {{a scene in}} which Blanche is {{supposed}} to break a glass bottle and attack Stanley, but she cannot muster enough anger towards Stanley to break the bottle. After coming home, Marge asks Homer to help her learn her lines, but Homer is uninterested. The day before the performance, Marge and Ned are again practising the bottle scene as Homer arrives to drive Marge home. Homer repeatedly <b>interrupts</b> the rehearsal. Imagining that Stanley is Homer, Marge finally smashes the bottle and lunges at Ned.|$|E
5000|$|An [...] "interrupt vector table" [...] (IVT) is a data {{structure}} that associates {{a list of}} <b>interrupt</b> handlers {{with a list of}} <b>interrupt</b> requests in a table of <b>interrupt</b> vectors. Each entry of the <b>interrupt</b> vector table, called an <b>interrupt</b> vector, is the address of an <b>interrupt</b> handler. While the concept is common across processor architectures, IVTs may be implemented in architecture-specific fashions. For example, a dispatch table is one method of implementing an <b>interrupt</b> vector table.|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” The <b>Interrupt</b> Controller is {{designed}} to interface with the AMBA bus. It can make the system more efficient and more responsive to critical events. <b>Interrupt</b> controller {{is designed}} {{with the concept of}} priority for immediate selection of peripherals which requires attention or service. The <b>interrupt</b> is necessary for any embedded processor based SOC design that is running a Real Time Operating System. The <b>Interrupt</b> Controller is fully scalable to support 32 <b>interrupt</b> sources and provides a programmable <b>interrupt</b> register which can be used to generate an <b>interrupt</b> under software control.

Sheldon is forced to go shopping with Mrs. Wolowitz.|$|E
5|$|Mob bosses Sal Maroni, Gambol, and the Chechen hold a {{videoconference}} {{with their}} corrupt accountant, Lau, {{who has taken}} their funds for safekeeping and fled to Hong Kong. The Joker <b>interrupts,</b> warns them that Batman is unhindered by the law, and offers to kill him in exchange for half of their money, but Gambol puts a bounty on the Joker instead after he insults him. After escaping and smuggling himself as a corpse, the Joker kills Gambol and takes over his gang. The mob ultimately decides to take the Joker up on his offer.|$|E
5|$|The Vatican City State Railway {{branches}} {{off from}} the Rome to Viterbo railway line at the Roma San Pietro railway station and crosses Gelsomino valley via a 143.12 metre long masonry viaduct of eight 15.30 metre arches (bearing the Fasces and the Savoy Coat of Arms), which crosses Viale Vaticano (which it <b>interrupts)</b> and Via Aurelia. The Via delle Cave and the Via del Gelsomino are also interrupted by the viaduct and thus merge with the Via Aurelia.|$|E
50|$|A level-triggered <b>interrupt</b> is an <b>interrupt</b> {{signaled}} {{by maintaining}} the <b>interrupt</b> line {{at a high}} or low logic level. A device wishing to signal a Level-triggered <b>interrupt</b> drives the <b>interrupt</b> request line to its active level (high or low), and then holds it at that level until it is serviced. It ceases asserting the line when the CPU commands it to or otherwise handles the condition that caused it to signal the <b>interrupt.</b>|$|R

5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which <b>interrupts</b> the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E

Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, Dr. Everett Scott, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie. Frank suspects that Dr. Scott investigates UFOs for the government. Upon learning of Brad and Janet's connection to Dr. Scott, Frank suspects them of working for him. Frank, Dr. Scott, Brad, and Riff Raff then discover Janet and Rocky together under the sheets in Rocky's birth tank, upsetting Frank and Brad.

Grateful, David congratulates Dwight for the idea and after a moment's hesitation, Dwight accepts the credit. Michael is shocked and upset. The rest of the office, still angry at Michael for his near-disastrous idea, play along with Wallace's misunderstanding and congratulate Dwight. When David sets up a conference call with the marketing department so Dwight can explain his Golden Ticket promotion, Michael <b>interrupts</b> and goads Dwight into revealing the idea actually came from Michael.

They discover that Kerner ransacked her office in search of Atlantean artifacts, but Sophia says that she keeps her most valuable item, her necklace, with her. She owns another of the shiny beads, now identified as the mystical metal orichalcum, and places it in the medallion's mouth, invoking the spirit of the Atlantean god Nur-Ab-Sal. She explains that a Nazi scientist called Dr. Hans Ubermann is searching for the power of Atlantis to use it as an energy source for warfare.|$|E

A mysterious time-traveling entity known as the Time Eater appears; Eggman, realizing its potential, uses it {{to go back in}} time and team up with his past ("Classic") self. The two convert it to a robot to erase their past defeats from history. The Time Eater proceeds to attack Classic Sonic as he travels through Green Hill {{at the beginning of the}} original Sonic the Hedgehog, and <b>interrupts</b> a birthday celebration being held for the present ("Modern") Sonic by his friends, scattering them. Modern Sonic awakens in White Space and rescues Tails after traveling through Green Hill.|$|E
5000|$|The {{length of}} any {{critical}} section {{that needs to}} be <b>interrupted.</b> Entry to a critical section restricts concurrent data structure access. When a data structure must be accessed by an <b>interrupt</b> handler, the critical section must block that <b>interrupt.</b> Accordingly, <b>interrupt</b> latency is increased by however long that <b>interrupt</b> is blocked. When there are hard external constraints on system latency, developers often need tools to measure <b>interrupt</b> latencies and track down which critical sections cause slowdowns.|$|R
