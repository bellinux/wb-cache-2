5|$|Unlike other Novomessor species, workers forage {{early in}} the morning and late {{afternoon}}, whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening. However, it is unknown whether or not these ants are active during the night. Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen during the middle of the day when temperatures reach 95–100°F (35–38°C), although the <b>ground</b> <b>temperature</b> is considerably higher. Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground, but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds. Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds, and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest. N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft (7 m) away from their home nest. N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on, consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps, bembicine wasps and small moths. When a worker discovers a dead insect, it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately, and other nestmates will join once they detect it. Workers do not cooperate with each other and pull the insect from all directions, accidentally tearing it apart. However, the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests, but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown.|$|E

Permafrost occurrence {{is represented by}} 3 clearly defined classes: Zone 1 : permafrost, Zone 2 : isolated permafrost possible and Zone 3 : potential ice-rich permafrost. A corresponding map legend {{is included in the}} KML file. A clear improvement in the prediction of <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> could be achieved by distinguishing ice-poor and ice-rich permafrost in the modelling process. There is a very strong correlation (0. 99) of <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> with elevation and potential incoming solar radiation in ice-poor ground represented by zone 1. The distribution of ice-rich permafrost was defined by modelling mass wasting processes and the burial of snow and ice into the ground caused by them. A validation of the map yield the following result: All 49 validation points located in zone 1 indicate permafrost. Approximately 2 / 3 of 33 validation points located in zone 3 indicate permafrost. 34 validation points are located outside the permafrost zonation of which 1 indicates permafrost and 33 permafrost absence...|$|R
25|$|Persistent cold {{temperatures}} {{can either}} prevent new snow from stabilizing or destabilize the existing snowpack. Cold air temperatures {{on the snow}} surface produce a temperature gradient in the snow, because the <b>ground</b> <b>temperature</b> {{at the base of}} the snowpack is usually around °C, and the ambient air temperature can be much colder. When a temperature gradient greater than 10°C change per vertical meter of snow is sustained for more than a day, angular crystals called depth hoar or facets begin forming in the snowpack because of rapid moisture transport along the temperature gradient. These angular crystals, which bond poorly to one another and the surrounding snow, often become a persistent weakness in the snowpack. When a slab lying on top of a persistent weakness is loaded by a force greater than the strength of the slab and persistent weak layer, the persistent weak layer can fail and generate an avalanche.|$|E

500|$|The newly emerged female {{grasshopper}} has a preoviposition {{period of}} {{a week or two}} while she increases in weight and her eggs mature. After mating, the female of most species digs a hole with her ovipositor and lays a batch of eggs in a pod in the ground near food plants, generally in the summer. After laying the eggs, she covers the hole with soil and litter. Some, like the semi-aquatic Cornops aquaticum, deposit the pod directly into plant tissue. The eggs in the pod are glued together with a froth in some species. [...] After a few weeks of development, the eggs of most species in temperate climates go into diapause, and pass the winter in this state. Diapause is broken by a sufficiently low <b>ground</b> <b>temperature,</b> with development resuming as soon as the ground warms above a certain threshold temperature. The embryos in a pod generally all hatch out within a few minutes of each other. They soon shed their membranes and their exoskeletons harden. These first instar nymphs can then jump away from predators.|$|E

40|$|A {{transient}} heat flow model {{was used to}} simulate both past and future <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> of mountain permafrost and associated active layer thickness in Southern Norway. The model was forced by reconstructed air temperature starting from 1860, approximately coinciding with the Little Ice Age in the region. The impact of climate warming on mountain permafrost until 2100 is assessed by using downscaled air temperatures from a multi-model ensemble for the A 1 B scenario. For 13 borehole locations, records over three consecutive years of <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures,</b> air temperatures and snow cover data are available for model calibration and validation. The boreholes are located at different elevations and in substrates with different thermal properties. With an increase of air temperature of ~+ 1. 5 &deg;C over 1860 – 2010 and an additional warming of + 2. 8 &deg;C until 2100, we simulate the evolution of <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> for the borehole locations. According to model results, the active-layer thickness has increased since 1860 by 0. 5 – 5 m and > 10 m for the sites Juvvasshøe and Tron, respectively. The simulations also suggest that at an elevation of about 1900 m a. s. l. permafrost will degrade {{until the end of}} this century with a probability of 55 – 75 % given the chosen A 1 B scenario...|$|R

40|$|With current {{remote sensing}} technologies, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to directly infer the thermal state of the ground from spaceborne platforms. We demonstrate that such limitations can be overcome by combining the information content of several remote sensing products in a data fusion approach: time series of remotely sensed land surface temperature, as well as snow cover and snow water equivalent, are employed to force ground thermal models which deliver <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> and thaw depths. First, we present a semi-empirical model approach based on remotely sensed land surface temperatures and reanalysis products from which mean annual <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> (MAGT) can be estimated at a spatial resolution of 1 km at continental scales. The approach is tested for the unglacierized land areas in the North Atlantic region, an area of more than 5 million km 2. The results are compared to in-situ temperature measurements in more than 100 boreholes from which the accuracy of the scheme is estimated to approximately 2. 5 °C. Furthermore, we explore transient modeling of <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> driven by remotely sensed land surface temperature, snow cover and snow water equivalent. The permafrost model CryoGrid 2 is applied to the Lena River Delta in NE Siberia (25000 km 2) at 1 km spatial and weekly time resolution for the period 2000 – 2014. A comparison to in-situ measurements suggests a possible accuracy of around 1 °C for annual average <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and around 0. 1 m for thaw depth. However, information on subsurface stratigraphies including the distribution of ground ice is required to achieve this accuracy which is currently not available from remote sensing products alone. Finally, we discuss the potential and limitations of schemes using a combination of remote sensing data and thermal permafrost models to assess the thermal state of the ground, and give a feasibility assessment for both mountain and lowland permafrost regions...|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} are {{the lack}} of access from below for utility lines, the potential for large heat losses where <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> fall significantly below the interior temperature, and a very low elevation that exposes the building to flood damage in even moderate rains. Remodeling or extending such a structure may also be more difficult. Over the long term, ground settling (or subsidence) may be a problem, as a slab foundation cannot be readily jacked up to compensate; proper soil compaction prior to pour can minimize this. The slab can be decoupled from <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> by insulation, with the concrete poured directly over insulation (for example, extruded polystyrene foam panels), or heating provisions (such as hydronic heating) can be built into the slab (an expensive installation, with associated running expenses).|$|R
40|$|Permafrost {{is present}} in several parts of Norway and {{contributes}} to binding mountain rock walls together, as well as storing potential greenhouse gasses as organic carbon in mires. Global climate changes influence the <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures,</b> {{and as a result}} the permafrost will thaw in some areas. This thesis provides new insight in the decisive role of the snow distribution in high mountain areas for correct estimates of <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> in climate models. Large parts of the high mountain areas and the mires in Scandinavia are frozen all year around. This phenomenon is called permafrost. Permafrost acts as a glue in mountain areas, and if the permafrost warms or thaws entirely, resulting destabilization of the rock walls could threaten both infrastructure and lives. In permafrost areas with a high organic content, thawing permafrost will release the carbon storage in the ground as greenhouse gasses, and act as a feedback mechanism to the global climate change. It is therefore crucial to understand how existing permafrost will react to the future changes in the climate. In order to know how the permafrost in mountains and lowland areas will respond to the future climate, precise and detailed models for <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> are required. The low thermal conductivity of snow cover makes it an efficient insulator to cold winter temperatures, and it therefore has profound implications for the thermal regime of the ground. Because of drifting snow, snow depths can be highly variable – from bare-blow ridges to deep troughs, sometimes only meters apart. Climate- and weather models traditionally operate on coarse resolutions, and use snow depths averaged over lager areas (> 1 km). In this thesis Gisnås demonstrates the errors introduced into permafrost models by this simplified representation of snow. Particularly bare-blown areas, where we find the coldest permafrost, are not well represented in current models. Statistical methods for representation of small-scale variation in snow depths in regional weather- and permafrost models have therefore been developed in this study. These methods highly improve the representation of the <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> as well as the response in <b>ground</b> <b>temperatures</b> to climate changes in permafrost models. The improved permafrost model is implemented for Scandinavia, and a new map of permafrost in this region is produced. The map provides new knowledge and a much higher level of detail of the total distribution of permafrost, and gives new insight in which areas that are vulnerable to future climate changes...|$|R
