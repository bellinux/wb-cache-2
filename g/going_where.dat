25|$|ESC {{intervenes}} {{only when}} it detects a probable loss of steering control, i.e. when the vehicle is not <b>going</b> <b>where</b> the driver is steering. This may happen, for example, when skidding during emergency evasive swerves, understeer or oversteer during poorly judged turns on slippery roads, or hydroplaning. ESC may also intervene in an unwanted way during high-performance driving, because steering input {{may not always be}} directly indicative of the intended direction of travel (i.e. controlled drifting). ESC estimates the direction of the skid, and then applies the brakes to individual wheels asymmetrically in order to create torque about the vehicle's vertical axis, opposing the skid and bringing the vehicle back in line with the driver's commanded direction. Additionally, the system may reduce engine power or operate the transmission to slow the vehicle down.|$|E
25|$|The Miami area {{is known}} for its high level of {{automobile}} dependency and lack of public transportation, which has led to an increasing traffic problem throughout the county. Nearly 20% of household income is spent on transportation and Miami had the most decentralized office space of any metropolitan area in the United States, according to a study in 2000. Despite overwhelming support for public transportation to be funded in place of several new highways in the 1970s, Miami's Metrorail system was not functional until 1984 and as of 2014 has failed to reach the scope which was promised over 30 years ago. Ridership was very low in the early years, averaging less than 10,000 riders per day. The system was not finished, even after nearly US$1 billion in federal subsidies, meaning that approximately US$100,000 was spent for each passenger. This led to criticism from then President Ronald Reagan, who stated {{that it would have been}} a lot cheaper to buy everyone a limousine. Those supporting mass transit argued that the low ridership was due to the system being incomplete and not <b>going</b> <b>where</b> people needed it to, and noted that within a few years ridership was nearing 50,000 per day. Many of Miami and Florida's politicians have not been advocates of alternative transportation. For example, both state governors Jeb Bush and Rick Scott denied funding for an intercity high-speed rail system in Florida. Two state senators tried to force Scott to accept the funding, but the Florida Supreme Court denied the case and the funding was later directed to several other rail projects across the United States.|$|E

It was intended to link the series directly into The Original Series by having T'Pau as a main character, who had previously appeared in the episode [...] "Amok Time". Instead, this character was developed into an original Vulcan character, T'Pol. Berman explained his vision for the series at launch, saying that [...] "we'll be seeing humanity when they truly are <b>going</b> <b>where</b> no man has gone before.

500|$|The novel also {{deals with}} the issue of globalisation. Courteau {{observed}} that although Little Bee learns English from newspapers she acquires at the English detention centre, her reference points are still Nigerian, and thus through her narrative voice Cleave [...] "illustrates the forcible dislocations of a globalized world." [...] Cleave chose to explore the issue in The Other Hand as he believes that, although globalisation is frequently discussed, people rarely consider its meaning. He explained: [...] "money can move freely across national borders, but people can't. They're actively prevented from <b>going</b> <b>where</b> the money is. Capital is global, but labour isn't. I believe that's the cause of two major crises that we're involved in as a species – one is a financial crisis and one is a refugee crisis. Imagine a world where money can't move, where capital is stuck in its country of origin, but people can freely move where the work is! That's an alternate interpretation of globalization that would solve a lot of problems." [...] Although Cleave did not intend for the novel to be heavily political, he felt it was important to raise the issue, given the refugee subject matter of The Other Hand.|$|E

2500|$|The Vanguard Press {{published}} Oates' first novel, With Shuddering Fall (1964), {{when she}} was 26 years old. In 1966, she published [...] "Where Are You <b>Going,</b> <b>Where</b> Have You Been?", a short story dedicated to Bob Dylan and written after listening to his song [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue." [...] The story is loosely based on the serial killer Charles Schmid, also known as [...] "The Pied Piper of Tucson". It has been anthologized many times and adapted as a film, Smooth Talk starring Laura Dern (1985). In 2008, Oates said that of all her published work, she is most noted for [...] "Where Are You <b>Going,</b> <b>Where</b> Have You Been?". Another early short story, [...] "In a Region of Ice" [...] (The Atlantic Monthly, August 1966), features a young, gifted Jewish-American student. It dramatizes his drift into protest against the world {{of education and the}} sober, established society of his parents, his depression, and eventually murder-cum-suicide. It was inspired by a real-life incident (as were several of her works) and Oates had been acquainted with the model of her protagonist. She revisited this subject in the title story of her collection Last Days: Stories (1984). [...] "In the Region of Ice" [...] won the first of her two O. Henry Awards. Her second novel was A Garden of Earthly Delights (1967), first of the so-called Wonderland Quartet published by Vanguard 1967 to 1971. All were finalists for the annual National Book Award.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the morning}} of Tuesday 11 July, a {{compromise}} was reached. The Orangemen {{would be allowed to}} march along Garvaghy Road on condition that they did so silently and without accompanying bands. Ronnie Flanagan (Deputy Chief Constable of the police) told the GRRC that residents should peacefully remove themselves from the road because [...] "an angry scene between police and protesters could worsen the Ormeau marching dispute and even destabilise the ceasefires". When GRRC member Breandán Mac Cionnaith asked protesters to clear the road, some heckled him and refused. Flanagan was told there would be a better chance of the protesters moving if they knew there would be no march there next year. Flanagan replied that [...] "there was no question of marches <b>going</b> <b>where</b> there was no consent from the community". The residents were then persuaded to clear the road.
