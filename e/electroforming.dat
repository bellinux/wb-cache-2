Graphite is combined with clays to form the 'lead' used in pencils used for writing and drawing.

From this mould a negative epoxy resin cast was produced. B.J.S. involved Engelhard Industries {{to assist in the}} <b>electroforming</b> of the cast.

25|$|Electrotyping {{is related}} to electroplating, which {{permanently}} adds a thin metallic overlayer to a metallic object instead of creating a freestanding metal part. Electrotyping and <b>electroforming</b> both produce metal parts, but differ in technical details. <b>Electroforming</b> involves {{the production of a}} metallic part around a metallic mandrel, although the term is sometimes used more broadly to encompass all electrodeposition processes. As noted above, electrotyping forms the part using a non-conducting mold or form whose surface has been made conducting by applying a thin coating of graphite or metal powder.|$|E

They have an excellent capability of copying minute surface details (< 0. 1 microns). However, much of teh work has been carried out using thick <b>electroforms</b> (in excess of 3 mm). Unfortunately, such <b>electroforms</b> take many days to produce. this paper examines the feasibility of using thin walled <b>electroforms</b> (< 1. 5 mm) for use as EDM electrodes that can be produced in copper in time-scales between 14 and 38 hours.

50|$|The object being <b>electroformed</b> {{can be a}} {{permanent}} part of the end product or can be temporary (as {{in the case of}} wax), and removed later, leaving only the metal form, the “electroform”. New technologies have made it possible for mandrels to be very complex. In order to facilitate the removal of the <b>electroform</b> from the mandrel, a mandrel is often made of aluminum. Because aluminum can easily be chemically dissolved, a complex <b>electroform</b> can be produced with near exactness.|$|R
40|$|Major joining {{methods of}} dental casting metal include brazing and laser welding. However, brazing cannot be applied for <b>electroformed</b> metals since heat {{treatment}} {{could affect the}} fit, and, therefore, laser welding is used for such metals. New methods of joining metals that do not impair the characteristics of <b>electroformed</b> metals should be developed. When new coating is performed {{on the surface of}} the base metal, surface treatment is usually performed before re-coating. The effect of surface treatment is clinically evaluated by peeling and flex tests. However, these testing methods are not ideal for deposition coating strength measurement of <b>electroformed</b> metals. There have been no studies on the deposition coating strength and methods to test <b>electroformed</b> metals. We developed a new deposition coating strength test for <b>electroformed</b> metals. The influence of the negative electrolytic method, which is one of the electrochemical surface treatments, on the strength of the deposition coating of <b>electroformed</b> metals was investigated, and the following conclusions were drawn: 1. This process makes it possible to remove residual deposits on the electrodeposited metal surface layer. 2. Cathode electrolysis is a simple and safe method that is capable of improving the surface treatment by adjustments to the current supply method and current intensity. 3. Electrochemical treatment can improve the deposition coating strength compared to the physical or chemical treatment methods. 4.

2500|$|Original master discs {{are created}} by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a {{modulated}} groove into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an <b>electroforming</b> bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for <b>electroforming</b> nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as <b>electroforming,</b> unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as mandrels for <b>electroforming</b> more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial <b>electroforming</b> of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of <b>electroforming</b> a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for <b>electroforming</b> future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] <b>electroforming</b> make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|E

40|$|A {{transpiration}} cooled rocket chamber is made {{by forming}} a porous metal wall on a suitably shaped mandrel. The porous wall may be made of sintered powdered metal, metal fibers sintered on the mandrel or wires woven onto the mandrel and then sintered to bond the interfaces of the wires. Intersecting annular and longitudinal ribs are then <b>electroformed</b> on the porous wall. An interchamber wall having orifices therein is then <b>electroformed</b> over the annular and longitudinal ribs. Parallel longitudinal ribs are then formed on the outside surface of the interchamber wall after which an annular jacket is <b>electroformed</b> over the parallel ribs to form distribution passages therewith.

Thirty Y-TZP primary crowns with <b>electroformed</b> gold copings (Z/G group) and Y-TZP secondary crowns (Z/Z group) and 30 CoCr primary crowns with <b>electroformed</b> gold copings (C/G group) and Y-TZP secondary crowns (C/Z group), each with taper angles of 0 °, 1 ° and 2 °, were fabricated, respectively. With {{the exception of the}} <b>electroformed</b> gold copings, all specimens were Computer-Aided-Design/Computer-Aided-Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) -milled, then sintered and afterwards manually adapted.
