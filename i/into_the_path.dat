5|$|Alan begins {{driving the}} car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind to wave to Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the train and are killed.

In the main series, Bianchi took two pole positions and a number of points positions before he was injured in a first-lap crash at the Hungaroring. In the feature race, he spun <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the field exiting the first corner, and was struck head-on by Ho-Pin Tung, sustaining a fractured second lumbar vertebra in the process.

5|$|Despite United's early pressure, it was Barcelona {{who scored}} the first {{goal of the}} match. Edwin van der Sar cleared the ball downfield for Manchester United, but it was headed away by Barcelona's midfield anchor Sergio Busquets. Carrick was first to the ball for Manchester United, but he could only head {{it as far as}} Xavi, who passed to Andrés Iniesta. The Manchester United defence backed away from the Spaniard, who – after exchanging passes with Lionel Messi – played the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of Samuel Eto'o in the Manchester United penalty area. Nemanja Vidić {{attempted}} to shepherd the Cameroonian striker towards the goal line, but Eto'o easily stepped inside him and toe-poked the ball past Van der Sar to make it 1–0 to Barcelona inside 10minutes.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 31st Army drove {{towards the}} Baltic coast.

Under pressure, the 331st fell back to the outskirts of Landsberg, and savage fighting ensued. Meanwhile, the German columns led by Waffen SS troops bypassed the town to the south and north, leaving the fighting elements of the division encircled for two days until they were relieved from outside. Meanwhile, the southern German column had rampaged through the mostly-defenseless rear elements of the division, destroying the medical-sanitation battalion, the motor pool, and other units; in total more than 300 men and women were killed and more wounded.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the book, the memoir exhibits Bruce Bechdel's obsession with restoring the family's Victorian home. His obsessive need to restore the house is connected to his emotional distance from his family, which he expressed in coldness and occasional bouts of abusive rage. This emotional distance, in turn, is connected with his being a closeted homosexual. Bruce Bechdel had homosexual relationships in the military and with his high school students; some of those students were also family friends and babysitters. At the age of 44, two weeks after his wife requested a divorce, he stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of an oncoming Sunbeam Bread truck and was killed. Although the evidence is equivocal, Alison Bechdel concludes that her father committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Busch won {{the pole}} {{position}}, which he held for 20 laps {{until he was}} passed by Edwards. He held the lead until the first green-flag pit stops and regained the position after the stops ended. Busch retook the lead on lap 81 and held it until he was passed by Matt Kenseth. Jeff Gordon took over the lead on lap 163, before Earnhardt became the leader on the 181st lap and maintained this position until Edwards regained it 14 laps later. The race was stopped for 17 minutes when Gordon crashed on lap 262, and car parts were strewn <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of other drivers, requiring officials to clean the track. Edwards maintained the lead at the restart and held it to win the race. There were eleven cautions and 19 lead changes by nine different drivers during the race.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City had {{the first}} attack of the match, but it came to nothing. Soon Everton began to {{dominate}} the match, with Dean frequently involved in the attacking play. Several Everton attacks came on their left flank. Stein caused Manchester City right-back Sid Cann problems, and Cann was forced to concede a corner kick on several occasions. Just after the half-hour Everton had their first shot on target, when Stein's effort was saved by Langford. Another chance quickly arrived. Stein's cross passed in front of goal, but Dean was unable {{to connect with the}} ball. Two minutes later Manchester City goalkeeper Langford attempted to catch a cross from Britton, but dropped the ball under pressure from Dean. The ball fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of Stein, who put the ball into the empty net to give Everton the lead. At half-time Everton led 1–0.|$|E
5|$|Mario Basler's free kick {{after six}} minutes opened the scoring for Bayern Munich. Bayern then {{had the chance}} to extend their lead with Mehmet Scholl hitting the post and Carsten Jancker the crossbar, forcing Peter Schmeichel to make {{numerous}} saves. In reaction to going a goal down, Ferguson substituted in Solskjær and Sheringham. As the game went to injury time, referee Pierluigi Collina indicated that three minutes would be played. In almost the last attack of the game, United won a corner, which Beckham took and goalkeeper Schmeichel went up front for. The ball was partially cleared by the Bayern defence before being played back to Giggs, who sent a low volley <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of Sheringham, whose scuffed shot squeezed low inside the post.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the track}} was {{reported}} clear of debris, the safety car was withdrawn {{and the race}} restarted on lap five. Jonathan Palmer, commentating alongside Murray Walker for the BBC, remarked how quick Schumacher was, as {{his time in the}} warm-up session on Sunday morning gave rise to speculation {{that he was going to}} make one pit stop and, therefore, race with a heavier car than Senna, who was planning to make two, as was conventional. Martin Brundle had told BBC presenter Steve Rider that McLaren were going to make two stops. On the second lap after the restart, with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher, Senna's car left the road at the Tamburello corner, and after slowing from 190mph (306km/h) to 131mph (211km/h), hit the concrete wall, with debris flying <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the other drivers.|$|E

5|$|The sails {{belonged to}} a convoy of Indiamen which had {{gathered}} in Colombo on Ceylon before sailing together to China. By choosing to come up through the Bali Strait rather than through the Straits of Malacca, Farquharson had inadvertently led his fleet directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of a French squadron whose six frigates were easily more powerful than his six East Indiamen. Farquharson was aware {{that he could not}} win a naval engagement with six frigates and so resolved instead to bluff the French into thinking his merchant convoy was a squadron of ships of the line. When he saw Cybèle approaching, Farquharson brought two ships forward to meet the frigate, gambling that in the low light Tréhouart might mistake the East Indiamen for warships. Farquharson compounded his ruse by raising Rainier's Blue ensign on Alfred and instructing the rest of the convoy to raise ensigns of their own.|$|E
5|$|USAF F-105s were {{escorted by}} F-4s {{to protect them}} against enemy fighters.

All victories were against MiG-17s. Of these 24.5 were shot down with cannon fire (one victory was shared with an F-4), and three with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. One F-105F is unofficially credited with downing three MiGs—one by air-to-air missile, the second by cannon fire and the third by jettisoning the centerline rack full of bombs directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of a surprised MiG.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham won the toss and Manchester City kicked off. The Birmingham goal {{came under}} {{pressure}} almost immediately. Within a minute a far post cross from Roy Clarke narrowly eluded Hayes. Two corners followed, the second {{resulting in a}} shot by Roy Paul. The next attack, in the third minute, resulted in the opening goal. Revie began the move, exchanging passes with Clarke, and back-heeling for the unmarked Hayes to sweep the ball past Gil Merrick to put Manchester City ahead. Birmingham's confidence was shaken, resulting {{in a series of}} Manchester City corners and a chance for Hayes, but they fought back to equalise in the 15thminute. Astall slipped the ball to Brown, who helped it forward. It rebounded off a Manchester City defender <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of Welsh international inside‑forward Noel Kinsey, who fired home via Trautmann's far post. For the remainder of the first half Birmingham had most of the play, exerting pressure on Manchester City full-back Leivers, but were unable to make a breakthrough. Though Birmingham put the ball in the net twice, Brown was adjudged to be offside on both occasions. With Warhurst missing and Boyd out of position and not fully fit, Birmingham's strength and balance was disrupted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to Manchester City's unconventional style.|$|E
