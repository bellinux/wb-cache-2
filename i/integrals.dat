Many {{important}} functions {{do not have a}} Riemann <b>integral.</b> So, Henstock and Kurzweil make the new theory of <b>integral.</b> From the background, the writer will be research about Henstock-Kurzweil <b>integral</b> and also theorems of Henstock- Kurzweil <b>Integral.</b> Henstock- Kurzweil <b>Integral</b> is generalized from Riemann <b>integral.</b> In this case the writer uses research methods literature or literature study carried out by way explore, observe, examine and identify the existing knowledge in the literature. In this thesis explain about partition which used in Henstock- Kurzweil <b>Integral,</b> definition and some property of Henstock- Kurzweil <b>Integral.</b> And some properties of Henstock-Kurzweil <b>integral</b> as follows: value of the Henstock-Kurzweil <b>integral</b> is unique, linearity of the Henstock-Kurzweil <b>integral,</b> Additivity of the Henstock-Kurzweil <b>integral,</b> Cauchy criteria, nonnegativity of Henstock-Kurzweil <b>integral</b> and primitive function...|$|R
