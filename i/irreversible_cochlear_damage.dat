40|$|Aminoglycosides (AG), {{including}} gentamicin (GM), are {{the most}} frequently used antibiotics in the world and are proposed to cause <b>irreversible</b> <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> and hearing loss (HL) in 1 / 4 of the patients receiving these life-saving drugs. Akin to the results of AG ototoxicity studies, high-frequency, basal turn outer hair cells (OHCs) preferentially succumb to multiple HL pathologies while inner hair cells (IHCs) are much more resilient. To determine if endogenous differences in IHC and OHC mitochondrial metabolism dictate differential sensitivities to AG-induced HL, IHC- and OHC-specific changes in mitochondrial reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence during acute (1 h) GM treatment were compared. GM-mediated decreases in NADH fluorescence and succinate dehydrogenase activity were observed shortly after GM application. High-frequency basal turn OHCs were found to be metabolically biased to rapidly respond to alterations in their microenvironment including GM and elevated glucose exposures. These metabolic biases may predispose high-frequency OHCs to preferentially produce cell-damaging reactive oxygen species during traumatic challenge. Noise-induced and age-related HL pathologies share key characteristics with AG ototoxicity, including preferential OHC loss and reactive oxygen species production. Data from this report highlight the need to address the role of mitochondrial metabolism in regulating AG ototoxicity and the need to illuminate how fundamental differences in IHC and OHC metabolism may dictate differences in HC fate during multiple HL pathologies...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [46]- 50) The {{effects of}} <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> on the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) were determined. Anatomical features (neuron size, neuron number, and AVCN volume) of the AVCN {{were examined in}} adult CBA/J mice which {{had been exposed to}} a brief but intense noise, sufficient to produce permanent damage to the organ of Corti and spiral ganglion cells of the cochlea. Mice of the following groups were used: noise exposed at 6 months, euthanized at 11 months; noise exposed at 11 months, euthanized at 24 months; noise exposed at 6 months, euthanized at 24 months. AVCNs of these groups of animals will be compared with one another and with their like-aged, nonexposed counterparts (11 and 24 month CBA/J mice). <b>Cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> resulted in a significant reduction in AVCN volume and neuron size, with complementary increases in neuronal packing density.

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests that cochlear stressors as noise exposure and aging can induce homeostatic/maladaptive changes in the central auditory system from the brainstem to the cortex. Studies centered on such changes have revealed several mechanisms that operate {{in the context of}} sensory disruption after insult (noise trauma, drug- or age-related injury). The oxidative stress is central to current theories of induced sensory neural hearing loss and aging, and interventions to attenuate the hearing loss are based on antioxidant agent. The present review addresses the recent literature on the alterations in hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons due to noise-induced oxidative stress in the cochlea, as well on the impact of <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> on the auditory cortex neurons. The emerging image emphasizes that noise-induced deafferentation and upward spread of <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> is associated with the altered dendritic architecture of auditory pyramidal neurons. The cortical modifications may be reversed by treatment with antioxidants counteracting the cochlear redox imbalance.

Although there has been great progress in tinnitus research over the past 25 years, the neurochemical basis of tinnitus is still poorly understood. We review current research about the effects of various types of <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> on the neurotransmitter chemistry in the central auditory system and document evidence that different changes in this chemistry can underlie similar behaviorally measured tinnitus symptoms. Most available data have been obtained from rodents following <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> produced by <b>cochlear</b> ablation, loud sound, or ototoxic drugs. Effects on neurotransmitter systems have been measured as changes in neurotransmitter level, synthesis, release, uptake, and receptors.

Patients were leukopenic (58), were infected by gentamicin-resistant organisms (11), or had cystic fibrosis (8). Three patients developed tinnitus, but none had vertigo or nystagmus. Of 55 courses with pre- and post-treatment audiogram, 13 (24 %) were associated with development of high-frequency hearing loss, which was usually bilateral.

40|$|Hypothesis: Experimentally induced {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) {{labyrinthitis}} provides a suitable model for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL). Background: Viral labyrinthitis has been postulated {{to play a role}} in the pathophysiology of ISSHL. Circumstantial evidence is painting at members of the herpes virus family. Experimental viral labyrinthitis elicited by various virus families leaves a virus-specific pattern of <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage.</b> Herpes viruses provide the best matching pattern in the distribution of <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> when compared with ISSHL postmortem cochlear histopathology. Methods: Herpetic viral labyrinthitis was induced in guinea pigs using perilymphatic inoculation with HSV- 1. A control group was inoculated with the culture medium only. Infection was confirmed by the measurement of HSV antibodies. Hearing was monitored. <b>Cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> was evaluated by light and electron microscopy. Results: In all HSV- 1 inoculated animals, rapid loss of hearing occurred. Seroconversion took place, but no systemic manifestations of herpetic infection were observed. The control group showed no cochlear or systemic symptoms. When comparing cochlear histopathology in ISSHL to experimental viral HSV- 1 labyrinthitis, strong similarities were found: degeneration of the stria vascularis, destruction of the organ of Corti, loosening of the tectorial membrane, and inflammatory changes in neural structures.

40|$|Ever since Pliny the Elder {{coined the}} term tinnitus, the {{perception}} of sound {{in the absence of}} an external sound source has remained enigmatic. Traditional theories assume that tinnitus is triggered by <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage,</b> but many tinnitus patients present with a normal audiogram, i. e., with no direct signs of <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage.</b> Here, we report that in human subjects with tinnitus and a normal audiogram, auditory brainstem responses show a significantly reduced amplitude of the wave I potential (generated by primary auditory nerve fibers) but normal amplitudes of the more centrally generated wave V. This provides direct physiological evidence of “hidden hearing loss” that manifests as reduced neural output from the cochlea, and consequent renormalization of neuronal response magnitude within the brainstem.

40|$|The {{presence}} and absence of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) {{as well as}} DPOAE amplitudes were compared between college music majors and a control group of nonmusic majors. Participants included 28 music majors and 35 nonmusic majors enrolled at a university with ages ranging from 18 - 25 years. DPOAEs and hearing thresholds were measured bilaterally on all the participants. DPOAE amplitudes were analyzed at the following f 2 frequencies: 1, 187 Hz, 1, 500 Hz, 1, 906 Hz, 2, 531 Hz, 3, 031 Hz, 3812 Hz, 4, 812 Hz, and 6, 031 Hz. Significantly more music majors (7 / 28) than nonmusic majors (0 / 35) exhibited absent DPOAEs {{for at least one}} frequency in at least one ear. Both groups of students reported similar histories of recreational and occupational noise exposures that were unrelated to studying music, and none of the students reported high levels of noise exposure within the previous 48 h. There were no differences in audiometric thresholds between the groups at any frequency. At DPOAE f 2 frequencies from 3, 031 Hz to 6, 031 Hz, nonsignificantly lower amplitudes of 2 - 4 dB were seen in the right ears of music majors versus nonmajors, and in the right ears of music majors playing brass instruments compared to music majors playing nonbrass instruments. Given the greater prevalence of absent DPOAEs in university music majors compared to nonmusic majors, it appears that early stages of <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> may be occurring in this population.

40|$|Theoretical {{considerations}} and experimental evidence suggest that otoacoustic emission parameters {{may be used}} to reveal early <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage,</b> even before it can be diagnosed by standard audiometric techniques. In this work, the statistical distributions of a set of otoacoustic emission parameters chosen as candidates for the early detection of <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> (global and band reproducibility, response level, signal-to-noise ratio, spectral latency, and long-lasting otoacoustic emission presence) were analyzed in a population of 138 ears. These cars have been divided, according to a standard audiometric test, in three classes: (1) ears of nonexposed bilaterally normal subjects, (2) normal cars of subjects with unilateral noise-induced high-frequency hearing loss, and (3) their hearing impaired ears. For all analyzed parameters, a statistically significant difference was found between classes 1 and 2. This difference largely exceeds the difference observed between classes 2 and 3. This fact suggests that the noise exposure, which was responsible for the unilateral hearing loss. also caused subclinical damage in the contralateral, audiometrically normal, car. This is a clear indication that otoacoustic emission techniques may be able to early detect subclinical damages. (C) 2002 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>Cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> {{secondary}} to exposure to acoustic trauma is {{the consequence of}} the acoustic energy effects on the hearing cells in Korti's organ. OBJECTIVE The objective {{was to assess the}} correlation between the degree of sensorineural hearing loss and the type of audiogram registered in acoustic trauma exposed patients. METHOD We analyzed 262 audiograms of patients exposed to acoustic trauma in correlation to 146 audiograms of patients with <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> and hearing loss not related to acoustic trauma. "A" group consisted of acoustic trauma cases, while "B" group incorporated cases with hearing loss {{secondary to}} cochlear ischaemia or degeneration. All audiograms were subdivided with regard to the mean hearing loss into three groups: mild (21 - 40 dB HL), moderate (41 - 60 dB HL) and severe (over 60 dB HL) hearing loss. Based on audiogram configuration five types of audiogram were defined: type 1 flat; type 2 hearing threshold slope at 2 kHz, type 3 hearing threshold slope at 4 kHz; type 4 hearing threshold notch at 2 kHz; type 5 notch at 4 kHz. RESULTS Mild hearing loss was recorded in 163 (62. 2 %) ears in the acoustic trauma group, while in 78 (29. 8 %) ears we established moderate hearing loss with the maximum threshold shift at frequencies ranging from 4 kHz to 8 kHz. The least frequent was profound hearing loss, obtained in 21 (8 %) audiograms in the acoustic trauma group. Characteristic audiogram configurations in the acoustic trauma patient group were: type 1 (N= 66; 25. 2 %), type 2 (N= 71; 27. 1 %), and type 3 (N= 68; 25. 9 %). Audiogram configurations were significanly different in the acoustic trauma group in comparison to the cochlear ischaemia group of patients (p= 0. 0005).

30|$|Tinnitus is a maladaptive neuropathic {{condition}} that develops in humans and laboratory animals following auditory insult. In our previous study we demonstrated that sound exposure leads to development of behavioral evidence of tinnitus {{in a sample}} of exposed mice. However, this tinnitus mouse model did not account for long-term maladaptive plasticity or aging, factors that are commonly linked to the human tinnitus population. Therefore the same group of mice was monitored for tinnitus for 360  days post exposure. Tinnitus was assessed behaviorally by measuring gap-induced pre-pulse suppression of the acoustic startle (GPIAS). Cochlear histology was performed on both control (unexposed) and experimental mice to determine whether sound exposure caused any evident <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage.</b> We found that 360  days after exposure the vast majority of exposed mice exhibited similar gap detection deficits as detected at 84  days post exposure. These mice did not demonstrate significant loss of inner/outer hair cells or spiral ganglion neurons compared to the control sample. Lastly, we demonstrated that GPIAS deficits observed in exposed animals were unlikely exclusively caused by <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage,</b> but could be a result of central auditory maladaptive plasticity. We conclude that CBA/CaJ mice can be considered a good animal model to study the possible contribution of age effects on tinnitus development following auditory insult.|$|R

Fifteen Male albino guinea pigs (300 - 350 g in weight) were randomly allocated into three groups: those exposed to 4 kHz octave band noise at 102 dB SPL (group 1, n= 5); those conditioned with 1 kHz octave band noise at 85 dB SPL, 6 hours per day for 5 days, then exposed to noise (group 2, n= 5); those conditioned with 4 kHz octave band noise at 85 dB SPL, then exposed to noise (group 3, n= 5). An hour and one week after noise exposure, threshold shifts were evaluated by auditory-evoked brainstem response (ABR) and then animals were euthanized for histological evaluation. We found that TTS and <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> caused by noise exposure were significantly reduced by 1 kHz and 4 kHz conditioning (P< 0. 001). We also showed that 4 kHz protocol attenuates noise- induced TTS but no significant TTS reduction occurred by 1 kHz conditioning.

25|$|Due {{to close}} {{proximity}} of the structures, vestibular lesioning often results in <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage,</b> which in turn results in hearing impairments.

However, animals with a removed eardrum (usually causing the inability to hear) and normal vestibular labyrinths perform significantly better than animals with eardrums and lesioning in the vestibular labyrinths. These findings suggest that disruption to hearing is not the primary cause of the observed spatial memory deficits.|$|R

The Src inhibitor has been shown to be effective in protecting the ear from noise-induced hearing loss. Three studies were carried out to determine whether this compound has otoprotective activity in rats treated with cisplatin. The first two studies used the Src inhibitor as a cotreatment with single doses of cisplatin in Fischer 344 /NHsd rats and nude rats, respectively. <b>Cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> was assessed by auditory brainstem response threshold shifts and outer hair cell loss. The third study was carried out in nude rats with implanted HT- 29 tumors, and the Src inhibitor was administered as a cotreatment with a lower dose of cisplatin. <b>Cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> and changes in tumor volume were assessed in the third study. In the first two studies, cotreatment with the Src inhibitor reduced cisplatin-induced hearing loss significantly. In the third study, little hearing loss was induced because of the use of a lower dose of cisplatin. However, cotreatment with the Src inhibitor did not exert a negative effect on cisplatin's slowing of tumor growth in the treated rats.

To test the effect of increased antioxidant defenses, a water-soluble coenzyme Q analog (Q) was used.

We report three main results. First, hearing loss and damage in hair cells and spiral ganglion was determined by noise-induced oxidative stress. Second, the acoustic trauma altered dendritic morphology and decreased spine number of II-III and V-VI layer pyramidal neurons of auditory cortices. Third, the systemic administration of the water-soluble CoQ analog reduced oxidative-induced <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage,</b> hearing loss, and cortical dendritic injury.

30|$|Furthermore, our {{ear plug}} results argue against hearing loss {{as the major}} {{contributor}} to frequency-specific gap detection deficits in sound exposed animals.

Since unexposed ears did not display any sign of ABR threshold increase after exposure, <b>cochlear</b> <b>damage</b> cannot be a reasonable explanation of the gap detection deficits. Although not completely definitive, this new finding further validates the gap detection methodology for tinnitus assessment. Alternatively, GPIAS might detect plastic changes along the auditory neuraxis caused by sound exposure, while not being capable of detecting tinnitus (Kaltenbach et al. 2005; Ma et al. 2006; Noreña and Eggermont 2003).|$|R
