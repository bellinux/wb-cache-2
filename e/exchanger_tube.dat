50|$|There are {{alternative}} configurations, {{including a}} secondary circulating loop which ducts {{a portion of}} the primary air flow through an external pressurized heat exchanger. This bypass flow can also be utilized for cool-down using an air-over heat exchanger. While gas firing does not readily lend itself to small machines, it can be fitted to autoclaves of three to four foot diameter and up. The longer the machine, the longer the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>tube</b> and thus the more efficient it will be. This heating option is less costly than hot oil and more costly than electric or steam (assuming an existing boiler) to purchase, but the extra expense is paid back very quickly.Over its full service life, the electrically heated autoclave will cost enough to have paid for another four or five comparable autoclaves. For any but the smallest lab machines, gas firing and steam heating are, to put it plainly, the best alternatives to consider.|$|E

Along with fast development of modern acoustic detection technology, using acoustic signals to detect leakage in heat exchange tube has been gradually accepted and considered with great potential by both industrial and research societies. In order to further advance the development of acoustic signal detection technology and investigate better methods for leakage detection in heat exchange tube, in this paper, firstly, we conduct a short overview {{of the theory of}} acoustic signal detection on heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>tube,</b> which had already been continuously developed for a few decades by researchers worldwide.

For this purpose, the CFD simulations have been conducted for the design of the inlet and outlet manifolds of the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>tube</b> elliptical, and the results compared with the values determined empirically, by measuring the mass flow flowmeter installed in the lower part of the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>tube.</b> A comparison of the results of numerical calculations with the measurement results is presented.

The tubes were loaded {{by a combination of}} tension, internal pressure and torsion. The temperature was 950 °C. The life-time of the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>tubes</b> under pure uniaxial tension was foung to be longer than the time to rupture of bar material made from the same parent heat. The heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>tubes</b> show a signigicant creep hardening in the primary creep range and a later onset of the secondary creep range. For the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>tubes</b> under different multiaxial loading conditions different life times were measured, although in all cases the same deviatoric stress (v. Mises) was used. For the experiments presented in this paper these differences can be explained by constitutive equations.

40|$|The minimum gas {{speed for}} a heat {{exchanger}} (HE) at which particulate fouling is avoided is investigated.

As the flow speed in the HE increases, the thickness and the surface area of the fouling layer deposited over the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>tube</b> are reduced. There is a limiting flow speed above which fouling is avoided. This limiting speed is related to the critical flow velocity required to roll a particle resting on a flat surface.

40|$|A {{framework}} for {{a method to}} predict fluid-elastic instability in heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>tube</b> bundles is presented. The method relies on a three-dimensional, cylindrical coordinate, thermal-hydraulic analysis code to obtain {{a representation of the}} three-dimensional flow distribution within the heat exchanger. With this information, local cross-flow velocities corresponding to each tube in the exchanger are obtained by interpolation and resultant cross-flow velocity distributions are computed. With a knowledge of the vibration mode shapes and frequencies, reduced effective cross-flow velocities are then computed for each tube. A comparison with experimental results shows excellent agreement: the tubes with high values of predicted reduced effective cross-flow velocity are the same tubes that first experience fluid-elastic instability in the flow tests and vibrate most violently; also, the simulation correctly predicts that the tubes directly exposed to the flow from the inlet nozzle have a low potential for fluid-elastic instability. Very good agreement is also shown in the comparison of the predicted reduced effective cross-flow velocities with the critical value obtained from a design guide. In summary, the feasibility of developing a heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>tube</b> vibration prediction method, based on a computer simulation of flow distribution, is demonstrated. Such a method would have immediate application in design optimization. However, further development and evaluation are required...|$|E

40|$|Evaporative cooling is an {{alternative}} and efficient method of cooling in dry climates. When a liquid evaporates into the surrounding gas, the energy required for the change of phase produces a cooling effect. The wet bulb depression is the measure of potential for evaporative cooling. Greater the wet bulb depression greater is the cooling effect, and vice versa. The residential desert cooler, apart from cooling the air increases the humidity of {{the air in the}} room by absorbing moisture from the water supplied to the cooler. This may result in an undesirable increase in humidity level. Allergies is an additional problem with direct evaporative coolers. Indirect evaporative cooling does not have these two drawbacks. In the present work a small indirect evaporative cooler is developed with a cross flow heat exchanger and the performance of the cooler is evaluated under controlled environmental conditions. The results are compared with the results of an analytical model developed by assuming constant water film temperature on the external wall of the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>tube.</b> The experimental results of the cooler show a satisfactory agreement with the analytical values. Design calculations are presented to show the performance characteristics of indirect evaporative coolers under different temperature and humidity conditions of the ambient. It has been shown that reducing the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>tube</b> diameter to around 2 mm results in better cooling effect. Climatic conditions of different Indian cities are discussed with respect to the expected effectiveness of indirect evaporative coolers...|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred fifty}} reports were {{reviewed}} along with interviews of some twelve recuperator manufacturers and research organizations. Of the reports reviewed, the consensus {{was that the}} majority of recuperators used in the U.

After reviewing the literature and from our discussions with recuperator manufacturers and research organizations, a general conclusion was that the upper material temperature limit of 1500 oF is state-of-the-art for recuperators operating in an oxidizing environment produced by the com-bustion of Diesel No. 2. A full size counter axial flow metal heat exchanger test module has successfully completed 50 test hours with exit temperatures of 1650 oF and firing temperatures of 2050 oF. Performance monitored during the tests was well within predicted limits. Less than 5 F circumferential temperature gradients were measured in the axial flow section of the test module. Also, reduction in thermal gradients across tube to header connection was achieved.
