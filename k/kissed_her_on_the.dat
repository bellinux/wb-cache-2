500|$|On November 6, 1842, Griswold {{visited his}} wife in New York after she {{had given birth to}} their third child, a son. Three days later, after {{returning}} to Philadelphia, he was informed that both she and the infant had died. Deeply shocked, Griswold traveled by train alongside her coffin, refusing to leave her side for 30hours. When fellow passengers urged him to try to sleep, he answered by kissing her dead lips and embracing her, his two children crying next to him. He refused to leave the cemetery after her funeral, even after the other mourners had left, until forced to do so by a relative. He wrote a long poem in blank verse dedicated to Caroline, [...] "Five Days", which was printed in the New York Tribune on November 16, 1842. Griswold had difficulty believing she had died and often dreamed of their reunion. Forty days after her entombment, he entered her vault, cut off a lock of her hair, <b>kissed</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forehead and lips, and wept for several hours, staying by her side until a friend found him 30hours later.|$|E
500|$|On December 8, 2011, Minaj tweeted {{that she}} was on set with Madonna filming the music video for [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin". She also said that Madonna <b>kissed</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lips, as a gift for her birthday. M.I.A. then tweeted about filming the video with Madonna, saying, [...] "Madonna killed it! A legend! said she'd have me, I said ill have her too". Directed by the team Megaforce—which {{consists}} of Léo Berne, Charles Brisgand, Raphaël Rodriguez and Clément Gallet—the video has a football and cheerleader theme, inspired by her then-upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance. Rodriguez explained to MTV News that they discussed the song with Solveig and understood that the video should be [...] "about happiness and something really sunny". The whole look was also dictated by the fact that Megaforce had never collaborated with Madonna, Minaj and M.I.A., feeling that it was a [...] "different universe" [...] for them. The video was shot for over two days in New York, with very strict timings which Megaforce found as challenging. Describing the process as like working with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Megaforce told Swedish newspaper 20 minutes that the set was surrounded by police patrol and security guards and mobile phones were not allowed. A total budget of US$1.5 million was allotted for the video. Some of the sequences in the video was Madonna's idea like one scene featuring her dancing in front of a wall, which Megaforce felt would not go with the main narrative. However, the singer insisted on keeping it and by the second day of filming she wrapped up early and left.|$|E
