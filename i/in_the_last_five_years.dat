5|$|As a {{workaround}} many {{policy makers}} try to restore competitiveness through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims {{to reduce its}} unit labour costs. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more {{to the level of}} 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy have hit a 25-year low and consumption has fallen to the level of 1950.|$|E
5|$|Native Silver perch and {{introduced}} brown trout were released in 1981–83 and 1987–89 respectively, {{but have not}} been stocked since. Silver perch stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout have been released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, {{the reason for the}} low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one suggested theory. However, the eutrophic nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons. Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the released fish in the last three decades and have been the only fish stocked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014.|$|E

5|$|Neil Harvey {{represented}} Australia in 79 Test matches between 1948 and 1963. He was Australia's {{most prolific}} batsman during the post-war era, served as vice-captain of Australia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> {{of his career}} and regarded by Wisden as the leading fielder in the world during his career. At {{the time of his}} retirement, he held the record for the most Test appearances by an Australian and was the country's second-highest run scorer and century-maker, behind Don Bradman. He was selected in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century and inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. He was an inaugural inductee into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. The family's eldest son, Merv, played one Test for Australia in 1946–47 after losing his best years to World War II and his grandson Robert Harvey was one of the elite Australian rules footballers of the last twenty years, twice winning the Australian Football League's Brownlow Medal for the best and fairest player of the season and being voted the Most Valuable Player in the competition by his peers in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} {{prevalence of}} active epilepsy (as of 2012) {{is in the}} range 3–10 per 1,000, with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy {{who has had a}} least one unprovoked seizure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> Epilepsy begins each year in 40–70 per 100,000 in developed countries and 80–140 per 100,000 in developing countries. Poverty is a risk and includes both being from a poor country and being poor relative to others within one's country. In the developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in the young or in the old. In the developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to the higher rates of trauma and infectious diseases. In developed countries the number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased among the elderly between the 1970s and 2003. This has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in the elderly.|$|E
