In the U.S., public <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> an <b>invention</b> results in the loss of patentability <b>of</b> the <b>invention</b> after a period of one year.

40|$|Works {{of fiction}} {{sometimes}} contain <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions</b> that {{operate as a}} bar to patentability, preventing inventors who actually make those inventions from subsequently patenting them. This is because the fictional disclosures effectively destroy the novelty <b>of</b> the <b>inventions</b> or render them obvious. Despite such disclosures, the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office does not habitually or effectively search through fiction for pertinent prior art in its examinations. This paper explores the legal, economic, and pragmatic considerations if searching fiction is {{to become part of}} the patent examination process. Until recently, it was impracticable to search fiction in a manner that would accurately locate pertinent prior art. However, with the advent of the Google Book Search Project, fiction can be both effectively and efficiently searched for the first time in history. Ultimately, the strong public interest in keeping invalid patents from issuing requires that fictional prior art searching be incorporated into patent examinations...|$|R

40|$|The Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) {{was enacted}} by the United States Congress in 1994. The URAA {{provided}} substantial modifications to the framework for U. S. patent law that came into effect January 1, 1953. Changes in patent regulation are especially important in the pharmaceutical sector because the patent system determines, in large part, the reward that an inventor can derive from discovery of a new drug. Most pharmaceutical patents are classified as utility patents. Pharmaceutical patents may include claims for the active ingredient per se, for the formulation of the active ingredient {{for use as a}} pharmaceutical, for therapeutic indications and uses, and for methods of manufacturing the drug. The U. S. has a First-to-Invent system to establishing the right of priority <b>of</b> an <b>invention,</b> but most countries have a First-to-File priority system. The First-to-Invent system allows for public <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions</b> prior to patent filing. In contrast, the First-to-File system encourages early filing of patent applications.

50|$|Patents {{are legal}} {{instruments}} intended to encourage innovation {{by providing a}} limited monopoly to the inventor (or their assignee) {{in return for the}} <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>invention.</b> The underlying assumption is that innovation is encouraged because an inventor can secure exclusive rights, and therefore a higher probability of financial rewards in the market place. The publication <b>of</b> the <b>invention</b> is mandatory to get a patent. Keeping the same invention as a trade secret, rather than disclose by publication, could prove valuable well beyond the time of any limited patent term, but at the risk <b>of</b> congenial <b>invention</b> through third party.|$|R

40|$|Clinical {{research}} faces a reproducibility crisis. Many recent {{clinical and}} preclinical studies {{appear to be}} irreproducible—their results cannot be verified by outside researchers. This is problematic for not only scientific reasons but also legal ones: patents grounded in irreproducible research appear to fail their constitutional bargain of property rights in exchange for working <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions.</b> The culprit is likely patent law’s doctrine of enablement. Although the doctrine requires patents to enable others to make and use their claimed inventions, current difficulties in applying the doctrine hamper or even actively dissuade reproducible data in patents. This Article assesses the difficulties in reconciling these basic goals of scientific research and patent law. More concretely, it provides several examples of irreproducibility in patents on blockbuster drugs—Prempro, Xigris, Plavix, and Avastin—and discusses some of the social costs of the misalignment between good clinical practice and patent doctrine. Ultimately, this analysis illuminates several current debates concerning innovation policy. It strongly suggests that a proper conception of enablement should take into account after-arising evidence. It also sheds light on the true purpose—and limits—of patent disclosure. And lastly, it untangles the doctrines of enablement and utility...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the struggle}} over rights to benefits and ownership of plant genetic resources and the global regime complex on the management of plant genetic resources, and how different regimes concerning these resources cooperate or stand in opposition to each other. Because of changes in US patent law {{and the establishment of}} TRIPS, patent claims over plant genetic resources has increased dramatically globally. This, amongst other things, in turn has lead to the acrimonious negotiations of access and benefit sharing arrangements within the framework CBD. The objective of this thesis is to examine the interaction between the international regimes regulating genetic resources and intellectual property and to analyse how these regime interactions, affect the protection of traditional knowledge held by local communities, indigenous peoples and small farmers in developing countries. The thesis concludes that it exists several regime interactions that are disruptive and undermine the possibility of protecting traditional knowledge from misappropriation.

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{understood that the}} patent system exists to encourage the conception and <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> new and useful inventions embodied in machines and other physical devices, along with new methods that physically transform matter from one state to another. What is not well understood is whether, and to what extent, the patent system is to encourage and protect the conception and <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions</b> that are non-physical methods – namely {{those that do not}} result in a physical transformation of matter. This issue was considered in Grant v Commissioner of Patents. In that case the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia held that an invention must involve a physical effect or transformation to be patentable subject matter. In doing so, it introduced a physicality requirement into Australian law. What this article seeks to establish is whether the court’s decision is consistent with the case law on point. It does so by examining the key common law cases that followed the High Court’s watershed decision in National Research Development Corporation v Commissioner of Patents, the undisputed authoritative statement of principle in regard to the patentable subject matter standard in Australia. This is done with a view to determining whether there is anything in those cases that supports the view that the Australian patentable subject matter test contains a physicality requirement...|$|R
