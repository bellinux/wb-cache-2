40|$|During hot {{and humid}} periods, a {{comfortable}} indoor environment can be attained only by controlling both the dry-bulb temperature and the humidity in the space. Conventional thermostats control the ON/OFF status of a cooling plant to maintain only the dry-bulb temperature within the conditioned space. This can result in the space dew-point temperature increasing to uncomfortable levels, especially during cool and humid {{times of the day}} and/or when there is high latent gain. Consequently, the occupant must resort to undesirable and inefficient interventions (e. g., manually lowering the space dry-bulb temperature set point) to "sweat out" the water from the air. An innovative controller, the Integrated Temperature and <b>Humidity</b> <b>Controller,</b> has been invented for controlling both the dry-bulb temperature and the absolute moisture content of the air in a conditioned space. These new algorithms have been implemented in a product prototype, and limited field tests have been performed. Preliminary results confirm the expected operation and performance of the controller and its robustness and are extremely encouraging...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, indoor {{temperature}} and humidity controls have been more important to provide thermal comfort to occupants. In residential and commercial buildings, split-type air conditioning systems {{have been widely used}} for its compactness and installation flexibility. However, the current split-type systems could not effectively control the thermal comfort of the occupants due to its insufficiency in humidity control. In this paper, the existing independent {{temperature and}} <b>humidity</b> <b>controllers</b> of the single unit split-type system are reviewed. Then, the study has extended to the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system, which is a typical multiple-unit split-type system. Several VRF systems that has the humidity control option have been reviewed and their performance is discussed. Based on the literature review, the feasibility of VRF systems with independent temperature and <b>humidity</b> <b>controllers</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of different levels of relative humidity (RH) on the maintenance of Postharvest quality of 'Niagara Rosada' table grapes after cold storage at 0. 5 &# 176;C for 21 days. A completely randomized design was used, with five replicates of 18 clusters per treatment. The selected levels of relative humidity were 85, 90, 95 and 100 %, obtained by means of electronic <b>humidity</b> <b>controllers.</b> The fruits were evaluated in relation to rot incidence, berry cracking, browning rate, respiratory rate, titratable acidity, soluble solids, resistance to abscission, berry drop and weight loss. The evaluations were assessed at 20 days of storage and after two and four days of shelf-life (20 &# 176;C; 85 % RH). The results showed that as higher as relative humidity, higher is rot incidence and that the variables rachis browning and weight loss {{were inversely related to}} relative humidity. Resistance to abscission at the end of storage was higher when humidity ranged between 90 and 95 %, but it was not affected after transfer to shelf-life from cold storage. Relative humidity ranging between 90 and 95 % offer the best conditions to maintain the Postharvest quality of 'Niagara Rosada' table grape...|$|R
40|$|A {{large-scale}} experimental, {{state of}} the art storage facility was constructed on the Macdonald Campus of McGill University. This storage facility will serve as a tool to further investigate many of the laboratory experiments performed in agricultural and food science topics, by providing a representation of actual storage facilities in use in the industry today. The storage facility was fully instrumented to provide valuable data of the stored commodity and it's environment. A custom control software was developed with a user friendly graphical interface. This fully automated software allows data acquisition and control of temperature and relative humidity of the experimental storage facility. Experiments were performed and the control software provided an adequate temperature and relative <b>humidity</b> control. The <b>controller</b> was based on a conventional PID or proportional, integral and derivative controller. To further improve the control of the storage facility, a novel multivariable PID controller was developed using enthalpy as the process variable, which encompasses both temperature and relative <b>humidity.</b> The novel <b>controller</b> was tested using a mathematical model developed. Simulations were performed comparing the performance of the novel multivariable controller to two other conventional controllers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the experimental and theoretical investigations, the modelling and the simulation of a 2, 5 kW PEMFC. The relationship of the three subsystems stacks, humidity and temperature control circuit is pointed out. The developed simulation models for the stack and the humidity control are described in detail. It is found, that the FSC can only operate stably and provide a high power quality, if the membrane humidity can be kept at a constant level. The original <b>humidity</b> <b>controller</b> was found to be not suited for a stable control across the whole range of operating points. Especially for partial load, the dehydration of the membrane and the fluctuating stack voltage were intolerable. These problems were addressed and solved by means of simulations and the introduction of a new control concept, a closed-loop Pl-controller combined with an open-loop model-reference control. The new control concept was implemented and tested. The FSC immediately showed the desired stabilisation and improvement of power quality. The simulation models were found to be valuable tools in the process of the controller redesign and optimization...|$|E
40|$|Cereus Peruvianus (night {{blooming}} Cereus, or peruvian apple) {{is one of}} {{the sensitive}} species to Phoma attack. Photographic images can intercept a certain phytopathology, at a certain moment. The computerized analysis of such an image turns into a value the spread which the phytopathological process has at that moment. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assimilate the technique of achieving successions of digital photos of Cereus peruvianus f. monstruosa attacked by Phoma sp. Parallely with recording the images, with the help of Rhythm digital temperature <b>humidity</b> <b>controller,</b> were recorded data about the green house microclimate (air humidity-minimum and maximum, temperature-minimum and maximum). In the first stage of the study, the attack presents small fluctuations, reaching a high level in days with low temperatures. So, the most significant growths were recorded in the periods: 10. 02. 2005 - 20. 02. 2005 with an affected area of 10. 97 - 8. 82 = 2. 15 and 11. 03. 2005 - 22. 04. 2005 with growth differences of 14. 67 - 13. 32 = 1. 35.

40|$|The Smart Grid is an {{evolution}} of the existing electricity grid. It comprises of a two-way communication where electricity and information is exchanged by the consumer and utility to maximize efficiency. Home automation is an important milestone in achieving smart grid and is ever exciting field that has exploded {{over the past few}} years. Advancement in technologies have made homes more convenient, efficient and even more secure. Introducing the Raspberry Pi to the world of home automation provides numerous customizations to turn a regular home into a smart home. Raspberry Pi provides a low cost platform for interconnecting electrical/electronic devices and various sensors in a home via the internet network. The main objective of present work is to design a smart home using various sensors which can be controlled and monitored by the Raspberry Pi via the Internet of Things (IoT). This will help the home owners to provide a simple, fast and reliable way to automate their environment. This paper focuses on two aspects of smart home i. e. home security and home automation. Home security system, capable of motion & disturbance detection at entry points and creating an alarm system with email notification alerts having picture, was implemented to allow real time monitoring for the house.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the development of}} an inexpensive control system for a miniature cropping house which uses the method of crop production. The control system was first developed in the Matlab-Simulink environment where it controlled a simulated model of the plant. The model was composed of four differential equations describing, air temperature in the cropping house, water temperature, C 0 2 concentration and inside <b>humidity.</b> The <b>controller</b> comprises a fuzzy ‚Äúexpert‚Äù controller which accepts inputs of light intensity and air temperature and returns fan speed and water temperature set-point as outputs. The latter was applied as a set-point for digital PID controller which controls water temperature in the cropping house. Expert advice, as well as knowledge of the plant gained from observation of the plant and the model, were used to develop fuzzy sets and a fuzzy rule-base. The controller was implemented in Matlab simulation language and tested on the model of the plant. Finally, the controller was implemented in ‚ÄúC‚Äù source and assembly for a standalone Motorola 68 HC 11 microprocessor based digital controller Development of software for the micro-controller was conducted using the Motorola‚Äôs Evaluation Tool-kit PCBUG.

40|$|The NASA Toxic Vapor Detection Laboratory (TVDL) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, {{has been}} using Personal Computer based Data Acquisition and Control Systems (PCDAS) for about nine years. These systems control the {{generation}} of toxic vapors of known concentrations under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity. The PCDAS also logs the test conditions and the test article responses in data files for analysis by standard spreadsheets or custom programs. The PCDAS was originally developed to perform standardized qualification and acceptance tests {{in a search for}} a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) toxic vapor detector to replace the hydrazine detectors for the Space Shuttle launch pad. It has since become standard test equipment for the TVDL and is indispensable in producing calibration standards for the new hydrazine monitors at the 10 part per billion (ppb) level. The standard TVDL PCDAS can control two toxic vapor generators (TVG's) with three channels each and two flow/ temperature / <b>humidity</b> (FTH) <b>controllers</b> and it can record data from up to six toxic vapor detectors (TVD's) under test and can deliver flows from 5 to 50 liters per minute (L/m) at temperatures from near zero to 50 degrees Celsius (C) using an environmental chamber to maintain the sample temperature. The concentration range for toxic vapors depends on the permeation source installed in the TVG. The PCDAS can provide closed loop control of temperature and humidity to two sample vessels, typically one for zero gas and one for the standard gas. This is required at very low toxic vapor concentrations to minimize the time required to passivate the sample delivery system. Recently, there have been several requests for information about the PCDAS by other laboratories with similar needs, both on and off KSC. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to inform the toxic vapor detection community of the current status and planned upgrades to the automated testing of toxic vapor detectors at the Kennedy Space Center...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{control for}} {{protected}} crops brings the added dimension of a biological system into a physical system control situation. The plants in a greenhouse impose their own needs, significantly affect their ambient conditions in a nonlinear way, and add long-tune constants {{to the system}} response. Moreover, the thermally dynamic nature of a greenhouse Suggests that disturbance attenuation (load control of external temperature, humidity, and sunlight) {{is far more important}} than is the case for controlling other types of buildings. This paper presents a feedback-feed forward approach to system linearization and decoupling for climate control of greenhouses and more specifically for the operation of ventilation/cooling and moisturizing. The proposed method consists of three parts: (a) a model-based feedback-feedforward compensation of external disturbances (loads) on the basis of input-output linearization and decoupling; (b) the transformation of user-defined desired settings for temperature and <b>humidity</b> into feasible <b>controller</b> setpoints, taking into account the constraints imposed by the capacities of the actuators and the psychrometric laws; and (c) additional PI outer loops to compensate for model uncertainties and deviations from expected disturbances (weather). Moreover, some tuning tests lump together several physical system parameters to be easily identified, and the method guarantees accuracy in setpoint tracking while simplifying stability issues. The proposed method is applicable to any air-conditioning system and is expected to gain wide acceptance in modern climate control systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{control for}} housed animals is of {{substantial}} importance {{but it is}} also a difficult and complicated task. The animals in a livestock building affect temperature and humidity conditions inside the building in a nonlinear way, and add long time constants to the system response. Moreover, the inherent coupling of temperature and humidity through psychrometric laws as well as the thermally dynamic, nature of livestock buildings suggest that disturbance attenuation (load control of external environmental conditions, heat emanated by the animals and water-vapour production of animals) is far more important than is the case of other types of buildings. To settle these concerns, a non-linear control design method, resulting in an inherently robust adaptive non-linear proportional integral control law for simultaneous temperature/ humidity control of livestock buildings in both summer and winter conditions, is presented in this paper. The proposed method, successfully tested here through extensive simulation, relies on: (a) a model-based feedback/ feed-forward compensation of measured external disturbances on the basis of input-output linearisation, decoupling and Lyapunov theory; (b) a robust non-linear compensation of unknown external system disturbances and parametric uncertainties, on the basis of non-linear damping terms, to guarantee small output deviations from desired set-point values; and (c) an adaptive non-linear control law incorporating integral action to cope for parametric model uncertainty and unknown disturbances and to guarantee zero steady-state offset in the system response. Its ability to track varying set-points provides the possibility to combine it with higher level control modules useful for the transformation of user-defined settings for temperature and <b>humidity</b> into feasible <b>controller</b> set-points, taking into account the constraints imposed by the capacities of the actuators, the psychrometric laws, animal welfare, etc. The proposed method is applicable to any air-conditioning system and is expected to gain wide acceptance in modern climate control systems.

40|$|Controlling indoor {{humidity}} at {{an appropriate}} level {{is very important}} since this affects occupants' thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ). The paper presents an investigation on developing a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) control strategy for simultaneously controlling the indoor air temperature and humidity by varying the speeds of both compressor and supply fan in an experimental DX A/C system. The MIMO-based controller was designed based on the linearized dynamic model of the experimental DX A/C system. The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) technique was used in designing the MIMO-based controller. The controllability tests with respect to both the disturbance rejection capability and the command following capability were carried out to assess the control performance of MIMO controller. The results of disturbance rejection capability test showed that the MIMO control strategy can effectively maintain the indoor air temperature and humidity to their respective settings after an unmeasured heat load disturbance was imposed by simultaneously varying speeds of both the compressor and the supply fan of the DX A/C system. Furthermore, in the command following capability test for indoor air temperature, the test {{results showed that the}} indoor air temperature can be controlled to its new setting while indoor humidity remained unchanged. Similar test results were also observed in the command following capability test for indoor humidity. Therefore, the MIMO controller developed can effectively control indoor air temperature and humidity simultaneously by varying compressor speed and supply fan speed of the DX A/C system. Compared to the previous related studies using conventional on-off control method or single-input single-output (SISO) control strategy, which can only effectively control either air temperature or relative <b>humidity,</b> the MIMO <b>controller</b> can simultaneously control the indoor air temperature and humidity with adequate control sensitivity and accuracy. The application of MIMO control strategy developed can be extended to other HVAC systems in the future to improve their operating performance and energy efficiency.
