40|$|China {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} wine markets in the world. Wine businesses from major wine-producing countries have been focusing on this market. New Zealand, as the fastest growing wine producer in the New World countries, has targeted East Asia, especially China, as an export destination. However, the market share and reputation of New Zealand wines has not been very high and many New Zealand <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> have neither understood the Chinese market very well, nor successfully set up their export business there. The findings of this study will inform current and potential <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> from New Zealand of effective market entry procedures. A qualitative methodology was employed to identify the key elements of exporting New Zealand wine to China. Fourteen businesses, including eleven New Zealand <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> and three China-based wine import distributors were interviewed. The data was analysed using qualitative data methods. The study found that New Zealand <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> have used four market entry modes, chosen according to the different characteristics of their businesses: indirect exporting, direct exporting, joint venture, and acquisition. This study also identified key elements in successfully exporting New Zealand wine to China, including the selection of market entry modes, distribution channels, and suitable importer/distributors, the initial organisation of the wine export process, and the development of business relationships. Challenges to this success have also been identified, such as the current Chinese preference for red wines, the small scale of the New Zealand wine industry, the orientation towards short-term profit by Chinese traders, and identifying suitable business partners. Recommendations are also made for the development of successful export business by New Zealand wine producers in the future. Key words: market entry, wine export, China wine market...|$|R

This paper is a summary of the research developed during 2004 - 2006 at the UPM with Argentinean exporters. The selection of UK market was due to the high degree of competition between international wines: European, American, Australian and others. Secondary information was collected from EU and Argentina publication and data bases.

The presentation describes the strengths and weaknesses of the more significant <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> with a SWOT matrix analysis. Argentina has comparative advantages in wine production but the main problem is the wine network exporting performance. The challenge is how to design adequate strategies, involving public and private national resources and get adequate quota market in the coming future. Some specific recommendations are related to: Firms and country commercial brands, relationship exporters-UK retailers, trade brands shared by producers and commercial agents, promotion and publicity of Argentinean wines in UK. Other scenarios of future development are the improvement of firm strategic alliances, rising added value in the <b>wine</b> chain for <b>exporters</b> and communication programs with UK society.

40|$|PURPOSE: There {{has been}} no {{significant}} research undertaken in the Japanese market on wine knowledge level and its relationship with brand loyalty and preference for specific country-of-origin (COO) wine brands. This exploratory study seeks to investigate these aspects and how wine knowledge is acquired and used in buying decisions. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A highly structured, self-administered questionnaire in the Japanese language was used to collect data over a three-week period. Data include consumers from six of the eight major regional divisions across Japan. The sample population was female-weighted with moderate levels of education and medium income. A ten-item objective wine knowledge scale was developed to measure consumers’ knowledge levels and to {{form the basis for}} segmentation. FINDINGS: Japanese wine consumers with higher levels of objective knowledge were shown to use more intrinsic cues than extrinsic cues in their purchase decisions, with the importance attributed to intrinsic cues increasing as objective knowledge increases. The study showed consumers with higher levels of objective knowledge do not use the COO cue more than consumers with lower knowledge. Wine consumers view taste, variety and price as the most important buying cues and are influenced by the recommendations of people around them. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This research provided insights into the Japanese wine market {{and the nature of the}} Japanese wine consumer. It is recommended that <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> focus greater marketing efforts on Japanese women, including greater wine education. ORIGINIALITY/VALUE: This study is of value to academic researchers, wine educators, industry practitioners such as restaurant owners/sommeliers and <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> alike, as it provides insights into the direction and extent of COO preferences and hence wine (country) brand loyalty.

40|$|The 1860 – 1970 {{period is}} a {{particularly}} interesting period to study wine trade because of {{dramatic changes in the}} wine markets and trade {{over the course of a}} century. The dramatic changes in trade flows were caused by both “nature” and “men”. Mediterranean wine trade represented around 90 % of global wine trade and France was the world’s leading exporter. The arrival of Phylloxera devastated French vineyards and stimulated Spanish and Italian wine exports. When French wine production recovered, French winegrowers pressured their government to intervene, resulting in high tariffs on Spanish and Italian wines and Greek raisins. The protectionist trade regime contributed to the bankruptcy of Greece and to the substitution of wine trade from Spain and Italy to France’s North African colonies. When Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia became independent, France imposed high wine tariffs, effectively killing their wine exports.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the loyalty of Japanese {{consumers}} to country-of-origin (COO) wine brands and how this affects purchasing behaviour. Design/methodology/approach – A multi-dimensional COO brand loyalty scale was developed containing attitudinal (psychological) and behavioural loyalty dimensions. A total of 173 responses were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire in the Japanese language. Findings – Japanese wine consumers have moderate levels of COO brand loyalty, with high levels of satisfaction, moderate-high levels of inertia and price sensitivity and moderate levels of word-of-mouth, emotional attachment, commitment and purchase intent. Furthermore, 46 per cent of respondents exhibited true COO brand loyalty. The conceptual definition of COO wine brand loyalty proved to be sound with a high level of measurement scale reliability (a = 0. 884). Practical implications – The findings provide insights into the Japanese wine market and the nature of Japanese wine consumer behaviour. <b>Wine</b> <b>exporters</b> should focus greater marketing efforts on Japanese women, including more wine-specific education.

Primary data regarding wine trade has been collected for the period of 2004 - 2011, referring to four main European producer countries, namely Greece, France, Germany and Bulgaria. A gravity equation model has been estimated in order to examine the factors that determine wine exports and wine exports competitiveness among those countries. The results offer a clear picture of the wine trade dynamics in the EU market, indicating as key determinants for its competitiveness the size of each country's economy, the geographical distance from other EU countries, the presence of common borders or common language among trading nations as well as the size of per capita wine consumption to the European wine markets...|$|R
40|$|This study {{adds to the}} {{knowledge}} base {{on the level of}} product involvement, brand loyalty, and preference for country-of-origin wine brands of Japanese wine consumers. A highly structured, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from Japanese wine consumers from six of the eight major regional divisions across Japan. A 17 -item wine product involvement scale measured consumers’ involvement levels and formed the basis for analysis. Regression analysis on brand loyalty and involvement show a low positive association between them. Involvement is influenced by the age demographic, and increases with age until the 35 – 45 - year age group (Generation-X) and then slowly decreases. A strong positive relationship exists between consumption frequency and quantity, and the level of involvement. High involvement consumers show a strong preference for Old World-produced wines, mainly from France and Italy. Consumers living in Chubu have the highest level of involvement, followed by Hokkaido and Kanto, which suggests that <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> should look beyond Tokyo for the opportunities in the regional areas of Japan.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{new century}} has {{provoked}} {{the liberalization of}} the world economy and market globalization. International marketing has opened the borders for all countries, which can compete with the same competitive tools, increasing the rivalry among them. This thesis deals with the wine sector and the changes that this sector has suffered in previous years, due to the entrance of new producer countries and the recession that has been produced by European wines, called “Old World” producers. In this study we will make an analysis of the Swedish wine market, describing how the different players act; from consumers to the special system of alcohol distribution that is controlled by the government, {{all the way to the}} producers and kinds of wine that compose the market. Among the different wine producers we will make a thorough study of the Spanish case, given that we come from Spain, where the wine industry has a special relevance. Furthermore, Spain is one of the most important <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> to Sweden, but in the last years it has suffered a small decrease in its market share. So apart from studying the current situation of the wine sector in Sweden and how consumers perceive the wine of “Old World” countries, such as France, Italy and Spain and “New World” countries, such as Australia, Chile and South Africa, our main objective is to make some strategic recommendations in order to improve the situation for Spanish wine.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to identify, {{describe}} and analyze the marketing communications strategies used by South African wineries to highlight the country of origin information of products exported into foreign markets. Four South African wine exporting companies participated in this study by providing information through email and telephone interviews. Results indicated that South African wineries emphasize the country of origin information in all marketing communications activities and especially through wine product attributes. The origin of wine is highlighted in packaging and labeling as a mandatory requirement in most wine importing countries. The most common label on packaging appears as ‘____South Africa’. Most <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> also use the country’s biodiversity information and ethical work standards to convey positive information to foreign consumers about the country’s wine industry. There was no generalization that country of origin information severely affected wines sales in foreign markets. This was in exception to the US market, where promotion activities need to be reviewed and enhanced. Furthermore, South African wine low market value was more associated with the high bulk export volumes. Participating wineries considered the country’s image abroad to be more important than their own individual brands. South African wine exporting companies together with the country’s official wine promotion agency (WOSA) must analyze the country’s image in all aspects, re-evaluate the capacity of the country as a wine producer, and maybe regulate its bulk export volumes, which appear to negatively impact on SA wine value and perception in foreign markets. Future research can focus on how the South African wine industry can increase their brand awareness for premium wine brands in export markets. In addition, South African wine marketing approach highlighting its deep French roots and expertise in wine making can be explored to evaluate if such marketing approach can enhance the country’s premium wine brands in foreign market acceptance...|$|R
