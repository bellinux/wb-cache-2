25|$|In {{a review}} of the book, Irwin M. Berg, a lawyer and friend of the Kaifeng Jewish community, claims Weisz never <b>figured</b> <b>the</b> many {{religious}} documents—Torah, Haggadah, prayer books, etc.—into his thesis and only relied on the stelae themselves. Such documents can be roughly dated from their physical and scribal characteristics. Even though he refers to Persian words utilized in the stelae, Weisz did not include a study on when the Judeo-Persian language of the liturgical documents first came into use in his thesis. Judeo-Persian first developed in Central Asia during the 8th century, well after the author supposes the Jews first entered China. Berg questions the historical reliability of the three stone inscriptions themselves. He gives one anachronistic example where the Jews claim it was an emperor of the Ming Dynasty who bequeathed the land used to build their first synagogue in 1163 during the Song Dynasty.|$|E

[...] In a {{conversation}} with Naulls after the game, Chamberlain predicted he would win his NBA championships but still be known for his individualism, versus Russell who was credited for making his team—the Boston Celtics—great. Two days after the historic feat, Chamberlain made a guest appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.|$|E

[...] In explaining how she came up with the nautical name, Reynard said: [...] "I realized that there were two letters which had to be in it: W for women and V for volunteer, because the Navy wants {{to make it clear that}} this is a voluntary service and not a drafted service. So I played with those two letters and the idea of the sea and finally came up with Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service – WAVES. [...] I <b>figured</b> <b>the</b> word Emergency would comfort the older admirals because it implies that we're only a temporary crisis and won't be around for keeps." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{one episode}} [...] "Death" [...] heavily {{influenced}} the film's screenplay. The plot and theme of both scripts revolves heavily around {{the parents of}} South Park protesting about Terrance and Phillip due to the perceived negative influence it has over their children. Parker said, [...] "After about {{the first year of}} South Park, Paramount already wanted to make a South Park movie, and we sort of thought this episode would make the best model just because we liked the sort of pointing at ourselves kind of thing." [...] During the time, the team was also busy writing the second and third seasons of the series, the former of which Parker and Stone later described as [...] "disastrous". As such, they <b>figured</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon would be over soon, and they decided to write a personal, fully committed musical.|$|E
500|$|Bannings of Candide lasted {{into the}} twentieth century in the United States, where it has long been {{considered}} a seminal work of Western literature. At least once, Candide was temporarily barred from entering America: in February 1929, a US customs official in Boston prevented a number of copies of the book, deemed [...] "obscene", from reaching a Harvard University French class. Candide was admitted in August of the same year; however by that time the class was over. In an interview soon after Candides detention, the official who confiscated the book explained the office's decision to ban it, [...] "But about 'Candide,' I'll tell you. For years we've been letting that book get by. There were so many different editions, all sizes and kinds, some illustrated and some plain, that we <b>figured</b> <b>the</b> book must be all right. Then one of us happened to read it. It's a filthy book".|$|E

500|$|A March 1969 {{meeting between}} Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Chris Kraft {{determined}} that Armstrong {{would be the}} first person on the Moon, in some part because NASA management saw Armstrong as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference held on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the lunar module pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. Slayton added, [...] "Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I <b>figured</b> <b>the</b> commander ought to be the first guy out... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision." [...] At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his 2001 autobiography.|$|E
500|$|Particularly {{after his}} fastball slowed, Young relied upon his control. Young was once quoted as saying, [...] "Some {{may have thought}} it was {{essential}} to know how to curve a ball before anything else. Experience, to my mind, teaches to the contrary. Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time. The curve is merely an accessory to control." [...] In addition to his exceptional control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury. For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Young was in his leagues' top ten for innings pitched; in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games. By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in spring training. [...] "I <b>figured</b> <b>the</b> old arm had just so many throws in it", said Young, [...] "and there wasn't any use wasting them." [...] Young once described his approach before a game: ...|$|E

And I <b>figured</b> <b>the</b> song would have to be devoid of subtext. That's why 'Lullabye' felt like a fit." [...] When Jim lowers the volume on Michael's computer, the tell-tale [...] "click" [...] of a Mac computer comes out of the speakers. Daniels and Chun note that this was intentional, and they wanted that specific sound, even though Windows computers do not make that sound. Pam's southern accent is compared to the fictional character Forrest Gump. After Andy successfully does a Savannah accent, Kevin asks him to do [...] "the Swedish Chef". Andy, not understanding the reference asks [...] "what province" [...] he is from, to which Kevin replies that [...] "he lives on Sesame Street, dumbass." [...] Angela blames her character's dabbling with the dark arts—she portrays a witch doctor in the game—with being exposed to the Harry Potter series.|$|E

2500|$|Kamaal/The Abstract {{contains}} introspective lyrical themes. Opening {{with the}} album's only rock chord, the opening track [...] "Feelin' It" [...] {{is one of}} the album's few tracks with him rapping and it contains one verse about common life experiences and hassles. It introduces Q-Tip {{on his way to a}} recording studio, during which he is stopped by a police officer who profiles him: [...] "This profiling cop with his profiling ass / <b>Figured</b> <b>the</b> best thing he could do was find a cat to harass. / The little kitten was me, not that one in the tree / The black one with the promise and the wish to be free". The lyrics are based on an experience that Q-Tip had with a policeman. John Murph of Jazz Times interpreted the song's verse as a metaphor for Q-Tip's struggles for absolute creative freedom without resulting in critical backlash. Tiny Mix Tapess Brendan Mahoney interpreted the [...] "profilin' cop" [...] in the song as [...] "another mundane and too-predictable distraction in a world full of them".|$|E
2500|$|Parker and Stone {{signed a}} deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that {{contracted}} the duo to producing South Park episodes until 1999, gave them {{a slice of the}} lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its first year, as well as an unspecified seven-figure cash bonus to bring the show to the big screen, in theaters. During the time, the team was also busy writing the second and third seasons of the series, the former of which Parker and Stone later described as [...] "disastrous". As such, they <b>figured</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon would be over soon, and they decided to write a personal, fully committed musical. Parker and Stone fought with the MPAA to keep the film R-rated; for months the ratings board insisted on the more prohibitive NC-17. The film was only certified an R rating two weeks prior to its release, following contentious conversations between Parker/Stone, Rudin, and Paramount Pictures. Parker felt very overwhelmed and overworked during the production process of the film, especially between April and the film's opening in late June. He admitted that press coverage, which proclaimed the end of South Park was near, bothered him.

2500|$|Performed by the Four Freshmen, [...] "Their Hearts Were Full of Spring" [...] (1961) was a {{particular}} favorite of the Beach Boys. Brian explained: [...] "My mom turned me on to them.

We went in [...] and she said you can take records into these little booths and play them to see if you wanted to buy them. ... You know how you sit in a sauna bath and the sweat will come out? That's what that whole experience in that room started to be. I purged all kinds of bullshit and picked up the Freshmen. It was magic. Total magic." [...] By deconstructing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Lambert notes, [...] "If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song." [...] Wilson continued: [...] "I learned them bar by bar. I'd go to my hi-fi set and I'd play a little bit.

He's not medically cleared, Mack has to go in and sort of change the medical records so that Jonas can keep on [...] We had a whole thing planned, it was going to be good." [...] Jonas would eventually leave the army due to his injuries coupled with combat stress and reunite with Molly. Mack would take over the team but at the end of the series would also leave for a training post after Tiffy becomes pregnant with their third child. Bob would be badly injured in a parachuting accident and join the CIA as their Unit liaison. Ryan would take a demotion to regain control of The Unit whilst Bridget Sullivan would be killed on a mission halfway through the season.
