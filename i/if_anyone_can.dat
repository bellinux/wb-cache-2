500|$|Mellisa Locker of Rolling Stone praised Sanchez's performance, {{calling it}} a [...] "brilliant job" [...] and adding that [...] "it's risky, but Beyoncé has done it, and <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> pull off a {{dazzling}} repeat performance, it's Jessica". She further compared the performance with the dream sequence from the 1945 film Spellbound but noted that it was [...] "slightly weirder" [...] Jim Farber of the Daily News commented that [...] "her take on a song by her clear role model, Beyoncé, showed too much similarity in their timbres and phrasing, making Sanchez's voice seem redundant...despite the fact she switched up {{the arrangement of the}} bootylicious song she chose, 'Sweet Dreams.'" [...] Laura Schreffler of the Daily Mail described Sanchez' performance as [...] "pared-down, show-stopping...a floaty, dreamy, confection that wows the judges." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Sanchez gave yet another perfectly calibrated performance with Beyoncé's 'Sweet Dreams,' balancing restraint and power. Everything from her voice to her dress to the red door she walked through seemed polished and tour-ready." [...] The Arizona Republics Randy Cordova praised the performance, saying that the slow-tempo version allowed Sanchez [...] "to really delve into the song's emotional core". The Hollywood Reporters Erin Carlson praised the tonned-down theatrical stage during the performance and Sanchez's vibrato voice, further describing the performance as a [...] "near-perfection".|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics have}} commended the {{development}} of Cheryl, as well as Greer's portrayal of the character. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall declared that Cheryl was his favorite character on the show. In his review for [...] "El Secuestro", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club felt that Greer's vocals were {{the highlight of the}} episode, and affirmed that she effectively portrayed the unstable characteristics of Cheryl. [...] "Greer is mostly just asked to say crazy things as Cheryl, and that’s fun, but she steps it up here, playing both Cheryl’s insanity and the part of her that’s a spoiled trust-fund kid who’s found a day job and has to ride the subway with a dwarf that freaks her out." [...] Likewise, Ian MacDonald of TV Overmind proclaimed that the writers [...] "found a great way to expand on ISIS' most emotionally unstable employees"; [...] "Cheryl, whose crazy has been escalated to an almost extreme," [...] MacDonald stated, [...] "seems almost justified in her maladjusted-ness. She's a billionaire heiress who owns an ocelot and drinks glue [...] Humor involving insane rich people just no getting it is usually pretty funny, and <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> pull it off, it's Adam Reed and [...] Greer." [...] Alongside fellow cast members Jessica Walter and H. Jon Benjamin, Greer was a candidate for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in a Television Production—the award was given to Jeff Bennett for his work in the Nickelodeon television series The Penguins of Madagascar.|$|E

"Miss Independent" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics, who lauded Clarkson for distancing herself from her American Idol persona, but criticized the song's resemblance {{to some of}} the songs on Stripped— particularly [...] "Dirrty" [...] and [...] "Fighter" [...] (2002). On its release, Brian Hiatt of Entertainment Weekly noted that [...] "its hard R sound may shock fans who embraced the mellow [...] "A Moment Like This." [...] "Miss Independent" [...] begins with Clarkson singing in a throaty moan over a bangin' hip-hop beat, then bursts into a power-chord-propelled, disco-diva chorus that's not unlike Britney Spears' [...] "Stronger"." [...] Rolling Stone wrote, [...] ""A Moment Like This" [...] was exactly the sort of treacly by-the-numbers ballad critics expected of a TV-contest winner; that's probably why its assertive follow-up, [...] "Miss Independent," [...] was such a surprise." [...] AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that it [...] "managed to make Kelly Clarkson seem younger and hipper without slutting her up like Christina Aguilera (who, ironically, co-wrote [...] "Miss Independent," [...] the first single from Thankful) while retaining a strong sense of melodic songcraft." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the song [...] "gives Clarkson the youthful edge she desperately needs to balance out the Adult Contemporary goo of songs like [...] "Anytime" [...] and [...] "A Moment Like This." [...] Cinquemani also added, [...] ""Miss Independent" [...] is no [...] "Dirrty," [...] but it proves that <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> out-sing Aguilera, it's Clarkson."

2500|$|In {{its early}} release in the United States, many American critics {{dismissed}} Fires on the Plain as a gratuitously bleak anti-war film. In 1963, The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther gave the film a quite harsh description, writing [...] "Never have I seen a more grisly and physically repulsive film than Fires on the Plain." [...] He continued, [...] "So purposefully putrid is it, {{so full of}} degradation and death... that I doubt <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> sit through it without becoming a little bit ill... That's how horrible it is." [...] He notes however, [...] "this {{is a tribute to}} its maker, for it is perfectly obvious to me that Kon Ichikawa, the director, intended it to be a brutally realistic contemplation of one aspect of war." [...] He points out, [...] "...with all the horror in it, there are snatches of poetry, too..." [...] He ends the review commenting that the only audience who would enjoy the film were those with bitter memories towards the Japanese held over from World War II.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2004, Fältskog {{released}} a new single, [...] "If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind" [...] (a {{cover of the}} song originally recorded by Cilla Black). It peaked at No. 2 in Sweden and became Fältskog's highest charting UK single to date, reaching No.11. One week later, the album My Colouring Book, a collection of Fältskog's covers of 1960s classic oldies, was released, topping the chart in Sweden, hitting the Top Five in Finland and Denmark, and peaking at No. 6 and No. 12 in Germany and the UK respectively. The title track, [...] "My Colouring Book", is a cover of the song originally recorded by Dusty Springfield. The Observer suggested that [...] "time hasn't diminished her perfect voice." [...] Reviewing the release in The Guardian, Caroline Sullivan wrote: [...] "Agnetha Fältskog has a vulnerability that gets under {{the skin of a}} song. She may be cheating a trifle by including no original material on this collection of 1960s covers, but <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> do justice to the likes of [...] "Sealed with a Kiss", it's her. The soaring sentimentality evokes Cilla Black and Sandie Shaw in their mini-skirted pomp, and I don't say that lightly." [...] The release attracted media attention across Europe, but Fältskog staunchly refused to be involved in any extensive promotion of the album (including personal appearances), and thus limited her public exposure to several short newspaper interviews, a few videos, and a Swedish-language TV special. Yet, the album managed to sell around 500,000 copies worldwide (according to Warner Music), 50,000 of those in the United Kingdom alone. The album became the 10th best-selling of 2004 in Sweden.|$|E

5000|$|Princeton {{professor}} Robert P.

[...] This position is seconded by Jennifer Morse of the Witherspoon Institute, who argues that <b>if</b> literally <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> define marriage as whatever they want, the state forfeits the ability to sufficiently secure the best interests of children. She goes further, arguing that the logic of marriage privatization [...] "at the expense of children, is a concept developed by adults that will benefit only adults." ...|$|R
