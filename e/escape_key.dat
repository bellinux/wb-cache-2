Much later printers and computer terminals that would use escape sequences often {{would take more than}} one following byte as part of a special sequence.|$|R

5000|$|Nightlong is {{predominantly}} an inventory management type of game, {{with a few}} puzzles thrown in. The game has backgrounds {{that appear to be}} a mixture of texture-mapped and hand-drawn graphics. The game is played mostly from the third-person perspective, and game characters are cyberpuppets. Background music and sound effects are unobtrusive. The navigation interface uses left-click to examine an object, right-click to use, interact with or combine objects in the game or in inventory. Hotspots are indicated with on-screen text. Many of the game's plot elements rely on finding a single object. For this amount of pixel hunting, a large-screen monitor is recommended. An inventory bar is accessible {{at the bottom of the}} screen, and the <b>Escape</b> <b>key</b> is used for the game control menu. The <b>Escape</b> <b>key</b> can also be used to skip video and dialog sequences, and right-clicking on screen exits avoids waiting for character walking. Useful [...] "Go to..." [...] text indicates previously-unexplored exits. A handy instant-navigation feature is also available for part of the game.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} the results of a remarkable effort to approximate the space of escape solutions of the axi-symmetric, two-degree of freedom dynamical system of the non-linear double oscillator corresponding to a third order potential. The initial conditions of escape solutions constitute a compact two-dimensional space in the (x, C) plane and the solutions generated by them, occupy densely its space of motion. Determination of the part of (x, C), within which ordered (non-chaotic) motions prevail, is better achieved through determination of the space of <b>escape</b> motions. <b>Key</b> words:- Non-linear double oscillator, escape solutions, ordered motions...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 163 - 165) This {{thesis is}} the specification {{and design of}} a portable, full-screen text editor (PED). PED has sufficient text capibilities for the most experienced typist and the most particular programmer. The editor also has the flexibility to be installed for use on any terminal with control and <b>escape</b> <b>keys.</b> The editor capibilities include such features as moving text, copying text, deleting text and changing text [...] all {{with the use of}} cursor control and full-screen display. PED allows scanning a file by moving the window up, down, left, or right, and editing a file by typing changes directly onto the text as it appears in the window. The cursor is positioned by the use of the four ???cursor motion??? keys marked with arrows and by the return and tab keys. In addition, PED provides capabilities used by the experienced typist. Such capabilities include setting of left and right margins and setting and clearing tab stops. Consistent with an electronic typewriter interface, PED will have a displayable columnar ???editor ruler??? as a visual reference for performing these functions. PED is designed for portability. This portability is achieved by designing each task of the editor as a seperate module. It is also important that PED's least portable tasks be isolated as seperate modules. Once these dependent tasks have been isolated, their implementation becomes easier. This makes PED more portable, for use on other computers...|$|R
