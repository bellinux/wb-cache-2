40|$|The therapy of erosive {{lichen planus}} (ELP) has been {{particular}} {{problem in the}} treatment of oral lesions. This case of ELP in male patient 29 years old was treated with topic application of the NBF <b>gingival</b> <b>gel,</b> three times a day after meal, previously rinsed with Clorhexidine gluconate 0. 12 %. After 5 days of treatment, initial improvements were recorded, and after two weeks of application of the NBF <b>gingival</b> <b>gel</b> we observed significant improvement. Clinical monitoring after the fifth day showed mild epithelialization of the eroded mucosa, yet still present erythematous base of the lesion. After the second week the erythema area was significantly reduced and the eroded surfaces of the mucosa were minimal, measured less than 0. 5 mm. After the third week there were no erosions to detect on the oral mucosa, yet still present vague redness, which completely pulled after the fourth week. Treatment ended after the fifth week when the topical application of the NBF <b>gingival</b> <b>gel</b> was terminated, and therapy was done, and clinically achieved effects remained stable even after the third month of the treatment. Topic application of the NBF <b>gingival</b> <b>gel</b> with ELP patients showed positive clinical effects in relatively short time period...|$|E
40|$|Patient {{reported}} {{that during the}} last three years, he had sores appeared on the lips, tongue and cheeks, 2 - 3 times annually, with severe pain emphasized while taking food, inability to speak normally, and difficulties maintain daily oral hygiene. Clinical examination of oral mucosa showed presence of three lesions, two on buccal mucosa and one on the tongue. The aphthae laid on inflamed and edematous surface, had irregular edges, steep bloody sides and milky white covering. Wide hyperemic ring was presented around ulcerated area. The patient applied topically, NBF <b>gingival</b> <b>gel</b> three times daily after meals, prior rinsing with 12 % Chlorhexidine gluconate. Initial improvements were recorded after 7 days of treatment, and after two weeks of gel application significant improvement was noted. There was withdrawal of infiltration and edema, mild epithelization of damaged epithelium with present erythematous base. The pain was moderate, but the problem of maintaining oral hygiene and nutrition was still present. The erythematous area was evidently decreased and epithelization was visibly advanced after the second week. The dimensions of the ulcers was decreased, with depth reduced two times. After the third week ulceration epithelized, but slight redness was still present. Complete withdrew happened after week four...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Over {{the past}} three decades, gallium {{compounds}} have gained importance in medicine. Radioactive gallium and stable gallium nitrate are used as diagnostic and therapeutic agents in cancer and disorders of calcium and bone metabolism. In addition, gallium compounds have displayed anti inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity in animal models of human diseases. More {{recent studies have shown}} that gallium compounds may also function as antimicrobial agents. In the review, the potential application of gallium in the future treatment of periodontitis and prevention of tooth loss will be discussed. Gingival inflammation, bacterial infection, alveolar bone destruction and subsequent tooth loss are characteristic features of periodontal disease. Surgical techniques, mechanical debridement of the denuded root surface, and local or systemic application of antimicrobial agents are currently used treatments for periodontitis. However, the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria has prompted a great need for new and alternative treatment methods for infection. Conclusion: The potential anti-periodontitis benefits of gallium are related to eradicating infection due to bacterial biofilms, increasing bone deposition and downregulating unwanted immune responses. Adjunctive use of gallium laser therapy with mechanical instrumentation in combination with gallium-containing <b>gingival</b> <b>gels,</b> toothpastes and mouth rinses may represent the final solutions for tooth loss prevention...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} the lidocaine/prilocaine topical {{anesthetic}} Oraqix® on pain reduction from orthodontic procedures has been studied previously. The findings of one study suggested the potential usefulness of Oraqix® in performing orthodontic procedures such as band placement and cementation, archwire ligation, and band/bracket removal [25]. The advantage of the topical anesthetic gel Oraqix® was its delivery method, which simply introduced the <b>gel</b> into the <b>gingival</b> crevice. The suggested indication for use was correlated with the reduction of pain during scaling in <b>gingival</b> pockets. The <b>gel</b> hardened with intraoral temperature and hence was easily contained within the gingival crevice. Also, the application procedure was reportedly simple and completely painless [26]. Since Oraqix® {{has not yet been}} used for discomfort and pain relief from the initial elastomeric separator placement, extending the use of Oraqix® to relieve patients from the associated sensation of discomfort would be an interesting achievement.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the present}} study was to explore the {{adjunctive}} use of Acacia arabica gel in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Methods: Single centre, randomised, triple blind, controlled trial on mild to moderate chronic periodontitis patients; Group I (SRP + Acacia arabica, n =  40) and Group II (SRP + placebo, n =  40); were analysed for clinical improvements in periodontal pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment levels (CAL) at baseline, 15 and 90  days on application of <b>gels.</b> <b>Gingival</b> index and plaque index were assessed as secondary parameters. Results: Statistically significant PPD reduction (p < . 05) and CAL gain (p < . 05) was observed with use of Acacia arabica gel. The reduction in sites with moderate PPD was observed more among Group I than Group II and the difference was statistically significant (p = . 001). Secondary outcome variables; Plaque Index and Gingival Index showed better resolution with Acacia arabica gel. Conclusion: Acacia arabica leads to better clinical outcomes in patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis with effective antiplaque and anti-gingivitis action. It may be recommended adjunct to SRP for maintenance in patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Although {{platelet-rich plasma}} (PRP) has been {{proposed}} as a therapeutic tool to enhance wound repair, the cellular and molecular mechanisms stimulated by this agent are still not completely understood. The present {{study was designed to}} characterize the effects of PRP and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) supernatants on cell responses involved in gingival tissue repair. Methods: We studied the response of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) to PRP and PPP fractions on: matrix contraction, cell migration, myofibroblastic differentiation, production of matrix components and proteolytic enzymes. PRP and PPP were obtained from donors using a commercial kit. Matrix contraction was evaluated by means of collagen lattices in the presence of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and actin polymerization inhibitors. The production of matrix molecules and proteinases was assessed through Western-blot. RhoA activity was evaluated through a pulldown assay. Actin distribution and focal adhesions were assessed through immunofluorescence. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) was quantified through ELISA. Results: Both PRP and PPP stimulated human <b>gingival</b> fibroblasts-populated collagen <b>gel</b> contraction and Ilomastat and cytochalasin D inhibited this response. PRP and PPP also stimulated MT 1 -MMP and TIMP- 2 production, RhoA activation and actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cell migration/invasion and myofibroblastic differentiation. TGF-b 1 was found at significantly higher concentrations in PRP than in PPP. Conclusions: Both PRP and PPP promote wound tissue remodeling and contraction through the stimulation of actin remodeling, the activity of MMPs, promotion of cell migration, and myofibroblastic differentiation. The similar biological responses induced by PRP and PPP suggest that both platelet-derived fractions may exert a positive effect on gingival repair...|$|R
