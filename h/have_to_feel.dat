25|$|Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (the RaMCHaL) {{posited that}} God's purpose in {{creation}} {{was to give}} a gift from God's good to another being. Since God is perfect, {{it would have been}} insufficient for God to give merely a partial good. Rather, God would have to give the ultimate good that God's creation – humankind – could receive. As God is the true good, that ultimate good is found in God. Allowing God's creatures to become more attached to God would thus allow them to experience this ultimate receivable good. Thus, the purpose of creation was to bring into existence a creature who could derive pleasure from God's own good. God further recognized that for humanity to most enjoy this good, humanity would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that humanity had earned it. God therefore arranged that humanity be able to perceive right and wrong, and have access to both. God thus gave humanity the means to earn the attachment to God that God sought to give.|$|E
25|$|Development of Pokémon X and Y {{began in}} 2010. Director Junichi Masuda {{revealed}} that the three main themes of X and Y to be beauty, bonds, and evolution. Beauty was the core focus and Masuda felt France to be {{a prime example of}} such; he brought a team to the country for study in 2011. With the games taking place in a region based on France, design inspiration stemmed more from European culture. The legendary trio of Xerneas, Yveltal, and Zygarde have their roots in Norse Mythology, for example. More focus than usual was placed on giving new Pokémon unique elements for this generation. The titles X and Y, representing the x-axis and y-axis—also reflecting different forms of thinking—were chosen early in development. The simplicity of the names was also related to the simultaneous worldwide release of the games. Additionally, designers sought to make the Pokémon names the same in every country whenever possible. Masuda expressed that this effort proved exceptionally difficult as the names <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> fitting to their physical appearance and not infringe upon any rights.|$|E

According to Colbert, while truthiness refers to statements that feel true but are actually false, [...] "Trumpiness" [...] does not even <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> true, much less be true. As evidence that Trump's remarks exhibit this quality, he cited a Washington Post column stating that many Trump supporters did not believe his [...] "wildest promises" [...] but supported him anyway.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} project ready for theaters, Lasseter {{would need to}} add 12 minutes or so of {{material}} and strengthen what was already there. The extra material would be a challenge, since {{it could not be}} mere padding—it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> as if it had always been there, an organic part of the film. With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away, Lasseter called Stanton, Docter, Joe Ranft, and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend.

500|$|Though Lawson {{has enjoyed}} a {{successful}} career in cookery, {{she is not a}} trained chef, and does not like being referred to as a [...] "celebrity chef". Furthermore, she does not see herself as a cook or an expert in her field. Throughout Lawson's television programmes, she emphasises that she cooks for her own pleasure, for enjoyment, and that she finds cooking therapeutic. When deciding upon which recipes to feature in her books, she takes the view of the eater, stating, [...] "If it's something I don't want to carry on eating once I'm full, then I don't want the recipe ...

500|$|Critical {{reactions}} of the episode were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10, calling it [...] "a swift return to form" [...] with [...] "plenty of striking and emotional moments" [...] that made {{it one of the}} better episodes of the first season. Carabott commented on the flashbacks; [...] "We don't necessarily learn anything new about Jack from a personality standpoint," [...] but Fox did [...] "an exceptional job of conveying Jack's heartbreak as he reveals that his father operated on a woman while under the influence of alcohol." [...] He enjoyed Jack and Ethan's encounter, calling it [...] "chilling." [...] Carabott also praised the scene where Jack tries to save Charlie; [...] "I remember believing that they had killed off Charlie on my initial viewing and even though I knew the outcome this time, it was still a hard scene to watch," [...] adding [...] "after Jack finally manages to resuscitate him, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> for Charlie because you know that he's disappointed in himself for letting Claire down." [...] Another IGN article ranked [...] "All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues" [...] the 33rd best Lost episode.|$|E

[...] Empathy involves [...] "emptying the mind and listening with our whole being." [...] NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs you guess they may be expressing.|$|E

Garrett went on to say, [...] "I definitely feel it's what Usher's been wanting to say. But at the same time, it's {{what a lot of people}} wanted to say, they just didn't know what to say." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that [...] "Usher pulls back the curtain, revealing that a rumored rift between him and his mother was very real", and the song could be heard as an [...] "postmortem" [...] on his marriage, through the lines, [...] "For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world/ 'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl, I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama/ I done turned into the man I never thought I'd be/ I'm ready to sign them papers." ...|$|R

500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} everything. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between [...] "friends" [...] and [...] "colleagues". For example, co-workers will rarely be referred to as friends, but often as colleagues.

As for Ricky, I suppose Natalie's always held a torch for him. He was her first love who finished with her, so she's been left with a kind of 'what if?' feeling.

2500|$|Much like Columbus Day, Thanksgiving is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} a [...] "national day of mourning", as a celebration of the cultural genocide and conquest of Native Americans by colonists.

Professor Dan Brook of the University of California, Berkeley condemns the [...] "cultural and political amnesia" [...] of Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving: [...] "We do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> guilty, but we do need to feel something." [...] Professor Robert Jensen of the University of Texas at Austin is somewhat harsher: [...] "One indication of moral progress in the United States would be the replacement of Thanksgiving Day and its self-indulgent family feasting with a National Day of Atonement accompanied by a self-reflective collective fasting."

After rehab Maurice started to rediscover his family again, spending quality time with them. To celebrate this, he and Yvonne renewed their wedding vows in 1992. [...] The ceremony was attended not only by many members of their families but many of the friends Gibb made while at the rehabilitation center. Maurice would remain sober until his death.|$|E
