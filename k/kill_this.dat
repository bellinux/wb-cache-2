5|$|There are {{variants}} {{within this}} tradition. Some versions give {{the credit for}} finding the child to Queen Kirupanci of Chandragiri. Others omit mention of the king of Chandragiri altogether, and omit reference to the Koovagam temple. Instead they focus on the demon Kuttacuran and an apparently impossible boon granted {{to him that he}} will be killed by a person having only a head and who was born from water. Vishnu, incarnated as Krishna, informs the gods that Aravan will <b>kill</b> <b>this</b> demon. With this in mind, the head of Aravan is consigned to the river and is transformed into a child called Kuttan ("born from water"), who kills the demon.|$|E
5|$|Where spotted hyenas and lions {{occupy the}} same {{geographic}} area, {{the two species}} occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can {{be as high as}} 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it is the other way around. Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a <b>kill.</b> <b>This</b> mostly occurs during the nighttime, when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1. The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.|$|E

25|$|Once a bear claims {{an animal}} carcass, {{it becomes very}} {{protective}} of its <b>kill.</b> <b>This</b> becomes a problem when a bear claims a hunter's kill, as the hunter may not wish to kill the bear as well. By avoiding a bear over a carcass, the risk of attack is reduced by around fifty percent.|$|E

25|$|The 1999 film, Onegin, is an English {{adaptation}} of Pushkin's work, directed by Martha Fiennes, and starring Ralph Fiennes as Onegin, Liv Tyler as Tatiana and Toby Stephens as Lensky. The film compresses {{the events of}} the novel somewhat: for example, the Naming Day celebrations take place on the same day as Onegin's speech to Tatiana. The 1999 film, much like the 1988 one, also gives the impression that during the duel sequence Onegin deliberately shoots to <b>kill.</b> <b>This</b> screen version was also criticized for a number of mistakes and inconsistencies.|$|E

25|$|On 18 August 1964, {{the first}} F-100D {{shot down by}} ground fire, piloted by 1st Lt Colin A. Clarke, of the 428th TFS; Clarke ejected and survived. On 4 April 1965, as escorts {{protecting}} F-105s attacking the Thanh Hoa Bridge, F-100 Super Sabres fought the USAF's first air-to-air jet combat duel in the Vietnam War, in which an F-100 piloted by Captain Donald W. Kilgus of the 416th Fighter Squadron shot down a North Vietnamese Air Force MiG-17, using cannon fire, while another fired Sidewinder missiles. The surviving North Vietnamese pilot confirmed three of the MiG-17s had been shot down. Although recorded by the U.S. Air Force as a probable <b>kill,</b> <b>this</b> represented the first aerial victory by the U.S. Air Force in Vietnam. However, the small force of four MiG-17s had penetrated the escorting F-100s to claim two F-105s. The F-100 was soon replaced by the F-4C for MiG CAP which pilots noted suffered for lacking built-in guns for dogfights.|$|E
25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so much control is because he determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must <b>kill.</b> <b>This</b> causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control is because he is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much easier for him to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that makes it hard for them to leave.|$|E

500|$|Mills {{noted that}} consequentialism does not merely {{expect that the}} {{consequences}} to one entity is determined. It requires {{a review of the}} consequences to all. When Marty observes Judd's out-of-season shooting of a deer, he uses the incident to blackmail him to sell Shiloh to him. However, this places deer in the future in danger of Judd's hunting. Marty sadly reflects: [...] "By lettin' him get away with this, I'm putting other deer in danger. He <b>kill</b> <b>this</b> one out of season, he'll figure maybe he can kill some more. To save Shiloh, I'm making it harder for deer". In essence, he selects the [...] "domestic love over the grander principle".|$|E
500|$|Reception of the game's storyline was mixed. Although Shoemaker and Sliwinski praised its [...] "dark" [...] tone, Shoemaker {{found some}} story {{elements}} (such as Gollum's introduction) forced {{and designed to}} appeal to a particular audience. According to Game Informer Matt Miller, Shadow of Mordor fails to successfully tie together all of its various plot threads in the game's conclusion. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot also found the storyline erratic, dragged down by anti-climactic fights and scenes. Dan Stapleton of IGN wrote that the story introduced memorable characters but would not make sense to fans of the series, and his interest in the game waned towards its end. Destructoid Chris Carter was disappointed in a plot he considered generic ("Go here, <b>kill</b> <b>this,</b> draw out this big bad, then kill him for your family"); the game failed to add anything new to the universe, and its side missions were more interesting than the main campaign.|$|E
500|$|Thompson has {{rejected}} arguments that such video games {{are protected by}} freedom of expression, saying, [...] "Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They’re not even speech. They’re dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it," [...] as well as simply calling video games [...] "mental masturbation". In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, {{saying that it was}} looking [...] "for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end". Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller [...] "gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each <b>kill.</b> <b>This</b> is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner's laboratory." ...|$|E

500|$|The bullet time {{mode that}} Max Payne {{was known for}} was improved; the {{developers}} {{referred to it as}} [...] "version 2.0". The mode, which allows Max to move in slow motion to react and kill enemies more easily, was enhanced to give Max a refill of a portion of the Bullet Time gauge, as well as slowing down the passage time even further, as Max moves further [...] "into the zone" [...] with each consecutive <b>kill.</b> <b>This</b> was done to encourage players to aggressively dive head-on into dangerous situations rather than crouching at a safe distance and waiting for enemies to come to them. A new reload animation was also introduced, which, when Max reloads while in Bullet Time, allows him to duck to avoid bullets, spin around to survey the combat situation, and briefly pause to give the player a moment to think of a strategy. Development tools were made available for Max Payne 2 by Rockstar Games and Remedy Entertainment to allow players to create modifications for the game. Modifications can perform several functions, such as the ability to add new weapons, skills, perspectives, surroundings, and characters.|$|E
500|$|On March13, Hagerstrom and his wingman Elmer N. Dunlap {{came across}} two MiGs, {{the first of}} which Hagerstrom [...] "shot the daylights out of". He shot at the second until he ran out of ammunition, and the {{remaining}} MiG was leaking fuel and its engine had stopped. Hagerstrom told Dunlap to [...] "finish off" [...] the crippled plane, and the MiG's pilot bailed over the enemy's Antung Airfield. That mission gave him a total of 4.5 victories, just short of the five kills needed for ace status. Knowing that he was likely to be transferred out soon, he became even more determined to get another kill. On March27 he sneaked up behind six MiGs and fired on one, but by [...] "sheer ass luck ... it knocked his wing tip off." [...] He kept up the chase, shooting short bursts, until the pilot, Chinese ace Wang Hai, ejected right above his own base. On the way home, Hagerstrom destroyed another MiG, bringing the total to 6.5. He became the war's 28th ace and would be the only from the 18th wing. Before the Air Force sent him back to the U.S., he got one more MiG on April13. On his last day in Korea, while waiting for his flight out, he volunteered to do an impromptu mission, netting his last <b>kill.</b> <b>This</b> gave him a sum of 8.5 throughout the whole war over 101 missions.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {{praised the}} show and said the {{decision}} to focus on fewer subplots might help. Bianco said, [...] "Let's hope the changes work, because Homicide is too good to lose, and its vision of civilization is too troubling to shunt aside." [...] The Washington Post television reviewer Tom Shales called Homicide [...] "achingly, even painfully, brilliant. The best cop show I have ever seen." [...] David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun called it the best police drama ever made for television besides Hill Street Blues. Baltimore Sun reporter David Bianculli praised the show's writers for being willing to place their characters in ethically questionable positions, adding: [...] "Please watch this series; it's so good, I don't mind pleading." [...] Tom Jicha of South Florida Sun-Sentinel called it [...] "an hour about as fine as there is on the tube" [...] with great writing and camera-work. Jicha said, [...] "It would be a senseless act of violence against superb TV for those who claim to appreciate fine drama to <b>kill</b> <b>this</b> show by turning the dial." [...] Hal Boedeker, television critic with The Miami Herald, strongly praised the series, particularly [...] "Bop Gun", which he called [...] "the highest order for network TV". Boedeker called the writing, direction and acting [...] "first-rate" [...] and declared Homicide the better choice over NYPD Blue {{because it did not}} resort to gimmicks like the nudity featured in the latter show.|$|E
