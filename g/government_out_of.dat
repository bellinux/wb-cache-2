5|$|In Germany, Emil {{had been}} {{dismissed}} from his academic post, and, disillusioned with the Lutheran Church's {{support of the}} NSDAP, had become a Quaker in 1933. He was arrested for speaking out against the government, but was only held for one month. Elisabeth married a fellow communist, Gustav Kittowski, {{with whom she had}} a child they named Klaus. Elisabeth and Kittowski were arrested in 1933, and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, but were freed at Christmas. Gerhard and his wife Karin were arrested in 1934, and spent the next two years in prison. Gerhard, Karin, Elisabeth and Kittowski established a car rental agency in Berlin, which they used to smuggle Jews and opponents of the <b>government</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Germany.|$|E
5|$|Much of this wealth {{was spent}} by Henry on {{maintaining}} his court and household, including {{many of the}} building works he undertook on royal palaces. Henry hung 2,000 tapestries in his palaces; by comparison, James V of Scotland hung just 200. Henry took pride in showing off his collection of weapons, which included exotic archery equipment, 2,250 pieces of land ordnance and 6,500 handguns. Tudor monarchs had to fund all the expenses of <b>government</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their own income. This income came from the Crown lands that Henry owned {{as well as from}} customs duties like tonnage and poundage, granted by parliament to the king for life. During Henry's reign the revenues of the Crown remained constant (around £100,000), but were eroded by inflation and rising prices brought about by war. Indeed, war and Henry's dynastic ambitions in Europe exhausted the surplus he had inherited from his father by the mid-1520s.|$|E

5|$|The Alabama {{legislature}} {{passed the}} Cater Act in 1949, allowing {{cities and counties}} to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was {{the driving force behind}} the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city <b>government</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> economic development decisions.|$|E
25|$|The HUD {{controversy}} involved administration staffers granting {{federal funding}} to constituents, and defrauding the U.S. <b>government</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> money intended for low income housing. It resulted in six convictions, including James G. Watt, Reagan's Secretary of the Interior. Watt was indicted on 24 felony counts and {{pleaded guilty to}} a single misdemeanor. He was sentenced to five years probation, and ordered to pay a $5000 fine.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} sympathetic Seattle {{strike was}} an attempted revolution. That {{there was no}} violence does not alter the fact... The intent, openly and covertly announced, was for {{the overthrow of the}} industrial system; here first, then everywhere... True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no killings. Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community... That is to say, it puts the <b>government</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> operation. And that is all there is to revolt–no matter how achieved.|$|E

25|$|On 4 April 2005, President Rüütel {{nominated}} Reform {{party leader}} Andrus Ansip as Prime Minister designate {{and asked him}} to form a new government, the eighth in twelve years. Ansip formed a <b>government</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a coalition of his Reform Party with the People's Union and the Centre Party. Approval by the Riigikogu, which by law must decide within 14 days of his nomination, came on 12 April 2005. Ansip was backed by 53 out of 101 members of the Estonian parliament. Forty deputies voted against his candidature. The general consensus in the Estonian media seems to be that the new cabinet, on the level of competence, is not necessarily an improvement over the old one.|$|E
25|$|The {{episode of}} History Detectives, which aired on July 2, 2014, {{reviewed}} the known evidence, thoroughly disputing the sabotage theory, and then {{focused on the}} question of why the steamboat was allowed to be crowded to several times its normal capacity before departure. The report blamed quartermaster Hatch, an individual with a long history of corruption and incompetence, who was able to keep his job due to political connections: he was the younger brother of Illinois politician Ozias M. Hatch, an advisor and close friend of President Lincoln. Throughout the war, Reuben Hatch had shown incompetence as a quartermaster and competence as a thief, bilking the <b>government</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> thousands of dollars. Although brought up on courts-martial charges, Hatch managed to get letters of recommendation from such noted authorities as President Abraham Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and General of the Army Ulysses S. Grant. The letters reside in the National Archives in Washington DC. After the disaster, Hatch refused three separate subpoenas to appear before Captain Speed's trial and give testimony. Hatch died in 1871, having escaped justice due to his numerous highly placed patrons—including two presidents.|$|E
500|$|When the Twentieth Congress {{began in}} December 1827, Tyler served {{alongside}} his Virginia colleague and friend Littleton Waller Tazewell, who shared his strict constructionist views and uneasy support of Jackson. Throughout his tenure, Sen. Tyler vigorously opposed national infrastructure bills, feeling these were matters for individual states to decide. He and his Southern colleagues unsuccessfully opposed the protectionist Tariff of 1828, [...] known to its detractors as the [...] "Tariff of Abominations". Tyler {{suggested that the}} Tariff's only positive outcome would be a national political backlash, restoring a respect for states' rights. Tyler remained {{a strong supporter of}} states' rights, stating [...] "they may strike the Federal <b>Government</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> existence by a word; demolish the Constitution and scatter its fragments to the winds." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1996, Kemp {{had been}} named a {{director}} of six corporate boards. He was a director for Hawk Corporation, IDT Corporation, CNL Hotels and Resorts, InPhonic, Cyrix Corporation and American Bankers Insurance Group. Kemp briefly {{served on the board}} of Oracle Corporation, whose CEO was his friend Larry Ellison, in 1996, but resigned when he ran for Vice President; he was named to the board of Six Flags, Inc. in December 2005. Kemp opted not to stand for re-election to IDT's board in 2006. He also served on the Habitat for Humanity board of directors, and served on the board of Atlanta-based software maker EzGov Inc. Kemp also served {{on the board of directors}} of Election.com, which was the private company that ran the world's first election on the internet (won by Al Gore), the 2000 Arizona Democratic Primary. Kemp was also a business partner with Edra and Tim Blixseth promoting membership in the elite private ski and golf Yellowstone Club. Kemp also partnered with the Blixseths in a failed anti-terrorism software venture called Blxware which was investigated for [...] "conning" [...] the federal <b>government</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> $20million in contracts for software which fraudulently claimed to detect secret messages from Al-Qaeda in television broadcast signals. Kemp was the founder and chairman of Kemp Partners, a strategic consulting firm that helps clients achieve both business and public policy goals.|$|E
500|$|Enforcement and {{compliance}} with seat belt laws varies by state. (Massachusetts, {{which had the}} lowest death rate per 100 million miles traveled in 2015, was among the states with the lowest use of seat belts.) Some states require motorcycle helmets while others do not. Speed limits, traffic density, topography, climate and many other factors affect the divergent accident rates by state. Speed limits in Texas, Utah, and Rhode Island are prima facie rather than absolute. This allows motorists in those states to defend against a speeding charge {{if it can be}} proven that the speed was reasonable and prudent. In good driving conditions, many drivers in prima facie states presume (usually correctly) that police will allow some tolerance in enforcement. Even in states with absolute speed limits, enforcement and penalties vary from one state to another. For these and other reasons, state-to-state comparisons are difficult. There are many studies examining increases in Interstate speed limits from 55mph to 65, 70 and 75mph. Some found that fatality rates increased significantly on Interstate highways where speed limits were raised. One study that examined the change from 55 to 65mph found higher Interstate speed limits improved overall highway safety by drawing traffic from less safe secondary highways to safer Interstate highways. Since the changes to 80mph speed limits in some states (and 85mph on one section of a toll highway in Texas) are relatively recent, robust analysis is not yet available. Anecdotal evidence suggests actual vehicle speeds did not increase as much as speed limits did. Also, police may be enforcing the new higher limits more strictly than they enforced the prior limits. In some states, police have reallocated resources to focus more on impaired and distracted driving. The higher speed limits are predominantly in rural states, which tend to be Republican states. To many Republican voters, speed limits (and seat belt laws) are seen as intrusions on personal liberty. According to transportation historian Owen Gutfreund, state governments may raise speed limits because raising the speed limit “sounds like such an easy regulatory win.” It’s a simple way to “get <b>government</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your face.” ...|$|E
