50|$|Jesus grows up, and his cousin, John the Baptist, {{calls for}} sinners to repent and be baptized in the Jordan River ("The Kingdom of Heaven/One Voice"§). Jesus comes to John to be baptized, and though John bows before <b>Jesus</b> and <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> {{it is not}} right for him to baptize Jesus, Jesus asks him to permit it so they may {{do what is right}} in God's eyes. John baptizes Jesus, and the Spirit of God descends on him. Satan leads Jesus out into the {{wilderness}} and tempts him, but Jesus does not succumb to his temptation ("It is Written"§). Back in Galilee, Jesus calls four fishermen - Peter, James, John, and Andrew - to be his first disciples. Amazed by a miraculous catch of fish, they declare that he must be the coming king ("I See the Kingdom Coming").|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the things}} taught to David was {{the ability to}} make armour (21:80, 34:10-11), a {{suggestion}} that David’s military exploits were the act of God. It is also important that the Quranic reference to David's [...] "wisdom" [...] was sometimes explained by the classical exegetes as the gift of prophecy. The Quran also connects David and <b>Jesus,</b> by <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> both cursed those Israelites who did not believe (5:78). Moreover, according to the Quran, David was given the ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood when dispensing justice (faṣl al-khiṭāb, 38:20). Furthermore, there is the allusion to a test David was put through, wherein he prayed and repented and God forgave him (38:24-5). Surat Sad (the 38th chapter of the Quran) is also called [...] "the sūra of David" [...] Exegetes explain that since David prostrated when asking God to forgive him, Muhammad was ordered to imitate him and to perform a prostration when reading this chapter.|$|R
2500|$|This Jesus' Name {{doctrine}} {{is a point}} of contention between the UPCI and Trinitarian Christians. Like other Oneness believers, the UPCI baptizes [...] "in the Name of Jesus Christ", while Trinitarians use [...] "in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". Both sides utilize Matthew 28:19 to support their claims, with the UPCI holding that the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit is <b>Jesus.</b> They <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> the word name in the scripture is singular, and that implies all three titles refer to Jesus. Other Oneness believers assert that Matthew 28:19 was changed to the traditional Triune formula by the Catholic Church in 325 AD in the counsel of Nicaea. The Jesus' Name belief originates from Acts 2:38, and members also stress Acts 8:16, Acts 10:48, Acts 19:5, and Acts 22:16, and 1 John 2:12, claiming that these are the only scriptures showing how the early Church performed baptisms, and that there is no scripture in the Word that shows anyone ever being baptized in the titles, and that the Bible authorizes no departure from that formula.Even that the early priest state that the early church only baptized in Jesus name and the latter formula was applied after 325AD by the Catholic church.|$|R
5000|$|The updated {{position}} {{taken by}} Wells was interpreted by other scholars as an [...] "about-face", abandoning his initial thesis {{in favor of}} accepting {{the existence of a}} historical <b>Jesus.</b> However, Wells <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> this figure of late first-century gospel stories is distinct from the sacrificial Christ myth of Paul's epistles and other early Christian documents, and that these two figures have different sources before being fused in Mark, writing, [...] "if I am right, against Doherty and Price - it is not all mythical." [...] Wells notes that he belongs in the category of those who argue that Jesus did exist, but that reports about Jesus are so unreliable that we can know little or nothing about him. Wells argues, for example, that the story of the execution of Jesus under Pilate is not an historical account, writing, [...] "I regarded (and still do regard) following stories; the virgin birth, much in the Galilean ministry, the crucifixion around A.D. 30 under Pilate, and the resurrection—as legendary". Many scholars still note Wells as a mythicist.|$|R
40|$|In {{every culture}} signs of {{religion}} abound. For religion {{is one of}} the fundamental components of the shaping of any civilization. The concept of separation of Church and State might have worked beautifully in America for a while. But then globalization happened…the melting pot melted becoming colored mosaics. Nowadays, as a matter of survival, people are insisting on their roots and establishing their identities. For individuals, religion is a personal identity. And always for nations, religion proved to be a political entity. Marxism‘s failure, for the most part, was the insistence on denying the existence of a supreme being and negating individuality. Examining some major world religions and philosophies will highlight the difficulty of the concept of {{separation of church and state}} to take root in the global world. Notice that on the American dollar, the world‘s favorite currency, a prominent phrase reads: ―In God we trust. ‖ Jesus preached a separation of church and state, ―Render…unto Caesar the things which be Caesar‘s and unto God the things which be God‘s. ‖ However, <b>Jesus,</b> after all, <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> His Kingdom is not of this world! The controversy persists. To entertain the topical problem of the separation of church and state we need to defin...|$|R
