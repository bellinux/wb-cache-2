5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> treatment.

5|$|Despite {{the above}} formulations, most silver {{compounds}} have significant covalent character {{due to the}} small size and high first ionization energy (730.8kJ/mol) of silver. Furthermore, silver's Pauling electronegativity of 1.93 is {{higher than that of}} lead (1.87), and its electron affinity of 125.6kJ/mol is much higher than that of hydrogen (72.8kJ/mol) and not much less than that of oxygen (141.0kJ/mol). Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable organometallic compounds, forming linear complexes showing very low coordination numbers like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide as well as Zintl phases like the post-transition metals.

Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed contact or impact loading, are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed noncontact or inertial loading, usually causes diffuse injuries. The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury. In impact loading, the force sends shock waves through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage. Shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along {{the path of a}} projectile, compounding the damage caused by the missile itself.|$|E

5|$|Purkinje cells {{form the}} heart of the {{cerebellar}} circuit, and their large size and distinctive activity patterns have made it relatively easy to study their response patterns in behaving animals using extracellular recording techniques. Purkinje cells normally emit action potentials at a high rate <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> the synaptic input. In awake, behaving animals, mean rates averaging around 40Hz are typical. The spike trains show a mixture of what are called simple and complex spikes. A simple spike is a single action potential followed by a refractory period of about 10ms; a complex spike is a stereotyped sequence of action potentials with very short inter-spike intervals and declining amplitudes. Physiological studies have shown that complex spikes (which occur at baseline rates around 1Hz and never at rates much higher than 10Hz) are reliably associated with climbing fiber activation, while simple spikes are produced by a combination of baseline activity and parallel fiber input. Complex spikes are often followed by a pause of several hundred milliseconds during which simple spike activity is suppressed.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Together, this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Recent {{research}} has shown that being able to inter-act with an object causes it to be perceived as being closer than objects that cannot be interacted with. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, we examined whether that compression of perceived space would be experienced by people who simply observed such interac-tions by others with no intention of performing the action themselves. Participants judged the distance to targets after observing an actor reach to an otherwise unreachable target with a tool (Experiment 1) or illuminate a distant target with a laser pointer (Experiment 2). Observing either type of inter-action caused a compression of perceived space, revealing that a person’s perception of space can be altered through mere observation. These results indicate that shared representations between an actor and observer are engaged at the perceptual level easily and perhaps automatically, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> o...|$|R
40|$|During {{infection}} with the helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni, the deposition of eggs {{coincides with the}} onset of IL- 4 production and Th 2 development. Although IL- 4 is known as a potent inducer of Th 2 differentiation, the mechanism by which schistosome eggs induce IL- 4 production is not clear. In this study, we demonstrate that the S. mansoni egg Ag (SmEA) induces IgE-dependent IL- 4 production by basophils derived from Heligmosomoides polygyrus-infected or OVA/alum-immunized mice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of pathogen-specific IgE. The effect is mediated by the secretory glycoprotein IPSE/alpha- 1, because IPSE/ alpha- 1 -depleted SmEA no longer induces cytokine production. Conversely, recombinant IPSE/alpha- 1 is sufficient to induce IL- 4 production. Importantly, the injection of SmEA or recombinant IPSE/alpha- 1 into H. polygyrus-infected 4 get/KN 2 IL- 4 reporter mice rapidly induces the dose-dependent IL- 4 production by basophils <b>in</b> <b>the</b> liver, a major site of egg deposition.
