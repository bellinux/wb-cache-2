5|$|In 1984, the UK Ministry of Defence began {{studies for}} a GR1 Mid-Life Update (MLU). The update to GR4 standard, {{approved}} in 1994, would improve capability in the medium-altitude role based on {{lessons learned from}} the GR1's performance in the 1991 Gulf War. British Aerospace (later BAE Systems) upgraded 142 Tornado GR1s to GR4 standard, beginning in 1996 and finished in 2003. 59 RAF aircraft are receiving the CUSP avionics package which integrates the Paveway IV bomb and installs a new secure communications module from Cassidian in Phase A, followed by the Tactical Information Exchange (TIE) datalink from General <b>Dynamics</b> <b>in</b> Phase B.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} abundance of 14N and 15N is practically constant {{in the atmosphere}} but can vary elsewhere, due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological redox reactions and the evaporation of natural ammonia or nitric acid. Biologically mediated reactions (e.g., assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification) strongly control nitrogen <b>dynamics</b> <b>in</b> the soil. These reactions typically result in 15N enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product.|$|E

5|$|Tires {{have a large}} {{influence}} over bike handling, especially on motorcycles, but also on bicycles. Tires influence bike <b>dynamics</b> <b>in</b> two distinct ways: finite crown radius and force generation. Increase the crown radius of the front tire {{has been shown to}} decrease the size or eliminate self stability. Increasing the crown radius of the rear tire has the opposite effect, but to a lesser degree.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system <b>dynamics</b> <b>in</b> a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|His {{early works}} in dynamics, {{the science of}} motion and {{mechanics}} were his circa 1590 Pisan De Motu (On Motion) and his circa 1600 Paduan Le Meccaniche (Mechanics). The former was based on Aristotelian–Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby in a vacuum, bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights. It also subscribed to the Philoponan impetus <b>dynamics</b> <b>in</b> which impetus is self-dissipating and free-fall in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration.|$|E
