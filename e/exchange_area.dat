25|$|Similarly, {{so called}} fine PM, (often {{referred}} to as PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung (alveolus), and very small particles (< 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Penetration of particles is not wholly dependent on their size; shape and chemical composition also play a part. To avoid this complication, simple nomenclature is used to indicate the different degrees of relative penetration of a PM particle into the cardiovascular system. Inhalable particles penetrate {{no further than the}} bronchi as they are filtered out by the cilia. Thoracic particles can penetrate right into terminal bronchioles whereas PM which can penetrate to alveoli, the gas <b>exchange</b> <b>area,</b> and hence the circulatory system are termed respirable particles.|$|E

500|$|In the settlement's early days, Bell Hill {{proved a}} major {{obstacle}} to travel {{south of the city}} centre, and major excavation work was carried out to provide access to the south.

The southern flank of the hill was also completely removed (that area now being occupied by Queen's Gardens). The stone removed from the hill was used as construction material for many of the city's first permanent buildings, and also as fill to reclaim the northern end of the Southern Endowment {{along the edge of the}} harbour.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the benefits of}} a four stroke engine having one intake and one exhaust rotary valve. The rotary valve has a speed of rotation half the crankshaft and defines an open passage that may permit up to extremely sharp opening or closing and very large gas <b>exchange</b> <b>areas.</b> The dual rotary valve design is applied to a racing engine naturally aspirated V-four engine of 1000 cc displacement, gasoline fuelled with central direct injection and spark ignition. The engine is then modeled by using a 1 D engine & gas dynamics simulation software package to assess the potentials of the solution. The improved design produces much larger power densities than the version of the engines with traditional poppet valves revving at higher speeds, with reduced frictional losses, and with larger gas <b>exchange</b> <b>areas</b> while also improving the fuel conversion efficiency thanks to the sharpness of opening or closing events. The novelty in the proposed dual rotary valve system is the combustion chamber of good shape and high compression ratio with central direct injector and spark plug coupled to the large gas <b>exchange</b> <b>areas</b> of the rotary valve system. Finally, jet-ignition is shown as a valuable tool to improve the rate of combustion also in stoichiometric and near stoichiometric racing engines applications with benefits in terms of fuel conversion efficiency and combustion stability...|$|R
