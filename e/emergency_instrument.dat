40|$|LL. D. This {{inquiry is}} about the {{derogation}} of human rights during states of emergency. International human rights law has blossomed since World War II. Over the years it has been understood that human rights can be limited or derogated (suspended) under certain circumstances. A set of standards has been developed through the different sources of international law to ensure that human rights abuses are avoided during states of emergency. Treaty law, as well as customary international law, provides definite standards {{that have to be}} adhered to during these circumstances. General principles of law recognised by “civilised” nations also contribute to the standard setting that must apply during states of emergency. The use of emergency powers during times of crisis is a world phenomenon. Human rights violations often occur in times of crisis when emergency powers are used. This has led to rich jurisprudence by the various international bodies that monitor, enforce and promote respect for human rights. All the sources of international law have contributed to ensuring that a prudent set of standards governs states of emergency. In this study these standards are set out and expounded upon. These standards are furthermore applied in three Southern African states. The history of states of emergency in these countries and the constitutional dispensations that govern states of emergency in each of these countries is placed under scrutiny and tested against the international standards that should apply. The picture that unfolds is not encouraging because there is not clear evidence that there is always respect for international law and the meticulous application of these standards. International and regional monitoring bodies have not always successfully discharged their obligations to promote human rights or to prevent human rights abuses during states of emergency. The main difficulty in the African Charter for Human and Peoples’ Rights {{is that it does not}} contain a derogation article, which forbids the abuse by the state of <b>emergency</b> <b>instruments</b> and curbs the abuse of power during states of emergency. The African Commission is plagued with difficulties, mainly pertaining to staff and resources. It often aspires to be “politically correct” in the face of state parties who are quick to rely on state sovereignty and thereby do not allow outsiders to monitor alleged human rights violations. The adoption of the Protocol to the African Charter on the establishment of an African Court is an important step in strengthening the African system for the protection of human rights. In Southern Africa, there is not a clear commitment to uphold and defend human rights through the relevant regional bodies – the correct statements are expressed in the treaty that formed the Southern African Development Community. There is however no authority to monitor or ensure compliance to ideals set out in the treaty. A route to overcome this difficulty is suggested, namely to negotiate a set of human rights standards in the region, without any legally binding effect initially but with strong persuasive and moral standing. This first step must provide a launching pad to ultimately have a Southern African Human Rights Treaty, with inter alia a tight derogation article as well as a treaty body with strong monitoring and enforcement powers. A regional commitment to uphold and respect human rights is a prerequisite to ensure that a human rights culture takes root in the service of stability and democracy in Southern Africa...|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} been {{developed}} to determine proper analytical support instruments {{in order to improve}} emergency operation systems in case of accidents in a nuclear reactor. The case study analyzed is in reference to an experimental nuclear fission power plant in Italy (the information about the name and location of this plant has been omitted for safety reasons). The accidental event’s consequences were simulated using a free licensed software, HotSpot, and the results obtained were compared with the results obtained using ISPRA Software, the only software certified by the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) for nuclear accidents. Once the reliability of HotSpot was established, the most critical incident for this reactor, as indicated by the latest revision of the National Plan on Protective Measures against Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies, was simulated. The simulation results (for areas classified with respect to limits on effective dose) were used as input in the development, through the use of the GeoMedia GIS software, of a vulnerability model that takes into account the spatial distribution of the population in the area affected by the event. In the context of <b>emergency</b> management, such <b>instruments</b> should be integrated with the systems of command & control centres for crisis management and the emergency operation centre (EOC), and made available to the entire chain of emergency management, including the field teams with handheld terminals...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Transactional {{analysis}} is a personality and communication theory established by psychiatrist Eric Berne, {{at the end}} of the fifties. Counter script is the way of life in accordance with parental imperative. The person with a counter-script has a compulsion to fulfill the required task in order to avoid the disaster of ban. There are five drivers that are considered essential, and these are: 'Be perfect!', 'Be strong!', 'Hurry up!', 'Please others!' and 'Work hard!' Objective: a) Determination of the most dominant driver in this medical service. b) Because of the specifics of this job which requires speed and humanity, the emphasis will be on doublet: 'Hurry up!' and 'Please others!' Method: The study was conducted on a group of subjects employed in a general service with medical <b>emergency.</b> The <b>instrument</b> used in the study was Julie Hay's questionnaire for diagnosing the working styles. Results: Statistical research was conducted on a sample of 30 subjects employed in the emergency medical service. Availability of all afore mentioned drivers was tested. The research hypotheses were formulated as follows: H 0 : The driver is not present among the employees in this service; H 1 : The driver is present among the employees in this service. Calculated value of the t-statistics for the driver 'Hurry up!' is 1. 398; for the driver 'Be perfect!' 3. 616; for the driver 'Please others!' 11. 693; for the driver 'Work hard!' - 0. 673; and for the driver 'Be strong!' 3. 880. Since the realizable value of the t-statistics for the drivers: 'Be perfect!' and 'Please others!' and 'Be strong!' is bigger than the critical value 1. 699, and p< 0. 05 we reject the null hypothesis and we accept the alternative hypothesis on the significance level of 95 %. For the drivers 'Hurry up!' and 'Work hard!' the values of t-statistics are lower than the critical value 1. 699 for significance level of 95 %, so the alternative hypothesis are not acceptable. Conclusion: The results of our research have determined which drivers are the most represented among the employees in emergency medical service. Al- though the name of the service points to the necessity of quick reaction in critical situations, humanity has proved to be more...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Workplace {{violence}} in the emergency department is a significant problem world wide. The aims {{of this study were}} to identify the proportion of staff subjected to the types of violence, its sources, factors affecting violence experiences, reporting the incidence and the emotions of the victims after violence. Methods: This descriptive study was conducted between March and August 2009 in the the emergency department of six hospitals in Ankara, Turkey. Data were collected from 270 staff working in various <b>emergency</b> settings. The <b>instrument</b> was a 36 -item questionnaire on types of violence, its sources, feelings, and ways to cope with violent behaviors. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used for data analysis. Results: The results showed 85. 2 % of participants had been subjected to at least one kind of violence: 41. 1 % to physical assault, 79. 6 % to verbal abuse, 55. 5 % to verbal threats and 15. 9 % to sexual harassment. Patients’ companions (90. 9 %) were identified as the primary perpetrators of violence. The rates of violence types were highest towards security officers and housekeepers. The most common reactions to violence were sadness and anger. "Did nothing and keeping silent" was the coping method used most commonly by the staff. Participants exposed to physical assaults and verbal threat did not report the incidence of violence to managers were at 43. 3 % and 65. 3 % respectively. Conclusion: Based on results of the study, it is suggested that every hospital institute reliable reporting procedures that staff members feel comfortable using, and also provide a comprehensive program of support services for staff that has been assaulted...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Emergency Medicine is {{a medical}} {{specialty}} based on knowledge and skills required for the prevention, diagnosis {{and management of the}} acute and urgent aspects of illness and injury affecting patients of all age groups with a full spectrum of undifferentiated physical and behavioural disorders. Addis Ababa University School of Medicine started its Emergency Medicine Residency in 2010 and Emergency Medicine training for fourth-year medical students started in 2013. This study aims to assess attitudes of fifth year medical students towards Emergency Medicine training and its contribution to their final year of medical school training. Methods: Two hundred fifth year medical students participated in the study by convenience sampling. Self-administered questionnaires and Likert scales were used for data collection. Descriptive frequencies and chi-square analysis were done for categorical data. Ethical oversight was provided by the Institutional Review Board of the Addis Ababa University College of Health Sciences. Results: Of the 200 participants, 150 were male and 50 were female. 80 % agreed its relevance for undergraduates. Relevance was significantly associated with recommendation to other medical schools (χ 2  =  8. 34, Pr =  0. 004). 72 % of respondents agreed lectures are appropriate teaching methods, 70 % agreed group activity, 68. 5 % skill sessions, 67. 5 % morning discussions, 64 % diagnostic session, 60 % duty exposures and 45 % seminars. Difficulties faced during internship are primarily attributed to lack of facilities, ranging from the setup of the <b>emergency</b> centre to <b>instruments</b> and <b>emergency</b> drugs. 60 % of respondents agreed that Emergency Medicine training is important to future careers. 65 % agreed recommending training to other medical schools. Conclusion: An Emergency Medicine rotation during the final year of medical school provides opportunities to learn about undifferentiated medical emergencies and it should be included for other medical schools in the country. Participants suggest that leadership aspects of Emergency Medicine need more emphasis as the curriculum is further developed in the future...|$|R
40|$|Background: Strengthening the {{provision}} of emergency health services, including the nursing workforce, is progress towards decreasing the burden of injury in sub-Saharan Africa. The WHO Essential Trauma Care Guidelines provide minimum knowledge and skills to ensure quality in-hospital trauma care. Our aim was to develop an emergency nursing trauma care knowledge, attitudes, and skills minimum competency assessment instrument with WHO guidelines for African emergency care settings. Methods: Constructs anchoring the assessment were defined by an expert panel of six emergency nurses from Ghana, Malawi, South Africa, and Tanzania, with a modified Delphi approach. The panel did each phase of the knowledge, attitudes, and skills instrument creation and validation by: (1) identifying objectives and attributes; (2) narrowing the domain of content previously predefined by WHO; (3) developing survey questions; (4) reviewing questions in the instrument; and (5) pilot testing the survey with 23 emergency nurses in Ghana. Findings: A four-part instrument was created. Important objectives and attributes of the instrument included easy measurement and discrimination of trauma care knowledge, attitudes, and skills among emergency nurses in sub-Saharan Africa. Domains assessed were primary, secondary, focused, and ongoing trauma assessment and management, including team-oriented practices, nursing analysis, planning, and implementation. The knowledge, attitudes, and skills instrument included ten demographic and 46 attitude questions self-administered on paper, 49 open-ended oral interview questions, and 26 administered in an observed patient simulation format. Pilot results show the instrument was easy to apply, appropriate for low-resource testing, {{and was able to}} discriminate knowledge, attitudes, and skills among nurses of various competencies. Interpretation: In Ghana, the longitudinal assessment instrument should be implemented for cohorts of newly trained emergency nurses. In other sub-Saharan African countries, actively trained <b>emergency</b> nurses the <b>instrument</b> should be locally validated and piloted, then deployed to measure basic trauma competencies between nurses. Ultimately, the instrument should serve as a standard across sub-Saharan Africa for measurement of competency among nurses, thereby allowing multination comparisons or longitudinal assessments.

40|$|Financial {{behaviour}} {{is complex}} and difficult to measure. Existing literature on the emergency fund remains lacking {{in terms of its}} theoretical testing and modelling, not to mention its accurate definition of emergency fund behaviour itself. Prior studies also suffer from providing sufficient country-contextual evidence on emergency fund behaviour, notably in the instance of Malaysia. Compounding this, the question of how young student adults allocate their emergency fund has yet to be adequately explored by existing studies, primarily due to data limitations. The issues of financial behaviour, financial problems and financial stresses among young adults are still being addressed by many studies. These tend to argue that young adults have less ability to allocate or achieve the recommended adequate level of emergency fund holding. It is these gaps that this thesis will address. This research uses modified theory of planned behaviour as a research conceptual framework to investigate and understand the emergency fund behaviour among young student adults in Malaysia. The data were collected using online questionnaires and survey interviews. The emergency fund behaviour measurement and Emergency Fund Formation Behaviour (EFFB) models were developed. The Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) were adopted as data analysis tools for this research. The definition of emergency fund behaviour was positioned in relation to two main financial behaviours: saving and investment. The results from the modelling revealed that attitude and propensity to plan were found to significantly contribute to emergency fund formation intentions and behaviour. The subjective norms and perceived behaviour controls were found not to be significant to fund formation intentions and behaviour. The emergency event from young student adults’ perspective was explored and contributes to additional current literature. This research also found that not all young student adults achieved the total three months expenses recommended adequacy level of emergency fund holding. Previous experience of emergency events was found to be the factor that prompted them to achieve the recommended adequacy level. Their intention was to continue to borrow from informal channels, such as family and friends,if they lacked emergency funds in future. Other factors, such as financial aid, did not necessarily determine their ability to achieve the adequacy level. This research also found that a significant proportion of young student adults chose to use savings accounts and current accounts as their emergency fund. Some also used their student loan (PTPTN) money as source of emergency fund allocation. In addition, the use of gold as an <b>emergency</b> fund financial <b>instrument</b> was also found to be relevant to the Malaysian context. The holding of gold was a behaviour found not to be gender-related. In terms of the financial instruments categories, most of the young student adults in this research were found holding intermediate fund rather than other emergency fund categories. The modelling and deeper understanding of emergency fund behaviour revealed overall of emergency fund formation behaviour and preference for financial products in response to future emergencies. This finding will help financial service providers and financial educators to offer more effective advice and fulfil the needs of their clients. Moreover, this research makes a significant contribution to the field of personal financial planning by improving our understanding of the application of behavioural finance theory, and suggesting that behavioural factors contribute to an individual’s financial planning and actions...|$|R
