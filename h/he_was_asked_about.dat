5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} saw {{a substantial}} increase in international media coverage. Eighty foreign media representatives from a multitude of countries registered for an event at the Foreign Ministry held during the election weekend as it usually is. The journalists also got to ask questions to the representatives of the various political parties. As the results came in, the Foreign Ministry set up broadcast coverage with interpreters on hand. Notably, most journalists were interested in the True Finns and their background. The following day, the Foreign Ministry invited professor Jan Sundberg of the Department of Political and Economic Studies at the University of Helsinki to lead an analysis of the result. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the reasons for the True Finns' performance and the commonality with other European populist movements. There was also discussion about the possible composition of a new government and how the different parties could find common ground during talks on government formation. Sundberg said he believed an agreement could be found within the following few weeks.|$|E

5|$|Another local {{man called}} Tom Austin was hanged in August 1694. He {{inherited}} a farm {{with an annual}} income of £80 and then married {{the daughter of a}} neighbouring farmer with a dowry of £800. He lived an extravagant lifestyle and spent all of his money. His farm, having been neglected could not provide sufficient income for him and he borrowed a lot of money from neighbours and friends. He then turned to highway robbery and was moderately successful for a time. He shot Sir Zachary Wilmott during a robbery on the road between Wellington and Taunton. The proceeds from his crimes supported him for a time but in the long term he was unable to clear his debts. In 1694, following a row with his wife, he went to visit his uncle. His uncle was not at home and he killed his aunt and her five children and took around £60 from the house. On returning home <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the bloodstains on his clothes by his wife. He then killed her and his two children. His uncle who dropped in to visit him on his way home knocked Tom Austin unconscious and he was arrested and later hung at Exeter Jail.|$|E

The questions {{touched on}} his personal views of LGBT, LGBT people adopting children and hurdles for LGBT Singaporeans. He was asked how he would react if one of his grandchildren {{turned out to be}} homosexual. He replied that he would accept his grandchild because homosexuality is a genetic code. One of the questions asked was if LGBT couples could adopt children. He did not think LGBT people were suited to bringing up a child as they have no maternal instinct aroused by the process of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} 1989 following an address by Yusuf {{to students at}} London's Kingston University, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the fatwa calling for the killing of Salman Rushdie, author of the novel The Satanic Verses. Yusuf {{made a series of}} comments that appeared to show his support for the fatwa. He released a statement the following day denying that he supported vigilantism, and claiming that he had merely recounted the legal Islamic punishment for blasphemy. In a 2006 BBC interview, he displayed a newspaper clipping from that period, with quotes from his statement. Subsequent comments made by him in 1989 on a British television programme were also seen as being in support of the fatwa. In a statement in the FAQ section of one of his websites, Yusuf asserted that while he regretted the comments, he was joking and that the show was improperly edited. In the years since these comments, he has repeatedly denied ever calling for the death of Rushdie or supporting the fatwa.|$|E

25|$|In 1823, Simon Resch and {{the sheep}} Toni {{became the first}} to reach the East Summit. Simon Resch was also led the second ascent of the East Summit on 18 September 1834 with his son, Johann, and the {{mountain}} guide, Johann Barth. Because Resch's first ascent had been doubted, this time a fire was lit on the summit. On the 27th the summit was climbed {{for a third time}} by royal forester's assistants, Franz Oberst and Schwepfinger, along with Johann Barth. Oberst erected a flagpole on the summit with a Bavarian flag that was visible from the valley. The first ascent from Austria took place in August 1837. The surveyors, Joseph Feuerstein and Joseph Sonnweber, climbed to the West Summit from Ehrwald and left behind a signal pole with their initials on it. The West Summit was conquered for the third time on 10 September 1843 by the shepherd Peter Pfeifer. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the route by a group of eight climbers who later reached the summit at the behest of Bavaria's Crown Princess Marie. She had the route checked in preparation for her own ascent of the Zugspitze. On 22 September 1853, Karoline Pitzner became the first woman on the Zugspitze.|$|E

Plumbing is." [...] Tracy was humble about his abilities, telling a journalist, [...] "it's just that I try no tricks. No profile. No 'great lover' act... I just project myself as I am—plain, trying to be honest." [...] He was known to have enjoyed the quip once made by Alfred Lunt: [...] "The art of acting is—learn your lines!" [...] Katharine Hepburn, in an interview six years after Tracy's death, suggested that Tracy wished he had held a different profession.|$|E
500|$|When Adams {{appeared}} on The Early Show in 2008, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> [...] "Summer of '69" [...] and its lyrical meaning. Adams said {{the song was}} about sex and making love in the summertime. [...] "69" [...] is {{a reference to the}} sexual position, 69. On the Reckless 25th anniversary, Adams told In the Studio that the song was built on the theme of nostalgia, such as the [...] "cultural revolution", the break-up of The Beatles, his discovery of music and the moon landing, but also about a character who plays until his fingers bleed and sexual discovery. Vallance however has gone for the more conventional interpretation of the title being a reference to a year. He notes Jackson Browne's [...] "Running on Empty", which contains references to 1965 and 1969, as his own influence, and recalls Adams citing the film Summer of '42 as his.|$|E

500|$|While making Aparajito, Ray had not {{planned a}} trilogy, but after <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> {{the idea in}} Venice, it appealed to him. He {{finished}} {{the last of the}} trilogy, Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. Critics Robin Wood and Aparna Sen found this to be the supreme achievement of the trilogy. Ray introduced two of his favourite actors, Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore, in this film. It opens with Apu living in a Calcutta house in near-poverty. He becomes involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna. The scenes of their life together form [...] "one of the cinema's classic affirmative depictions of married life." [...] They suffer tragedy. After Apur Sansar was harshly criticised by a Bengali critic, Ray wrote an article defending it. He rarely responded to critics during his filmmaking career, but also later defended his film Charulata, his personal favourite.|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{has spoken}} about his {{political}} views on several occasions, most notably {{when he visited}} Tony Blair at No. 10 Downing Street in 1997.

I wasn't going there representing the 'Indie community'. I wasn't representing anyone. I was going there for me. You have to understand that from when I went to school and from when I was born all we ever knew was conservative, Tory, right-wing government. What people don't mention is, they say 'He went to meet Tony Blair.' No. I went to meet the Labour prime minister. Our parents always drummed into us that the Labour Party was for the people and the Tory Party was not. I went to meet the Labour prime minister." ...|$|E

Though Scalia was not referring to any particular individual, the Supreme Court was about to {{consider the case of}} Salim Ahmed Hamdan, supposed driver to Osama bin Laden, who was challenging the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. A group of retired military officers that supported Hamdan's position asked Scalia to recuse himself, or step aside from hearing the case, which he declined to do. The Court held 5–3 in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that the federal courts had jurisdiction to consider Hamdan's claims; Scalia, in dissent, contended that any Court authority to consider Hamdan's petition had been eliminated by the jurisdiction-stripping Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.|$|E

500|$|The {{identity}} of Mysterion is never revealed in [...] "The Coon". After the episode aired, the question [...] "Who is Mysterion?" [...] became a frequently asked {{question at the}} FAQ for the official South Park website, South Park Studios. The answer posted at that site was that [...] "there is no answer", and that only Trey Parker and Matt Stone actually know. Parker said {{it was one of}} the most common questions <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the show, along with the {{identity of}} Cartman's father, which was resolved in the fourteenth season episode [...] "201". Parker and Stone originally said there was no actual answer to Mysterion's identity, as they never chose a specific character to be him. In the original ending of the episode, after Mysterion is arrested, Kyle is shown to be in prison and it is believed he is the superhero. However, the real Mysterion visits him, and Kyle explains he pretended to be Mysterion so the real superhero could remain free and continue fighting crime. As a thank you, Mysterion revealed his identity by showing his face, but like in the actual episode, the viewer cannot determine who he is because all the children look alike without hats. The ending was ultimately cut because Parker and Stone decided it took too much time for a simple throwaway gag and to show that Kyle was not Mysterion. The clip is available as a deleted scene in the thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray sets. The superhero characters from [...] "The Coon" [...] returned in the fourteenth season episodes [...] "", [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] and [...] "Coon vs. Coon and Friends", in which Mysterion is revealed.|$|E
