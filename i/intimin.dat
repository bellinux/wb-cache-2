40|$|To {{successfully}} colonize their mammalian hosts, many bacteria produce multiple virulence {{factors that}} play essential roles in disease processes and pathogenesis. Some of these molecules are adhesins that allow efficient attachment to host cells, {{a prerequisite for}} successful host colonization. Bordetella spp. express a number of proteins which either play a direct role in attachment to the respiratory epithelia or exhibit similarity to known bacterial adhesins. One such recently identified protein is BipA. Despite the similarity of BipA to <b>intimins</b> and invasins, deletion of this protein from B. bronchiseptica {{did not result in}} any significant defect in respiratory tract colonization. In this study, we identified an open reading frame in B. bronchiseptica, designated bcfA (encoding BcfA [bordetella colonization factor A]), that is similar to bipA. In contrast to the maximal expression of bipA in the Bvg intermediate (Bvgi) phase, bcfA is expressed at high levels in both the Bvg+ and Bvgi phases. We show here that BvgA and phosphorylated BvgA bind differentially to the bcfA promoter region. Utilizing immunoblot assays, we found that BcfA is localized to the outer membrane and that it is expressed during animal infection. While deletion of either bipA or bcfA did not significantly affect respiratory tract colonization, concomitant deletion of both genes resulted in a defect in colonization of the rat trachea.

50|$|Peptides {{are very}} useful as {{therapeutic}} and diagnostic substances.

Many types of bacteria have cell surface proteins such as the enteropathogenic E. coli <b>intimin</b> protein which is involved in binding to host cells, or the OmpA protein of E. coli cells which is important in keeping the structure of the outer membrane. Many surface proteins are involved in bacterial cell attachment and invasion of the host cell. By using bacterial display, target proteins on the host cell can be identified. These surface proteins need to first be translocated across the bacterial cell membranes from the cytoplasm to the cell surface. Gram-negative bacteria have an additional periplasmic space, which Gram-positive bacteria lack, so they have a harder task of translocating proteins. The display of heterologous proteins on the bacterial cell surface normally requires the fusion of the protein with a surface protein, called a scaffold.|$|E

This diversity was used to define a number of distinct <b>intimin</b> types, {{the most common of}} which are α, β and γ. <b>Intimin</b> binds the type III secretion system effector protein Tir.

On the basis of characterization of the C-terminal 280 -amino-acid cell binding domain of <b>intimin</b> (Int 280661 – 939), four distinct Int 280 types (types α, β, γ, and δ) have been identified.

40|$|<b>Intimin</b> is a {{bacterial}} adhesin {{located on the}} surface of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and other related bacteria that is believed to self-translocate across the outer membrane (OM), and therefore it has been regarded {{as a member of the}} type V secretion system (T 5 SS), which includes classical autotransporters (ATs). However, <b>intimin</b> has few structural similarities to classical ATs and an opposite topology with an OM-embedded N region and a secreted C region. Since the actual secretion mechanism of <b>intimin</b> is unknown, we investigated <b>intimin</b> biogenesis by analyzing its requirement of periplasmic chaperones (DsbA, SurA, Skp, and DegP) and of OM protein BamA (YaeT/Omp 85) for folding, OM insertion, and translocation. Using full-length and truncated <b>intimin</b> polypeptides, we demonstrate that DsbA catalyzes the formation of a disulfide bond in the D 3 lectin-like domain of <b>intimin</b> in the periplasm, indicating that this secreted C-terminal domain is at least partially folded prior to its translocation across the OM. We also show that SurA chaperone plays the major role for periplasmic transport and folding of the N region of <b>intimin,</b> whereas the parallel pathway made by Skp and DegP chaperones plays a secondary role in this process. Further, we demonstrate that BamA is essential for the insertion of the N region of <b>intimin</b> in the OM and that the protease activity of DegP participates in the degradation of misfolded <b>intimin.</b> The significance of these findings for a BamA-dependent secretion mechanism of <b>intimin</b> is discussed in the context of T 5 SSs...|$|E

40|$|<b>Intimin</b> is a {{bacterial}} adhesion molecule involved in intimate attachment of enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli to mammalian host cells. <b>Intimin</b> targets the translocated <b>intimin</b> receptor (Tir), which is exported by the bacteria and {{integrated into the}} host cell plasma membrane. In this study we localized the Tir-binding region of <b>intimin</b> to the C-terminal 190 amino acids (Int 190). We have also determined the region’s high-resolution solution structure, which comprises an immunoglobulin domain that is intimately coupled to a novel C-type lectin domain. This fragment, which is necessary and sufficient for Tir interaction, defines a new super domain in <b>intimin</b> that exhibits striking structural similarity to the integrin-binding domain of the Yersinia invasin and C-type lectin families. The extracellular portion of <b>intimin</b> comprises an articulated rod of immunoglobulin domains extending from the bacterium surface, conveying a highly accessible ‘adhesive tip’ to the target cell. The interpretation of NMR-titration and mutagenesis data has enabled us to identify, for the first time, the binding site for Tir, which {{is located at the}} extremity of the Int 190 moiety...|$|E

The results indicate that beta 1 -chain integrins are not essential for intimin-mediated cell attachment or EPEC-mediated actin polymerization...|$|E
40|$|Fecal {{samples from}} healthy {{children}} under 2 {{years of age}} living in Berlin, Germany (205 infants), and Melbourne, Australia (184 infants), were investigated {{for the presence of}} attaching and effacing (AE) Escherichia coli (AEEC) strains by screening for eae (<b>intimin)</b> genes. Twenty-seven AEEC strains were isolated from 14 children (7. 6 %) from Melbourne and from 12 children (5. 9 %) from Berlin. The 27 AEEC strains were classified as enterohemorrhagic E. coli (one strain, producing Shiga toxin 1), typical enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (one strain carrying an EPEC adherence factor [EAF] plasmid), and atypical EPEC (25 strains negative for Shiga toxins and EAF plasmids). The AEEC were divided into 18 different serotypes, O-nontypeable and O-rough strains. Typing of their <b>intimin</b> genes revealed the presence of <b>intimin</b> α in 6 strains, <b>intimin</b> β in 11 strains, <b>intimin</b> γ in 7 strains, <b>intimin</b> ζ in 2 strains, and <b>intimin</b> η in one strain. Analysis of HEp- 2 cell adherence showed diffuse adherence or localized adherence-like patterns in 26 AEEC strains; local adherence was found only with the EAF-positive strain. Ten AEEC strains showed an AE property with the fluorescent actin staining (FAS) test. The introduction of an EAF plasmid (pMAR 7) converted 11 FAS-negative AEEC strains to FAS positive and increased the FAS reaction in six FAS-positive AEEC strains, indicating that the genes needed for the AE phenotype were functional in these strains. Our finding indicates that atypical EPEC strains could play a double role as strains that naturally immunize against <b>intimin</b> in humans and as reservoirs for new emerging human pathogenic EPEC strains...|$|E
40|$|Attachment to host cells by enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is {{associated}} with the formation of a highly organized cytoskeletal structure containing filamentous actin, termed an attaching and effacing (AE) lesion. <b>Intimin,</b> an outer membrane protein of EHEC, is required for the formation of AE lesions, as is Tir, a bacterial protein that is translocated into the host cell to function as a receptor for <b>intimin.</b> We established a yeast two-hybrid assay for intimin-Tir interaction and, after random mutagenesis, isolated 24 point mutants in <b>intimin,</b> which disrupted Tir recognition in this system. Analysis of 11 point mutants revealed a correlation between recognition of recombinant Tir and the ability to trigger AE lesions. Many of the mutations fell within a 50 -residue region near the C-terminus of <b>intimin.</b> Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of this region revealed four residues (Ser 890, Thr 909, Asn 916 and Asn 927) that are critical for Tir recognition. Mapping the sequences of EHEC <b>intimin</b> and Tir onto the crystal structure of the intimin-Tir complex of enteropathogenic E. coli predicts that each of these four <b>intimin</b> residues lies at the intimin-Tir interface and contributes to a pocket that interacts with Ile 298 of EHEC Tir. Thus, this genetic approach to <b>intimin</b> function both identified residues critical for Tir binding and demonstrated a correlation between the ability to bind Tir and the ability to trigger actin focusing...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEnteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is an {{important}} cause of diarrhea in children. EPEC adheres to the intestinal epithelium and causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. Recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis (Smeg) and Mycobacterium bovis BCG strains were constructed to express either BfpA or <b>intimin.</b> The entire bfpA gene and {{a portion of the}} <b>intimin</b> gene were amplified by PCR from EPEC genomic DNA and inserted into the pMIP 12 vector at the BamHI/KpnI sites. The pMIP_bfpA and pMIP_intimin vectors were introduced separately into Smeg and BCG. Recombinant clones were selected based on kanamycin resistance and designated rSmeg_pMIP_(bfpA or <b>intimin)</b> and rBCG_pMIP_(bfpA or <b>intimin).</b> The expression of bfpA and <b>intimin</b> was detected by Immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-BfpA and anti-intimin antibodies. The immunogenicity of these proteins was assessed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice by assaying the feces and serum for the presence of anti-BfpA and anti-intimin IgA and IgG antibodies. TNF-α and INF-γ were produced in vitro by spleen cells from mice immunized with recombinant BfpA, whereas TNF-γ was produced in mice immunized with recombinant <b>intimin.</b> The adhesion of EPEC (E 2348 / 69) to HEp- 2 target cells was blocked by IgA or IgG antibodies from mice immunized with recombinant BfpA or <b>intimin</b> but not by antibodies from non-immunized mice. Immunogenic non-infectious vectors containing relevant EPEC virulence genes may be promising vaccine candidates...|$|E
40|$|Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli 0157 :H 7 (EHEC) and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are {{intestinal}} pathogens that induce characteristic lesions on mammalian cells called actin pedestals. Attachment to host cells by both EPEC and EHEC is {{an essential}} step towards colonization and {{is associated with the}} formation of highly organized actin cytoskeletal elements termed as attaching and effacing (AE) lesions beneath bound bacteria. The outer membrane protein <b>intimin</b> is required for the formation of these structures and binds its own translocated mammalian cell receptor called Translocated <b>intimin</b> receptor (Tir). These interactions induce a cascade of events that result in actin pedestal formation. In this thesis, we characterized pedestal formation and the requirements of pedestal formation by host adapted and in vitro cultivated EHEC. Our data indicate that growing EHEC in the mammalian host enhances bacterial cell attachment, expression and translocation of virulence effectors and actin signaling, and this enhancement is likely to entail more than one bacterial activity involved in host cell interactions. We also focused on the interaction between the two key bacterial players involved in pedestal formation, <b>intimin</b> and Tir. We randomly mutagenized the Tir-binding domain of <b>intimin</b> and isolated point mutants that disrupted Tir recognition. The ability of <b>intimin</b> mutants to bind to recombinant Tir correlated with their ability to trigger AE lesions on pre-infected mammalian cells. Half of the mutations fell within the previously identified 50 amino acid C-terminal region of <b>intimin,</b> and alanine scanning mutagenesis of this region identified four residues of EHEC <b>intimin</b> that are critical for Tir recognition. In a model of the EHEC intimin-Tir complex that is based on EPEC <b>intimin</b> and Tir, these four amino acids are predicted to be located at the intimin-Tir interface, indicating that these residues play a functional role in <b>intimin</b> recognition by Tir. To identify critical residues involved in <b>intimin</b> recognition and <b>intimin</b> mediated actin signaling, we generated point mutations in the extracellular domain of EHEC Tir. Based on our data, we conclude that Tir-intimin interaction is essential for triggering actin pedestals, and <b>intimin</b> function in the context of Tir signaling can be replaced by proteins that are entirely unrelated to <b>intimin</b> but that bind to Tir. These data are concordant with the model that <b>intimin</b> functions to cluster Tir in the membrane to induce actin assembly. Finally, as a step to study downstream actin signaling processes after Tir translocation, we mapped the domain of Tir involved in host cell signaling. We found that the clustering of a 12 amino acid stretch of C-terminus encompassing the Nck binding sequence of Tir generated actin nucleation indistinguishable from that mediated by the entire C-terminus, and abrogation of Nck binding by mutation of Y 474 to Phenylalanine abolished actin assembly. Although these results do not rule out a role for other domains of Tir involved in actin pedestal formation, this suggests that the essential element of Tir consists of the Nck binding domain...|$|E
40|$|Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} agent of diarrheal disease in the developed countries. Attachment to host cells, an essential step during intestinal colonization by EHEC, {{is associated with the}} formation of a highly organized cytoskeletal structure containing filamentous actin, termed attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion, directly beneath bound bacteria. The outer membrane protein, <b>intimin,</b> is required for the formation of this structure, as is Tir, a bacterial protein that is translocated into the host cell and thought to function as a receptor for <b>intimin.</b> In this thesis, we characterized A/E lesion formation by in vivo and in vitro-grown EHEC, aimed at testing whether bacterial adaptation to the mammalian host included up regulation of A/E lesion formation. Our results showed that actin signaling by EHEC was induced upon bacterial growth in vivo, and this induction was likely due to the up regulation of multiple activities by in vivo-grown EHEC. We also focused on the interaction between <b>intimin</b> and the host cell, an interaction that triggers actin condensation of A/E lesion formation. We evaluated the role of β 1 integrins, one of the proposed receptors of <b>intimin,</b> in A/E lesion formation, and demonstrated that β 1 integrins are not essential for intimin-mediated cell binding and actin condensation. To better understand <b>intimin</b> function, we mapped the functional domains of <b>intimin,</b> showed that the minimal cell binding domain of <b>intimin</b> correlates with the minimal Tir-binding domain. This minimal Tir-binding domain, when purified and coated on latex beads, was sufficient to trigger actin condensation on preinfected mammalian cells, suggesting that Tir-binding by <b>intimin</b> is critical in the final step of A/E lesion formation. To further demonstrate the significance of the interaction between <b>intimin</b> and Tir in A/E lesion formation, we developed a yeast two-hybrid system to identify <b>intimin</b> mutants diminished in Tir-binding, and then characterized those mutants for the ability to trigger actin condensation, the final step of A/E lesion formation. Finally, as a first step to study the downstream actin signaling pathway after Tir-binding, we mapped the domain of Tir involved in intimin-binding, and showed that the N-terminus and C-terminus of Tir are likely to be localized in the host cell cytoplasm, available to interact with downstream effectors in actin signaling...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of <b>intimin</b> subtype and Tir in the adherence of EPEC and Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), isolated from different animal species, to porcine intestinal IVOC. Moreover, the role of <b>intimin</b> in Tir-independent adherence of the human EPEC strain E 2348 / 69 was investigated using <b>intimin</b> and Tir-deficient derivatives. Our results demonstrated that A/E E. coli strains (AEEC) from various animal species and humans induce the A/E phenotype in porcine ileal IVOC and that <b>intimin</b> subtype influences intestinal adherence and tropism of AEEC strains. We also showed that a tir mutant of EPEC strain E 2348 / 69 demonstrates close adherence to the epithelial cells of porcine ileal IVOC segments, with microvillous effacement but with no evidence of actin polymerization or pedestal formation, and that <b>intimin</b> seems to be involved in this phenotype.
