40|$|Abstract. Although it is {{generally}} assumed that the <b>Horseshoe</b> <b>Whip</b> <b>Snake</b> (Coluber hippocrepis) originated in northern Africa, its biology and ecology has been studied mainly in southern Europe. In this paper we report on morphology, feeding, and reproductive ecology of Coluber hippocrepis in the Rif region (northern Morocco). Males attained larger sizes than did females, {{but there was no}} body-size difference between populations separated by the Strait of Gibraltar. The species feeds exclusively on vertebrates: mammals (45 %), reptiles (28 %), birds (17 %), and amphibians (10 %). There was an ontogenetic dietary shift in terms of frequency of prey consumed and in terms of prey size; moreover, an intersexual difference in prey frequency was found. Sexual maturity was attained at 540 mm snout-vent length (SVL) in males, and 720 mm SVL in females. Males showed a vernal spermatogenic cycle. Oviposition occurred at the beginning of summer, and offspring were observed in the field during September...|$|E

50|$|The red <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> is a slender, long-tailed snake {{that grows}} to {{a length of}} 70 cm in Europe but up to 100 cm {{in the eastern part}} of its range in Asia. It closely resembles Dahl's <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> but differs in having a smaller, flatter head. The upper surface is reddish-brown or reddish grey, with a dark band with pale margins on the neck and scattered, smaller dark bands with pale rims on the fore-parts, these {{markings}} being more widely spaced than those of Dahl's <b>whip</b> <b>snake.</b> Another distinguishing feature is the fact that the scales on the belly of that species have a keel on each side whereas the belly scales on the red <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> do not. The eye is surrounded by a ring of pale skin and the area of skin in front of and behind this is dark. The underparts are whitish-yellow.|$|R

5000|$|Signal whips (or signalwhips) are {{a type of}} single-tailed whip, {{originally}} designed to control dog teams. A signal whip usually measures between 3 and 4 feet in length. Signal <b>whips</b> and <b>snake</b> <b>whips</b> are similar. What distinguishes a signal <b>whip</b> from a <b>snake</b> <b>whip</b> {{is the absence of}} a [...] "fall". A fall is a piece of leather attached {{to the end of the}} body of the <b>whip.</b> In a <b>snake</b> <b>whip,</b> the [...] "cracker" [...] attaches to the fall.

The other Maltese snakes include the harmless Black <b>Whip</b> <b>Snake,</b> the Leopard Snake and the Algerian <b>Whip</b> <b>Snake.</b> Snakes are usually fairly timid creatures and they only bite humans in defence, when touched, trodden upon or cornered.
