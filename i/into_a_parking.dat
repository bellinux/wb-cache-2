5|$|After World War II, {{the vacant}} {{site of the}} former synagogue {{was used as a}} {{makeshift}} volleyball court. The volleyball court made way for a prefabricated department store building, constructed in 1959. The department store was completely destroyed in a fire on December 31, 1980, and was subsequently dismantled. Despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the same spot, and a 1977 architecture competition for its design, no construction took place. Instead, the parcel was turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> lot, which it remains to this day.|$|E
5|$|The site of One Meridian Plaza {{was bought}} by the Arden Group in 2000. The site was {{converted}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> lot as construction on a new building was held up in a zoning feud with the neighboring site, 1441 Chestnut Street. 1441 Chestnut Street {{was the site of}} the Morris Building and other smaller buildings that sat behind One Meridian Plaza. The feud between Arden Group's chief executive Craig Spencer and 1441 Chestnut Street developer Tim Mahoney began in 2003. Spencer and Mahoney settled their dispute in March 2006 and construction on One Meridian's 48-story replacement, the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton began in May. The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton opened in January 2009. A memorial was unveiled on October 21, 2009 at the skyscraper honoring the three firefighters who died in the fire. The memorial features three bronze firefighter helmets atop a marble base with the firefighters' names on it. It sits in an empty area between the condo building and the adjacent hotel along the south side of South Penn Square across from the SW corner of Dilworth Park.|$|E

25|$|BART {{was one of}} {{the first}} U.S. systems of any size to have {{substantial}} automated operations. As a first-generation installation, the automation system was plagued with numerous operational problems during its first years of service. Shortly after revenue service began, an on-board electronics failure caused one two-car test train (with car 143 as the lead car) to run off the end of the elevated track at the Fremont station and <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> lot. This incident was dubbed the Fremont Flyer, and there were no serious injuries.|$|E

500|$|One {{concern of}} the group was to keep their music [...] "stripped down" [...] and minimal.

We've turned the world <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> lot. Similarly we use musical technology that we create, and it finds a use for itself".|$|E

500|$|In 1977, {{the city}} used eminent domain to {{purchase}} the area southwest of Mount Vernon Square itself. Over the next few years, the homes and businesses on these blocks were razed. [...] One of the last businesses to exist on the 901 New York Avenue NW lot was a Chinese restaurant named Nan King (which {{was one of the}} first restaurants in the city to serve dim sum). It stayed in business until 1979. Although the Washington Convention Center was constructed on the blocks just south of 901 New York Avenue, nothing was built on the triangular block itself.

500|$|From 1981 to 1993, new {{construction}} projects were initiated in downtown St. Louis at levels unseen {{since the early}} 1960s. Among these was the tallest building in the city, One Metropolitan Square, which was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum and built in 1989. New retail projects began to take shape: Amtrak abandoned Union Station as a passenger rail terminal in 1978, but in 1985, it reopened as a festival marketplace {{under the direction of}} Baltimore developer James Rouse. The same year, downtown developers opened St. Louis Centre, an enclosed four-story shopping mall costing $176 million with 150 stores and [...] of retail space. By the late 1990s, however, the mall had fallen out of favor due to the expansion of the St. Louis Galleria in Brentwood, Missouri. The mall's flagship Dillard's store closed in 2001. The mall closed in 2006, and beginning in [...] 2010, developers began to convert the mall <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> structure and an adjoining building into apartments, hotel, and retail.|$|E
500|$|The $1.6 million {{were raised}} in full {{by the end of}} April 2000, just in time to ensure the circus {{received}} its STAR funding which would have been nullified if the Butlers had not made their fundraising goal by May 5 of that year. The Butlers had found the space for the school through coincidence; after driving along Montreal Avenue in Saint Paul one night, they turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> lot, noticed an area beneath some trees, and realized it was an ideal location for their school's expanded facility. On August 25, 2000, ground was broken on the new structure. The big top took about a year to complete, during which time the school also changed its name to Circus Juventas, named for Juventas, an ancient Roman goddess of youth and rejuvenation. Ultimately, the project totaled $2.1 million and by 2006, the school was $700,000 in debt. It was working with various city agencies to resolve the shortfall and faced [...] "no looming threat." [...] The school relies heavily on parent volunteers to help with various operational aspects, from rigging to administrative work to set construction and decoration, and concessions sales. Betty Butler estimated that 90 percent of work on the school's shows is done by parent volunteers. The circus operates with the equivalent of 40 full-time employees.|$|E

She is scared, but then surprised and perplexed when the mob unexpectedly begins to dance in a synchronized manner. Her boyfriend, appearing normal, then arrives in the Mercedes to rescue her.
