40|$|Thermo-elastic {{distortions of}} {{composite}} structures have been {{measured by a}} holographic camera using a BSO photorefractive crystal as the recording medium. The first test campaign (Phase 1) was performed on CFRP struts with titanium <b>end-fittings</b> glued to {{the tips of the}} strut. The samples were placed in a vacuum chamber. The holographic camera was located outside the chamber and configured with two illuminations to measure the relative out-of-plane and in-plane (in one direction) displacements. The second test campaign (Phase 2) was performed on a structure composed of a large Silicon Carbide base plate supported by 3 GFRP struts with glued Titanium <b>end-fittings.</b> Thermo-elastic distortions have been measured with the same holographic camera used in phase 1, but four illuminations, instead of two, have been used to provide the three components of displacement. This technique was specially developed and validated during the phase 2 in CSL laboratory. The system has been designed to measure an object size of typically 250 x 250 mm²; the measurement range is such that the sum of the largest relative displacements in the three measurement directions is maximum 20 μm. The validation of the four-illuminations technique led to measurement uncertainties of 120 nm for the relative in-plane and out-of-plane displacements, 230 nm for the absolute in-plane displacement and 400 nm for the absolute out-of-plane displacement. For both campaigns, the test results have been compared to the predictions obtained by finite element analyses and the correlation of these results was goo...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to select a TRW A-type polyimide resin that would be suitable for fabrication of filament wound reinforced plastics structures. Several different formulations were evaluated after which the P 105 AC formulation {{was selected as the}} most promising. Procedures were developed for preparing P 105 AC/S-glass roving prepreg and for fabricating filament wound structural composites. Composites were fabricated and then tested in order to obtain tensile and shear strength information. Small, closed-end cylindrical pressure vessels then were fabricated using a stainless steel liner and <b>end-fittings</b> with a P 105 AC/S-glass polar-wound overwrap. These pressure vessels were cured in an air circulating oven without augmented pressure. It was concluded upon completion of this study that the P 105 AC resin system is suitable for filament winding; that low void content, high strength composites are obtained by the filament winding process; and that augmented pressure is not required to effect the fabrication of filament wound P 105 AC composites...|$|E
40|$|Spoolable {{reinforced}} plastic line pipe will be {{widely used in}} the exploitation of acid gas and oil wells. <b>End-fitting</b> is a mechanical device that forms {{the transition from the}} spoolable {{reinforced plastic}} line pipe to the connector. It was well known that nickel was an important element in the <b>end-fitting.</b> In this paper, a novel spectrophotometric method was described for determination of nickel in the <b>end-fitting</b> of spoolable reinforced plastic line pipe. The method was based on the color reaction between nickel and dimethylglyoxime, which was favored in an alkaline medium, producing a red compound in the presence of ammonium persulfate as an oxidant. Under the optimum reaction conditions the absorption value was proportional to the concentration of nickel in the range of 0. 080 ~ 0. 50 % (R 2 = 0. 9999), and the relative standard deviation was less than 3. 0 % (n= 5). The proposed method was applied successfully to determine nickel in <b>end-fitting</b> of spoolable reinforced plastic line pipe...|$|R
40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [61077031]The {{stress state}} of crimped {{pultruded}} composite rods subjected to traction {{has been investigated}} analytically using the linear theory of elasticity of anisotropic body and the superposition principle. The theoretical solution is able to reproduce the finite element analysis results and clarify {{the relation between the}} stress state and the boundary stresses. It can be appreciated from the theoretical solution that a longitudinal compressive stress {{at the edge of the}} crimping zone is generated by the boundary shear stress induced by the flow of metal <b>end-fitting.</b> Thus it can be deduced that the stress concentration at the edge of crimping zone could be mitigated through appropriately increasing the extent of the flow of the metal <b>end-fitting</b> away from the middle of the crimping zone. Our research shows that a radial tensile stress existing at the edge of the crimping zone is corresponding to the area of the rod that axial splitting is taken place. Comparison between analytical and numerical results shows the analytical results are in good agreement with the numerical ones except for stress distribution at the edge of the loading zone. The detailed study on stress state at the edge of the crimping zone provides better understanding of the failure mechanism, the improvement possibilities on the crimping technique and the monitoring of the structural health of the composite rod.

40|$|A {{simplified}} packing {{and operating}} procedure for capillary electrochromatography (CEC) {{has been developed}} which draws {{from some of the}} more accessible features of published practice. The key elements of this methodology are use of an <b>end-fitting</b> and frit from a 1 -mm microbore column in the initial phase of the packing, use of a conventional constant-flow HPLC pump for capillary packing, conditioning of the packed capillary using a conventional constant-flow HPLC pump with flow splitting, bedding down of the packed capillary under an electric field while fitted into the CE instrument and operation without pressurisation and without an end frit. Working in such a manner, CEC was carried out on a commercial test mixture and mixtures of steroids...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFlexible risers are {{presently}} {{seen as an}} attractive alternative to their rigid counterparts in the offshore oil exploration industry, mainly because of their relatively simpler mounting and transportation. However, the complex multi-layered structure which guarantees high flexural compliance is not favorable for inspection with most non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques, which makes structural integrity evaluation difficult. Initial efforts concentrated on {{the search for a}} single technique which would ensure reliable detection of armor failure, but recent {{studies have shown that the}} safest approach may be to take advantage of the redundancy obtained when different instruments are combined. This work presents results of a full-scale dynamic loading test of a 6 m-long section of a flexible pipe with <b>end-fittings</b> which was instrumented with a range of sensors. Of these, measurements of torsional angle variation, axial displacement and Acoustic Emission were selected for a direct comparison. A detection pattern is observed during forced rupture of the wires of one of the outer armor layers, and reliable identification of events is possible when information from the three techniques is combined...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the facility, experimental methods, characterizations, and uncertainty {{analysis of the}} Cryo Distortion Measurement Facility (CDMF) at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). This facility is designed to measure thermal distortions of structural elements as the temperature is lowered from 320 K to below 40 K over multiple cycles, and is capable of unattended running and data logging. The first measurement {{is to be the}} change in length and any bending of composite tubes with Invar <b>end-fittings.</b> The CDMF includes a chamber that is efficiently cooled with two cryo-coolers (one single-stage and one two-stage) rather than with liquid cryogens. Five optical ports incorporate sapphire radiation shields - transparent to the interferometer - on each of two shrouds and a fused silica vacuum-port window. The change in length of composite tubes is monitored continuously with displacement-measuring interferometers; and the rotations, bending, and twisting are measured intermittently with theodolites and a surface-figure interferometer. Nickel-coated invar mirrors and attachment mechanisms were developed and qualified by test in the CDMF. The uncertainty in measurement of length change of 0. 4 m tubes is currently estimated at 0. 9 micrometers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAdvanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) is a 300 MWe {{vertical}} pressure tube type, boiling light water cooled and heavy water moderated reactor. It consists of 452 coolant channels wherein {{the heat of}} nuclear reaction is used to boil the light water coolant to generate steam. Typical coolant channel assembly of AHWR consists of a pressure tube of cold worked Zr- 2. 5 Nb alloy extended by stainless steel <b>end-fittings,</b> attached at its ends. A Calandria tube of annealed Zircaloy- 4 alloy separates the hot pressure tube from the cold heavy water moderator. The Calandria tube is attached at its ends to the Calandria side tube-sheets of both the bottom and top end shields. Thermal expansion, irradiation enhanced axial creep and growth of Calandria tubes cause them to elongate. These elongations induce compressive stresses in Calandria tubes and also load the tube-sheets of the end shields. Stresses also get induced in the annular plate, main-shell and sub-shells of the Calandria vessel. Nature of interaction and types of stresses induced in these components will depend upon the support conditions of both the end shields, creep and growth rates of Calandria tubes. This has been studied for different combinations of fixed and floating types of support conditions of both the top and the bottom end shields. It has been observed that compared to the fixed support condition of both the end shields, stresses induced in the different components reduce to half when either of the end shields support condition is kept floating or on some flexible support...|$|E

This paper applies a three-dimensional (3 D) electric field analysis program to calculate the field distribution at the live-end of 275 kV and 330 kV non-ceramic insulators used in the Queensland transmission system. At these voltages, fields can be high enough to cause damage to the insulator sheath due to corona discharge, and grading devices need to be used to reduce the electric field to acceptable levels. Of particular interest to this research was the effect of <b>end-fitting</b> geometry and corona ring geometry on the electric field at the live-end of high voltage non-ceramic insulators. Three different non-ceramic insulator types were compared, and their fields are shown. Also a number of different ring geometries were compared. The effect of changing ring cross-sectional shape, diameter, and placement along the insulator are shown. All of these were found to influence the electric field at the live end. 1...|$|R

Box 800), Riyadh 11421, Saudi ArabiaAn {{accident}} {{scenario in}} which the <b>end-fitting</b> of one channel of the Pickering-B, Canadian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (CANDU) is assumed to fail completely is considered. All of the 12 bundles of the channel {{are assumed to be}} discharged to the fuelling-machine vault and onto the floor. Three cases are analysed; the case of intact bundle, bundle broken into separate intact fuel pins and broken bundle with broken pins. Release of 1311 and Xe+ Kr to the atmosphere are estimated for both cases of intact and impaired containment using AECL computer codes HOTSPOT, CURIES, FIREBIRD and PRESCON. For conservatism, the channel with the maximum power was used in the analysis. The activity released to the environment in both events of intact containment (single failure) and impaired containment (dual failure) was estimated to be below the permissible regulatory limits. How-ever, the activity released in the dual failure case is much higher than that for the single failure...|$|R
40|$|Super-pressure {{balloons}} {{are currently}} under development by the NASA Balloon Pro-gram Office {{for use in}} stratospheric balloon missions. They are made of thin polyethylene film forming a sealed envelope that is contained by stiff meridional tendons. The film is subject {{to a state of}} stress whose details depend on the cutting pattern, stiffness of the film vs. stiffness of the tendons, etc. and the viscoelastic behavior in the film plays an important role. This paper extends the modeling approach presented by the same authors at the AIAA Balloon Systems Conference 2007. The current model captures nonlinear viscoelasticity in a wrinkled, anisotropic membrane, and the analysis has been successfully applied to several balloon designs. Because the effects of wrinkling on the stress history are modeled correctly, the behavior of the balloon can be simulated with high fidelity, starting from pressures as low as 5 - 20 Pa. The creep strains at selected points of a 4 m diameter balloon were measured using photogrammetry and the results were compared to results from the numerical model. At a pressure of 700 Pa the balloon had a maximum stress of 6. 0 MPa in the meridional direction (2. 5 MPa hoop stress) and meridional strains of up to 6. 4 % (- 2. 7 % hoop strain). A detailed model of gore seams and tendon attachments provides insight into the asymmetry of the strain distribution that results from the actual asym-metry of the gore seams. This also allows the numerical replication of an experimentally observed pressure-dependent rotation of the <b>end-fittings.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{increasing}} {{manufacturing cost}} effectiveness becomes a vital {{condition for the}} commercial success {{of the next generation}} of large wide body aircrafts. Welding is a very strong candidate process to be used in manufacturing, allowing both sensible cost reductions and structural efficiency. The main aim of the work is to study the fatigue crack propagation in welded structures. The study is focused on the effect of welding residual stresses to the damage tolerance behaviour of the structure. The welding technique under investigation is the Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA). Two stringer panels were designed, one tension panel to simulate the lower wing skin cover and one compression panel to mimic the upper wing skin cover. The main design driving force for the upper stiffened panel is buckling since it is under compression. Damage tolerance is the main design criterion for the lower stiffened panel due tensile fatigue loading. Design of the end- fittings for the tension stiffened panel was also carried out using finite element modelling in order to ensure uniform stress distribution at the cross section of the test area of the structure. A fatigue analysis at the various locations of the bolts and at the weld line has been performed. This is necessary {{in order to ensure that}} the crack initiation site comes from the weld line rather than from the fastener holes at the <b>end-fittings</b> during the fatigue testing. The research was focused on fatigue crack growth behaviour of welded aluminium panels. The FE model of the CCT coupon is the main tool for the comparison of the fatigue crack behaviour between the parent and the welded coupons. Furthermore AFGROW software is used in conjuction with the output of the FE model to compare the experimental and numerical results in terms of fatigue crack growth lives of welded coupons. In welded coupons a faster crack propagation growth was demonstrated at the region of the weld line and the heat affected zone (HAZ) due to the tensile welding residual stresses. Away from this region, a decrease in crack growth took place due to the compressive welding residual stresses in this area. Finally, a calculation effort in large-scale stiffened panels was made in terms of the stress intensity factor for both welded and non-welded cases. Possible future work was also addressed in such large-scale structures. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
