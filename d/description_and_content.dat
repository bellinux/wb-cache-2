40|$|Many studies {{observed}} that the Church involvement in ecclesiastical architecture {{for a number of}} decades amounted to apostasy and heresy. Other studies have also noted that architecture has augmented and has become an impetus to the aspirations and purpose of Christianity. This study examined apostasy and heresy in the Church and how they have affected the development of ecclesiastical architecture in Nigeria. The three phases of ecclesiastical architecture development were considered. Since this study is theoretical and historical in nature, qualitative methods in form of literature, unstructured interview and non-participant observation were adopted to gather the data. The analysis was done through <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> analysis. The findings of this study showed that, in Nigeria, architecture created identity for the Church, registered the Church’s presence at every location, exhibited the wealth of the Church, encouraged the poor of hope and announced the Church to the world.

40|$|Abstract. Transition from {{traditional}} teacher-centered models, focusing on curricula <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> plans, to student-centered models, in which learning activities are supported in e-learning platforms, {{is not an}} easy task to resolve. This issue is especially important when the knowledge is emergent, i. e. when the activities that this knowledge enables are intensively supported by information and communications technologies, subjected to rapid obsolescence. A method for mapping a course content plan into technological mediating tools that form a portfolio is proposed. A mediating tool is a set of learning activities organized according to a specific structure. The portfolio enables synergetic relations between mediating tools, promoting a good content organization and high-order learning activities. The characteristics of the resulting application are described for a course of electronic marketing, in which a content plan is mapped into a set of mediating tools organized in a portfolio. The application was evaluated with surveys and benchmarked with traditional teaching and other e-learning solutions. Benchmarking positioned our e-learning solution as having the best features in team building, achieving scores similar to traditional teaching. ...|$|E

40|$|There {{is still}} a broad variety of systems of {{technical}} requirements for buildings in the various European countries, despite {{the existence of the}} Construction Products Directive of the European Union and the development of Euro Codes. The goals and topics are quite similar, and most countries call their regulations ‘performance based, ’ but a detailed study reveals considerable variety of functional requirements, performance requirements, and specifications, with inconsistency within the requirements of some countries. This paper is based on the findings of a comparative analysis of building regulations for housing in eight European countries, carried out on behalf of the Dutch Ministry of Housing and intended to locate the Dutch Building Decree within the spectrum of regulations in other European countries. The project makes a detailed comparison of systems of building control, the formulation of the requirements, and the contents of selected subjects.

This study examined various emerging materials and architectural styles with a view to identify how and why these factors have affected the emergence and development of ecclesiastical architecture in Nigeria. The study area was Lagos State because of many reasons. Lagos State was noted as the cradle of Christian evolution and growth in Nigeria. It was a place that pioneered ecclesiastical architecture in Nigeria. Lagos State was arguably one of the most Christian religious cities in the world having a long history of Independent African Churches dating back to the time of the great influenza epidemic of 1918. Since this study was a theoretical research and historical in nature, qualitative methods in form of literature, unstructured interview and non-participant observation were employed to gather the data and analysis was done by <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> analysis. The study found that {{building materials}} and the architectural styles carried theological, liturgical and spiritual meanings of the Church at different times and in different denominations. Each Church determined the choice of materials and style to augment the preached word. This study concluded that these factors carried meanings that were capable to fulfil the mission, vision and the aspirations of various Churches at various times...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} collective bargaining on the civil service merit system in the State of Oregon. Four topics of current interest are explored. The first is {{a discussion of the}} status of collective bargaining and the civil service merit system legislation. The second topic is an analysis {{of the extent to which}} the day-to-day administration of public sector personnel functions is determined by the relative influence of collective bargaining agreements and civil service rules. The third is the impact of the collective bargaining model on the integrity of the merit principle. The final topic addressed by this study is the implication of the relationship between collective bargaining and civil service for the effective administration of public sector personnel systems in the future. This research utilized a multiple methods design. The data collection methodology involved two approaches. The first was a document review of state statutes, administrative rules, Employment Relations Board orders, and court decisions applicable to the civil service and collective bargaining. The second approach to data collection employed a written survey designed to solicit the opinion of personnel administrators and others in a position to have an opinion concerning the influence of collective bargaining within their respective jurisdictions. Both qualitative and quantitative methods of data analysis were employed to interpret the data. Qualitative analysis of historical documents yielded descriptive information pertaining to such factors as the proliferation of collective bargaining legislation and the rationale behind such legislation. Quantitative survey data were summarized through the use of descriptive statistics. In addition, qualitative survey data were analyzed using techniques of narrative <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> analysis, which were applied to the open ended survey responses and interview data. A combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques were used in tandem with the expectation that such an approach would contribute to a more thorough investigation of the research question and lead to a better understanding of the impact which collective bargaining legislation may have had on the civil service merit system than would the use of either technique alone...|$|E
