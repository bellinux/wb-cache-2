5|$|The {{density of}} housing is {{generally}} high, {{but there are}} open green areas, in particular heathland on Runcorn Hill and the extensive Town Park created {{as part of the}} new town. The older industries, particularly the remaining chemical <b>factories,</b> <b>are</b> concentrated mainly to the southwest of the town bordering the Mersey, while newer industries, including warehousing, are to the northeast and southeast.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of glassblowing {{continues in the}} 21st century in three factories located outside of the traditional quarter of the Old City, north of Hebron and south of the neighboring town of Halhul which generally produce functional household souvenirs. Two of the <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> owned by the Natsheh family. These are displayed in large halls close to each of the factories.|$|E
5|$|Czech {{units were}} held up near Skoczów and a ceasefire was signed on 3 February. The new Czechoslovakia claimed the area partly on {{historic}} and ethnic grounds, but especially on economic grounds. The area {{was important for}} the Czechs as the crucial railway line connecting Czech Silesia with Slovakia crossed the area (the Košice-Bohumín Railway, {{which was one of}} only two railroads that linked the Czech provinces to Slovakia at that time). The area is also very rich in black coal. Many important coal mines, facilities and metallurgy <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> located there. The Polish side based its claim to the area on ethnic criteria: a majority (69.2%) of the area's population was Polish according to the last (1910) Austrian census.|$|E
50|$|The {{gunpowder}} <b>factory</b> <b>was</b> not rebuilt. In around 1667, a new <b>factory</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed in}} Floriana, {{far away from}} any residential areas. This <b>factory</b> <b>was</b> incorporated into the Ospizio complex in the early 18th century.|$|R
50|$|A {{co-operative}} {{butter factory}} opened in Creamery Road, Yinnar in 1891. The <b>factory</b> <b>was</b> sold in 1901 to Wood & Co. who modernised and upgraded the machinery. In 1915 the <b>factory</b> <b>was</b> purchased by Hussey.The <b>factory</b> <b>was</b> later demolished.|$|R
50|$|On 10, April 2008 Nambarrie {{announced}} {{its plans to}} close its factory in Belfast. The <b>factory</b> <b>is</b> now closed and production currently takes place in England.

5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation). Taxi, delivery and truck drivers have also been adversely affected by the recent gas price increase. Experts believe that the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector {{for at least the next}} 2–3 years.|$|E
5|$|Sandakan main {{industrial}} {{zones are}} basically based on three {{areas such as}} the Kamunting area known for its oil depots, edible oil refinery and glue factories. In Batu Sapi, a shipyard, fertiliser oxygen gas and wood-based <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> situated. The main highway, Batu Sapi Road, had been upgraded by 2014. A grand specialised industrial park, Majulah Industrial Centre have also started operating in 2015. The proposed Seguntor industrial area consists of 1,950 hectares (4,833 acres) is originally an agricultural area and the area is now in the process to be re-zoning into an industrial area. 2,531 acres will be for wood-based industries while another 2,302 will be used for general industries. At present, 55 wood-based factories have been approved, of which 35 has been into operation. While another total of 340 hectares area for general industries and 30 hectares for service industries are located in various parts of Sandakan.|$|E
5|$|The Antankarana were {{historically}} {{fishermen and}} pastoralist zebu herders, although {{in recent years}} most have become agriculturalists. Sea fishing is carried out in two-man canoes made from a single hollowed out log. Antankarana fishermen used these canoes to hunt whales, turtles and fish. They also used nets to hunt in rivers, where they could catch eels, fish, crayfish and other food sources. Salt production was historically a major economic activity. Historically the Antankarana engaged in trading with European seafarers, exchanging tortoiseshell for guns. Today, {{while the majority of}} Antankarana continue to work in these traditional sectors – especially the highly lucrative shrimp fishing business or the growing of sugarcane – many are wage laborers. More highly educated community members, particularly among the noble class, work in salaried positions as government officials, teachers {{and a variety of other}} trades and professions. The SIRAMA national sugar company <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> located in Antankarana territory and employ many migrants, but relatively few Antankarana as their standard of living on average is high enough to be able to pursue better opportunities.|$|E

25|$|<b>Factories</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{responsible for}} the production of pu'er teas. While some individuals oversee small-scale production of high-quality tea, such as the Xizihao and Yanqinghao brands, the majority of tea on the market is compressed by factories or tea groups. Until recently factories were all state-owned and {{under the supervision of the}} China National Native Produce & Animal Byproducts Import & Export company (CNNP), Yunnan Branch. Kunming Tea Factory, Menghai Tea Factory, Pu'er Tea Factory and Xiaguan Tea Factory are the most notable of these state-owned factories. While CNNP still operates today, few <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> state-owned, and CNNP contracts out much production to privately owned factories.|$|E

25|$|<b>Factories</b> <b>are</b> {{stations}} {{which use}} resources {{to create one}} or many products. The needed resources and produced wares need to be transported by a ship. Traders in the universe must move wares between the factories to keep production going; if supply exceeds demand a factory will often stop producing goods. The player can build factories by buying them at a shipyard and loading them on board a large transport ship (TL class). The player factories can own their own ships to buy resources and sell products. There are many factory options to configure the trader ships behaviour and job. Player factories can also connect to each other to share resources and products. The <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> connected through tubes and the docking bay is moved to a central complex hub.|$|E

50|$|By the 1890s a {{vineyard}} {{and cheese}} <b>factory</b> <b>were</b> established in Garryowen. The cheese <b>factory</b> <b>was</b> built in 1892 as the Garryowen Cheese Factory. The factory produced around 300 pounds of cheese per day from local milk, which was exported to American and British markets. In 1901, the shareholders formed the Canada Pride Cheese Company. By 1930, cheese was mostly purchased by wholesalers {{and by the}} 1940s the <b>factory</b> <b>was</b> closed. The frame <b>factory</b> <b>was</b> dismantled and its lumber used to build three houses.|$|R
50|$|The Tanner Street <b>factory</b> <b>was</b> closed, and the {{building}} and <b>factory</b> <b>were</b> used for storage. Starting in 2000, parts of the site were redeveloped for flats.

There was also an additional factory in Stourport-on-Severn, now closed.|$|R
25|$|Damascus {{is home to}} a {{wide range}} of {{industrial}} activity, such as textile, food processing, cement and various chemical industries. The majority of <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> run by the state, however limited privatization in addition to economic activities led by the private sector, were permitted starting in the early 2000s with the liberalization of trade that took place.|$|E
25|$|The average {{official}} {{salary in}} 2011 was equivalent to $US2 per month while the actual monthly income {{seems to be}} around $US15 because most North Koreans earn money from illegal small businesses: trade, subsistence farming, and handicrafts. The illegal economy is dominated by women because men have to attend their places of official work {{even though most of}} the <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> non-functioning.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce costs, many mass-producers of toys locate their {{factories}} in areas where wages are lower. 75% of all toys sold in the U.S., for example, are manufactured in China. Issues and events such as power outages, supply of raw materials, supply of labor, and raising wages that impact areas where <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> located often have an enormous impact on the toy industry in importing countries.|$|E

25|$|Here, P is {{the price}} of an item and r is the rate of profit. Assume that the owners of the <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> rewarded by {{receiving}} income proportional to the capital that they advanced for production (with the proportion being determined by the profit rate). Assume that the labor cost per unit equals W in each sector (and does not change). Both r and W are assumed to be equalized between sectors due to competition, i.e., the mobility of capital and labor between sectors.|$|E
25|$|Since {{replication}} machineries do {{not move}} relatively to template DNAs such as factories, they are called a replication factory. In an alternative figure, DNA <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> similar to projectors and DNAs are like as cinematic films passing constantly into the projectors. In the replication factory model, after both DNA helicases for leading strands and lagging strands are loaded on the template DNAs, the helicases run along the DNAs into each other. The helicases remain associated {{for the remainder of}} replication process. Peter Meister et al. observed directly replication sites in budding yeast by monitoring green fluorescent protein(GFP)-tagged DNA polymerases α. They detected DNA replication of pairs of the tagged loci spaced apart symmetrically from a replication origin and found that the distance between the pairs decreased markedly by time. This finding suggests that the mechanism of DNA replication goes with DNA factories. That is, couples of replication <b>factories</b> <b>are</b> loaded on replication origins and the factories associated with each other. Also, template DNAs move into the factories, which bring extrusion of the template ssDNAs and nascent DNAs. Meister’s finding is the first direct evidence of replication factory model. Subsequent research has shown that DNA helicases form dimers in many eukaryotic cells and bacterial replication machineries stay in single intranuclear location during DNA synthesis.|$|E
