40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the problem of jointly {{determining}} the order size and dynamic prices for a perishable inventory system over a finite time planning horizon when firms simultaneously provide customers with a prompt delivery option and a delivery schedule option. Customers are segmented into two types, namely spot purchase customers and the <b>forward</b> <b>purchase</b> customers. Demands for both types of customers are assumed to be time and price dependent. The decision-maker of the inventory system is assumed to apply pricing policies to stimulate demand to improve revenues under the condition that customers with forward purchases may cancel their orders. A mathematical model is developed to find the optimal number of price settings, the optimal dynamic prices and the order quantity. A solution procedure is found to determine the optimal decisions...|$|E

There are sunspot equilibriums in both of the high interest rate and low interest rate cum devaluation strategies that may lead to the vicious spiral of currency crashes, credit crunch, and output collapse. The destructive high interest rate amid exchange rate overshooting is indeed the most unwise policy proposal. Dual demand driven monetary policy has demonstrated its superiority as the first best option in this manner. Without compromising to the credibility of fixed exchange rates, and not incompatible to the banks ’ willingness to lend, the central bank plays the role of lender of last resort via open market <b>forward</b> <b>purchase</b> to help the banking system sail through the capital reversal. The lower yield on bank reserves bolsters the prospective output that initiates greater demand for money, and thereby enticing capital re-inflow.

40|$|A presente tese realizou uma pesquisa sobre o processo de tomada de decisão {{individual}} que ocorre no contexto de compra a crédito, a partir de teorias e estudos da psicologia econômica e do comportamento do consumidor. Pretendeu-se analisar o efeito do tipo de produto e das condições de pagamento na intenção de compra a prazo dos indivíduos, assim como a influência das diferenças individuais nesta relação. Assim, utilizou-se uma metodologia experimental com a qual foram realizados três experimentos, a fim de testar as hipóteses construídas a partir de um modelo teórico. No Experimento 1, com 8 grupos experimentais e uma amostra de 279 pessoas, identificou-se que há um efeito negativo na propensão de compra a prazo quando há um desconto para pagamento à vista, independentemente da cobrança de juros a prazo. Se não há o desconto à vista, a propensão de compra a prazo aumenta. Além disso, concluiu-se que os indivíduos que apresentam altos índices de materialismo e impulsividade tendem a comprar mais a prazo. Para o Experimento 2, com 8 grupos experimentais e 314 respondentes, a coleta de dados foi similar à primeira, alterando somente algumas manipulações. Como implicação, encontrou-se resultados para os quais, se há desconto nas condições, menor tende a ser a propensão de compra a prazo. Além disso, provou-se que o tipo de produto possui um efeito na compra parcelada. Já no Experimento 3, buscou verificar somente os efeitos relacionados às manipulações dos tipos de produtos, com 4 grupos experimentais, e uma amostra de 171 pessoas. Averiguou-se um efeito cruzado para a interação produto e tipo de produto, ou seja, quando o tipo de produto for hedônico, há maiores variações na média de intenção de compra a prazo pelo produto do que se ele for utilitário. Concluiu-se, também, que o produto utilitário apresentou uma maior intenção de compra a prazo. This thesis {{aimed to}} conduct a research on the individual decision-making that occurs in the credit purchase context, from theories and studies of economic psychology and consumer behavior. It was intended to analyze {{the effect of the}} product type and payment conditions in the credit purchase intention, as well as the influence of individual differences in this relationship. It was used an experimental methodology with three experiments in order to test the hypotheses from a theoretical model. In Experiment 1, with 8 experimental groups and a sample of 279 people, it was identified that there is a effect on the credit purchase propensity when there is a discount for cash payment, regardless of the interest rates. If there is no discount, the lower tends to be the credit purchase propensity i as there are no interest charges in the payments. Furthermore, it was concluded that individuals with high levels of materialism and impulsivity tend to buy more than those who have a high financial literacy. For Experiment 2, with 8 experimental groups and 314 respondents, the data collection was similar to the first, changing just the manipulations. As implication, it was found results that if there was no discount the lower tends to be the term purchase propensity, {{in the same way that}} the first one. By the way, it was proven the that the produt type influenced in the credit payment. In the Experiment 3, it was sought to verify only the effects related to the type of products, with 4 experimental groups for both products, and a sample of 171 people. It was found a crossed product interaction effect when the type of product is hedonic, so there were greater variations in the average of credit purchase intentionwhen the product was utilitarian. It was also proven that the utilitarian product has a higher <b>forward</b> <b>purchase</b> intention, so the bigger the effect that was noticed by the product variation...|$|E

One very strong result of that literature is that uncertainty should not matter, as long as well developed forward markets exist. The empirical implications of this result, however, are hard to find in the data. We model terms of trade uncertainty in a small open economy with uncertainty stemming from abroad and derive the equilibrium demand for forward contracts. It turns out that risk averse agents will not buy forwards at an actuarially fair price, thus rendering both the full-hedge theorem and the separation theorem of the afore-mentioned literature obsolete. Using real world data for Germany we calibrate our model. We find that in equilibrium risk averse agents will buy forward cover only for investment reasons. The amount of <b>forwards</b> <b>purchased</b> is around 20 % of equilibrium imports. This is broadly in accordance with empirical observed ratios. ...|$|R

We first test for settlement effects, ie pure time-value explanations, and found that these are theoretically small and empirically almost undetectable, despite the potentially high power of our tests. Experimenting six arbitrage trading rules to seek for an explanation of what else might behind the price diferences, we found a clue in the autocorrelation of the premiums: positive premiums tent to persist while negative ones do not. The persistence is too weak to allow profitable low-risk `arb' trading, but the pattern still suggests that there is a `cash is king' effect: sellers tend to prefer spot sales, and buyers tend to go for <b>forward</b> <b>purchases.</b> This is consistent with the idea that the cost of financing consists of not just pure time value but also of a fixed shadow cost (re ecting the hassle and delays caused by raising cash), and that this cost is larger and arises more often and more persistently than the hassle costs of shorting stocks. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Spot and <b>forward</b> <b>purchases</b> for {{delivery}} on the usage date {{play an important}} role in matching the supply and the uncertain demand of energy, because storage capacity for energy, such as electricity, natural gas, and oil, is limited. Transaction costs tend to be larger in spot than forward energy markets near maturity. Partially procuring supply in the forward market, rather than entirely in the spot market, is thus a potentially valuable real option, which we call the forward procurement option. We investigate the optimal value and management of this real option, as well as their sensitivities to parameters of interest. We do this by formulating, analyzing, and applying to natural gas data procurement models with differential spot and forward transaction costs and correlated spot demand and nominal price random variables. Our research quantifies the value of the forward procurement option on realistic instances, also suggesting that procuring the demand forecast in the forward market is nearly optimal. This policy greatly simplifies the management of this real option without an appreciable loss of value. We provide some theoretical support for this numerical finding. Beyond energy, our research has potential relevance for the procurement of other commodities, such as metals and agricultural products. 1...|$|R

Thus, spot and <b>forward</b> <b>purchases</b> for delivery on the usage date {{play an important}} role in matching the supply and the uncertain demand of energy.

Hence, partially procuring supply in the forward market, rather than entirely in the spot market, is a potentially valuable real option. We call this option the forward procurement option. The study of this option from the perspective of differential transaction costs has received little attention in the literature. We thus formulate and analyze a parsimonious procurement model with differential spot and forward transaction costs and correlated spot demand and nominal price random variables. Our analysis, in part based on natural gas data, sheds novel light on the value of the forward procurement option and its optimal exercise, as well as their sensitivities to parameters of interest. Our main insight is that procuring the demand forecast in the forward market is nearly optimal on the instances that we consider. This greatly simplifies the management of this option. We obtain analogous results with a richer model in which the supply procured in the forward market is delivered at multiple dates.
