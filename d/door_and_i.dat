500|$|During James' meeting, he was {{informed}} that a letter bomb had exploded {{in a suburb of}} Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said [...] "There was a knock at the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real". Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.|$|E
500|$|Valo {{has been}} a regular alcohol user much of his life. He got drunk {{for the first time}} at age 13, and on more than one occasion, Valo has also been {{reported}} to have performed intoxicated. In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a guy just talking a lot of bull about me and my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked the door, he opened the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} used to {{perpetuate}} the myth of Johnson selling his soul to the Devil for his musical ability. [...] The lyrics do not contain any references to Satan or a Faustian bargain, but they have been interpreted as a description of the singer's fear of losing his soul to the Devil (presumably in exchange for his talent). [...] Music historian Elijah Wald believes that Johnson's verses do not support the idea. [...] Delta bluesman Tommy Johnson promoted himself as having made a deal with the Devil and Southern folklore identifies a crossroads or graveyard as the site of such a pact, which Wald identifies as likely sources of the myth. [...] However, musicologist Robert Palmer points out that Johnson was [...] "fascinated with and probably obsessed by supernatural imagery." [...] His song [...] "Hellhound on My Trail" [...] tells of trying to stay ahead of the demon hound which is pursuing him and in [...] "Me and the Devil Blues" [...] he sings, [...] "Early this mornin' when you knocked upon my <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said 'Hello Satan I believe it's time to go'". [...] These songs contribute to the Faustian myth; how much Johnson promoted the idea is debated, although many agree [...] "the 'devil angle' made for good marketing".|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I forsooth," [...] he said. [...] "M. le Comte would as {{soon have}} Satan or Beelzebub inside his <b>doors.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> marvel, my good de Marmont, {{that you have}} succeeded in keeping on such {{friendly}} terms with that royalist ogre." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jolly uncomfortable they are," [...] Andrew remarked, {{looking at}} them. [...] "However, I didn't {{want to be}} turned away from your <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> still have a few friends in town whom I daren't disgrace. Honestly, Berners, I came up to ask you something." ...|$|R
60|$|So in I went. Mother Goose herself {{opened the}} <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> there <b>I</b> was.|$|R
500|$|Kelly Leverknight, a local resident, was {{watching}} {{news of the}} attacks {{when she heard the}} plane. [...] "I heard the plane going over and I went out the front <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw the plane going down. It was headed toward the school, which panicked me, because all three of my kids were there. Then you heard the explosion and felt the blast and saw the fire and smoke." [...] Another witness, Eric Peterson, looked up when he heard the plane, [...] "It was low enough, I thought you could probably count the rivets. You could see more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly. It was on its side. There was a great explosion and you could see the flames. It was a massive, massive explosion. Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, Shanahan {{accepted}} {{an offer from}} the NHL to become the NHL's vice president of hockey and business development. [...] "In a broad sense, I think obviously, I {{am going to be}} another voice in the hockey ops, {{but at the same time}} people like [...] John Collins and [...] Gary [...] and [...] Bill [...] are going to allow me and teach me the business of hockey," [...] Shanahan told NHL.com. [...] "What I was excited about in their offer to bring me on board is that it was wide open for me. There was not going to be any room with a closed <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would be given an opportunity to see and learn. As time goes by there will be some days where my role is more hockey specific and some days where my role is more business or marketing specific." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who {{was playing with}} Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it was like, when I walked in the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> heard them playing, {{it was like a}} revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E
60|$|While I {{was in her}} house, {{which was}} near four months, she had no less than twelve ladies of {{pleasure}} brought to bed within the <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think she had two-and-thirty, or thereabouts, under her conduct without doors, whereof one, as nice as she was with me, was lodged with my old landlady at St. Jones's.|$|R
5000|$|Derek Laverty (Kelami, {{pulled up}} before 22nd): [...] "He {{gave me a}} great spin. They went a great gallop early <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was handy, but he is an old horse and began to feel the pinch on the second circuit. I noticed three horses {{disappear}} at Becher's and thought it best to pull him up. We were someway behind." ...|$|R
60|$|Just {{then the}} person outside the <b>door</b> coughed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hastened to open it, for I knew the cough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Satisfy your curiosity, Mr. Linwood, by all means," [...] Charlotte {{answered}} {{in the same}} tone. [...] "Open the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will follow you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The man led me {{into the}} service room {{and turned to the}} left. He knocked at a closed <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> heard a sleepy voice say-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{mean that}} when I {{was a student}} at college, feeding on four dollars a week, this {{opportunity}} was knocking at the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> missed it?" ...|$|E
60|$|All this I {{heard as}} I dashed for the lee <b>door</b> <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> {{wondered}} why I {{did not hear}} the Samurai's voice.|$|R
60|$|I {{sat down}} again. She {{went to the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> called, <b>I</b> {{following}} her with my eyes. Lindy came {{with a bowl of}} water.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} had any {{experience}} in the sash, <b>door</b> <b>and</b> blind business," [...] replied Jimmy. [...] "I didn't come here to make sash, <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> blinds. <b>I</b> came here to manage your business." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{pointed to}} the {{warehouse}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{saw that it was}} now open and that a man was standing upon the threshold. I turned towards him doubtfully.|$|E
60|$|My {{companion}} {{then threw}} open a <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{followed him into}} a luxuriously-appointed room, furnished with a suite of lounges and easy-chairs corresponding {{with those in the}} hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Rollo, [...] "and {{we must go}} out {{the front}} <b>door.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> don't care much," [...] he continued, [...] "for it is pretty near dinner time." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'I am come to put {{out your}} eyes, as you deserve, seeing how you have treated my master. Still I will spare you at a price.

6000|$|... "Neither," [...] I said. [...] "You {{will make}} your {{appearance}} on the scene when a gentleman should--after you are fully dressed, which indubitably private function shall take place behind closed <b>doors.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> will feel indebted to you if, after you do appear, your deportment and manners are such {{that it will not}} be necessary to inform the public, in order to appease its apprehension, that you have taken a bath." ...|$|R
60|$|A tapping {{came at the}} <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{heard the}} glutinous accents of M'ling speaking. I {{pocketed}} one of the revolvers (keeping one hand upon it), and opened to him.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked back}} at us from the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had a last {{impression}} of that beautiful haunted face, the startled eyes, and the drawn mouth. Then she was gone.|$|E
60|$|The barking of the {{vigilant}} dogs {{had drawn}} me instantly to the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> remember how positively certain I then felt that Sidney had kissed Mariposilla during her groundward journey.|$|E

5000|$|In 2012, Farrell {{discussed}} his aborted {{plans for a}} Satellite Party play, stating, [...] "I was actually working on something, a project {{a couple of years}} ago, that was actually a Satellite Party. It had to do with The Doors. I even got to produce a song, a previous unproduced and unrecorded song, by The <b>Doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do this beautiful play called “The Satellite Party” in Vegas. It didn’t work out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O," [...] said Rollo, laughing, [...] "I {{never thought}} of that. Go down, Nathan," [...] he continued, [...] "to the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will go round and knock out the fid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{be safer}} and quieter {{while you are}} sitting. I heard {{a knock at the}} <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do not doubt that it is Clara. She said she would be here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, excuse me," [...] said he. He reopened the {{bathroom}} <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> took my finger {{out of the}} crack of it. After I had performed the marvellous digito-nasal feat I said: ...|$|E
