5|$|Pre-season {{fears of}} a {{conflict}} with Keenan were realized, as the coach reduced his time on the power play and forced him into a defensive role he was not comfortable with. Unhappy with being pushed into a checking role, and believing that the way Keenan was using him was not allowing him to give the Flames <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> on his contract, Tanguay requested a trade at the Christmas break. He and general manager Darryl Sutter agreed to keep it quiet {{so as not to}} become a distraction to the team, although Tanguay's request was revealed in the off-season. He suffered offensively, falling to 58 points.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates whether, and if so, to what extent, Level 3 <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> {{disclosed}} by European banks {{provide useful}} information to investors and {{are reflected in}} firm value changes. Using a unique sample of 416 hand-collected firm-year observations from European banks reporting under IFRS, in contrast to previous research conducted in the US, we find no overall evidence that changes in Level 3 <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> are associated with changes in firm value. However, the value relevance of Level 3 <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> depends on the category assigned to financial instruments. Level 3 <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> that are held for trading are reflected in firm value. Further analyses suggest that this effect is driven predominantly by banks that operate in market-based economies and hire audit firms with deep industry expertise...|$|R

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of banks, this study {{examines}} the capital market pricing implications of three components of loan <b>fair</b> <b>values.</b> We find that the nondiscretionary component is priced on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the discretionary component is assigned a significantly larger multiple than the nondiscretionary component and the noise component is not priced. This implies that the relevance and reliability of loan <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> differs across the three components. The larger multiple assigned to the discretionary component is predicted by a signaling motivation for discretionary behavior, {{consistent with the findings}} for allowance for loan losses. One cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} the estimated discretionary component is proxying for other value-relevant constructs that have a positive pricing implication. However, our results are robust to alternative specifications, including a levels and a changes formulation.

40|$|Prior {{research}} findings are not conclusive {{on whether or}} not equity accounted carrying amounts and disclosed <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of listed associates are value-relevant in different countries. Using a variety of statistical methods, this study compares the value-relevance of disclosed <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of listed associates in South Africa, the United Kingdom and Australia. It finds that value-relevance differs between sample countries, especially when firms in the globalised financial services and mining industries are excluded from the sample, despite increased convergence in accounting standards. This study contributes to the existing literature by directly comparing the cross-country value-relevance of disclosed <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of listed associates. Findings highlight that generalisation of value-relevance findings across countries and industries should be done with caution. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the capital market pricing implications of nondis-cretionary, discretionary, and noise components of loan <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> for {{a sample of}} commercial banks. We use a model to partition loan <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> into discretionary and nondiscretionary components using proxies for dis-cretion and nondiscretion. The residual from the model captures the noise component. We hypothesize that the nondiscretionary component is priced on a dollar-for-dollar basis and the residual (noise) component is not priced. The pricing coeflcient on the discretionary component is predicted to be positive (negative) {{depending on whether the}} motivation for discre-tion is signaling (opportunism). We find evidence consistent with the hy-potheses, implying that the relevance and reliability of loan <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> differs across the three components. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the usefulness of}} incorporating <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> as measures of assets and liabilities {{in the body of}} financial statements in credit-oriented financing systems. Specifically, we argue that fair valuation – while potentially useful in countries that boast advanced capital markets with diffused equity ownership – is not as useful, and even potentially misleading, in countries wherein lenders are the major source of financing and hence are the ‘primary users’ of financial reporting. This paper contributes to the discussion by reviewing the literature on the prediction of default, bankruptcy, credit-rating, and the pricing of credit and identifying the informational inputs used for such predictions and pricing. We then argue that these informational inputs largely ignore <b>fair</b> <b>values,</b> whether measured as exit values or otherwise. Next, we suggest that the premise that <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> are suitable for all countries and entities, regardless of differences in ownership structure and modes of financing, may need to be re-examined. We do propose, however, that enhanced disclosures of <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> are likely to satisfy the criterion of decision usefulness in Italy and other similarly situated countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates several methods {{which can}} {{possibly}} be used to minimize the pro-cyclical impact of accounting rules on bank capital regulation. Improving accounting rules cannot eliminate the pro-cyclicality problem as the recently proposed expected credit loss impairment model for historical cost accounting may be moving towards using information inputs for <b>fair</b> <b>values.</b> Limiting the trading activities accounted for by <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> may reduce the pro-cyclicality. However, it cannot eliminate the impact of <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> in a liquidity crisis. The most effective method is to exclude the unrealized accounting gains or losses from regulatory capital. But it needs a report of capital ratios based on accounting measures to help regulators read the early warning signals emitted by the accounting information...|$|R

25|$|The actual {{pricing and}} rate {{analysis}} of adjustable rate mortgage in the finance industry is done through various computer simulation methodologies like Monte Carlo method or Sobol sequences. In these techniques, {{by using an}} assumed probability distribution of future interest rates, numerous (10,000–100,000 or even 1,000,000) possible interest rate scenarios are explored, mortgage cash flows calculated under each, and aggregate parameters like <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> and effective interest rate {{over the life of}} the mortgage are estimated. Having these at hand, lending analysts determine whether offering a particular mortgage would be profitable, and if it would represent tolerable risk to the bank.|$|E
25|$|The EMH was {{developed}} by Professor Eugene Fama who argued that stocks always trade at their <b>fair</b> <b>value,</b> {{making it impossible for}} investors to either purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices. As such, it should be impossible to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing, and that the only way an investor can possibly obtain higher returns is by chance or by purchasing riskier investments. His 2012 study with Kenneth French confirmed this view, showing that the distribution of abnormal returns of US mutual funds is very similar to what would be expected if no fund managers had any skill—a necessary condition for the EMH to hold.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{collapse}} of the equity markets in 2000, many investors in private equity sought an early exit from their outstanding commitments.

5000|$|The Tax Court, {{relying on}} the “cash equivalency” doctrine, held that the <b>fair</b> market <b>value</b> of the {{contract}} was not includable in the amount realized from the sale.

For example, Benefactor owns a yacht whose adjusted basis is $150,000, but at the time of Benefactor's death, the <b>fair</b> market <b>value</b> of the yacht is only $110,000. The beneficiary's basis in the yacht will be the <b>fair</b> market <b>value,</b> $110,000.|$|R
40|$|Companies {{are under}} IAS 40 {{required}} to report <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of investment properties on the balance sheet or to disclose them in the notes. The standard requires also that companies have to disclose the methods and significant assumptions applied in determining <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of investment properties. However, IAS 40 does not include any illustrative examples or other guidance on how to apply the disclosure requirements. We use a sample with publicly traded companies from the real estate sector in the EU. We find {{that a majority of}} the companies use income based methods for the measurement of <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> but there are considerable cross-country variations in the level of disclosures about the assumptions used in determining <b>fair</b> <b>values.</b> More specifically, we find that Scandinavian and German origin companies disclose more than French and English origin companies. We also test whether disclosure quality is associated with enforcement quality measured with the “Rule of Law” index according to Kaufmann et al. (2010), and associated with a secrecy- versus transparency-measure based on Gray (1988). We find a positive association between disclosure and earnings quality and a negative association with secrecy...|$|R

2500|$|Bond {{valuation}} is {{the determination}} of the fair price of a bond. [...] As with any security or capital investment, the theoretical <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> of a bond is the present value of the stream of cash flows it is expected to generate. Hence, the value of a bond is obtained by discounting the bond's expected cash flows to the present using an appropriate discount rate. In practice, this discount rate is often determined by reference to similar instruments, provided that such instruments exist. Various related yield-measures are then calculated for the given price.|$|E
40|$|Banks {{have been}} {{required}} to report many securities and all derivatives at <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> under U. S. GAAP rules for many years.

We conclude that rather than converging U. S. GAAP with IFRS, competition between the FASB and the IASB would allow GAAP to better respond to market forces...|$|R
