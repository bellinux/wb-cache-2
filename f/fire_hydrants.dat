5|$|Experimental {{electric}} fire-engines {{were made}} for testing in France, Germany and England starting {{in the latter part}} of the nineteenth century. Siemens Brothers Company of London built and experimented with an electric fire engine in 1891. It was shown at the Royal Naval Exhibition in England in 1892. The Paris Fire Department experimented with a self-propelled electric fire engine in 1899. The French electric fire engine, known to them as the automobile pump, was first exhibited at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris and became very popular during its first six months of successful operation. It was demonstrated that this electric fire-engine allowed firemen to begin to extinguish a fire four minutes earlier than a steam fire engine. The fire-engine was self-propelled by on board batteries, and carried a water tank with hundreds of gallons of water that could be used immediately at the site of the fire. The hoses were then connected to the city <b>fire</b> <b>hydrants</b> for more water if needed for a large fire. In 1901, the Paris Fire Department put an electric fire engine into successful operation that also had a hook-and-ladder wagon. It had an electric motor-driven water pump to which hoses were attached for the firemen to use.|$|E
5|$|The flood made {{national}} news. The {{most familiar}} footage is possibly {{of the fire}} that started on April 19 in downtown Grand Forks, surrounded by floodwaters, where eleven buildings and sixty apartments were destroyed. The Grand Forks Herald building was totally destroyed in the fire, along with 120 years of archives. Firefighters {{were not able to}} begin extinguishing the fire immediately as they had to evacuate nearly forty people in one of the nearby apartment complexes who had defied the evacuation order. Additionally, their tankers were unable to reach the buildings due to the height of the floodwater and the water pressure from the hoses and <b>fire</b> <b>hydrants</b> was too weak to extinguish the flames. The National Guard placed the fire trucks on several tractor-trailers to prevent them from flooding, which allowed the firefighters to assist in extinguishing the fire. Also, two aircraft rescue and firefighting trucks from the Grand Forks International Airport were brought in to fight the fire because their engines were higher up off the ground, and thus did not get clogged by the flood waters. The firefighters received assistance several hours after the fire started by a fire-bombing plane that dropped retardant and helicopters who made sixty drops totaling 120,000 gallons of water. Three of the firefighters were treated for hypothermia after treading through the cold temperatures of the flood water. The fire was later determined to have been caused by an electrical problem that had resulted from the large amounts of floodwater.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFlushing {{is a good}} {{practice}} to avoid problems related to sediment, bio-film growth, and corrosion. Artificial sediment was removed from <b>fire</b> <b>hydrant</b> with pilot scale water distribution main. The sediment removal in <b>fire</b> <b>hydrant</b> and main was carefully compared with different flow rate with velocity ranged from 0. 3 to 3. 0 m/s {{and the depth of}} <b>fire</b> <b>hydrant</b> from 0. 5 m to 1. 3 m. The drain capability of <b>fire</b> <b>hydrant</b> decreased as the flow rate increased. Sediment with higher density was hard to remove from water main. The length effect of upward <b>fire</b> <b>hydrant</b> was relatively minor. Downward drain showed better efficiency for both sand and actual sediment...|$|R

25|$|Fire {{fighting}} {{services are}} provided in most developed areas to extinguish or contain uncontrolled fires.

25|$|A tanker truck, {{which can}} also {{be known as a}} water tender or water bowser, is a {{specialist}} fire appliance with the primary purpose of transporting large amounts of water to the fire area to make it available for extinguishing operations.

25|$|At {{the time}} of cityhood, Burbank had a {{volunteer}} fire department. Fire protection depended upon the bucket brigade and finding a hydrant. It wasn't until 1913 that the city created its own fire department. By 1916, the city was installing an additional 40 new <b>fire</b> <b>hydrants</b> but still relying on volunteers for fire fighting. In 1927, the city switched from a volunteer fire department to a professional one.|$|E

25|$|The {{placement}} of energy attenuation devices (e.g. guardrails, wide grassy areas, sand barrels) is also common. Some road fixtures such as road signs and <b>fire</b> <b>hydrants</b> {{are designed to}} collapse on impact. Light poles are designed to break at the base rather than violently stop a car that hits them. Highway authorities may also remove larger trees from the immediate vicinity of the road. During heavy rains, if the elevation of the road surface isn't higher than the surrounding landscape, it may result in flooding.|$|E

Water and sewer services are provided by the Evansville Water & Sewer Company, which provides water to more than 75,000 customers in Evansville and the surrounding area. The Ohio River provides {{for most of the}} city's source of drinking water. Water is drawn from the river and filtered at a 60 million gallon per day treatment plant. There are approximately 1,000 miles of water mains in the system and includes approximately 6,000 <b>fire</b> <b>hydrants.</b>|$|E

Other enhancements include satellite navigation, communications equipment, modern facilities for the crew (kitchen, lavatories, washing machines, desalination equipment, ventilation, refrigerators), watertight bulkheads and fire protection (fire sprinkler systems, <b>fire</b> <b>hydrants</b> etc.). Most of this new technology was necessary to pass national and international safety regulations.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, {{the entire}} area of Lockheed's Vega factory was camouflaged to fool an enemy {{reconnaissance}} effort. The factory was hidden beneath a complete suburb replete with rubber automobiles and peaceful rural neighborhood scenes painted on canvas. Hundreds of fake trees and shrubs were positioned to give {{the entire area}} a three-dimensional appearance. The fake trees and shrubs were created from chicken wire that had been treated with an adhesive and then covered with chicken feathers to provide a leafy texture. Air ducts disguised as <b>fire</b> <b>hydrants</b> {{made it possible for}} the Lockheed-Vega employees to continue working underneath the huge camouflage umbrella designed to conceal their factory.|$|E
25|$|Some fire engines have a fixed deluge gun, {{also known}} as a master stream, which directs a heavy stream of water to {{wherever}} the operator points it. An additional feature of engines are their preconnected hose lines, commonly referred to as preconnects. The preconnects are attached to the engine's onboard water supply and allow firefighters to quickly mount an aggressive attack on the fire as soon as they arrive on scene. When the onboard water supply runs out, the engine is connected to more permanent sources such as <b>fire</b> <b>hydrants</b> or water tenders and can also use natural sources such as rivers or reservoirs by drafting water.|$|E
25|$|This marble obelisk {{is on top}} of {{a square}} base with three reliefs on it. The south side of the base has a relief of Benjamin Grenup {{at the time of his}} death. The relief shows Grenup being run over by a fire water wagon and his fellow firefighters {{reacting}} to the accidental death—one has his arms in the air while the other firefighters stop the wagon. The west side of the base has a relief of a fire hose and two nozzles. The east side has a relief of a fire axe, torch and spanner wrench tied together with a rope. Egg-and-dart motif along with garland and ribbons decorate the sculpture. The sculpture sits on a triangle plot surrounded by a fence. <b>Fire</b> <b>hydrants</b> sit at each of the three corners of the base.|$|E
