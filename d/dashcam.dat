50|$|Police {{departments}} use <b>dashcams</b> {{in police}} vehicles to gather evidence during traffic stops and car chases. Some dash cam {{systems can be}} automatically activated when a police car's emergency lights or siren are turned on. Freedom of information laws mean that the footage can be released under some circumstances, and this {{can be an important}} tool in reporting on police actions. TV shows like World's Wildest Police Videos have frequently featured car chase videos shot from <b>dashcams.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} selling <b>dashcams</b> {{originated}} {{from a personal}} need after founder Alex Jang experienced his family members involved in a terrible car accident. The case was delayed because no parties accepted fault and no witnesses came forward. From this, Alex Jang, while still a sophomore at the University of British Columbia, began researching on <b>dashcams</b> and quickly found their prevalence in the Asian market. In March 2012, BlackboxMyCar officially launched and began selling to the Canadian market, quickly expanding {{to the rest of}} North America and the world.|$|R

2500|$|At around 8:20p.m. on July 26, 2015, Hammond, with Morton as his passenger, {{drove his}} 2001 Honda Civic through {{a parking lot}} of a Hardee's restaurant, where the pair were texted by the {{undercover}} officer. Tiller was sent as backup for the undercover officer, and when Tiller arrived, he pulled his vehicle in behind Hammond's car in an attempt to block Hammond's escape. According to Tiller's account, Tiller approached Hammond's car, ordering him to show his hands. Hammond (who was 19 years old and weighed 121 pounds {{at the time of his}} death) [...] panicked and began to drive away from the scene. Tiller claims that Hammond accelerated turning toward [...] the officer, although this is not supported by the <b>dashcam</b> video. Tiller then fired two rounds from his [...]45 caliber handgun at close range through the open driver's side window of Hammond's car as Hammond tried to flee. Bullets struck Hammond in the left chest and left front shoulder. According to a police report, Tiller feared being run over by Hammond's vehicle when he backed it up and then pulled forward toward the officer. As seen in the <b>dashcam</b> video, Tiller was never in the path of Hammond's vehicle. Police contend that Hammond was under the influence of cocaine at the time of his death. However, in a lawsuit filed against Tiller and the Seneca Police Department, testimony suggests that cocaine was planted on Hammond's body after he had been shot and dragged from his car.|$|E

Castile then calmly informed Yanez: [...] "Sir, I {{have to tell you}} that I do have a firearm on me." [...] Quoting the Star Tribune description of the next 13 seconds of the audio/video: Before Castile completed the sentence, Yanez interrupted and calmly replied, “OK,” and placed his right hand on the holster of his own holstered weapon. Yanez said, “Okay, don't reach for it, then ... don't pull it out.” Castile responded, “I'm not pulling it out,” and Reynolds also said, “He's not pulling it out.” Yanez repeated, raising his voice, “Don't pull it out!" [...] as he quickly pulled his own gun with his right hand and reached inside the driver's window with his left hand. Reynolds screamed, [...] "No!" [...] Yanez removed his left arm from the car and fired seven shots in the direction of Castile in rapid succession. [...] Reynolds yelled, “You just killed my boyfriend!” [...] Castile moaned and said, “I wasn't reaching for it."

2500|$|In the <b>dashcam</b> audio/video of the {{incident}} Yanez can be heard being questioned by St. Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde within minutes of the shooting, and telling her: {{was sitting in the}} car, seat belted. I told him, 'Can I see your license?' And then, {{he told me he had}} a firearm. I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet .... And I don't know where the gun was, he didn't tell me where the fucking gun was, and then it was just getting hinky, he gave, he was just staring ahead, and then I was getting fucking nervous, and then I told him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.According to the official Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) transcript of the interview of Yanez and his attorneys Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler, Yanez stated that his justification for the shooting was based on fear for his own life because he believed that Castile's behavior was abusive toward a young girl passenger (Reynolds' daughter) in the car. Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E

40|$|Video {{recordings}} of police-citizen interactions, most notably those {{obtained from the}} dashboard cameras (<b>dashcams)</b> of police cars, {{have been successful in}} objectively capturing police-citizen exchanges. However, since police-civilian interactions do not solely occur in front of police cars, <b>dashcams</b> present significant limitations. Off-camera violent, and sometimes fatal, encounters (such as the notorious Ferguson case) have fueled increased public support for body-worn cameras. This is especially true in cases with conflicting accounts from the officer(s), victim(s), and witness(es). Requiring officers to wear bodycams may reduce incidents of force and citizen complaints, and increase officer accountability. This paper will present peer-reviewed research to help create an understanding of officer perceptions about the device, and will evaluate the effects of bodycams on both police officers and the communities they serve. Although bodycams have the potential to improve behaviors of both officers and civilians, its efficacy is dependent on its implementation (i. e., policies). Additionally, this paper will present suggestions for police agencies adopting the use of bodycams. Since bodycams hold promise for helping to rebuild relations between officers and the community, more research and feedback can help address the growing privacy and retention concerns...|$|R
