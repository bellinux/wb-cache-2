5|$|Larrys Creek flows {{south from}} the {{dissected}} Allegheny Plateau to the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. It rises in Cogan House Township and flows south to Green Mountain.

5|$|Once <b>it</b> <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> flat Sacramento Valley, SR 20 takes a {{generally}} straight path, crossing I-5 in Williams, overlapping SR 45 near {{the west bank}} of the Sacramento River southeast from Colusa, and then turning back east to cross the Sacramento River and Sutter Bypass on its way to Yuba City. The route crosses SR 99 west of central Yuba City, and runs east through northern Yuba City to the Feather River, which it crosses on the 10th Street Bridge into Marysville. Within the central part of that city, SR 20 makes several turns, first turning south from 10th Street onto E Street, then east on 9th Street (overlapping SR 70), north on B Street, and east on 12th Street (splitting from SR 70). The highway leaves Marysville to the northeast, paralleling the Yuba River on its north side as <b>it</b> <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> foothills of the Sierra Nevada.|$|E

5|$|Upon exiting Jerome, SR 89A heads {{northeast}} {{through the}} Verde Valley.

5|$|After the six 735kV wires {{split up}} {{into two groups}} of three power lines each, the HVDC line follows the eastern group, and the western set diverges away. The line remains {{overhead}} until it reaches {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence River near Grondines, where the 450kV HVDC line descends into an underwater tunnel traversing the river. The power line surfaces on the south shore near Lotbinière substation. After the river crossing, the line enters into the Nicolet terminal near Sainte-Eulalie, northeast of Drummondville. South of the terminal, the line heads south and after a relatively short distance, <b>it</b> <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> Des Cantons close to Sherbrooke.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highway}} leaves Cottonwood, it again becomes a divided highway north of Rocking Chair Road, heading into desert.

As <b>it</b> <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> city of Sedona, the route {{is known as the}} Si Birch Memorial Highway. The route continues east through Sedona, providing access to the Sedona Airport.

5|$|Briar Creek begins where Knob Mountain, Huntington Mountain, and Lee Mountain meet {{in western}} Briar Creek Township. It flows east {{for a short}} {{distance}} before turning south through a gap in Lee Mountain, briefly descending quite steeply. The course levels out as it leaves the mountain behind and begins flowing through a valley after a short distance. It flows under Pennsylvania Route 93, leaving the valley behind. Soon afterwards, the stream picks up the tributary West Branch Briar Creek and turns southeast. After some distance, <b>it</b> <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> community of Briar Creek {{and picks up the}} tributary East Branch Briar Creek. The stream then turns southwest and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River near French Island.|$|E
5|$|East of Parma Corners, {{development}} on NY104 steadily increases as it {{heads toward the}} town of Greece. By the Parma–Greece town line, where NY104 intersects the southern terminus of NY261, Ridge Road is lined with commercial properties of varying size. Continuing east, NY104 meets the northern terminus of NY386. Here, NY 104 widens to a six-lane divided highway. Between NY386 and NY390 exit24, NY104 passes by several large shopping malls, the largest of which is The Mall at Greece Ridge {{at the intersection of}} NY104 and Long Pond Road. At NY390, NY104 continues to be a six-lane divided highway as it heads toward Rochester. <b>It</b> <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> city limits upon meeting Mount Read Boulevard at an interchange.|$|E
5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before <b>it</b> <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or proenzyme.|$|E

5|$|FM1957 {{begins at}} FM471 near Rio Medina, as a two-lane country road. It then {{traverses}} mostly rural, undeveloped land, {{before reaching the}} Bexar–Medina county line, where it becomes Potranco Road. In far western Bexar County, Potranco Road travels through recently built, patchy, residential developments. Development becomes somewhat heavier after the highway passes State Highway211 (SH211), but FM1957 still displays mostly rural characteristics until the highway reaches Loop1604, at which point <b>it</b> <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> San Antonio city limits. Now five lanes wide, with two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane, the legislative definition of FM1957 becomes UR1957; however, Potranco Road remains signed as FM1957.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to {{the lock and}} key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as <b>it</b> <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E
5|$|In Massena, {{the forests}} along NY420 subside {{slightly}} {{as it passes}} by industrial warehouses and residences.

NY420 ends here; however, the road continues north {{into the heart of}} the village as Main Street.|$|E
