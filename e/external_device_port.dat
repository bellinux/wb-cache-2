This study has developed an experimental tool that serves as a practical hands-on learning kit for novices in exploring and mastering hardware-software interfacing in visual environment. After exploring the developed experimental tools, learners could understand the use of computer to configure, control and connect <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> via com <b>port</b> in visual environment. Based on the questionnaire feedback, the developed tool seems very useful and helpful for beginners, which have minimum skills in electrical and electronic engineering in understanding hardware-software interfacing programming better...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of the I/O port controller for the MAP chip as part of the M-Machine project. The I/O port controller is responsible for managing the I/O port, which is used for communication between the MAP chip and <b>external</b> <b>devices.</b> The I/O <b>port</b> is intended to be connected to an off-chip module that then connects to other peripheral buses, such as SCSI or SBUS. The I/O port controller is implemented in Verilog HDL and synthesized to a standard cell library...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel, unified technique to evaluate, through physics-based modeling, the frequency conversion and noise behavior of semiconductor devices operating in large-signal periodic regime. Starting from the harmonic balance (HB) {{solution of the}} spatially discretized physics-based model under (quasi) periodic forced operation, frequency conversion at the <b>device</b> <b>ports</b> {{in the presence of}} additional input tones is simulated by application of the small-signal large-signal network approach to the model. Noise analysis under large-signal operation readily follows as a direct extension of classical approaches by application of the frequency conversion principle to the modulated microscopic noise sources and to the propagation of these to the <b>external</b> <b>device</b> terminals through a Green's function technique. An efficient numerical implementation is discussed within the framework of a drift-diffusion model and some examples are finally provided on the conversion and noise behavior of rf Si diodes...|$|R
50|$|External {{hard disk}} drives or optical disk drives {{that have an}} {{internal}} PATA interface, use some other interface technology to bridge {{the distance between the}} <b>external</b> <b>device</b> and the computer. USB is the most common external interface, followed by Firewire. A bridge chip inside the <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> converts from the USB interface to PATA, and typically only supports a single <b>external</b> <b>device</b> without cable select or master/slave.|$|R

40|$|Universal Serial Bus (USB) {{devices are}} high {{transmission}} speed <b>external</b> <b>devices.</b> USB is the speediest <b>external</b> <b>device</b> available today. The access to USB is very simple, convenient and fast {{compared to other}} <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> such as CD, DVD, Floppy drive etc. Thus USB have become most popular interface standard for hardware connection. But from security point of view, USB devices lacks security as no user is restricted to access USB device. If we restrict the use of USB devices, then the data access through <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> would be as chaotic as before. Thus a system which would provide fast access as well as security is required. In this paper, we propose a system which deals with mutual authentication and key agreement {{in order to provide}} security for access through USB devices...|$|R

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the validity of}} using <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> for urine specimen collection from 24 elderly incontinent men residing {{in a nursing home}} by collecting three sequential specimens, two with <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> and then one by catheterization. The positive predictive value of organisms isolated in quantitative counts of {{greater than or equal to}} 10 (5) CFU/ml in <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> for bladder bacteriuria was 86 % for either sterile or clean collecting devices and 93 % for the same organism in two consecutive specimens. The negative predictive value for organisms present in quantitative counts of less than 10 (5) CFU/ml was 90 % for both sterile and clean devices and 86 % when the organism was present in both specimens. Contamination in <b>external</b> collection <b>devices</b> was not influenced by whether the device was clean or sterile, circumcision of the resident, or duration of time between device application and specimen collection. These data suggest that urine specimens collected by ward nursing staff with <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> are reliable for the diagnosis of bacteriuria in this patient population...|$|R

40|$|With the {{presence}} of smartphones and tablets people are getting used to control their technicaldevices at home with custom applications. This thesis explores the possibility of controlling an IPSet-Top-Box from an <b>external</b> <b>device.</b> The focus of this report and thesis is finding a way for <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> to control IP-Set-Top-Boxesrunning the KreaTV platform. To open up for this possibility a service running in the KreaTVplatform was designed and implemented to handle communication from <b>external</b> <b>devices.</b> Aprotocol for communication was structured and defined to allow devices to communicate with theplatform. The protocol includes a base structure defined for general use when communicating withapplications and services in the platform. The base structure was extended and defined forcommunication with the Set-Top-Box application running the graphical user interface. An Android application was used {{to demonstrate that the}} design solution presented in this reportopens up for the possibility of <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> to control the IP-Set-Top-Box beyond the limitationsof a normal infrared remote control. The Android applications main focus is controlling the Spotifyservice of the IP-Set-Top-Box...|$|R

The proposed models accurately represent {{the effects of the}} fluctuations of the <b>device</b> <b>port</b> signals induced by EM disturbances coupling to the system interconnect. The models can be easily estimated from the <b>device</b> <b>port</b> transient responses and can be effectively implemented in any commercial tool as SPICE subcircuits. Model accuracy is assessed by comparing measurements carried out on a test board and simulations. The effects of both continuous wave sinusoidal and pulsed disturbances are discussed...|$|R
