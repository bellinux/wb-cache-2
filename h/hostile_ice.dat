Respublika was hulked in September 1918 and saw no action ever. Andrey Pervozvanny, {{although}} neglected by its revolutionary crew, remained in active service. In June 1919 Andrey, captained by Lev Galler, and Petropavlovsk gunned downed the rebels of the Krasnaya Gorka fort. The British fleet, which was cruising nearby, {{did not do}} anything to support the anti-Bolshevik mutiny. Two months later, August 16, 1919, the British raided the harbor of Kronstadt with a joint air and torpedo boat strike. One torpedo hit Andrey Pervozvanny armor belt, killing one sailor and flooding an isolated watertight compartment. Repairs continued slowly until the Kronstadt rebellion of 1921 and completely stopped after its suppression {{due to a lack}} of resources. The Bolshevik government had no interest in resurrecting the troublesome capital ships. Both Andrey Pervozvanny-class battleships were sent to the breaker's yard in Novemberâ€“December 1923.|$|R
