25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
2500|$|Nastya {{wakes up}} with a cold. She mutters about spiritual {{complexities}} {{similar to those of}} Voschev. Chiklin drapes three coats over her body for warm, but the activist, still upset about the intelligence letter from management, steals one of them from her. Zhachev tells Chiklin about the aforementioned letter, and Chiklin becomes suspicious of the activist's optimism and energy. Chiklin kills him with a sledgehammer. The activist's body is sent down the river like the kulaks were. The bear begins to weep, feeling isolated from the group. Voschev explains the bear <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> because he has no purpose in life except to work. Nastya's condition is also worsening. [...] "Bring me Mama's bones," [...] she continues to say. [...] "I want them." [...] The workers decide to bring her back to the worksite. Prushevsky, however, stays in the village in order to teach the children. Nastya dies the next morning.|$|E

There are mighty few engagements now, Mrs. Elmore, when a {{regiment}} sets off; no presentation of revolvers in the town hall; {{and some of the}} widows have got married again; and that I don't think is right.

6000|$|... "I wouldn't {{say such}} a thing without being sure. I saw it, I felt it, in England, just before he came away. He talked to me one night- -the last night; and then it came over me. You can tell when a person <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I wouldn't accuse him if he hadn't made me feel that way. I don't accuse him; I just tell you that that's how it is. He can't help it; we can't govern our affections. Do I govern mine? mightn't he say that to me? It's because he is so fond of my mother, whom we lost so long ago. She was beautiful, and very, very brilliant; he is always {{thinking}} of her. I am not at all like her; Aunt Penniman has told me that. Of course, it isn't my fault; but neither is it his fault. All I mean is, it's true; and it's a stronger reason for his never being reconciled than simply his dislike for you." ...|$|E

And something that getting to know the Chambers family has shown me is a beautiful way to make music." [...] "We didn't want a duets album, where people come together for a vocal collaboration and go on their way. We wanted an album that sounds like a band with two singers in it. It <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to us. And we hope it <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to the people who hear it too." [...] states Chambers again.|$|E

5000|$|Life is {{not going}} from bad to good, but itâ€™s a balance of the two that kind of goes up and down. There are bad things and there are good things.
