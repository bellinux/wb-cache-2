5|$|U-37 sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 1 August, {{again with}} Victor Oehrn in command.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> cut pruning were tested on a native Iranian early {{maturing}} apple cultivar (‘Golab’) and seven commercial apple cultivars (‘Gala’, ‘Fuji’, ‘Granny Smith’, ‘Red Delicious’, ‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Red Spare’ and ‘Braeburn’). Tests evaluated vegetative and reproductive responses to <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> cut pruning on M 9 rootstocks. Tests were {{arranged in a}} completely randomized block design with four replicates. The terminal part of vertical shoots was <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> in mid-April in all cultivars; shoots in the control were left intact. Evaluations were made for plant growth (shoot length) and number of flower buds to remain {{until the end of}} the growing season. Tests showed that flowering, in terms of number of formed flower buds, was significantly affected by pruning treatment. Tests on apple cultivar and interaction between pruning and cultivar indicated difference between cultivars in terms of response to pruning. Evaluations for flower bud number and vegetative growth increased by <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> treatment. Results of comparisons showed that ‘Granny smith’ cultivar had the strongest positive reaction to <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> treatment and that the most flower buds formed on one-year old branches after <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> treatment in the subsequent growing season and the ‘Braeburn’ cultivar had the least positive reaction to <b>heading</b> <b>back.</b> The ‘Golab’ cultivar, a local early maturing cultivar, showed a weak positive reaction to <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> but stimulation to flowering was more than that in ‘Fuji’, ‘Red delicious’ or ‘Golden delicious’ cultivars...|$|R

5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the <b>head</b> <b>back</b> together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E

Realizing the danger, {{he is about to}} <b>head</b> <b>back</b> when a walker attacks him.

Hershel finds Dale's injures are too severe and he will not survive. The group agrees to euthanize Dale, but Rick himself cannot take the shot. Daryl takes the {{revolver}} and ends Dale's suffering.|$|E
5|$|Despite the block, Salmaniya Medical Complex's {{disaster}} {{plan was}} activated {{on the morning}} of the attack. It called for more than a dozen ambulances to search nearby areas and Pearl Roundabout. Another dozen ambulances were put on stand-by, according to a member of the medical staff. The staff said that ambulances were functioning in accordance with the plan until about 6:00am, when an alleged call from the Ministry of Interior ordered all but two ambulances to <b>head</b> <b>back</b> to the SMC. However, this order was ignored and more ambulances were sent to search for the injured in the areas surrounding the roundabout.|$|E

Orme drew level with Signorina, but the filly edged away slightly again and won an exciting race by half a length from Orme, Martagon a <b>head</b> <b>back</b> in third.

5|$|Unable {{to capture}} Warsaw by a frontal assault, von Diebitsch devised {{a plan to}} outflank it and enter the city from the west. In early 1831 he sent his forces {{upstream}} on the Vistula, where the Russian divisions were to cross the river and <b>head</b> <b>back</b> north, towards Warsaw. The new plan was thwarted by the Polish defence in three successive battles around Wawer, Dębe Wielkie and Iganie. The Russians withdrew towards Siedlce, where von Diebitsch fell ill and died of cholera.|$|E

5|$|After Duquesne lost to Saint Bonaventure, the Bonnies {{also lost}} their final regular season game to Xavier, which left {{the two teams}} in a tie for the eighth seed and the home tournament game that went with it. The two teams had played each other twice during the season, with each team taking one victory, so the second tiebreaker came down to who had scored the best victory. Duquesne's best win came against Charlotte, while Saint Bonaventure's was against Rhode Island. Unfortunately, those two teams were also in a tie. So for Duquesne to get their home game, Charlotte had to win their final home game, and Rhode Island had to lose. Both teams lost, so the tie {{remained}} and Rhode Island won out due to their head-to-head records. Thus Duquesne would <b>head</b> <b>back</b> {{out on the road}} against the Bonnies.|$|E
5|$|Alan regains {{consciousness}} a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, {{but with}} no memory of how he got there. He starts to <b>head</b> <b>back</b> towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with {{his name on the}} by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.|$|E
5|$|Crosses that precede an {{offensive}} bicycle kick are of dubious accuracy—German striker Klaus Fischer reportedly stated that most crosses {{prior to a}} bicycle kick are bad. Moreover, performing a bicycle kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, as it may harm a startled participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González recommends that the player executing the bicycle kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, the greatest danger happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the <b>head,</b> <b>back,</b> or wrist. Witzig recommends players attempting the move to land on their upper back, using their arms as support, and simultaneously rolling over to a side in order to diminish impact from the drop. A poor bicycle kick can also expose a player to ridicule.|$|E
