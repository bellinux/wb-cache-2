A devout Methodist and prohibitionist, Fields prohibited both dancing and drinking at the Executive Mansion. <b>He</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> inaugural ball from the mansion to the capitol rotunda, where dancing would be allowed, but he and his wife did not attend.

They turned professional in 1891 and joined The Football League two years later. They were promoted to the First Division in 1904 but financial problems meant they were liquidated and reformed.

After the First World War he arranged for the club's promotion back to the First Division, in controversial circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Coon {{assumed the}} role of {{superintendent}} of shops in 1896. During his tenure at Georgia Tech, <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> curriculum away from vocational training.

5|$|Palmer {{gained an}} anti-settler {{reputation}} among immigrants, newspapers and officials, {{who said he}} acted too favorably toward the Indians, even though <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> tribes to reservations outside the Willamette Valley, seeking to avoid friction between settlers and natives by physical distance. In late 1855, while moving the Rogue River tribes to the Grand Ronde Reservation, violent resistance was threatened by settlers who felt the land should not {{be given to the}} tribes. Palmer succeeded, but the territorial legislature petitioned for his removal from office, which became effective in 1857.|$|E
5|$|Tensions eased when Beth Israel hired {{its first}} Rabbi, the Reverend L. Winter, in 1870. <b>He</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> {{congregation}} towards Reform Judaism, replacing Saturday services with Friday night ones, giving sermons in English, and adding confirmation ceremonies. However, Winter left soon afterward. Beth Israel's building burned down in 1874, {{and was replaced}} by a stone and brick building at the same location.

The last king of Ambohimanga, Andrianampoinimerina, successfully conquered Antananarivo in 1793; he reunited the provinces of Imerina, ending the civil war. <b>He</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> kingdom's political capital back to Antananarivo in 1794, and declared Ambohimanga the kingdom's spiritual capital, a role it still maintains. Andrianampoinimerina created a large marketplace in Analakely, establishing the city's economic center.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776, commander-in-chief General George Washington brought the Continental Army {{to defend the}} port city of New York, then limited to the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign, so he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack. In July, the British under the command of General William Howe landed a few miles across the harbor from Manhattan on the sparsely-populated Staten Island, where they were slowly reinforced by ships in Lower New York Bay during the next month and a half, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows, and <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> bulk of his forces to Manhattan, believing that {{it would be the first}} target.|$|E

5|$|Although Evans {{had led the}} {{kidnapping}} and torture {{of a black man}} while leader of the Dallas Klan, as Imperial Wizard he publicly discouraged vigilante actions, fearing that they would hinder his attempts to gain political influence. In 1923, Evans presided over the largest Klan gathering in history, attended by over 200,000, and endorsed several successful candidates in 1924 elections. <b>He</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> Klan's headquarters from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., and organized a march of 30,000 members—the largest march in the organization's history—on Pennsylvania Avenue. Evans' efforts notwithstanding, the Klan was buffeted by damaging publicity in the early 1920s, partially because of leadership struggles between Evans and his rivals, which hindered his political efforts. In the 1930s, the Great Depression significantly decreased the Klan's income, prompting Evans to work for a construction company to supplement his pay. He resigned his position with the Klan in 1939, after disavowing anti-Catholicism. He was succeeded by his chief of staff, James A. Colescott. The next year, Evans faced accusations of involvement in a government corruption scandal in Georgia; he was fined $15,000 after legal proceedings.|$|E
5|$|During Barry's career, he was {{credited}} with saving the lives of more than forty people, although this number has sometimes varied over the years.

The child survived and was returned to his parents, although other sources say that the boy's mother died in the avalanche that trapped the boy. The Museum of Natural History in Bern disputes the legend, attributing it to Peter Scheitlin, an animal psychologist.|$|E
5|$|Events {{leading up}} to the 1842 Battle of Salado Creek caused Houston to believe that Mexico was {{planning}} a full-scale invasion to re-take Texas.

Upon her later return, they temporarily lived with the Lockhart family at Washington-on-the-Brazos until they were able to acquire a small home there. The couple's first child Sam Houston Jr. was born in the new house on May 25, 1843. Upon learning of her son Martin's death in a duel, Nancy moved in with the Houstons, helping Margaret with the new baby, and over Houston's objections, pitching in with some financial assistance for food and household necessities.|$|E
