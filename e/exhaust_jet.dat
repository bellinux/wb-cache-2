40|$|The {{feasibility}} of simulating propulsion-induced aerodynamic effects on scaled aircraft models in wind tunnels employing Magnetic Suspension and Balance Systems. The investigation concerned itself with techniques of generating <b>exhaust</b> <b>jets</b> of appropriate characteristics. The objectives were to: (1) define thrust and mass flow requirements of jets; (2) evaluate techniques for generating propulsive gas within volume limitations imposed by magnetically-suspended models; (3) conduct simple diagnostic experiments for techniques involving new concepts; and (4) recommend experiments for demonstration of propulsion simulation techniques. Various techniques of generating <b>exhaust</b> <b>jets</b> of appropriate characteristics were evaluated on scaled aircraft models in wind tunnels with MSBS. Four concepts of remotely-operated propulsion simulators were examined. Three conceptual designs involving innovative adaptation of convenient technologies (compressed gas cylinders, liquid, and solid propellants) were developed.

The feasibility of generating <b>exhaust</b> <b>jets</b> of appropriate characteristics onboard magnetically suspended models was examined. Four concepts of remotely operated propulsion simulators was considered. Three conceptual designs involving conventional technologies such as compressed gas cylinders, liquid monopropellants, and solid propellants were developed.

50|$|Exhaust thrust in a {{turboprop}} is sacrificed {{in favor}} of shaft power, which is obtained by extracting additional power (up to that necessary to drive the compressor) from turbine expansion. Owing to the additional expansion in the turbine system, the residual energy in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>jet</b> is low. Consequently, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>jet</b> typically produces around or less than 10% of the total thrust. A higher proportion of the thrust comes from the propeller at low speeds and less at higher speeds. Turboprops can have bypass ratios up to 50-100 although the propulsion airflow is less clearly defined for propellers than for fans.|$|E

50|$|Afterburners do produce {{markedly}} enhanced thrust {{as well as}} {{a visible}} flame {{at the back of the}} engine.

50|$|The {{supersonic}} {{nature of}} the <b>exhaust</b> <b>jet</b> means that {{the pressure of the}} exhaust can be significantly different from ambient pressure - the outside air is unable to equalize the pressure upstream due to the very high jet velocity.
