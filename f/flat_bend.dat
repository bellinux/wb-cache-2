40|$|New {{gravity and}} {{magnetic}} data {{collected in the}} vicinity of Massachusetts Mountain and CP basin (Nevada Test Site, NV) provides a more complex view of the structural relationships present {{in the vicinity of}} CP basin than previous geologic models, helps define the position and extent of structures in southern Yucca Flat and CP basin, and better constrains the configuration of the basement structure separating CP basin and Frenchman Flat. The density and gravity modeling indicates that CP basin is a shallow, oval-shaped basin which trends north-northeast and contains ~ 800 m of basin-filling rocks and sediment at its deepest point in the northeast. CP basin is separated from the deeper Frenchman Flat basin by a subsurface ridge that may represent a Tertiary erosion surface {{at the top of the}} Paleozoic strata. The magnetic modeling indicates that the Cane Spring fault appears to merge with faults in northwest Massachusetts Mountain, rather than cut through to Yucca Flat basin and that the basin is downed-dropped relative to Massachusetts Mountain. The magnetic modeling indicates volcanic units within Yucca Flat basin are down-dropped on the west and supports the interpretations of Phelps and KcKee (1999). The magnetic data indicate that the only faults that appear to be through-going from Yucca Flat into either Frenchman Flat or CP basin are the faults that bound the CP hogback. In general, the north-trending faults present along the length of Yucca <b>Flat</b> <b>bend,</b> merge, and disappear before reaching CP hogback and Massachusetts Mountain or French Peak...|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of detailed topographic leveling {{on the southwest}} segment of the El Asnam thrust fault with existing seismic and geologic data implies that the geometry of this fault involves shallow dipping flats and steep ramps. The fault appears to be growing along strike toward the southwest end, where the main shock initiated in 1980. From a depth of about 10 km, the main thrust appears to ramp to the basement-Cenozoic cover interface on a plane striking N 40 °E and dipping 50 °– 55 ° to the northwest. Along the southwest segment where folding has not yet developed, the thrust continues steeply through the Cenozoic cover to the near surface where it flattens, causing normal faulting. Along the central and northeast segments, which display a more evolved fold structure, the deep thrust probably flattens {{at a depth of}} 5 – 6 km, into a decollement along the Cenozoic-Jurassic interface before ramping to the surface. The Sara El Marouf and Kef El Mes anticlines have thus formed as fault propagation folds. Normal faults at Beni Rached probably branch with the thrust to maintain kinematic compatibility between the deep ramp and decollement. The greater separation (∼ 7 km) between the normal faults at Beni Rached and the thrust where it crosses Oued Cheliff than along the southwest segment (∼ 1 km) reflects the greater depth of the ramp to <b>flat</b> <b>bend.</b> We infer that the September 9, 1954, earthquake activated only the central deep segment of the main thrust together with the Beni Rached normal faults, while that of October 10, 1980, activated the whole system of flat decollements, ramp thrusts and compatibility normal faults. Further complexities of the faulting in map view are related to changes of strike of the thrust (in particular north of Oued Cheliff) ...|$|E

The methods of segregating veneers quality were defined. The superior veneers were obtained by peeling the billets until their diameters left approximately 12 inches, meanwhile the inferior veneers were obtained by further peeling the same billets used for obtaining superior veneers until their diameters left 4 inches. The mean densities for superior veneer as well as inferior veneer were about 478. 8 kg/m 3 and 385. 1 kg/m 3 respectively.   The mean moisture content of both superior and inferior veneers was approximately 11 %. The veneers were arranged with 5 layers into three types of moulded shapes of furniture components namely i) 100 % S ii) alternate S and I and iii) surface S & core I. The suitable pressure, temperature and time were set as important parameters. The arrangements of veneer quality were pressed using V-shape mould through hot press machine with three parameters pressure 1500 psi, 2000 psi and 2500 psi.

40|$|International audienceIn this contribution, the {{formability}} of {{sheet metal}} cut edges is investigated using a damage model. Classical forming limit diagrams are known not to apply properly to the cut edges. However, with mild steels the sheet edges usually behave {{better than the}} Forming Limit Diagram predictions, so this phenomenon has not been given sufficient attention. In contrast, for Advanced High Strength Steels the cut edges exhibit reduced formability {{as compared to the}} plain sheet; this effect is very sensitive {{to the quality of the}} cutting process. The current investigation is aimed to evaluate the ability of available damage models to predict this effect on sample applications. The Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman model is used and the material parameters for a Dual Phase steel are considered [1]. The effect of the cutting process is described by means of initial fields of equivalent plastic strain and porosity. The geometrical distribution and typical values for these two initial fields are devised based on literature. Numerical simulations of flat notched tensile tests are used within the FE code Abaqus/Explicit to illustrate the impact of the initial fields on the moment and the location of the failure initiation. The influence of the mesh size in the cutting-affected area is also investigated.

40|$|In {{comparison}} to conventional heat treatments, laser beam hardening has some specific advantages. As {{a result of}} the locally limited heat input, the distortion of the material is essentially reduced. Because of the self-quenching process it is possible to abandon cooling agents and additionally laser hardening is well qualified for the integration in automated manufacturing systems. In the field of transformation hardening, Nd:YAG-lasers are superior to CO 2 -lasers due to higher energy impact into the material and their greater flexibility. By using pulsed mode, case hardness and case hardening depth are increased. The material is exposed to a rapid thermal cycling during the pulsed laser treatment. The aim of the examinations are the description of the microstructure, the distribution of hardness and residual stress and the resulting fatigue limit in dependence on the laser parameters. On <b>flat</b> <b>bending</b> 42 CrMo 4 specimens single tracks in longitudinal direction were locally hardened with various laser parameters. The laser pulse frequency was varied between 12. 5 Hz and 100 Hz. It has been found, that surface melting causes high roughness, high tensile stresses over the whole track surface and has a detrimental effect on the fatigue limit.

Using frequencies of 2500 Hz for the frame and 28 kHz for the mirror full color laser projection systems have been developed. Multiple Lissajous patterns are needed for the generation of one picture. Thus efficiency and frame rate are limited. Recently, a new approach has been invented: still a resonantly moving mirror {{is used for the}} fast movement but the frame is driven by a quasi-static drive. Among the several driving mechanisms possible the piezoelec. drive is the most promising. By choosing appropriate piezoelec. materials MEMS process integration is feasible. Besides a quasi-static deviation to generate pictures further options arise. The picture generation algorithm can be simplified if the movement along the rows is stepwise and the movement back is one fast step. This saw tooth like motion could be achieved through the high frequency response of piezoelec. materials. The setup of the chip is similar to the existing 2 d scanning mirrors: Inside the mirror with an area of 0. 25 to 9 mm 2 is mounted on two spring bearings to the frame and resonantly driven through comb structures.

Owing to extremely anharmonic XCN bending modes, the a-type rotational spectra of the halofulminates BrCNO and ClCNO exhibited very unusual patterns, whereas the low-lying CCN bending mode of cyanofulminate NCCNO appeared {{to be close to}} a harmonic bending mode of a linear molecule. This has been confirmed by a rovibrational spectrum of the CCN band system in the far infrared. The data for NCCNO have been analyzed with a linear molecule type hamiltonian, resulting in precise term values for the first to the fifth excited state of the CCN bending mode. The fundamental transition wavenumber has been determined to be 80. 5242 cm- 1. From semirigid bender analyses, effective barriers to linearity of 131 cm- 1 for BrCNO and 167 cm- 1 for ClCNO have been obtained.
