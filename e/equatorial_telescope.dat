2500|$|The {{observatory}} is a sandstone {{building in}} the Italianate style. [...] There are two telescope domes on octagonal bases and a four-storey tower for the time-ball. [...] The 1858 building designed by the Colonial Architect, Alexander Dawson, comprised a dome to house the <b>equatorial</b> <b>telescope,</b> a room with long, narrow windows for the transit telescope, an office for calculations, and a residence for the astronomer. A western wing was added in 1877 with office and library space and a second dome for another telescope. [...] Some of the first astronomical photographs of the southern sky were taken at the observatory, {{under the direction of}} Henry Chamberlain Russell. [...] The observatory also took part in the compilation of the first atlas of the whole sky, The astrographic catalogue. [...] The part completed at Sydney took over 70 years, from 1899 to 1971, and filled 53 volumes.|$|E
2500|$|Thorp was a [...] "scientific and {{mechanical}} genius". In pursuit {{of his childhood}} interest in astronomy, he developed considerable skills {{in the manufacture of}} optical glass and both reflector and refractor telescopes. He also created celluloid diffraction grating replicas, polarising solar eyepieces and prominence spectroscopes that were widely used, as well as objective prisms. His high resolution diffracting grating replicas were significant advances of the ideas developed by Henry Rowland, whilst his multi-slit spectroscope was the first to enable the showing of both celestial and terrestrial objects and has formed the basis for the present day spectrohelioscope. Father Aloysius Cortie, of Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, was one whom achieved good results from an example of the objective prisms. Eventually owning houses in Whitefield and also in Prestatyn, North Wales, he constructed observatories at each of these and favoured the [...] Cooke <b>equatorial</b> <b>telescope</b> for his own observations. This device was fitted with a photo-visual objective, a spectroscope and other attachments that enabled it to be used for photography.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} in England {{the news}} of Le Verrier's June prediction, George Airy immediately recognized the similarity of Le Verrier's and Adams' solutions. Up until that moment, Adams' work had been {{little more than a}} curiosity, but independent confirmation from Le Verrier spurred Airy to organize a secret attempt to find the planet. At a July 1846 meeting of the Board of Visitors of the Greenwich Observatory, with Challis and Sir John Herschel present, Airy suggested that Challis urgently look for the planet with the Cambridge 11.25inch <b>equatorial</b> <b>telescope,</b> [...] "in the hope of rescuing the matter from a state which is ... almost desperate". [...] The search was begun by a laborious method on 29 July. Adams continued to work on the problem, providing the British team with six solutions in 1845 and 1846 [...] which sent Challis searching the wrong part of the sky. Only after the discovery of Neptune had been announced in Paris and Berlin did it become apparent that Neptune had been observed on August 8 and August 12 but because Challis lacked an up-to-date star-map, it was not recognized as a planet.|$|E

5000|$|Astrophotography {{requires}} {{very long}} exposure times (sometimes {{an hour or}} more) to record faint objects on a photographic plate. Long exposure could also record objects invisible to the human eye. Isaac Roberts developed a technique of [...] "piggyback" [...] astronomical photography, mounting the camera/lens on a larger <b>equatorial</b> mounted <b>telescope</b> that {{was used as a}} [...] "guidescope".

50|$|In {{some cases}} an {{observatory}} {{would move to}} a new location, or the <b>equatorial</b> <b>telescope</b> itself would be removed.

50|$|James Townsend {{was one of}} the Canterbury Pilgrims, having {{arrived on}} the Cressy in December 1850. In his retirement, he lived on Park Terrace, just north of the site of the Canterbury College.

5000|$|During the 1800s, conical pendulums {{were used}} as the {{timekeeping}} element in a few clockwork timing mechanisms where a smooth motion was required, {{as opposed to the}} unavoidably jerky motion provided by ordinary pendulums. [...] Two examples were mechanisms to turn the lenses of lighthouses to sweep their beams across the sea, and the location drives of <b>equatorial</b> mount <b>telescopes,</b> to allow the telescope to follow a star smoothly across the sky as the Earth turns.|$|R
25|$|The Natal Observatory was {{initially}} {{equipped with a}} 200mm Grubb <b>equatorial</b> refracting <b>telescope</b> donated by the Natal lawyer and politician Harry Escombe, a 75mm Troughton & Simms transit instrument, a clock by Dent keeping sidereal time, and some precision clocks and other minor instruments. A mean time clock by Victor Kullberg was added in 1892 and a 75mm portable equatorial refractor in 1896. In December 1883 meteorological instruments were received from England and regular meteorological observations initiated at the observatory. Instruments to measure magnetic declination arrived in 1892.|$|R
50|$|For an <b>equatorial</b> GoTo <b>telescope</b> mount, {{the user}} must align the mount by hand {{with either the}} north {{celestial}} pole or the south celestial pole. Assuming the user is accurate in the alignment, the mount points the telescope to a bright star, asking the user to center it in the eyepiece. Since the star's correct right ascension and declination is already known, the distance from what the user {{considered to be the}} celestial pole and the actual pole can be roughly deduced. Using another alignment star can further improve the accuracy of the alignment.|$|R
50|$|Several of the telescopes remain but {{the largest}} telescope, the 100 inch (254 cm) {{aperture}} Isaac Newton Telescope {{was moved to}} La Palma, Canary Islands in the 1970s. The estate provides housing to the <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Telescope</b> Buildings, which have been converted to an interactive science centre for schoolchildren. The empty dome for the Newton Telescope remains on this site and is a landmark, visible from afar.|$|E
50|$|The Crawford Observatory is a 19th-century {{observatory}} {{located on}} the campus of University College Cork, Ireland. Built in 1878, the observatory contains three instruments; a Thomas Grubb <b>equatorial</b> <b>telescope,</b> a transit telescope and a siderostatic telescope. The construction of the observatory and the purchase of telescopes was funded in part by a £1,000 donation from William Crawford, of the Beamish and Crawford brewing company.|$|E
5000|$|In 1795 he {{delivered}} the Troughton <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Telescope</b> to the Armagh Observatory, a 2 inch aperture refractor telescope mounted equatorially, and its first major instrument {{since its founding}} in 1790 (It survived into the 21st century also).
