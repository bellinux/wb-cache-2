40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of ethanol and two nitric oxide dose applications on {{the maintenance of the}} post-storage quality of ‘Galaxy’ apple during storage under controlled atmosphere (CA). Treatments evaluated were: [1] 1. 2 kPa O 2 + 2. 0 kPa CO 2; [2] CA + 20 µL L- 1 of nitric oxide, [3] CA + 40 µL L- 1 of nitric oxide; [4] CA + 1 ml of ethanol kg- 1 fruit. Fruits received treatments before storage and were kept under CA during eight months and seven days of storage at 20 °C. Fruits had been kept on CA for eight months and seven days at 20 ° C. Fruits treated with ethanol showed higher ethylene production, low flesh firmness, high <b>flesh</b> <b>breakdown,</b> mealiness and acetaldehyde production. Fruits treated with 40 µL L- 1 nitric oxide showed lower ethylene production, respiration rate and ACC oxidase ((1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid) oxidase enzyme activity. Apples treated with 20 uL L- 1 nitric oxide showed higher ethylene production, respiration rate, internal ethylene concentration CO 2 and ethanol concentration. Ethanol and nitric oxide application before storage have no benefits in maintaining fruit quality after storage under CA due to lower flesh firmness, higher mealiness incidence, <b>flesh</b> <b>breakdown</b> and decay incidence...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} carried out aiming to {{evaluate}} the effect of thidiazuron (TDZ) {{on the quality of}} 'Gala' apples stored under controlled atmosphere (CA) conditions. Plants were sprayed at full bloom with TDZ at 0, 10, 20, or 40 g ha- 1 (a. i.). Harvested fruits were then stored in CA with 1. 0 + 2. 5, 1. 5 + 2. 5 and 1. 5 + 5. 0 (kPa O 2 +kPa CO 2), both at 0. 5 °C. In addition, the partial pressure of 1. 5 kPa of O 2 + 2. 5 kPa of CO 2 was also evaluated at - 0. 5 °C. Higher flesh firmness and titratable acidity was obtained by applying 20 or 40 g ha- 1 TDZ. Furthermore, these TDZ doses decreased the respiration rate as well as the occurrence of <b>flesh</b> <b>breakdown,</b> mealiness and decay. The application of TDZ at doses ranging from 20 to 40 g ha- 1 maintains higher fruit quality for up to 8 months under CA. In addition, the storage of 'Gala' apples under CA with 1. 0 kPa O 2 + 2. 5 kPa CO 2 at 0. 5 °C results in higher flesh firmness and titratable acidity. Moreover, this CA condition reduces the incidence of <b>flesh</b> <b>breakdown,</b> mealiness and postharvest decay in 'Gala' apple fruits...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on quality attributes and shelf life performance of 'Friar' plums (Prunus salicina) was studied. Plums were stored at 0 °C and 85 % relative humidity for a 60 -day period in five different box liners (LifeSpan L 316, FF- 602, FF- 504, 2. 0 % vented area perforated, and Hefty liner) and untreated (control). Flesh firmness, soluble solids concentration, titratable acidity, and pH were {{unaffected by the}} box liners. Fruit skin color changes were repressed on plums packed in box liners that modified gas levels and weight loss was reduced {{by the use of}} any of the box liners. Plums packed without box liners (bulk-packed) had ≈ 6 % weight loss. High carbon dioxide (CO 2) and low oxygen (O 2) levels were measured in boxes with MAP box liners (LifeSpan L 316, FF- 602, and FF- 504). Percentage of healthy fruit was unaffected by any of the treatments during the ripening period (shelf life) after 45 days of cold storage. However, after 60 days of cold storage, fruit from the MAP box liners with higher CO 2 and lower O 2 levels had a higher incidence of chilling injury (CI) symptoms, evident as <b>flesh</b> translucency, gel <b>breakdown,</b> and >off flavor> than fruit from the other treatments. Overall, results indicate that the use of MAP box liners is recommended to improve market life of 'Friar' plums up to 45 days cold storage. However, the use of box liners without gas control capability may lead to CI symptoms in fruit cold-stored for longer periods. We acknowledge financial support from Kool Kountry and Sun World.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} how preharvest calcium (Ca) and nitrogen (N) nutrition, and low crop load during fruit development affect fruit quality and postharvest disease of Keitt mangoes (Mangifera indica L). Calcium, N and crop load were chosen because previous research and Gower reports implicate them as major factors in internal disorders, poor colour development, and postharvest disease in mangoes grown in the Mareeba district of Queensland. The symptoms and incidence of the internal fruit disorders seen in Keitt mangoes growing in Queensland were investigated to determine their similarity {{to other forms of}} internal disorders, and to develop a severity rating scale to assess fruit in later experiments. While the observed disorder in Keitt shared some symptoms with other named forms of disorders, not all symptoms were similar. The typical symptoms of patches of watery translucent <b>flesh</b> that <b>breakdown</b> and discharge cellular fluids in the more severe cases, are referred to as watery-pulp breakdown throughout this thesis. Watery-pulp breakdown-affected fruit had lower mesocarp Ca concentrations (0. 05 % dw) than healthy fruit (0. 10 % dw), but not N, K, P, and Mg concentrations. The severity of symptoms increased as maturity of the fruit increased, and early harvest may be a useful strategy to minimise the disorder. The first nutrition experiment investigated the effects of Ca, N and crop load on fruit quality in 6 -year-old Keitt trees, between 1997 and 2000. Trees were fertilised with high (> 1 kg Ca tree- 1 and > 300 g N tree- 1) or nil concentrations of Ca and N, and natural or 70 %-reduced crop loads. Fruit were assessed for watery-pulp breakdown, fruit colour, postharvest disease, fruit firmness, yield and average fruit weight. Although Ca was applied above the normal industry rates, there were no significant increases in fruit-Ca or leaf- Ca concentrations, or response in any of the fruit quality parameters measured. The factors influencing Ca concentrations in mesocarp were shown to be changes in dry matter accumulation and periodic reductions in Ca supply. Fruit from the high N treatment had significantly (p < 0. 05) greater incidence and severity of postharvest side disease lesions (mainly anthracnose) but not stem lesions (mainly stem-end rot). The high N treatments also significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced the percentage of yellow skin, and the percentage and intensity of red blush colour in ripe fruit. Watery-pulp breakdown, fruit firmness and average fruit weight were not significantly affected by the high N treatments. Reducing the crop load throughout fruit development significantly (p< 0. 05) increased the average fruit weights and the incidence of watery-pulp breakdown, but did not significantly affect the other fruit quality parameters measured. Further studies on Ca uptake and distribution were carried out in 3 additional experiments. The effects of Ca supply on fruit quality were investigated in a similar manner to the first experiment, by varying soil-applied Ca. Increased rates (1726 g tree- 1 Ca) and more frequent applications (fortnightly) of gypsum were used to overcome leaching. Although soil Ca concentrations at harvest (0 - 30 cm deep) were increased by the Ca treatment, no significant effects were observed on fruit quality. The effect of leaf transpiration on leaf and fruit Ca concentrations was investigated by reducing leaf transpiration with an anti-transpirant throughout flowering and fruit development. Reduced leaf transpiration did not significantly affect mesocarp or leaf Ca, N, P, Mg, K, B concentrations, indicating the balance of transpiration mass flow between leaves and fruit is not a major factor in mango fruit Ca accumulation. Temporal changes in uptake and distribution of Ca during flowering and fruit development were studied using elemental strontium (Sr) as a Ca analogue. Sr and Ca concentrations were not similar during the experiment making prediction of Ca uptake and distribution based on Sr uptake and partitioning unsuitable. The effect of high N in increasing postharvest fruit disease in the first experiment was further studied to confirm the earlier results and to identify the mechanisms involved in this relationship. Fruit with a range of N concentrations were produced from trees fertilised with a range of N rates (0  417 g tree- 1). The incidence and severity of postharvest anthracnose (C. gloeosporioides) increased as fruit-N increased, with significant relationships between anthracnose severity and exocarp-N concentration (anthracnose severity in sprung fruit = 163. 18 x 2  151. 85 x + 36. 987, r 2 = 0. 97 **). High N had a similar effect on the incidence of Penicillium sp., Rhizopus sp., Guibnardia sp., or Epicoccum sp., but not Dothiorella sp. (stem-end rot). The antifungal compounds 5 -n-pentadecyl resorcinol and 5 -n-heptadecenyl resorcinol were influenced by exocarp-N in two ways. Resorcinol concentrations were lower in fruit with high exocarp-N than low-N fruit, and concentrations decreased faster in ripening fruit with high exocarp-N. The differences in resorcinol concentrations between high- and low-N fruit was strongest in the sprung stage of ripeness, and positive exponential relationships were found between exocarp-N and concentrations of 5 -n-pentadecyl resorcinol (p= 0. 006. r 2 = 0. 92) and 5 -n-heptadecenyl resorcinol (p= 0. 016, r 2 = 0. 82). There were also positive relationships between anthracnose severity and 5 -n-pentadecyl resorcinol (p= 0. 003, r 2 = 0. 86) and 5 -n-heptadecenyl resorcinol (p= 0. 003, r 2 = 0. 87). No significant differences were observed in exocarp morphology to explain the N effect on postharvest disease incidence or severity. The effect of timing of application of N on fruit quality and disease was investigated in a field experiment on 8 -year-old Keitt mango trees on which N was applied at flowering, at mid fruit development, 2 weeks pre-harvest, or not applied (control). N applied at flowering and mid fruit development, significantly increased the severity of postharvest Colletotrichum sp. (p< 0. 05) Penicillium sp., Rhizopus sp., Guibnardia sp., and Epicoccum sp. (p< 0. 01) in ripe fruit. N applied 2 weeks prior to harvest did not significantly affect postharvest diseases, with fruit having similar anthracnose severity and incidence to the nil-N (control) treatment. Fruit Ca concentrations were not able to be manipulated by imposing field treatments. The inability to easily manipulate fruit Ca concentrations indicates it is unlikely to be an effective tool to manipulate fruit quality in mango. Nitrogen was shown to greatly influence fruit quality, having a major influence on postharvest disease, skin colour and sunburn susceptibility, but not watery-pulp breakdown. Increased N was also shown to reduce concentrations of natural antifungal resorcinol compounds as fruit ripened, making fruit more susceptible to postharvest rots. The sensitivity of fruit quality to N makes management of N a critical tool in managing fruit quality and disease susceptibility. Reduced crop load had a major effect on the incidence and severity of watery-pulp breakdown, indicating tree management practices to maximise crop load will also reduce the severity of watery-pulp breakdown...|$|R

The respiratory quotient (RQ) was monitored at two temperatures which were then compared using a commercially available technology based on chlorophyll fluorescence DCA (DCA-CF) and static CA. Ethylene production and respiration rates were lower in apples stored in DCA than in CA, as a result of lower 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate oxidase activity, especially in apples stored in DCA-RQ 2. Flesh firmness of apples stored in DCA did not differ from those stored in CA.

40|$|Aroma {{and texture}} {{are known to}} {{influence}} the overall perception of apple flavour and are subconsciously evaluated by consumers during consumption. Aroma {{is derived from the}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released from the apple both before (orthonasal) and during consumption (retronasal). The degree to which the VOC impacts upon the flavour profile is affected by the mechanical breakdown of the apple flesh during mastication. The characteristics of apple texture, microstructure and breakdown are cultivar specific. This thesis aimed to understand the cultivar specific differences of apple texture, microstructure and VOC release in relation to their role in overall flavour perception and to explore the correlations between sensory derived attributes and instrumental derived parameters. In vitro (orthonasal) and in vivo (retronasal) measurements of VOC release were carried out using either a proton transfer reaction quadrupole mass spectrometer (PTR-QUAD-MS) or a proton transfer reaction time of flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). Both instrumental techniques separated cultivars based on their in vitro headspace volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles of either intact or cut apple portions. However, PTR-ToF-MS was found to be superior to PTR-QUAD-MS due to its higher sensitivity. The in vivo nosespace method involving the measurements of dynamic VOC release from the nasal cavity, during swallowing as panellists consumed apple portions, resulted in improved data and temporal resolution, as well as {{an increase in the number}} of detectable nosespace VOCs when the PTR-ToF-MS was used. Ester related VOCs were predominantly detected in the in vivo nosespace measurements followed by carbonyl and alcohol related compounds. Measured nosespace parameters showed potential for use in understanding differences in the mechanical breakdown of apple flesh during mastication; with for example juicy cultivars inducing a faster time to first swallow (Tswal). Panellists also displayed longer consumption times (Tcon) when consuming firm samples, as opposed to softer cultivars. In a preliminary study using the PTR-QUAD-MS, the time to maximum VOC intensity (Tmax) was found to be shorter for soft apple flesh owing to their faster breakdown during mastication and their resulting increase in surface area. However, the PTR-ToF-MS study which used more cultivars suggested that Tmax could also be shorter for firm juicy cultivars, owing to the occurrence of more swallowing events during mastication as juice was released. The feasibility of being able to differentiate between cultivars using solely instrumental techniques was investigated by comparing instrumentally derived results to those gained from descriptive sensory analysis. Sensory odour/ flavour data was compared to VOC profiles obtained from the PTR-ToF-MS, while sensory texture was compared to mechanical and acoustic textural parameters. Both analytical and sensory techniques characterised the cultivars similarly, indicating the potential of solely instrumental techniques to separate apple cultivars based on their VOC profiles and textural properties. Different VOC groups (terpenes; esters and their associated fragments; butanoate esters) were associated to specific sensory attributes. For example, butanoate esters (m/z 103, 117, 131) were positively correlated to lemon flavour and odour whereas hexyl acetate (m/z 145) was positively correlated to overall apple odour signifying its importance towards base apple flavour. Physico-chemical properties such as titratable acidity (TA) were positively correlated to sour taste which could be considered in prediction models. Sweet taste was negatively correlated to TA but was not correlated to soluble solids content (SSC). However, a positive correlation between sweet taste and fruity ester related compounds (m/z 43, 61, 145) was observed indicating a possible aroma-taste interaction. Instrumentally derived texture parameters were well correlated to sensory descriptions. However, the former also provided additional information that could differentiate between cultivars that were firm but not crunchy. As the behaviour of apple <b>flesh</b> <b>breakdown</b> during mastication was shown to affect perceived texture, X-ray micro-computer tomographic (μ-CT) scanning was used to investigate microstructural differences that could affect apple texture. Morphological properties of apple parenchyma such as connectivity and porosity were associated with VOC release, whereas anisotropy was associated with firm texture. Porosity was negatively correlated to firm texture however, this was cultivar specific owing to the fact that porosity is a summation of all intercellular spaces within a volume; it does not take into account the variation in size and distribution which has been shown to affect texture. The use of an ethylene inhibitor, 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) retained the apple texture at a cost of lower VOC emission. However, its efficacy favoured cultivars of high ethylene concentration (Golden Delicious) as opposed to low ethylene emitting cultivars (Fuji). Therefore, it is important to understand the effects of 1 -MCP on specific cultivars. This study demonstrated the viable use of PTR-MS and texture measurements to understand the interrelationships between texture and aroma release during consumption. These techniques were shown to characterise apple cultivars similarly to sensory measurements. Moreover, μ-CT scanning proved to be a powerful tool to visualise the role of microstructure in mechanical texture. Overall, these analyses showed that apple cultivars are distinctly different and suggest that such information could be used to compile a database of phenotypes, such as the cultivar specific VOC and texture characteristics. This database could be used as a reference to create high quality apples through careful selection of specific traits in order to create customised apples targeted towards consumer specific needs...|$|E
