5|$|The Tank Corps {{was formed}} as the <b>Heavy</b> <b>Section</b> Machine Gun Corps in 1916. Tanks {{were used for}} the first time in action in the battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916. The {{intention}} being that they would crush the barbed wire for the infantry, then cross the trenches and exploit any breakthrough behind the German lines. In November 1916, they were renamed the Heavy Branch MGC and in June 1917, the Tank Corps.|$|E
5|$|In November 1940, the LRP was reorganised and re-designated the Long Range Desert Group. It was {{expanded}} to six Patrols: 'T','W' and 'R' Patrols {{were joined by}} 'G', 'S' and 'Y' Patrols. Each patrol was expected {{to belong to the}} same regimental group, but only the Brigade of Guards and the Yeomanry regiments formed their own Patrols, 'G' and 'Y' respectively. The men of 'G' Patrol were drawn from the 3rd Battalion Coldstream Guards and the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards under command of Captain Michael Crichton-Stuart. The 'Y' Patrol men were drawn from the Nottinghamshire Yeomanry under command Captain P. J. D. McCraith, with additional men from the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In December 1940, 'W' Patrol was disbanded and its personnel used to bring 'R' and 'T' Patrols up to strength, while 'G' Patrol took over their vehicles. By June 1941 the LRDG was re-organised into two squadrons: the New Zealand and Rhodesian 'A' Squadron with 'S', 'T' and 'R' Patrols, and 'B' Squadron with 'G', 'H' and 'Y' Patrols. There was also a Headquarters Section along with signals, survey and light repair sections. A <b>Heavy</b> <b>section,</b> initially equipped with four 6-ton Marmon-Herrington trucks, was used to provide logistical support by transporting supplies to bases and setting up hidden replenishment points at pre-arranged locations. In addition, there was an Air Section, using Waco ZGC-7 and YKC biplanes that transported key personnel, evacuated wounded and performed other liaison tasks.|$|E
500|$|The LRP could {{initially}} form {{only three}} units, known as patrols, but {{a doubling of}} strength allowed {{the addition of a}} new <b>Heavy</b> <b>Section.</b> In November 1940, the name of the LRP was changed to the [...] "Long Range Desert Group" [...] (LRDG), and the New Zealanders were joined by volunteers from British and Southern Rhodesian regiments. The British volunteers, who came mostly from the Brigade of Guards and Yeomanry regiments, were incorporated into their own patrols. The original patrol unit consisted of two officers and 28 other ranks, equipped with a Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) Ford 15 Imperial hundredweight (cwt) truck and 10 Chevrolet 30 cwt trucks. In March 1941 new types of trucks were issued and the patrol units were split into half-patrols of one officer and 15â€“18 men in five or six vehicles. Each patrol incorporated a medical orderly, a navigator, a radio operator and a vehicle mechanic, each of whom manned a truck equipped for their role.|$|E

The 44th Brigade was {{to be held in}} reserve and four tanks of D Company, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Section,</b> Machine Gun Corps were to assist the infantry. To maintain secrecy, aircraft were arranged to fly over the German lines again, to drown the sound of the tank engines as they moved into position.

40|$|Realistic truss design {{optimization}} problems are often governed by practical constraints. Because {{of the complexity}} of these constraints, usually only member constraints are taken into account during the optimization, and joint constraints are accounted for in a manual postprocessing step. This paper proposes a method to account for joint constraints in the global discrete size optimization of a steel truss structure. The design of an N-type truss girder is considered first without and then with the joint constraints specified in the Eurocode. To guarantee global optimality in both cases, the optimization problem is reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program. A statically determinate analysis model is adopted so as to ensure that all joint constraints can be reformulated as linear functions. If the joint constraints are not considered in the optimization, a design is obtained where the joints need additional strengthening. This can be done by manually selecting <b>heavier</b> <b>sections,</b> which often leads to a suboptimal result, or by strengthening the joints (e. g., by means of stiffening plates), which has a serious effect on the fabrication cost. If the joint constraints are considered in the optimization, they are automatically satisfied by the final design. The weight of this design is about 15 % higher than in the first case. This shows that the joint constraints {{have a significant effect on}} the optimal design. If the joint constraints are accounted for in a suboptimal way (e. g., by manually selecting <b>heavier</b> <b>sections),</b> the additional weight may be even higher. Taking into account joint constraints in the optimization leads to a cost reduction at two levels: in terms of engineering cost (no manual postprocessing step is needed) and fabrication cost (using unnecessarily <b>heavy</b> <b>sections</b> and joint strengthening are avoided). status: publishe...|$|R
