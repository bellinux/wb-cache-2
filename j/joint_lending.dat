40|$|MM (P&DM) thesisThe Malawi {{government}} adopted microfinance with <b>Joint</b> <b>Lending</b> Liability (JLL) as {{an instrument}} of poverty alleviation especially in the rural areas where poverty is rampant. However, the government’s microfinance schemes are faced with the problem of high default rates despite incorporating JLL which seems to have enhanced repayment performance in other countries. The {{purpose of the study was}} to explore the perceptions of rural microfinance beneficiaries regarding the concept of JLL and how this affects loan repayment performance. The researcher undertook an exploratory qualitative research through in-depth interviews on a purposively selected sample of eight beneficiaries from Malawi Rural Development Fund (MARDEF) in Bvumbwe area of Thyolo district in Malawi. The study revealed that, rural microfinance beneficiaries in Malawi lack a proper understanding of the peer mechanism in JLL and this distorts their perception and behaviour as regards loan repayments. This stems from lack of proper education and training to the beneficiaries prior to loan disbursements. There is need for microfinance institutions to train and educate beneficiaries on the basic principles of JJL and how they relate to loan repayment performance in microfinance...|$|E

Critics blame the banking industryfor failing to meet the credit needs of poorer neighborhoods. Some claim that bankers pass up worthwhile lending opportunities because of racial or ethnic bias. Others argue that a market failure causes banks to restrain lending in low-income neighborhoods. They claim that <b>joint</b> <b>lending</b> efforts by many banks in such neighborhoods would be profitable, but no single bank is willing to bear the cost of being the pioneer. The central statute regulating the relationship between bank lending and neighborhoods, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA, or “the Act”), was inspired by the critics ’ view that banks discriminate against low-income communities. 1 The Act directs the bank regulatory agencies to assess {{the extent to which a}} bank meets “the credit needs of its entire community, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. ” In a similar spirit, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires depository institutions to disclose mortgage originations in metropolitan areas by census tract.

Defenders of the banking industry attribute the disparity in credit flows to differences in the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, information that i...|$|E
40|$|The Microcredit Self Help Group (SHG) {{programme}} in India is {{an important}} institutional device used to improve {{the status of women}} in India in terms of poverty reduction and women empowerment. The SHG is an effective strategy to provide financial services to poor women, who are excluded from accessing financial services, and offered micro credits for their income generating activities and other non-economic loans targeting improvement in the standards of living. The aim of this dissertation was to establish the extent to which women’s participation in SHGs and their involvement in the group activities improved their socio economic conditions. The objective was to study the socio economic status of women in the SHGs in urban areas by comparing the living conditions of the members before joining the programme and their conditions three years after the programme intervention. The programme intervention was expected to reduce the level of poverty and increase the empowerment of women in SHGs. This study confirms the theoretical premise of Micro Credit Paradigms such as Poverty, Financial Sustainability and Empowerment Paradigms and Theory of <b>Joint</b> <b>Lending</b> Liability. This study adds to the empirical evidence in the area of SHGs in an urban setting. Data was collected from the selected women in SHGs formed by government- funded, non-government organisation under the scheme of Mahalir Thittam in the city of Chennai in, Tamil Nadu. A three stage stratified random sampling techniques was adopted. The NGOs were selected as per the demographic region. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in the study. The focus of the quantitative study was to investigate whether there were significant differences in income, savings, assets, expenditure, basic amenities, as well as the attitudinal and behavioural changes in the women before and after the intervention of the SHG ii programme. This study used the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve to find the income inequality and the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to study the impact of micro credit in the SHG women. The qualitative part {{of the study was to}} gain deeper insights into some of the variables covered under the quantitative study. The quantitative and qualitative analysis helped to study the changes in the social background of the women in SHGs, their economic status and the financial sustainability of the SHGs. The findings showed that the social and economic status of the women members had improved and there was improvement in the level of income, expenditure and savings. The level of self-confidence and self-esteem of the women showed a positive change. The women were more assertive towards community and social matters. The study recommended that the government develop a strong mechanism to monitor the NGOs and SHG leaders (Animators) so that the funds provided by the government would benefit the poor women.

Various theories have arisen to explain why <b>joint</b> liability group-based <b>lending</b> can be an improvement over traditional individual-based lending. Here we exploit {{the idea that if}} a model were true, the repayment rate would vary in a systematic way with various covariates. We thus use observed repayment rates to test across four representative and oft-cited models of <b>joint</b> liability <b>lending.</b> The theoretical part of this paper develops the models' implications for repayment and derives new ones, signing the derivative of a project choice, monitoring, default, or selection equation. For example, we find that several models imply that higher correlation of output can raise the observed repayment rate, and in some the ability to act cooperatively leads to lower repayment rates. More generally, the models agree on some dimensions and conflict on others. The empirical part uses survey data from 262 Thai joint liability groups of the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) and from 2880 households of the same villages. Nonparametric, univariate tests and multivariate logits are used to evaluate the predictions of the models. A hybrid, partially linear procedure is used to understand any differences in the results between the two types of tests. We find that the Besley and Coate model of limited enforcement is strongly supported in the more rural, poorer region of Thailand covered by the data. In the more prosperous region, closer to Bangkok, support is found for the Stiglitz model of moral hazard and the Ghatak model of adverse selection.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} in the theoretical economic literature that <b>joint</b> liability group-based <b>lending</b> helps to overcome the hurdles of adverse selection, moral hazard, auditing cost and enforcement by exploiting local information embodied in specific social networks. Much less attention has been given to explain how other features of microcredit contracts have opened up possibilities for microfinance. In this paper I study a <b>joint</b> liability <b>lending</b> program in Thailand to analyze how social ties and policies such as compulsory savings and training contribute to explain the success of the program in terms of repayment rates in rural and urban communities. I use a novel panel dataset on household loans constructed from household, institutional and community-level data from the Townsend Thai Data Collection. Empirical results are consistent with the repayment predictions of existing theories on <b>joint</b> liability <b>lending.</b> The findings suggest that joint liability may prosper in areas in which social ties are strong enough to permit individuals to costlessly enforce agreements in their community, and the threat of social sanctions exists and is credible. Additionally, I find evidence that suggests that households in rural areas have some knowledge about the customs and characteristics of people and institutions in the region which varies across communities and predicts success and failure of the microfinance program. The estimation results also indicate that the degree of joint liability in the fund is negatively associated with repayment; and that practices such as requiring compulsory savings and providing training or information to borrowers are positive predictors of repayment in both rural and urban environments.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters that fall under the broad banner of contract theory, applied to topics in behavioral and development economics. Empirically, labor contracts that financially penalize failure induce higher effort provision than economically identical contracts presented as paying a bonus for success. This is puzzling, as penalties are infrequently used in practice. The most obvious explanation is selection: loss averse agents are unwilling to accept such contracts. In the first chapter, I formalize and experimentally test this intuition. Surprisingly, I find that workers were 25 {{percent more likely to}} accept penalty contracts, with no evidence of adverse selection. Penalty contracts also increased performance on the job by 0. 2 standard deviations. Finally, I outline extensions to the basic theory that are consistent with the main results. The second chapter analyzes the effect of market structure in microfinance on borrower welfare and the types of contracts used. We find that market power can have severe implications for borrower welfare, while despite information frictions, competition delivers similar borrower welfare to non-profit lending. We also find that for-profit lenders are less likely to use joint liability than non-profits, which is consistent with some empirical stylized facts suggesting a decline in use of joint liability. We simulate the model to evaluate quantitatively the importance of market structure for borrower welfare. The third chapter contrasts individual liability lending with and without groups to <b>joint</b> liability <b>lending,</b> motivated by an apparent shift away from <b>joint</b> liability <b>lending.</b> We show under what conditions individual liability can deliver welfare improvements over joint liability, conditions that depend on the joint income distribution and social capital.
