Vonnegut, in a later letter, suggested that [...] "Harrison Bergeron" [...] might have sprung from his envy and self-pity {{as a high school}} misfit.

Darryl Hattenhauer, in his 1998 journal article on [...] "Harrison Bergeron", theorized that the story was a satire on American Cold War misunderstandings of communism and socialism.|$|E

2500|$|Under CRTC rules, American {{networks}} are offered on a [...] "4 + 1" [...] basis, meaning that a cable company may offer any four American commercial networks and PBS on basic cable; other American networks {{can only be}} offered on a pay tier. In most cities, this means that The CW and MyNetwork TV are not available on basic cable because of lower demand for those networks. However, cable providers in border cities {{have been allowed to}} offer all American networks on basic cable that are available over the air in that market, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> more than four commercial {{networks are}} provided.

2500|$|When {{all of a}} player's {{checkers}} are in that player's home board, that player {{may start}} removing them; this is called [...] "bearing off". A roll of 1 {{may be used to}} bear off a checker from the 1-point, a 2 from the 2-point, and so on. If all of a player's checkers are on points lower than the number showing on a particular die, the player may use that die to bear off one checker from the highest occupied point. For example, if a player rolls a 6 and a 5, but has no checkers on the 6-point and two on the 5-point, then the 6 and the 5 must be used to bear off the two checkers from the 5-point. When bearing off, a player may also move a lower die roll before the higher <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> the full value of the higher die is not fully utilized. For example, if a player has exactly one checker remaining on the 6-point, and rolls a 6 and a 1, the player may move the 6-point checker one place to the 5-point with the lower die roll of 1, and then bear that checker off the 5-point using the die roll of 6; this is sometimes useful tactically. As before, if {{there is a way to}} use all moves showing on the dice, by moving checkers within the home board or bearing them off, the player must do so.|$|E
