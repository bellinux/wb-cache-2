40|$|Nowadays, the {{existence}} of aluminum in human diet as a food contaminant has attracted the concerns of many researchers. It seems that the <b>cooking</b> <b>pans</b> are common sources of aluminum exposure through foodstuffs in Iran. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the migration of aluminum from cooking containers into foodstuffs. For this purpose, solutions with different concentrations of citric acid, sodium chloride, fat, protein and sugar were prepared and migration of aluminum into these solutions was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry. Results showed that salt and citric acid concentrations could enhance aluminum migration; whereas, acid concentration was more effective than salt due to its corrosive effect. The intensity of heat processing and the duration of heat treatment had direct relation with aluminum migration. The aluminum content of cooked foods in aluminum <b>cooking</b> <b>pans</b> was also significantly more than control samples...|$|R

50|$|It is {{here where}} John {{inquires}} {{as to how}} the ice-nine came into Papa Monzano's possession. The Hoenikkers explain that when they were young, their father would riddle them with the concept of ice-nine. One day, they find their father has died taking a break from freezing and unfreezing ice-nine to test its properties. With the sweep of a cloth, Frank Hoenikker collects residual amounts of ice-nine from a <b>cooking</b> <b>pan,</b> as was the various collection and examination methods of their father when creating the substance. A dog licks the cloth and also instantly freezes. Witnessing this, the young Hoenikkers finally deduce the properties of ice-nine. They collectively cannot determine who had what part in gathering the ice-nine, but chunks of the substance were chipped from the <b>cooking</b> <b>pan</b> supply and placed in mason jars then later in thermoses. The Hoenikkers explain that this is how they had become fortunate throughout their lives, each one selling off the substance to various buyers.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{conventional}} kitchen stoves, glass-ceramic cooktops are relatively simple to clean, {{due to their}} flat surface. However, glass-ceramic cooktops can be scratched very easily, so {{care must be taken}} not to slide the <b>cooking</b> <b>pans</b> over the surface. If food with a high sugar content (such as jam) spills, it should never be allowed to dry on the surface, otherwise damage will occur.|$|R
50|$|A pan fry {{takes place}} at lower heat than does a sauté. This is because the food to be pan-fried, such as chicken breasts, steak, pork chops or fish fillets, is not {{cut into small pieces}} before <b>cooking.</b> <b>Pan</b> frying {{requires}} a lower heat so that the exterior of the food does not overcook until the interior reaches the proper temperature, and can keep foods in a moister state.|$|R

The Jin dynasty collapsed after the Mongols besieged and captured Caizhou in 1234, which suggests that the Heilongjiang hand-gun can reasonably be dated to the 13th century at the latest.|$|R

Frying pans were also known in ancient Greece where they were called tagēnon (Greek: τάγηνον) and Rome, where they were called patella or sartago. The word pan derives from the Old English panna.
