5000|$|The GSM {{cellular}} system combines {{the use of}} <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplex</b> (FDD) to prevent interference between outward and return signals, with FDMA and TDMA to allow multiple handsets {{to work in a}} single cell.|$|E
50|$|In radio systems, TDMA {{is usually}} used {{alongside}} Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and <b>Frequency</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplex</b> (FDD); the combination {{is referred to}} as FDMA/TDMA/FDD. This is the case in both GSM and IS-136 for example. Exceptions to this include the DECT and PHS micro-cellular systems, UMTS-TDD UMTS variant, and China's TD-SCDMA, which use time-division duplexing, where different time slots are allocated for the base station and handsets on the same frequency.|$|E
50|$|The {{multiple}} access methods used in GSM with GPRS {{are based on}} <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplex</b> (FDD) and TDMA. During a session, a user is assigned to one pair of up-link and down-link frequency channels. This is combined with time domain statistical multiplexing which {{makes it possible for}} several users to share the same frequency channel. The packets have constant length, corresponding to a GSM time slot. The down-link uses first-come first-served packet scheduling, while the up-link uses a scheme very similar to reservation ALOHA (R-ALOHA). This means that slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA) is used for reservation inquiries during a contention phase, and then the actual data is transferred using dynamic TDMA with first-come first-served.|$|E

30|$|The {{two layers}} in the IEEE 802.16 {{protocol}} stack are the physical layer, which transfers raw data, and the MAC layer, which supports the physical layer {{by ensuring that}} the radio resources are used efficiently. The three duplex modes in the physical layer with OFDMA are Time Division Duplex (TDD), <b>Frequency</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Duplex</b> (FDD), and Half-duplex <b>Frequency</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Duplex</b> (H-FDD). The TDD is the most attractive duplex mode because of its flexibility. In addition, the modulation methods, that is {{quadrature phase shift keying}} (QPSK), 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16 QAM), or 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (64 QAM), and the associated coding rate for data transmission are selected according to the channel quality, that is, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).|$|E

30|$|However, MCP {{comes at}} the cost of {{increased}} signaling and infrastructural overheads. On the downlink of cellular systems operating in <b>Frequency</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Duplexing</b> (FDD) mode, the overheads of MCP are related to the inherent need for Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitter of multiuser MIMO systems and also to the distributed nature of collaborative BS processing [5].

This metric has direct relevance to smart or adaptive antenna array base-station deployments in cellular networks, which are known to offer capacity enhancement when compared to fixed coverage solutions. In particular, the results presented were obtained from field trial measurement campaigns for both urban and rural scenarios, with the observations having {{a direct impact on}} the choice of down-link beamforming architecture in FDD applica-tions. Further, it is shown that significant spatial decorrelation can occur in urban deployments for bearer separations as small as 5 MHz. Results are presented in terms of both instantaneous characteristics as well as time averaged estimates, thus facilitating the appraisal of smart antenna solutions in both packet and circuit switched networks.

30|$|Coordinated multi‐point (CoMP) {{transmission}} {{has drawn}} broad attention recently [1, 2]. When all the coordinated base stations (BSs) share both data and channel information, coherent cooperative transmission, {{also known as}} joint transmission, can provide high spectral efficiency for cellular systems if the BSs can obtain high‐quality channels. This however requires large feedback overhead for <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplexing</b> (FDD) CoMP systems. Though CoMP has various forms, depending on the information shared among the BSs, we refer coherent cooperative transmission as CoMP {{in the rest of}} the paper for simplicity.|$|R
50|$|FDMA is {{distinct}} from <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplexing</b> (FDD). While FDMA allows multiple users simultaneous access to a transmission system, FDD refers to how the radio channel is shared between the uplink and downlink (for instance, the traffic {{going back and forth}} between a mobile-phone and a mobile phone base station). Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) is also distinct from FDMA. FDM is a physical layer technique that combines and transmits low-bandwidth channels through a high-bandwidth channel. FDMA, on the other hand, is an access method in the data link layer.|$|R

Considering that the available time and frequency resources are limited, those overheads might be a bottleneck for RRH cooperation in an FDD-based C-RAN where a large number of RRHs are deployed for user service. In [16, 17], RRH cooperation strategies are developed to reduce the overhead required for acquiring CSI at the CP.|$|R
