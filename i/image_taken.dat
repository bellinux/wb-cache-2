5|$|Fans gained {{national}} attention after giving a torrid time to David Beckham {{in his first}} away match of 1998–99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on Diego Simeone. Coinciding with the game, there were claims (and an <b>image</b> <b>taken)</b> that fans, organised by a hardcore, had hung an effigy of the player outside a local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in South-East London, the heartland of West Ham's greatest rivals Millwall. The West Ham fans did, however, boo Beckham's every touch of the ball during the game.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp's orbital {{position}} was calculated as 7.2astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and {{by far the}} greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show no discernible activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable coma. An <b>image</b> <b>taken</b> at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13AU from the Sun, a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable. (Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun.) Analysis indicated later that its comet nucleus was 60±20kilometres in diameter, approximately six {{times the size of}} Halley.|$|E
5|$|Part of the Milky Way's galactic plane {{passes through}} Serpens Cauda, which is {{therefore}} rich in galactic deep-sky objects, {{such as the}} Eagle Nebula (IC 4703) and its associated star cluster Messier 16.

Other striking objects include the Red Square Nebula, {{one of the few}} objects in astronomy to take on a square shape; and Westerhout 40, a massive nearby star-forming region consisting of a molecular cloud and an H II region.|$|E

5|$|Players have {{discovered}} that {{the cover of the}} North American Wii version of Ōkami includes a watermark from IGN, and traced the source to an <b>image</b> <b>taken</b> from IGN's site. To make up for the error, Capcom offered for a limited time to replace the cover with one of three high-resolution covers free of charge to users in North America. Because of delays in fulfilling the offer, Capcom shipped copies of all three covers to those that registered. They have since discontinued the offer, but have made the cover images available worldwide in high-quality PDF files for users to download and print themselves. The European PAL version of the cover has no such error.|$|E
5|$|In his 2011 book Satellittkrigen, Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation {{journalist}} Bård Wormdal {{argues that}} SvalSat {{is used for}} military intelligence and thus is violating the Svalbard Treaty. Specifically, Wormdal provides evidence that downloaded images of the earth are used for intelligence and military activities. For instance, a Landsat <b>image</b> <b>taken</b> during the Libyan Civil War was sold by the Italian company e-GEOS to the Italian Armed Forces. Similarly, a Technology Experiment Satellite image was sold to the United States Armed Forces during the War in Afghanistan and Arirang-2 images of North Korean installations have been sold to the United States. All three satellites use SvalSat {{as one of their}} ground stations. According to Governor Odd Olsen Ingerø, even if a military should indirectly use information downloaded from SvalSat, this would not be a breach of the treaty. A dissertation by Professor Geir Ulfstein concludes that even if a ground station was directly used for downloading military intelligence from military satellites, it would still be permitted by the treaty.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Viking metal scene {{believe that it is}} {{impossible}} for someone to be a Viking unless they themselves are of northern European descent. According to Trafford and Pluskowski, the members of practically all Viking metal bands claim Viking ancestry, and after its inception in Scandinavia, Viking metal spread to areas historically settled by Vikings, including England, Russia, and Normandy. Viking metal bands have even formed in the United States and Canada, with their members claiming Viking descent either directly from Scandinavia or through England. The scene also spread to other parts of Northern Europe in areas united by a common Germanic heritage, such as Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. For instance, the Austrian band Valhalla makes extensive use of Viking iconography, including horned helmets. Another Austrian example is Amestigon, which on the cover of its promotional album Remembering Ancient Origins depicts a wood carved scene of Sigurd killing Regin, an <b>image</b> <b>taken</b> from a panel held in Hylestad stave church.|$|E

5|$|The {{front of}} the single's US picture sleeve {{consisted}} of a photo of Harrison playing guitar inside the central tower of his recently purchased home, Friar Park, in Henley-on-Thames. The tower's sole, octagonal-shaped room was an area that Harrison had adopted as his personal temple and meditation space. This picture was taken by photographer Barry Feinstein, whose Camouflage Productions partner, Tom Wilkes, originally used {{it as part of}} an elaborate poster intended as an insert in the album package. The poster featured a painting of the Hindu deity Krishna watching a group of naked maidens beside a bathing pond. Harrison apparently felt uncomfortable with the symbolism in Wilkes's design – the Friar Park tower image filled {{the top half of the}} poster, floating among clouds above the Krishna scene – so Wilkes abandoned the concept and instead used a darkened photo of Harrison inside the house as the album poster. The more common picture sleeve internationally was a close-up of Feinstein's All Things Must Pass front-cover <b>image,</b> <b>taken</b> on the main lawn of Friar Park. In Denmark, the sleeve featured four shots of Harrison, again with guitar, taken on stage during the Delaney & Bonnie tour.|$|E

25|$|If the {{original}} image is enlarged {{to make the}} final image, the circle of confusion in {{the original}} image must be smaller than that in the final image by the ratio of enlargement. Cropping an image and enlarging to the same size final image as an uncropped <b>image</b> <b>taken</b> under the same conditions is equivalent to using a smaller format under the same conditions, so the cropped image has less DOF.

25|$|In 2011, {{around that}} same star, three exoplanets were {{rendered}} viewable in a NICMOS <b>image</b> <b>taken</b> in 1998, using advanced data processing.

The image allows the planets' orbits {{to be analyzed}} better, since they take many decades, even hundreds of Earth years to orbit their host star. In other words, the NICMOS image is especially useful because it is older.|$|E

500|$|The Impactor {{section of}} the {{spacecraft}} contains an instrument that is optically identical to the MRI, called the Impactor Targeting Sensor (ITS), but without the filter wheel. Its dual purpose was to sense the Impactor's trajectory, which could then be adjusted up to four times between release and impact, and to image the comet from close range. As the Impactor neared the comet's surface, this camera took high-resolution pictures of the nucleus (as good as [...] per pixel) that were transmitted in real-time to the Flyby spacecraft before it and the Impactor were destroyed. The final <b>image</b> <b>taken</b> by the impactor was snapped only 3.7 seconds before impact.|$|E

The video opens with a fast instance of a sun rising in the sky and moves to the girls standing nude together. Each singer is featured in her own desert scene performing individually during her respective verse; Beyoncé is seen on a diving board next to a swimming pool, Rowland on a deserted road where she dances next to a silver car from which she had previously got out of and Williams on a sunlounger. During the chorus the group members are seen wearing fishtail evening dresses, performing a choreographed dance routine for the camera and three males who watch them from the side; the men are never filmed in the same shot as Destiny's Child. During the end, each member is seen together with one of their male partners and the video fades away showing the trio nude again as during the beginning.|$|E
