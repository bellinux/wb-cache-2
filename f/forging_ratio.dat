With increasing hot <b>forging</b> <b>ratio,</b> thickness of the network and acicular proeutectoid cementite decreased, and than were broken up into particle shapes, when the <b>forging</b> <b>ratio</b> was 80 %, the network and acicular shape of the as-cast state disappeared. Interlamellar spacing and the thickness of eutectoid cementite decreased with increasing <b>forging</b> <b>ratio,</b> and were broken up into particle shapes, which then became spheroidized. With increasing hot <b>forging</b> <b>ratio,</b> hardness, tensile strength, elongation and impact value were not changed up 50 %, and then hardness rapidly decreased, while impact value rapidly increased. Hardness and impact value was greatly affected by the disappeared of network and acicular shape of proeutectoid cementite, and became particle shap...|$|E

40|$|Zr, Nb, and Ta as {{alloying}} elements for Ti alloys {{are important for}} attaining superior corrosion resistance and biocompatibility in the long term. However, note that the addition of excess Nb and Ta to Ti alloys leads to higher manufacturing cost. To develop low-cost manufacturing processes, the effects of hot-forging and continuous-hot-rolling conditions on the microstructure, mechanical properties, hot forgeability, and fatigue strength of Ti- 15 Zr- 4 Nb- 4 Ta alloy were investigated. The temperature dependences with a temperature difference (ΔT) from β-transus temperature (Tβ) for the volume fraction of the α- and β-phases were almost the same for both Ti- 15 Zr- 4 Nb- 4 Ta and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys. In the α-β-forged Ti- 15 Zr- 4 Nb- 4 Ta alloy, a fine granular α-phase structure containing a fine granular β-phase at grain boundaries of an equiaxed α-phase was observed. The Ti- 15 Zr- 4 Nb- 4 Ta alloy billet forged at Tβ-(30 to 50) °C exhibited high strength and excellent ductility. The effects of <b>forging</b> <b>ratio</b> on mechanical strength and ductility were small at a <b>forging</b> <b>ratio</b> of more than 3. The maximum strength (σmax) markedly increased with decreasing testing temperature below Tβ. The reduction in area (R. A.) value slowly decreased with decreasing testing temperature below Tβ. The temperature dependences of σmax for the Ti- 15 Zr- 4 Nb- 4 Ta and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys show the same tendency and might be caused by the temperature difference (ΔT) from Tβ. It was clarified that Ti- 15 Zr- 4 Nb- 4 Ta alloy could be manufactured using the same manufacturing process as for previously approved Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy, {{taking into account the}} difference (ΔT) between Tβ and heat treatment temperature. Also, the manufacturing equivalency of Ti- 15 Zr- 4 Nb- 4 Ta alloy to obtain marketing approval of implants was established. Thus, it was concluded that continuous hot rolling is useful for manufacturing α-β-type Ti alloy...|$|E

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels {{are widely used}} in chemical process, oil and gas industry. One of the main ap-plications are disconnect able mooring systems (SWIVEL connections) for offshore Floating Production Storage and Offloading units (FPSO). Due to the increasing demand for energy ever larger cast or forged parts are required in the offshore industry. It is a well known fact that in larger duplex stainless steel forgings precipitation of detrimental phases can take place, such as Sigma phase or nitrides. Impact strength at low temperature and corrosion resistance will be influenced by these precipitations. Therefo-re mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of ring rolled products with large wall thicknesses are the main objective of this report. Hence, mechanical properties including impact strength were determined {{as a function of}} specimen test location depth in a part that failed during acceptance testing. Additionally two test rings with identical wall thickness and different <b>forging</b> <b>ratios</b> were investigated in the same manner. Corrosion resistance tests were performed according to ASTM G 48 and in some cases Critical Pitting Temperature (CPT) was established. The microstructure was examined via Optical Microscopy as well as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). A Focused Ion Beam (FIB) device was used to micromachine TEM foils at evident sites in SEM specimens.

40|$|The basic {{features}} of A- 100 steel, such as relationship between cogging process and mechanical properties, relationship among the forging process, grain size and mechanical properties, secondary hardening, and fatigue properties were discussed. The high-temperature homogenization and high deformation {{at first step}} technique were developed on the foundation of multiple upsetting and stretching, high <b>forging</b> <b>ratio</b> technique used for 300 M steel, and became the technique foundation of cogging process in A- 100 steel. The fracture toughness of A- 100 steel was tended {{to be influenced by}} hot working process. The grain size grew heavily, and mixed grain structure was appeared after heating at 1140 ℃ and above with deformation amount below 20 %, the fracture toughness was also decreased. The secondary hardening performance of A- 100 steel was changed after the deformation at low temperature. The tensile strength peak temperature was changed to 468 ℃,the tensile strength was decreased slowly when over aging. A- 100 steel was cyclic hardened, and its fatigue crack growth properties were better than 300 M steel.

40|$|In some studies, {{the metal}} {{materials}} with different magnetic permeability and same chemical composition {{need to be}} prepared to avoid the interference caused by different compositions and make the parameter of magnetic permeability become the key variable directly. In order to prepare the metal materials with different magnetic and same component, the paper has considered other two commonly schemes, such as the casting method by adding some ferromagnetic elements and the heat-treatment process to increase its phase content of martensite or ferrite. Finally, it has been found that the cold working process was preferable if the austenitic stainless steel 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti with paramagnetic was selected as a raw material, because it got better control in <b>forging</b> <b>ratio.</b> The method of magnetic balance has been used to measure the relative magnetic permeability of every specimen with different hardness HB  165 (A), HRC  20 (B), HRC  25 (C) and HRC  30 (D). The metallurgical microscope, XRD, TEM and SEM has been put to use to analyse their microstructure before and after forging. The results show, the cold working process improved magnetic properties of 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti continuously and largely within limits by controlling different forging rate, as well as the process was not complicated. The relative rate of magnetic permeability for 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti and W 18 Cr 4 V (high-speed steel) could be up to 1 : 2. 435 at 0. 03  T. The 20. 1  % maximum reduction of the austenite phase should be a main reason to improving magnetic permeability of 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti. The real magneto-crystalline anisotropy should be due to martensite or ferrite phases with strong magnetic property. The 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti after cold working still maintained high corrosion resistance. Furthermore, this process method was also applicable to other austenitic steels with paramagnetic and strong cold work hardening characteristics. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the effect of thermo-mechanical treatment (TMT) on the microstructure and mechanical behaviour of low alloy steel. Hot forging is carried out at 1200 ºC using mechanical press of 500 and 800 ton. The effect of hot <b>forging</b> reduction <b>ratios</b> (1. 11 and 1. 29) on the hardness and mechanical properties are studied. TMT samples are given different heat treatment i. e. annealing (A), normalizing (N), hardening (H), hardening and tempering (H/T) and their corresponding impact toughness are obtained. Selected heat treatment (normalizing and annealing) are given to tensile test samples and their corresponding strength and ductility are obtained. Ultimate tensile, 0. 2 % offset yield strength and percent elongation are measured. Hardness and impact toughness measurements were carried out for all alloy conditions. Hardness (HV), ultimate tensile stress (UTS-MPa) and 0. 2 % offset yield stress (MPa) increases with increasing reduction ratio. TMT leads to a sharp rise in alloy hardness and strength. Normalizing and annealing following TMT revealed a low hardness values compared to those observed in the TMT condition. Annealing reduces hardness and strength but increases ductility and impact toughness. This {{could be attributed to}} the recovery and coarsening effect. Pro-eutectoi...|$|R
40|$|Raw {{materials}} were cast from different specific processes {{in order to}} produce cleaner steels with a reduced amount of inclusions. Studied materials that are HSS hardened alloys belonging to the Fe-Cr-C-X system were shared out in four groups depending on the tempering temperature and the presence of secondary and primary carbides. Both inclusions and carbides were roughly assessed by means of Image Analysis. Forging was done on all studied materials with different reduction ratios in order to highlight the texture influence oil mechanical properties. High cycle fatigue tests were made using the boundary method to allow a quick evaluation of results. Fractographic analyses carried out on broken samples led to the definition of four failure modes depending on the nature and the location of the point from which the crack was initiated in one hand, and the roughness of striations in the propagating area over and around the initiation point. Internal and surface crack initiation points were found, the latter being more harmful than the first ones. Though oxides appeared to be more detrimental than other inclusions, primary carbides were also found to be both crack initiation candidates and crack propagation enhancers. Various parameters likely to influence high cycle fatigue failures were finally defined, the most significant one dealing with the nature and location of embedded precipitates and the <b>forging</b> reduction <b>ratio.</b> (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Forging {{behaviour}} of 2124 {{aluminium alloy}} containing 26 vol. % of SiC particles (average size 3 μm) was investigated {{by means of}} room and elevated temperature tensile tests (range of temperature 20 - 350 °C). The results obtained were utilized to define the <b>forging</b> parameters (deformation <b>ratio</b> 3. 5 : 1, strain rate 0. 14 s- 1, sample temperature during the hot deformation process ranging from 440 to 340 °C). Microstructure of as-fabricated and forged specimens was investigated. Microfractographic examinations were executed on the tensile fracture surfaces, obtained by testing the composite both at room and high temperature, in order to investigate the mechanism controlling the fracture process. The material exhibited excellent forgeability and after forging the tested composite {{was found to be}} crack free. This feature is very likely due {{to the size of the}} reinforcing SiC particles, smaller than those generally used for conventional metal/ceramic composite processing. Furthermore, forging resulted in an increase of both tensile strength and ductility with respect to the as-fabricated condition. The performing of T 4 treatment on forged specimens highly increased yield and tensile strength, the ductility still remaining similar to that of HIP billets...|$|R
40|$|Objective This study aims to {{identify}} the relationship between odd- and branched-chain fatty acids (OBCFAs) and microbial nucleic acid bases in the rumen, and to establish a model to accurately predict microbial protein flow by using OBCFA. Methods To develop the regression equations, data on the rumen contents of individual cows were obtained from 2 feeding experiments. In the first experiment, 3 rumen-fistulated dry dairy cows arranged in a 3 × 3 Latin square were fed diets of differing forage to concentration ratios (F:C). The second experiment consisted of 9 lactating Holstein dairy cows of similar body weights at the same stage of pregnancy. For each lactation stage, 3 cows with similar milk production were selected. The rumen contents were sampled at 4 time points of every two hours after morning feeding 6 h, and then to analyse the concentrations of OBCFA and microbial nucleic acid bases in the rumen samples. Results The ruminal bacteria nucleic acid bases were significantly influenced by feeding diets of differing <b>forge</b> to concentration <b>ratios</b> and lactation stages of dairy cows (p< 0. 05). The concentrations of OBCFAs, especially odd-chain fatty acids and C 15 : 0 isomers, strongly correlated with the microbial nucleic acid bases in the rumen (p< 0. 05). The equations of ruminal microbial nucleic acid bases established by ruminal OBCFAs contents showed a good predictive capacity, as indicated by reasonably low standard errors and high R-squared values. Conclusion This finding suggests that the rumen OBCFA composition {{could be used as}} an internal marker of rumen microbial matter...|$|R
