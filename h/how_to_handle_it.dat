Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house and preventing visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it,</b> but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E
25|$|At 9:00 on {{the morning}} of 13 April, the {{traditional}} festival of Baisakhi, Colonel Reginald Dyer, the acting military commander for Amritsar and its environs, proceeded through the city with several city officials, announcing the implementation of a pass system to enter or leave Amritsar, a curfew beginning at 20:00 that night and a ban on all processions and public meetings of four or more persons. The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi, but few paid it any heed or appear to have learned of it later. Meanwhile, the local CID had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds. At 12:40, Dyer was informed of the meeting and returned to his base at around 13:30 to decide <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

Spector wrote that they considered it in preproduction, {{but that they}} did not figure out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it</b> until [...] "relatively late in development". This led to wasted time when the team had to discard their early AI code. The team built atop their game engine's shooter-based AI instead of writing new code that would allow characters to exhibit convincing emotions. As a result, NPC behavior was variable until the very end of development. Spector felt that the team's [...] "sin" [...] was their inconsistent display of a trustable [...] "human AI".|$|E

At this time, Yamazaki said that the player should be able to use emotions and analytical psychology to reach the truth, in addition to using evidence: he thought that previous Ace Attorney games had only focused on evidence versus statements, and wanted to introduce a third element. Natsuki Ikawa, one of the game designers, read books on psychology and talked to the other staff members about what to do. She wrote down several ideas for <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it,</b> including goggles that show the witness's personality as a specter, or a large computer that analyzes brain waves and heart rates, and showed them to Yamazaki, who would say [...] "that's a pretty nifty idea" [...] but still reject them; this contradiction between what he said and what he felt made Ikawa realize the basic concept for the mood matrix system, which was revised through feedback from everyone on the team and was implemented in the game. Another game designer, Yoriki Daigo, worked on several new features, including making the player able to move between locations freely and designing the revisualization system. Because the game was built from the ground up, the user interface for investigation sections was overhauled completely to be more visually appealing. The developers tried to keep the game simple, keeping it in line with Takumi's original vision of a game simple enough for his mother to play.|$|E

6000|$|At Barbizon Millet's life {{moved on}} so quietly {{that there is}} nothing to record in it almost, save a long list of {{pictures}} painted, and a gradual growth, not in popularity (for THAT Millet never really attained at all), but in the esteem of the best judges, which of course brought with it at last, first ease, then comfort, and finally comparative riches. Millet was able now to paint such subjects as pleased him best, and he threw himself into his work with all the fervour of his intensely earnest and poetical nature. Whatever might be the subject which he undertook, he knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it</b> so that it became instinct with his own fine feeling for the life he saw around him. In 1852 he painted his [...] "Man spreading Manure." [...] In itself, that is not a very exalted or beautiful occupation; but what Millet saw in it was the man, not the manure--the toiling, sorrowing, human fellow-being, whose labour and whose spirit he knew so well how to appreciate. And in this view of the subject he makes us all at once sympathize. Other pictures of this period are such as [...] "The Gleaners," [...] "The Reapers," [...] "A Peasant grafting a Tree," [...] "The Potato Planters," [...] and so forth. These were very different subjects indeed from the dignified kings and queens painted by Delaroche, or the fiery battle-pieces of Delacroix but they touch a chord in our souls which those great painters fail to strike, and his treatment of them is always truthful, tender, melancholy, and exquisite.|$|E
