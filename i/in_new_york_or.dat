In late 1909 and early 1910 Olivia and Dorothy {{attended}} his lectures at the London Polytechnic Institution; in June 1910 they joined him in Sirmione, Italy. For reasons unclear to biographers Olivia forbade the two from writing to each other during his extended visit to New York from 1910-11. Despite the restriction Dorothy seems to have considered herself engaged to Pound, although uncertain whether he intended to stay <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>or</b> return to London.|$|E
5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated {{only by a}} (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>or</b> the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{had hoped}} {{to work in a}} more modern {{facility}} than EMI's London studios at Abbey Road, and so sent Epstein to Memphis in March 1966 to investigate the possibility of their recording at Stax Studio. According to a letter written by Harrison two months later, the group intended to work with Stax's in-house producer, Jim Stewart. The idea was abandoned after locals began descending on the Stax building, as were alternative plans to use either Atlantic Studios <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>or</b> Motown's facility in Detroit.|$|E

In specific language, the U.S. ceded all right and title to them the territory they reserved to themselves out of their Iroquois domain {{in return for their}} ceding all right and title in the Ohio Valley to the United States government.|$|E
25|$|Police did {{not learn}} of the Moskowitz–Violante {{shooting}} until about 2:50a.m., and Dowd {{did not think that}} it was another Son of Sam shooting until an officer at the scene reported that large-caliber shells had been used. Police established a series of roadblocks about an hour after the shooting, stopping hundreds of cars to question drivers and inspect vehicles. During interviews, Masters and others described a Volkswagen speeding from the crime scene, and police now suspected that the shooter owned or drove such a vehicle. In subsequent days, police determined that there were more than 900 Volkswagens <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>or</b> New Jersey, and they made plans to trace each of these cars and their owners. Detective John Falotico was awakened at home and told to report to the 10th Homicide Division at the 60th Precinct station house in Coney Island. He was told that Stacy Moskowitz and Robert Violante had been shot. Falotico was given two weeks to work on the case as a normal murder investigation; it was then given to a special Son of Sam task force.|$|E

500|$|From {{the mid-1960s}} on, Waldron {{spent a lot}} of time in Europe: Paris, Rome, Bologna, and Cologne, before moving {{permanently}} to Munich in 1967. Waldron originally moved to France when film director Marcel Carné asked him if he wanted to compose the score for Three Rooms in Manhattan <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>or</b> Paris; Waldron's 1958 experience touring Europe with Holiday made the decision an easy one. Waldron's stated reasons for settling in Europe were his disgust with the [...] "fierce, cutthroat competition, just to get a job" [...] and the fact that black musicians were paid less than their white counterparts in the U.S. The 1965 score for Three Rooms in Manhattan was followed by one for the American film Sweet Love, Bitter in 1967. Waldron also composed for theater (Amiri Baraka's The Slave and Dutchman), television, and short films. In Europe around this time he played with other expatriates, including Ben Webster and Kenny Clarke.|$|E
