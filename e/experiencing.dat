The believer discovers {{that he or she is}} not distinct from the cosmos, the deity or the other reality, but one with it. Zaehner has identified two distinctively different mystical experiences: natural and religious mystical <b>experiences</b> (Charlesworth: 1988). Natural mystical <b>experiences</b> are, for example, <b>experiences</b> of the 'deeper self' or <b>experiences</b> of oneness with nature. Zaehner argues that the <b>experiences</b> typical of 'natural mysticism' are quite different from the <b>experiences</b> typical of religious mysticism (Charlesworth: 1988). Natural mystical <b>experiences</b> are not considered to be religious <b>experiences</b> because they are not linked to a particular tradition, but natural mystical <b>experiences</b> are spiritual <b>experiences</b> that can have a profound effect on the individual.|$|R

50|$|In Chapter 2, The Need of a Theory of <b>Experience,</b> Dewey {{argues that}} not all <b>experiences</b> are educative and that, in fact, some <b>experiences</b> can be mis-educative. The central {{challenge}} to experience-based learning is to create fruitful <b>experiences</b> and organize them in progression to guide students’ learning. A mis-educative <b>experience</b> stymies the growth of further <b>experiences.</b> Enjoyable <b>experiences</b> may be mis-educative if they are disconnected and promote dispersive, disintegrated and centrifugal habits. In traditional schools, people associated boredom with the learning process. The <b>experiences</b> had by teachers and students were of the “wrong kind.” It Is not the absence of <b>experiences</b> in traditional schooling that Dewey finds troubling, but the defective nature of these <b>experiences.</b> Therefore, the educator’s duty {{is to determine the}} quality of an <b>experience.</b> Each <b>experience</b> has two aspects: the immediate agreeableness or disagreeableness and its later impact on further <b>experience.</b> Educators must think about the experiential continuum—continuity of <b>experiences.</b>|$|R
