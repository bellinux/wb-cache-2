40|$|Plastics are {{increasingly}} a preferred material choice in designing and developing complex, consumer products, such as automobiles, {{because they are}} mouldable, lightweight, and are often perceived to be highly recyclable materials. However, actually recycling the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>plastics</b> used in such durable items is challenging, and presents very different scenarios to how simple products, such as water bottles, are recovered via curbside or container recycling initiatives. While the technology exists to recycle plastics, their feasibility to do so from high level consumer or industrial applications is bounded by technological and economical restraints. Obstacles include the lack of market for recyclates, {{and the lack of}} cost efficient recovery infrastructures or processes. Furthermore, there is a knowledge gap between manufacturers, consumers, and end-of-life facility operators. For these reasons, end-of-life plastics are more likely to end up down-cycled, or as shredder residue and then landfilled. This paper reviews these challenges and several alternatives to recycling plastics in order to broaden the mindset surrounding plastics recycling to improve their sustainability. The paper focuses on the automotive sector for examples, but discussion can be applied {{to a wide range of}} plastic components from similarly complex products...|$|R

Arising from environmental concern {{and at the same}} time supporting waste to wealth program, the best way to overcome coastal plastic {{pollution is}} by recycling. However, due to photo degradation and nature of the surroundings, the characteristics of coastal plastic waste are differ from land plastic waste that drives for further research in determining the characteristics of coastal plastic waste and discovering its potential value. The objectives of this study are to improve the characteristics of mechanical properties of coastal <b>plastic</b> waste by <b>heterogeneous</b> recycling, to compare the mechanical properties of <b>heterogeneous</b> coastal <b>plastic</b> waste with the commercial plastic and to study the potential value of <b>heterogeneous</b> coastal <b>plastic</b> waste. Polypropylene (PP) and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), two types of plastic waste which are highly abundant at the coastal region for its great consuming in food and beverages packaging and containers are used as sample. Samples are collected, cleaned and sorted manually according to the types and crushed into small flakes. PP and PET are mixed by volume composition of 0 %, 3 %, 5 %, 7 % and 10 % of PET before undergo extrusion process. Under extrusion process, the plastic is extruded to strands and then pelletized to produce a single-polymer plastic. Then, plastic is moulded into testing specimen according to standard measurement, ASTM D 638 - 05 and tested in term of its mechanical properties- tensile strength, elongation at break and elastic modulus- by using Universal Testing Machine. From analysis of obtained result, the mechanical properties of mixed <b>heterogeneous</b> coastal <b>plastic</b> waste are poor compared to homogeneous recycling except for elastic modulus. However, at 7 % composition of recycle PET, it shows the optimum mixing ratio which gives better of mechanical properties.

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} well known that ductile {{fractures}} of steels are accelerated by triaxial stresses. The characteristics of ductile crack initiation in steels are evaluated quantitatively using two-parameter criterion based on equivalent plastic strain and stress triaxiality. It has been demonstrated by authors using round-bar specimens with circumferential notch in single tension that the critical strain to initiate ductile crack from specimen center depends considerably on stress triaxiality, but surface cracking of notch root is in accordance with constant strain condition. This study fundamentally clarifies the effect of strength mismatch, which can elevate plastic constraint due to <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>plastic</b> straining under static loading, on critical conditions for ductile cracking from the pre-notch root.

The polyurethanes are produced from the condensation of 1, 4 -butanediol (BDO) with hexamethylenediisocyanate (HDI). The morphology – induced by the hard-segment crystallization – converts from dispersed randomly placed hard-segment domains into progressively more periodic, but interconnected HS nanophases with increasing HS content. Irrespective of the actual morphology, the SAXS data could be described satisfactorily by using a clipped Gaussian random field (GRF) model. The NMR data demonstrate that the HS domain fraction corresponds to the chemical feed, pointing at a complete phase separation. The material mechanical behavior during repeated deformation cycles can be explained on morphological grounds and involves a spatially <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation of the hard domains.

Besides, the amplitude of regular stress serrations observed at room temperature and an intermediate strain rate increases several times, indicating a strong increase of the contribution of solute solution hardening to the overall strength. Moreover, the grain refinement affects the usual sequence of the characteristic types of stress serrations, which characterize the dynamical mechanisms governing a highly <b>heterogeneous</b> unstable <b>plastic</b> flow.

Large-scale electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) orientation maps are customarily used to correlate the orientation topography with the roping profile. The most common way of investigating this phenomenon is to extract the predominant texture components and then to correlate them with the roping profile, since grains belong to different texture components lead to different plastic responses. Instead of using a microscopic representative volume element in the length scale of the grain size, the present work proposes a moving window mechanical model to use a representative volume element of the meso-scale, corresponding to a grain cluster, to simulate roping.

Within atherosclerotic plaques, macrophages rapidly respond to changes in the microenvironment, shifting between pro- (M 1) or anti-inflammatory (M 2) functional phenotypes. Furthermore, different stimuli have been associated with differentiation of newly discovered M 2 subtypes: IL- 4 /IL- 13 (M 2 a), immune-complex (M 2 b), IL- 10 /glucocorticoids (M 2 c), and adenosine receptor agonist (M 2 d). More recently, additional intraplaque macrophage phenotypes were also recognized in response to CXCL 4 (M 4), oxidized phospholipids (Mox), haemoglobin/haptoglobin complexes (HA-mac/M(Hb)), and heme (Mhem). Such macrophage polarization was described as a progression among multiple phenotypes, which reflect the activity of different transcriptional factors and the cross-talk between intracellular signalling.

The aim of this review is to update the current knowledge on the role of macrophage subsets in atherogenesis.

Viral diseases are thus difficult to control because of the appearance of drug-resistant mutants, and it becomes essential to seek mechanisms able to force the extinction of the quasispecies before adaptation emerges. An alternative {{to the use of}} conventional drugs consists in increasing the replication error rate through the use of mutagens. Here, we report about persistent infections of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus treated with fluorouracil, where a progressive debilitation of infectivity leading to eventual extinction occurs. The transition to extinction is accompanied by the production of large amounts of RNA, indicating that the replicative ability of the quasispecies is not strongly impaired by the mutagen. By means of experimental and theoretical approaches, we propose that a fraction of the RNA molecules synthesized can behave as a defective subpopulation able to drive the viable class extinct. Our results lead to the identification of two extinction pathways, one at high amounts of mutagen, where the quasispecies completely loses its ability to infect and replicate, and a second one, at lower amounts of mutagen, where replication continues while the infective class gets extinct because of the action of defectors. The results bear on a potential application of increased mutagenesis as an antiviral strategy in that low doses of a mutagenic agent may suffice to drive persistent virus to extinction...|$|R
