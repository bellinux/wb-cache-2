5000|$|Although {{newspapers}} {{are most frequently}} published with page counts in multiples of four, {{it is possible to}} achieve other page counts. To do this, a sheet of paper with only one page on each side is added {{in the center of the}} newspaper. This sheet is half the size of a normal sheet because it doesn't have a mate next to it on each side. This page, called a [...] "dink," [...] is nestled between the <b>double</b> <b>truck.</b> In most cases under this arrangement, the <b>double</b> <b>truck</b> pages would be treated as two separate pages with no graphics or text overlapping because of the additional pages between the two would-be <b>double</b> <b>truck</b> pages. However, note that even with a dink, newspapers can never be an odd number of pages. Dinks are generally not used in magazines or bound publications because they cannot be held in place.|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "double truck" [...] {{comes from}} the days when the heavy forms for {{newspaper}} pages (the metal version of each page), largely filled with lead type, were rolled around the composing room floor on heavy carts called trucks.

50|$|At {{approximately}} 1356 on 12 December 2006, a <b>double</b> trailer <b>truck</b> {{drove into}} the path of The Ghan passenger train (1AD8) at the Fountain Head Road level crossing, Ban Ban Springs, Northern Territory. As a consequence, two locomotives, a wagon used for carrying passengers' private vehicles and nine passenger carriages derailed.

40|$|For {{a two-year}} period, large truck crashes {{on the interstate}} system in Washington State were {{investigated}} using a case-control method. For each large truck involved in a crash, three trucks were randomly selected for inspection from the traffic stream {{at the same time}} and place as the crash but one week later. The effects of truck and driver characteristics on crashes were assessed by comparing their relative frequency among the crash-involved and comparison sample <b>trucks.</b> <b>Double</b> trailer <b>trucks</b> were consistently overinvolved in crashes by a factor of two to three in both single and multiple vehicle crashes. Single unit trucks pulling trailers also were overinvolved. Doubles also had a higher frequency of jackknifing compared to tractor-trailers. The substantial overinvolvement of doubles in crashes was found regardless of driver age, hours of driving, cargo weight, or type of fleet. Younger drivers, long hours of driving, and operating empty trucks were also associated with higher crash involvement...|$|R
