He also helped craft a significant education reform bill {{in response to a}} ruling by the Kentucky Supreme Court that declared the state's entire public school system unconstitutional. Wilkinson's term was plagued by political scandal and an uneasy relationship with the state legislature. He advocated an amendment to the state constitution that would allow him to seek a second consecutive term as governor, but the amendment was defeated in the General Assembly. His wife Martha attempted to succeed him, but withdrew from the campaign amid weak support for her candidacy. Following his term as governor, Wilkinson encountered difficult financial times. In 2001, he was sued by a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>creditors,</b> and during the proceedings, it was revealed that he was operating a Ponzi scheme to keep his businesses afloat. Both he and his wife Martha filed for bankruptcy later that year. In 2002, Wilkinson was hospitalized with arterial blockages. His condition was complicated by a recurrence of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002, and his family withdrew his life support the following day in accordance with his previously-expressed wishes.|$|E

40|$|SHOULD THERE BE a {{sovereign}} bankruptcy procedure for countries in financial distress? This paper explores {{the use of}} U. S. bankruptcy law {{as a model for}} {{a sovereign}} bankruptcy procedure and asks whether adoption of such a procedure would lead to a more orderly process of sovereign debt restructuring. It assumes that a quick and orderly debt restructuring process is more efficient than a prolonged and disorderly one, because a lengthy process of debt restructuring takes a high toll on debtor countries’ economies as well as harming creditors in general. I concentrate on three goals for a sovereign bankruptcy procedure: preventing individual credi-tors or <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> from suing the debtor for repayment, prevent-ing <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> from strategically delaying negotiations or acting as holdouts, and increasing the likelihood that private creditors will pro-vide new loans to sovereign debtors in financial distress, thus reducing the pressure on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to fund bailouts. I conclude that nonbankruptcy alternatives are less likely to accomplish these goals than a sovereign bankruptcy procedure. U. S.

After discussing the importance of strong entity shielding a characteristic of the corporation but not the partnership -and how it complements limited liability, the authors conclude that the development of new business forms is the culmination of the process of extending strong entity shielding to unrestricted types of entities and, therefore, the new business forms should be viewed as generalizations of the business corporation rather than the partnership...|$|R

40|$|In {{cross-border}} mergers, creditor {{protection is}} important to facilitate a smooth, efficient and transparent process necessary to facilitate the single market. As all assets and liabilities are being transferred {{and there is a}} risk that the liabilities of the acquiring company will exceed the assets, creditor protection needs to be safeguarded in legal mergers. As the title suggests, creditor protection in the context of cross-border mergers and the recently adopted directive is examined in this paper, as well as the position <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> under Dutch law and the Third Directive. The ex-ante and ex-post systems <b>of</b> <b>creditor</b> protection, both existing in the Member States of the EU, and which are both supported by strong arguments, are also discussed. The fact that differences in creditor protection rules nevertheless remain may create unjustifiable differences in the position <b>of</b> various <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> involved in one single cross-border merger. The authors conclude that the case for leaving creditor protection to the Member States is weakening. Differences in national legislation on creditor protection, defendable as they may be, are ultimately of a technical nature and create unnecessary and unjustifiable impediments. There are strong arguments, in other words, to adopt the same provisions for all transactions for the sake of simplicity, but while this may be attractive, it can lead to undesired delay. Amending the Directive {{at this point in time}} thus seems equally unfeasible. This stresses the need to make haste with at least some further harmonization <b>of</b> <b>creditor</b> protection rules related to the Third Directive...|$|R
25|$|The NH {{had been}} making up any {{shortfall}} {{in the ability of}} the NYW to meet its debt obligations. Thus, when the NH entered bankruptcy in 1935, the NYW did as well. Former New Haven General Manager Clinton L. Bardo was appointed as Trustee to try to turn around the fortunes of the ailing Westchester. But the trustees of the NH bankruptcy and the trustees of the NYW bankruptcy were responsible to different <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>creditors.</b> The liquidation brought them into conflict. The NYW was forced to cease operating on the Port Chester line to enhance the revenues of the NH from its parallel service. The loss of revenue could not be offset by lower costs. If the NYW had been left intact, it would have required the New Haven to pay off a bond issue that was due in 1946. Total liquidation was the only answer. Bardo {{died of a heart attack}} in August 1937, before the full effect of his policies could be realized. The NYW ceased operations on December 31, 1937.|$|R

We also find that information of relatively high precision available to the large creditor reduces the probability of failure. ...|$|R

We use a two-creditor example to illustrate that a key strategic motivation <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> in an unstructured negotiation environment is the desire to wait until others have settled, in an attempt to extract a larger settlement and show that this motivation is stronger, and expected delay is increased, as the number <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> increases. We then use a three player example to demonstrate that collective action eliminates the strategic holdout motivation for delay, while introducing a free-rider motivation: each creditor prefers the others to incur the costs of negotiating for the collective. A perhaps surprising result is that this motivation can be su ¢ ciently strong, that it causes an increase in expected delay. We illustrate the exibility of our approach by applying the model to secondary markets for creditors and to the issue of credit vultures...|$|R
