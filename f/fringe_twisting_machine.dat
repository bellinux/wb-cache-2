40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a carding <b>machine</b> and <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> for produce eri fiber and yarn. A carding machine decomposes degumming cocoons and forms it into cohesiveness silk filament. Silk filament was then spun and <b>twisted</b> in <b>twisting</b> <b>machine.</b> Factors to test machine functionality were teeth of carding head which were aligned in straight and zigzag pattern. Speeds of fiber feeding were 0. 24, 0. 32, and 0. 4 meter per minute. From the experiments of carding machine, it can be found that almost cocoons were decomposed when using zigzag pattern. Speed of cocoon feeder was about 0. 24 meter per minute. From <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> testing, results pointed out different speed of fiber feeding provided different size of yarn. The properties of eri silk obtained from machine were similar with eri silk produced from traditional method. Therefore, carding <b>machine</b> and <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> developed in this research can help farmers to increase production and support the eri silk industry development...|$|R

30|$|The paper yarns {{used in the}} weft {{were made}} into two types, single yarn and {{combination}} yarn. First, in the manufacturing process of a single yarn, a paper sheet was cut to a pre-determined width to make a tape yarn, and after that the single yarn was produced by adding a proper twist to the tape yarn through a <b>twisting</b> <b>machine.</b> In other words, the Hanji paper sheet, {{with the weight of}} 13  g/m 2, was cut into the tape yarn in the width of 2.75 and 3.75  mm. Then, the Hanji paper yarns, count of 16 and 11  Ne, were produced after twisting 600 and 520  tpm (Z-twist), respectively, using a <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> (Murata® 363). The combination yarn was manufactured by combining paper yarn and core spun yarn. In this study, Hanji paper yarn of 16 or 30  Ne was plied in S-twist with the core spun yarn [cotton (sheath)/spandex (core)]. After that, the structures of Hanji combination yarns were stabilized through the steam setting for 14  min at 105  °C.

The firm’s modest production together with some purchased yarn was dyed at the Rau dyeing works in Berg before being taken to Bönnigheim where it was wound onto a bobbin and finished by twelve women. Two men turning a wheel provided the motive power. However, by 1855 manpower had proved insufficient and two donkeys (later two oxen) were used to drive a horse mill. In the same year, the black dyeing process was transferred in-house and additional machinery of various kinds was acquired. The following year saw the arrival of four new <b>twisting</b> <b>machines,</b> six additional winders and more washing and bobbin machines: the power source for these was a four-horsepower steam engine which replaced the oxen.

40|$|Mask-rotating speckle {{metrology}} {{for investigating}} low-speed dynamic problems {{has been discussed}} in detail in this thesis. All the dynamic information {{for the duration of}} exposure can be recorded onto one photographic plate and can be continuously reconstructed by the whole-field filtering. The dynamic thermal, flexural and residual deformations, as well as the dynamic out-of-plane displacements, of continuously deformed objects have been successfully measured by using the method proposed in this thesis. The proposed method has also been successfully used for measuring the dynamic slopes of a continuously deformed object. The influence of displacements on slope fringe formation in speckle aperture-shearing metrology has been systematically discussed in this thesis. It has been shown that the in-plane displacement, aperture orientation and shearing direction have a significant influence on slope fringe formation in photographic speckle aperture-shearing metrology. It has also been shown that the in-plane displacement and object-to-wedge distance have an important influence on slope fringe formation in digital speckle aperture-shearing metrology and that the influence is increased with an increase of the in-plane displacement and with a decrease of the object-to-wedge distance. Speckle aperture-shearing metrology, including digital speckle aperture-shearing metrology, for obtaining pure curvature and <b>twist</b> <b>fringes</b> has been studied in this thesis. The slope fringes influencing the contrast of curvature and <b>twist</b> <b>fringes</b> can be completely removed from the patterns of curvature and <b>twist</b> <b>fringes</b> and thus the patterns of pure curvature and <b>twist</b> <b>fringes</b> with high contrast can be obtained. The influence of displacements and strains on pure curvature and <b>twist</b> <b>fringes</b> in speckle aperture-shearing metrology has also been discussed. It has been shown that the in-plane displacements have no direct influence on fringe formation and that the in-plane strains have an important influence on fringe formation. Partially coherent speckle metrology, as well as the factors influencing the quality of speckle fringes, is investigated. It has been successfully used for measurement of slopes. In this thesis, the phase-shifting technique has also been successfully combined with conventional digital speckle aperture-shearing metrology to quantitatively evaluate slopes and strains and applied in digital speckle metrology to determine residual deformations. Volume grating digital speckle metrology has been proposed for measuring the out-of-plane displacement in this thesis. It can be employed to quantitatively evaluate the out-of-plane displacement of deformed objects when combined with the carrier and phase-shifting techniques. It can also be employed for measuring the amplitude distribution of vibrating objects, in which a Bessel fringe pattern with unit contrast can be obtained...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES. We {{sought to}} develop lists of jobs whose members {{reported}} {{high and low}} levels of functional disability. METHODS. Samples of women (n = 6096) and men (n = 3653) were drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiological Follow-up. Disability was measured with a modified Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire. We analyzed women and men separately, and we calculated average disability indices within longest-held occupations while adjusting for age, age-squared, married spouse present, and education. We minimized attrition bias with an econometric technique. RESULTS. From highest to lowest association with disability, the female broad occupations ranking was as follows: farming, no occupation, laborers, service, technicians, operatives, crafts workers, transportation operators, professionals, sales workers, administrative support, and managers. The male broad occupations ranking was as follows: no occupation, farming, operatives, crafts workers, service, technicians, manager, administrative support, sales, and professionals. The highest levels of disability for women and men occurred among nonconstruction laborers, farm workers, <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> operators, servants, machinery maintenance workers, mining machine operators, and bus drivers.
