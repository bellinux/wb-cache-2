5|$|The most {{important}} lesson learned is {{that a number of}} ecosystems, including the one that contains Yellowstone, are specially adapted to large and intense wildfires. This was widely thought to be the case well before 1988, and the wildfires of that year drove the conclusion home. While large destructive fires are unacceptable in regions with extensive encroachment by communities, they are mandatory in a region such as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> maintained in a natural manner.|$|E

25|$|Although {{molecular}} hydrogen has very {{high energy density}} on a mass basis, partly because of its low molecular weight, as a gas at ambient conditions it has very low energy density by volume. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used as fuel stored on board the vehicle, pure hydrogen gas must be stored in an energy-dense form to provide sufficient driving range.|$|E
25|$|Pinpointing the {{extinction}} (or pseudoextinction) {{of a species}} requires a clear definition of that species. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species.

25|$|In many non-US western {{countries}} a 'fourth hurdle' of cost effectiveness analysis has developed before new technologies can be provided. This {{focuses on the}} efficiency (in terms of the cost per QALY) of the technologies in question rather than their efficacy. In England and Wales NICE decides whether and in what circumstances drugs and technologies will be made available by the NHS, whilst similar arrangements exist with the Scottish Medicines Consortium in Scotland, and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in Australia. A product must pass the threshold for cost-effectiveness <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> approved. Treatments must represent 'value for money' and a net benefit to society.|$|E
25|$|The {{brilliance}} {{of lead crystal}} relies on the high refractive index caused by the lead content. Ordinary glass has a refractive index of n = 1.5, while the addition of lead produces a range up to 1.7 or 1.8. This heightened refractive index also correlates with increased dispersion, which measures {{the degree to which}} a medium separates light into its component spectra, as in a prism. Crystal cutting techniques exploit these properties to create a brilliant, sparkling effect as each cut facet reflects and transmits light through the object. The high refractive index is useful for lens making, since a given focal length can be achieved with a thinner lens. However, the dispersion must be corrected by other components of the lens system <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> achromatic.|$|E
25|$|The {{measurement}} of critical application characteristics involves measuring structural {{attributes of the}} application's architecture, coding, and in-line documentation, as displayed in the picture above. Thus, each characteristic is affected by attributes at numerous levels of abstraction in the application and all of which must be included calculating the characteristic's measure <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a valuable predictor of quality outcomes that affect the business. The layered approach to calculating characteristic measures displayed in the figure above was first proposed by Boehm {{and his colleagues at}} TRW (Boehm, 1978) and is the approach taken in the ISO 9126 and 25000 series standards. These attributes can be measured from the parsed results of a static analysis of the application source code. Even dynamic characteristics of applications such as reliability and performance efficiency have their causal roots in the static structure of the application.|$|E

25|$|Zero-point energy (ZPE) {{or ground}} state energy {{is the lowest}} {{possible}} energy that a quantum mechanical system may have. Unlike in classical mechanics, quantum systems constantly fluctuate in their lowest energy state due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As well as atoms and molecules, the empty space of the vacuum has these properties. According to Quantum Field Theory the universe {{can be thought of}} not as isolated particles but continuous fluctuating fields: matter fields, whose quanta are fermions (i.e. leptons and quarks), and force fields, whose quanta are bosons (e.g. photons and gluons). All these fields have zero-point energy. These fluctuating zero-point fields lead to a kind of reintroduction of an aether in physics, since some systems can detect the existence of this energy. However this aether cannot {{be thought of as a}} physical medium <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Lorentz invariant such that there is no contradiction with Einstein's theory of special relativity.|$|E

500|$|The thing must be movable, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stolen. Whilst an {{immovable}} thing {{cannot be}} carried away, the pre-classical extension to {{other types of}} interference with property means that immovable were not by their nature excluded. Gaius indicates that certain veteres ("ancients") believed that land could be stolen. This was also the view of Sabinus, but it was rejected by other classical jurists. A thing separated from the land could be stolen, however. Usucapio was particularly important with regard to land, and therefore the exclusion may have been retained to help the good faith possessor of land to usucapt. Res sanctae and religiosia were covered by separate delicts; and one could not steal a res nullius. [...] One can commit furtum of one's own property, for example by taking back a thing pledged to a creditor, or by secretly reclaiming one's own thing from a good faith possessor. Free persons could also be stolen, for example, children; a wife in manu; indicati and auctorati. This was probably a hang-over from a time when dominium (ownership), manus and potestas were indistinct and not formally separate. Res hereditariae could not be stolen, perhaps {{for want of a}} suitable plaintiff with a sufficient interest.|$|E
500|$|It was {{initially}} believed that Newton {{had failed to}} escape from the Boston after it ditched into the sea, and he was posted as missing. Squadron Leader Hampshire had immediately dispatched a sortie to recover the pair that were last seen swimming for shore, but no sign of them was found. Two weeks later, he wrote a letter to Newton's mother in which he described her son's courage and expressed the hope that he might yet be found alive. Hampshire concluded, [...] "Bill is one of those rare fellows I shall miss for a long time, and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> remember for an age". The details of his capture and execution were only revealed later that year in a diary found on a Japanese soldier. Newton was not specifically named, but circumstantial evidence clearly identified him, as the diary entry recorded the beheading of an Australian flight lieutenant who had been shot down by anti-aircraft fire on 18March 1943 while flying a Douglas aircraft. The Japanese observer described the prisoner as [...] "composed" [...] in the face of his impending execution, and [...] "unshaken to the last". After the decapitation, a seaman slashed open the dead man's stomach, declaring [...] "Something for the other day. Take that." ...|$|E
500|$|Plato {{was called}} by {{biologist}} Ernst Mayr [...] "the great antihero of evolutionism," [...] because he promoted belief in essentialism, which is {{also referred to as}} the theory of Forms. This theory holds that each natural type of object in the observed world is an imperfect manifestation of the ideal, form or [...] "species" [...] which defines that type. In his Timaeus for example, Plato has a character tell a story that the Demiurge created the cosmos and everything in it because, being good, and hence, [...] "...free from jealousy, He desired that all things should be as like Himself as they could be." [...] The creator created all conceivable forms of life, since [...] "...without them the universe will be incomplete, for it will not contain every kind of animal which it ought to contain, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> perfect." [...] This [...] "principle of plenitude"—the idea that all potential forms of life are essential to a perfect creation—greatly influenced Christian thought. However some historians of science have questioned how much influence Plato's essentialism had on natural philosophy by stating that many philosophers after Plato believed that species might be capable of transformation and that the idea that biologic species were fixed and possessed unchangeable essential characteristics did not become important until the beginning of biological taxonomy in the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E
