5|$|At {{the time}} of Smith's death, the fourteen-year-old Lennon was visiting members of the Stanley family in Sango Bay, Durness, Scotland, and was not {{informed}} until he returned home. Lennon's <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> to laugh hysterically, but then to privately grieve and cry, as he later did after hearing {{about the death of}} his mother three years later, and the death of Stuart Sutcliffe (The Beatles' first bass player) which were all major factors in Lennon's early life. In the same year as Smith’s death the McCartney family moved to 20 Forthlin Road, which is only ¾ of a mile (1.2km) from Mendips. Lennon would later meet Paul McCartney {{for the first time at}} St. Peter's Church, where Smith was buried.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, 1973, Agnew {{appeared}} before the federal court in Baltimore, and pled no contest to one felony charge, tax evasion, for the year 1967. Richardson agreed {{that there would be}} no further prosecution of Agnew, and released a 40-page summary of the evidence. Agnew was fined $10,000 and placed on three years' unsupervised probation. At the same time, he submitted a formal letter of resignation to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in the best interest of the nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and uncertainty, and applauding Agnew for his patriotism and dedication to the welfare of the US. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford, who would be Agnew's successor as vice president (and Nixon's as president) recalled that he heard the news while on the House floor and his <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> disbelief, his second sadness.|$|E
5|$|When Miranda {{attacked}} that morning, Coburg's <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> to draw substantial {{troops from}} his center to reinforce his right flank. Initially, Archduke Charles' men were driven back to Dorsmael {{but then they}} {{held on to the}} village. The French Reserve captured Leau and threatened Halle but was soon thrown back. The main fighting occurred between 3:00 and 6:00 PM when Miaczinski's column seized Dorsmael but counterattacks drove his soldiers out. Other attacks withered {{in the face of the}} strong Coalition defenses. Charles saw an opportunity and hurled his cavalry on the tired French soldiers. The Left Wing became so demoralized that its troops were driven back to Tienen before Miranda could rally them. When Dumouriez heard of the defeat of Miranda's wing on the morning of the 19th he was forced to order a retreat.|$|E

However, by the time Howard acquired the director's position, Costner's name never came up in serious discussion, and Hanks had already been interested in doing a film based on Apollo 13. When Hanks' representative informed him that a script was being passed around, he had the script sent to him. John Travolta was initially offered the role of Lovell, but declined.|$|E
25|$|While he had Alexander in custody, King James {{delegated}} {{the northern}} campaign to Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, with more minor roles going to Maol Choluim Mac an Tóisich, Alexander Seton of Gordon, Hugh Fraser and Aonghas de Moravia. James {{would never again}} return to Ross or Moray. Mar was given support {{in his role as}} Lieutenant when Alan Stewart, the second son of Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl, was made Earl of Caithness in Spring 1430. The royal earldoms of Buchan and Ross, and the castle of Urquhart were put under Mar's control; by 1431 the lordship of Lochaber, held by Alasdair Carrach, was assigned to Mar's command; and by 1432 Mar had received papal dispensation to marry Margaret Seton, the mother of the heiresses to the earldom of Moray, which he would administer on their behalf. James, moreover, arranged a marriage between Lachlan Maclean, captain of the MacLeans of Duart, an important vassal kindred of the Lordship of the Isles, to Mar's daughter, bringing Mar's influence into the Lordship of the Isles itself. In 1431 Aonghas de Moravia was sent on a campaign against Aonghas Dubh MacAoidh in Strathnaver. However the main campaign was in Lochaber, where Mar hoped to make his status as Lord of Lochaber a reality. In both campaigns, however, the results were defeats for the king's forces. At the Battle of Inverlochy Mar's forces were met by both Domhnall Ballach and Alasdair Carrach of Lochaber; although Mar managed to make a long escape on foot back to Kildrummy Castle, the Earl of Caithness and 990 men were slain. In 1429, in Strathnaver, at the Battle of Drumnacoub, Aonghas Dubh MacAoidh (Angus MacKay), chief of Clan MacKay was also victorious over royal forces, this battle however was more of a family related feud. Both defeats were incurred before September 1431. James' <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> to raise taxes, taxes which were granted on 16 October, in order to deliver a counter-attack; but this revenue was insufficient and James had other problems to deal with. King James therefore arranged a reconciliation with Alexander, who was pardoned for past offences and released from captivity.|$|E
500|$|On 24 September 1942, Wilhelm {{took the}} ingot to Spedding at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and {{presented}} it to Compton, whose <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> of disbelief. He thought it must be hollow. Spedding had the ingot cut open. It was not hollow. A few days later, the Metallurgical Laboratory's director, Richard L. Doan, went to Ames, where he drew up an Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) contract for the Ames Project to produce [...] of pure uranium metal a day. This would be a pilot plant, with the process eventually being transferred to industry. The OSRD contract was superseded by a Manhattan Project contract in November 1942. The initial contract was for $50,000. By 31 December 1945, the face value of contracts let to the Ames Project totaled $6,907,000; but the work was carried out for $4,000,000.|$|E

500|$|Distressed from a {{long stretch}} of poor ratings, NBC {{executives}} placed pressure on Homicide: Life on the Street producers to improve its viewership and become more popular than its higher-rated time-slot competitor, Nash Bridges. Yoshimura and the other producers, however, decided to continue pushing the envelope with [...] "Subway" [...] because they felt the series needed to maintain its quality and survive. [...] "Subway" [...] had to be greenlighted by NBC before a script could be written, and Yoshimura anticipated backlash about the episode. He said, [...] "Every episode, we have trouble with NBC, so this is no different. We've fought that battle, we've had five years of that, so it doesn't matter to us." [...] However, the executives were surprisingly enthusiastic about the premise. Warren Littlefield, then-president of NBC Entertainment, said his <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> [...] "the classic response of a network programmer: 'Oh my God, this is scary, but that he quickly came around to the idea and greenlighted the project.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{momentum}} of the German ground and air attack completely destroyed the Soviet organizational command and control within the first few hours, paralyzing every level of command from the infantry platoon to the Soviet High Command in Moscow. Moscow not only failed to grasp {{the magnitude of the}} catastrophe that confronted the Soviet forces in the border area, but Stalin's <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> also disbelief. At around 07:15, Stalin issued NKO Directive No. 2, which announced the invasion to the Soviet Armed Forces, and called on them to attack Axis forces wherever they had violated the borders and launch air strikes into the border regions of German territory. At around 09:15, Stalin issued NKO Directive No. 3, signed by Marshal Semyon Timoshenko, which now called for a general counteroffensive on the entire front [...] "without any regards for borders" [...] that both men hoped would sweep the enemy from Soviet territory. Stalin's order, which Timoshenko authorized, was not based on a realistic appraisal of the military situation at hand, but commanders passed it along for fear of retribution if they failed to obey; several days passed before the Soviet leadership became aware of the enormity of the opening defeat.|$|E
500|$|Etan Cohen {{created the}} role of Kirk Lazarus {{as a way of}} lampooning the great lengths that some method actors go to depict a role. Downey was {{approached}} by Stiller about the part while on vacation in Hawaii. Downey said on CBS' The Early Show that his <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "This is the stupidest idea I've ever heard!" [...] and that Stiller responded, [...] "Yeah, I know— isn't it great?" [...] In another interview, Downey said that he accepted the part but, having no idea where or even how to start building the character of Lazarus, eventually settled on a jive-esque speech pattern and a ragged bass voice; he then auditioned Lazarus' voice over the phone to Stiller, who approved the characterization immediately. Downey revealed that he modeled the character on actors Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, and Daniel Day-Lewis. The initial script was written for Downey's character to be Irish, but was altered after Downey stated he could improvise better as an Australian (he had previously played a similar outlandish Australian character in the film Natural Born Killers). Downey's practice of remaining in character between takes and even off the film set was also written into the script for his character to perform. Downey required between one and a half to twohours of make-up application. According to Downey, [...] "One makeup artist would start on one side of my face and a second makeup artist would start on the other side, and then they'd meet in the middle." ...|$|E

The <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> allowed to progress to completion before triggering the second reaction in which all necessary solvents, reactants, or catalysts are placed except for the starting reagent for the target reaction. With the appropriate trigger, in most cases unidirectional flux, {{the product of the}} <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> introduced to the second medium allowing a second transformation in the same glass reaction pot—albeit separated by a polymeric membrane.

The use of ionic liquids as tools to control chemical potential across the polymeric membranes making the first pot is discussed based on standard diffusion models—Fickian and Payne’s models. Besides chemical potential, use of ionic liquids as delivery agent for a small amount of a solvent that slightly swells the polymeric membrane, hence increasing flux, is highlighted.
