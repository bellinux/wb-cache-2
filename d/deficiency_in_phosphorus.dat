5000|$|Detecting {{phosphorus}} deficiency {{can take}} multiple forms. A preliminary detection method is a visual inspection of plants. Darker green leaves and purplish or red pigment can indicate a <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>phosphorus.</b> This method however {{can be an}} unclear diagnosis because other plant environment factors can result in similar discoloration symptoms. In commercial or well monitored settings for plants, phosphorus deficiency is diagnosed by scientific testing. Additionally, discoloration in plant leaves only occurs under fairly severe phosphorus deficiency so it is beneficial to planters and farmers to scientifically check phosphorus levels before discoloration occurs. The most prominent method of checking phosphorus levels is by soil testing. The major soil testing methods are Bray 1-P, Mehlich 3, and Olsen methods. Each of these methods are viable but each method has tendencies to be more accurate in known geographical areas. These tests use chemical solutions to extract phosphorus from the soil. The extract must then be analyzed to determine the concentration of the phosphorus. Colorimetry is used to determine this concentration. With {{the addition of the}} phosphorus extract into a colorimeter, there is visual color change of the solution and the degree to this color change is an indicator of phosphorus concentration. To apply this testing method on phosphorus deficiency, the measured phosphorus concentration must be compared to known values. Most plants have established and thoroughly tested optimal soil conditions. If the concentration of phosphorus measured from the colorimeter test is significantly lower than the plant’s optimal soil levels, then it is likely the plant is phosphorus deficient. The soil testing with colorimetric analysis, while widely used, can be subject to diagnostic problems as a result of interference from other present compounds and elements. Additional phosphorus detection methods such as spectral radiance and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP) are also implemented with the goal of improving reading accuracy. According to the World Congress of Soil Scientists, the advantages of these light-based measurement methods are their quickness of evaluation, simultaneous measurements of plant nutrients, and their non-destructive testing nature. Although these methods have experimental based evidence, unanimous approval of the methods has not yet been achieved.|$|E

40|$|In {{the study}} of the {{stoichiometric}} relationship between autotrophs and herbivores, attention has been largely focused on effects of the encountered mismatch between needs and supplies of an element on herbivore growth and ecosystem processes. Herbivore adaptation to poor food quality has rarely been investigated. This study presents a predictive model of feeding, assimilation, digestion and excretion of Daphnia facing a dietary <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>phosphorus.</b> Biochemical compounds in the food were divided into phosphorous and non-phosphorus compounds. It was assumed that Daphnia is able to differently assimilate both types of compounds by regulation of target specific digestive enzymes. Feeding rate was regulated by optimal gut residence time of food particles, and assimilation efficiency by gut residence time and optimal secretion of both classes of gut enzymes. The model predicted the optimal strategy for a consumer facing an elementally imbalanced diet: (1) increase the ingestion rate, and (2) increase the secretion rate of both classes of gut enzymes. It resulted in decreased C and nutrient assimilation efficiencies, increased C feeding costs, and reduced growth rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that these predictions were qualitatively not influenced by parameter values. An alternative model was tested that includes an additive term allowing the direct excretion of C assimilated in excess. Results showed that this strategy is not optimal for the consumer growth rate. In conclusion, the model supports the hypothesis that carbon ingested in excess may generate energy {{that can be used to}} obtain more nutrients by increased feeding rate. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an extensive vertical and longitudinal {{description of the}} biogeochemistry in the whole Mediterranean Sea during the summer 2008. During this strong stratified period, the distribution of nutrients, particulate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP) were investigated along a 3000 km transect (BOUM cruise) crossing the Western and Eastern Mediterranean basins. The partitioning of chemical C, N and P species among all these mineral and organic pools has been analysed to produce a detailed spatial and vertical extended examination of the elemental stoichiometry. Surface Mediterranean waters were depleted in nutrients and the thickness of this depleted layer increased towards the East from about 10 m in the Gulf of Lion to more than 100 m in the Levantine basin, concomitantly to the gradual deepening of the thermocline and nutriclines. We used threshold in oxygen concentration to discriminate the water column in three layers; surface (Biogenic Layer BL), intermediate (Mineralization Layer ML), and deep layer (DL) and to propose a schematic representation of biogeochemical fluxes between the different compartments and to compare {{the functioning of the}} two basins. The stoichiometry revealed a clear longitudinal and vertical gradient in the mineral fraction with a P-depletion evidenced on both dimension. As a consequence of the severe <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> the C:N:P ratios in all pools within the BL largely exceed the Redfield ratios. Despite these gradients, the deep estimated fluxes in the mineral compartment tend towards the canonical Redfield values in both basins. A change in particulate matter composition has been evidenced by a C increase relative to N and P along the whole water column in the western basin and between BL and ML in the eastern one. More surprisingly, a decrease in N relative to P with depth was encountered in the whole Mediterranean Sea. We suggest that there was a more rapid recycling of N than P in intermediate waters (below BL) and a complete use of DOP in surface waters. DOC accumulated in surface waters according to the oligotrophic status but {{this was not the case}} for nitrogen nor phosphorus. Our data clearly showed a noticeable stability of the DOC:DON ratio (12 – 13) in the whole Mediterranean Sea, contradicting the fact that N is recycled faster than C in the DOM but in agreement with a P limitation of bacterial activity. Finally, comparisons between these elemental distributions and ratios along the West-East Mediterranean gradient of trophic status provide new insights for identifying and understanding fundamental interactions between marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems, which will help to predict the impacts of environmental climate changes on the Mediterranean marine ecosystems. Indeed, the outflowing through the various Mediterranean straits have been shown to be changing, the functioning of the BL ecosystem could be impacted, not only by changes in nutrients surface sources but also by changes in deep nutrients one...|$|E
40|$|The Mazowe Valley {{contains}} {{several of}} Zimbabweâ€˜s largest current and closed mining operations. It is densely populated {{and is also}} a major agricultural area. The {{urban and rural areas}} of Bindura, Goromonzi, Shamva, Marondera, Murehwa and Mutoko all draw water from within the Mazowe Valley. Irrigation of commercial crops is also a major water user. Madziwa and Trojan Nickel Mines, located 150 km north-east and 90 north of Harare respectively, are within the Mazowe Valley and are likely to impact negatively on water systems. Mining took place between 1966 and 2000 at Madziwa Mine and is ongoing at Trojan Mine. Nickel was and is still being produced from ore bodies consisting of mainly chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite and pyrite. Waste from underground mining at Trojan and from the mineâ€˜s plant at Madziwa has been disposed on a waste rock dump and a tailings dam respectively. These are the focus of this study. Surface water samples were collected around the waste rock and both surface and groundwater samples were collected around the tailings dump to assess the impacts of the dumps on water chemistry. Water samples were analysed for metals, sulphate and carbonate. Surface waste rock samples and both surface and subsurface tailings samples were collected from the dumps to assess the geochemistry of the waste dumps. All samples were analysed for total elemental concentration. Mineralogical investigations and static tests were performed on some of the samples to assess acid mine drainage production potential of the dumps. Tailings geochemical data show concentration levels of heavy metals, including nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr) and cobalt (Co) that are significantly higher than the level that is considered phytotoxic to plants [100 ppm for Ni, Cr and Cu, and 40 ppm for Co] and a <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>phosphorus</b> (P), a plant nutrient. Static tests indicated that the tailings have a low neutralisation potential and will therefore form acidic drainage. This was confirmed by mineralogical studies, which revealed the weathering of iron sulphides and the presence of minerals with high neutralization potential (carbonates and ferromagnesian silicates) in small quantities (6. 2 ppm), nickel (> 0. 3 ppm) and sulphate (> 500 ppm). Concentrations of metals generally decreased after the effluent had passed through natural wetlands. Chemical analysis of groundwater showed similarly high levels of sulphate. These findings show that acid mine drainage is seeping from the tailings dump and is dissolving and dispersing potentially toxic metals and salts into water systems. The geochemical data showed concentrations of nickel, copper and cobalt in the waste rock dump that are above the phytotoxic limit of plants (100 ppm and 40 ppm respectively). Static test results indicated that the waste rock dump would form near neutral to alkaline drainage. This was confirmed by mineralogical studies that revealed plenty of minerals with high neutralisation potential (e. g. calcite, serpentine and talc). Effluent emanating from the waste rock dump was characterized by near neutral to alkaline pH values (> 6) with high concentrations of sulphate (> 500 ppm) and some metals (e. g. Pb > 1. 0 ppm and Ni > ppm). This confirms the static test results which indicated that the neutralization capacity of the waste dump exceeds its acid generation potential. Thus the neutral drainage is mobilizing potentially toxic elements out of the waste rock dump. Though the pond at the toe of the dump decreases the concentrations elements, they remain sufficient to increase levels of calcium, sulphate, arsenic, and nickel in the Pote River, which is located downstream of the mine. Environmental problems from the tailings and waste rock dumps persist at both mines despite efforts by mine operators to minimize their impacts in line with environmental regulations. However, lack of enforcement of the regulations by relevant authorities causes mine operators not to be sufficiently compliant. The waste rock dump and tailings dump have negative visual impacts on the environment. In addition, seepage from the dumps is causing the contents of metals and sulphates in surface and groundwater to exceed limits for safe effluent, drinking water, domestic use, irrigation and livestock agriculture, thereby putting the health of local communities, plants and animals at health risks. The impacts are more severe at Madziwa Mine. There is therefore need for enforcement of environmental legislation to check the challenges of acid mine drainage from mine waste dumps.,Bindura Nickel Corporatio...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{begins with}} {{a brief review of}} the history of phosphorus, {{followed}} by a description of the role of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>in</b> food security and technology development. It is then followed by discussions on critical issues related to sustainable phosphorus management, such as phosphorus-related pollution, the innovation potential of phosphate fertilizers and fertilizer production, uneven geographical distribution of phosphate resources, transparency of reserves, economic scarcity, and price volatility of phosphate products. In order to identify the <b>deficiencies</b> <b>in</b> the world’s <b>phosphorus</b> flows, we utilize the “not too little–not too much” principle (including the Ecological Paracelsus Principle), which is essential to understanding the issues of pollution, supply security, losses, sinks and efficiency of phosphorus use, and the challenges to closing the phosphorus cycle by recycling and other means. When linking the supply–demand (SD) chain view on phosphorus with a Substance or Material Flux Analysis, the key actors <b>in</b> the global <b>phosphorus</b> cycle become evident. It is apparent that sustainable phosphorus management is a very complex issue that requires a global transdisciplinary process to arrive at a consensus solution. This holds true both from an epistemological (i. e., knowledge) perspective as well as from a sustainable management perspective. To gain a complete picture of the current phosphorus cycle, one requires knowledge from a broad spectrum of sciences, ranging from geology, mining, and chemical engineering; soil and plant sciences; and all facets of agricultural and environmental sciences to economics, policy, and behavioral and decision science. As phosphorus flows are bound to specific historical, sociocultural, and geographical issues as well as financial and political interests, the understanding of the complex contextual constraints requires knowledge of related sciences. The need for transdisciplinary processes is equally evident from a sustainable transitioning perspective. In order to identify options, drivers, and barriers to improving phosphorus flows, one requires processes in; capacity building that may be changed and consensus building on the phosphorus use practices that must be changed and maintained, along with recognition of how changes <b>in</b> <b>phosphorus</b> use <b>in</b> the current market may be framed.

40|$|Abstract The {{impact on}} cell wall (CW) of the <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> {{nitrogen}} (–N), <b>phosphorus</b> (–P) or sulphur (–S), known to impair essential metabolic pathways, {{was investigated in}} the economically important fruit species Vitis vinifera L. Using cuttings as an experimental model a reduction in total internode number and altered xylem shape was observed. Under –N an increased internode length was also seen. CW composition, visualised after staining with calcofluor white, Toluidine blue and ruthenium red, showed decreased cellulose in all stresses and increased pectin content in recently formed internodes under –N compared to the control. Using CW-epitope specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), lower amounts of extensins incorporated in the wall were also observed under –N and –P conditions. Conversely, increased pectins with a low degree of methyl-esterification and richer in long linear 1, 5 -arabinan rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) side chains were observed under –N and –P in mature internodes which, in the former condition, were able to form dimeric association through calcium ions. –N was the only condition in which 1, 5 -arabinan branched RG- content was not altered, as –P and –S older internodes showed, respectively, lower and higher amounts of this polymer. Higher xyloglucan content in older internodes was also observed under –N. The results suggest that impairments of specific CW components led {{to changes in the}} deposition of other polymers to promote stiffening of the CW. The unchanged extensin amount observed under –S may contribute to attenuating the effects on the CW integrity caused by this stress. Our work showed that, in organized V. vinifera tissues, modifications in a given CW component can be compensated by synthesis of different polymers and/or alternative linking between polymers. The results also pinpoint different strategies at the CW level to overcome mineral stress depending on how essential they are to cell growth and plant development...|$|R
40|$|The {{noteworthy}} fine remodeling {{that plant}} cell walls (CWs) undergo {{to adapt to}} developmental, physiological and environmental cues and the observation that its composition and dynamics differ between species represents an opportunity to couple crop species agronomic studies with research on CW modifications. Vitis vinifera {{is one of the}} most important crops from an economic point-of-view due to the high value of the fruit, predominantly for winemaking. The availability of some information related to this species’ CWs allows researching its responses to imposed conditions that affect the plant’s development. Mineral <b>deficiency,</b> <b>in</b> particular nitrogen, <b>phosphorus,</b> potassium and sulfur, strongly affects plant metabolism, reducing both growth and crop yield. Despite the importance of mineral nutrition in development, its influence on CW synthesis and modifications is still insufficiently documented. Addressing this knowledge gap, V. vinifera experimental models were used to study CW responses to imposed mineral depletion in unorganized (callus) and organized (shoots) tissues. The discussion of the obtained results is the main focus of this review. Callus and shoots submitted to mineral restriction are impaired in specific CW components, predominantly cellulose. Reorganization on structure and deposition of several other polymers, in particular the degree and pattern of pectin methyl-esterification and the amount of xyloglucan (XyG), arabinan and extensin, is also observed. In view of recently proposed CW models that consider biomechanical hotspots and direct linkages between pectins and XyG/cellulose, the outcome of these modifications in explaining maintenance of CW integrity through compensatory stiffening can be debated. Nutrient stresses do not affect evenly all tissues with undifferentiated callus tissues showing more pronounced responses, followed by shoot mature internodes, and then newly formed internodes. The impact of nitrogen depletion leads to more noticeable responses, supporting this nutrient’s primary role in plant development and metabolism. The consequential compensatory mechanisms highlight the pivotal role of CW in rearranging under environmental stresses...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{irradiation}} of rabbits with ultra-violet light, with a consequent hypertrophy of the parathyroid glands, {{resulted in}} {{some degree of}} protection to these animals, when part of the parathyroid tissue was extirpated. This fact indicates that the remaining hyperplastic tissue was potentially active, and that the increased factor of safety represented by this condition of the remaining tissue resulted in less loss of blood calcium, a more rapid initiation of recovery, and an absence of the rise <b>in</b> the inorganic <b>phosphorus</b> of the blood serum which was a characteristic result of partial parathyroidectomy in normal rabbits. A fall in calcium in all the irradiated rabbits, without a corresponding rise <b>in</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> shows that the drop in calcium is the primary reaction, and a rise <b>in</b> <b>phosphorus</b> a secondary reaction following parathyroidectomy. But {{the relation of the}} rise <b>in</b> <b>phosphorus</b> to the development of tetany remains obscure...|$|R

40|$|Zinc (Zn) <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> animals {{became of}} {{interest}} until the 1950 s. In this paper, progresses in researches on physiology of Zn <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> animals, phytate effect on bioavailability of Zn, {{and role of}} phytase <b>in</b> healing Zn <b>deficiency</b> of animals were reviewed. Several studies demonstrated that Zn is recycled via the pancreas; the problem of Zn deficiency was controlled by Zn homeostasis. The endogenous secretion of Zn is considered as an important factor influencing Zn deficiency, and the critical molar ratio is 10. Phytate (inositol hexaphosphate) constituted up to 90 % of the organically bound <b>phosphorus</b> <b>in</b> seeds. Great improvement {{has been made in}} recent years on isolating and measuring phytate, and its structure is clear. Phytate is considered to reduce Zn bioavailability in animal. Phytase is the enzyme that hydrolyzes phytate and is present in yeast, rye bran, wheat bran, barley, triticale, and many bacteria and fungi. Zinc nutrition and bioavailability can be enhanced by addition of phytase to animal feeds. Therefore, using phytase as supplements, the most prevalent Zn <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> animals may be effectively corrected without the mining and smelting of several tons of zinc daily needed to correct this deficiency by fortification worldwide...|$|R
