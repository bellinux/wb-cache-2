5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with <b>further</b> <b>research.</b> All three {{are thought to have}} diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled <b>further</b> <b>research</b> {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E

5|$|Auricularia auricula-judae {{has been}} the subject of {{research}} into possible medicinal applications. Experiments in the 1980s concluded that two glucans isolated from the species showed potent antitumour properties when used on mice artificially implanted with Sarcoma 180 tumours. This was despite the conclusion of earlier research indicating that, while aqueous extracts from several other fungal species had antitumour effects, extracts from A.auricula-judae did not. <b>Further,</b> <b>research</b> on genetically diabetic mice showed that a polysaccharide extracted from A.auricula-judae had a hypoglycemic effect; mice fed with food including the polysaccharide showed reduced plasma glucose, insulin, urinary glucose and food intake.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. <b>Further</b> <b>research</b> showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. <b>Further</b> <b>research</b> shows that they can tell in one bite {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E

5|$|Fermi {{was among}} the first to warn {{military}} leaders about the potential impact of nuclear energy, giving a lecture on the subject at the Navy Department on 18March 1939. The response fell short of what he had hoped for, although the Navy agreed to provide $1,500 towards <b>further</b> <b>research</b> at Columbia. Later that year, Szilárd, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller sent the famous letter signed by Einstein to U.S. President Roosevelt, warning that Nazi Germany was likely to build an atomic bomb. In response, Roosevelt formed the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Further</b> <b>research</b> has {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a second species, G. latidens, from slightly older rocks in Montana than the classic gryposaur localities of Alberta.

When the old couple watching Tooms depart and Tooms is visited by Monte, he kills him and consumes the final liver he needs before his thirty-year hibernation. After discovering Monte's body, Mulder and Scully head to Tooms' former residence at 66 Exeter Street, {{which has been}} demolished and replaced with a shopping mall. Inside, Mulder crawls below an escalator and finds Tooms' nest. Tooms bursts out, covered in bile, and pursues Mulder, who {{makes it to the}} surface and activates the escalator, trapping and killing Tooms.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad.
