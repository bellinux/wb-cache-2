40|$|Pre-Print Journal Article,The {{importance}} of foreign trade {{in general and}} exporting in particular to a countryâ€™s economy cannot be over emphasised. It is through exporting that a country earns <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> to <b>buy</b> essential products it does not produce. Developing countries, Zimbabwe included, {{have in the past}} relied heavily on the export of primary products from the agricultural and mining sectors. However, falling prices and depletion of natural resources has seen many developing countries turning to the manufacturing sector for export earnings. Zimbabwe is no exception.

50|$|Assume that a country's {{currency}} is depreciating. To prevent this, the country's central bank {{may decide to}} intervene in the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market. To prop up the value of the nation's currency, the central bank may resort to creating artificial demand for its currency. It can do this by using some of its <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> reserves to <b>buy</b> local currency. The resulting demand stops the currency's depreciation but also acts to reduce the domestic money supply in two ways. First the bank is directly removing some of the nation's currency from circulation as it buys it up. Secondly, if the central bank overshoots the target, the intervention can create or worsen a current account deficit due to the propped-up exchange rate being more favorable for importers than for exporters. This deficit sends currency out of the country, further decreasing liquidity.|$|R
50|$|Fixed {{exchange}} rates are usually maintained {{by a combination}} of legally enforced capital controls and the central bank standing ready to purchase or sell domestic currency in <b>exchange</b> for <b>foreign</b> currency. Under fixed {{exchange rates}}, persistent capital outflows or trade deficits will involve the central bank using its <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> reserves to <b>buy</b> domestic currency, to prop up demand for the domestic currency and thus to prop up its value. However, this activity is limited by the amount of foreign currency reserves the central bank owns; the prospect of running out of these reserves and having to abandon this process may lead a central bank to devalue its currency in order to stop the foreign currency outflows.|$|R

2500|$|Gandhi {{inherited}} a weak and troubled economy. Fiscal {{problems associated with}} the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence. The government responded by taking steps to liberalize the economy, and by agreeing to the devaluation of the currency in return for the restoration of foreign aid. The economy managed to recover in 1966 and ended up growing at 4.1% over 1966–1969. But, much of that growth was offset {{by the fact that the}} external aid promised by the United States government and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), meant to ease the short-run costs of adjustment to a liberalized economy, never materialized. American policy makers had complained of continued restrictions imposed on the economy. At the same time, Indo-US relations were straining due to Gandhi's criticism of the American bombing campaign in Vietnam. While it was thought, at the time, and for decades after, that President Johnson's policy of withholding food grain shipments was to coerce Indian support for the war, in fact, it was to offer India rainmaking technology that he wanted to use as a counterweight to China's possession of the atomic bomb. In light of the circumstances, liberalization became politically suspect and was soon abandoned. Grain diplomacy and currency devaluation became matters of intense national pride in India. After the bitter experience with Johnson, Gandhi decided not to request food aid in the future. Moreover, Gandhi's government resolved never again to become [...] "so vulnerably dependent" [...] on aid, and painstakingly began building up substantial <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> reserves. When food stocks slumped after poor harvests in 1972, the government made it a point to use <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> to <b>buy</b> US wheat commercially rather than seek resumption of food aid.|$|R
