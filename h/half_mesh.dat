Instead {{of solving the}} equation in an irregular Cartesian geometry, we formulate the equation in elliptical coordinates. The solver relies on representing the solution as a truncated Fourier series, then solving the differential equations of Fourier coefficients by finite difference discretizations. Using a grid by shifting <b>half</b> <b>mesh</b> away from the pole and incorporating the derived numerical boundary value, the difficulty of coordinate singularity can be elevated easily. Unlike the case of 2 D disk domain, the present difference equation for each Fourier mode is coupled with its conjugate mode through the numerical boundary value near the pole; thus, those two modes are solved simultaneously. Both second- and fourth-order accurate schemes for Dirichlet and Neumann problems are presented. In particular, the fourth-order accuracy {{can be achieved by}} a three-point compact stencil which is in contrast to a five-point long stencil for the disk case. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|AbstractWe derive {{a family}} of labeled, undirected graphs from the Stirling table of the first kind and {{investigate}} properties of these graphs {{as a basis for}} multiprocessor interconnection networks. The diameter of a Stirling network with n nodes is ⌈log 2 (n+ 1) ⌉ − 1, the average distance is less than 103, and the number of links is O(n 1. 59). Stirling networks can be inductively specified with incrementability of one, and adjacencies can be determined solely by the node addresses. Many standard networks including full-ringed binary trees, tree machines, meshes and <b>half</b> <b>mesh</b> of trees are shown to be embedded in these combinatorial networks. Properties of Stirling networks are analyzed and related to the underlying mathematical structure. We present a routing scheme that is deadlock free, avoids congestions, and can be executed on the fly by bit manipulation of node labels. A methodology for modular construction of these networks yields estimates for the VLSI area required for their layout. Fault-tolerance properties are analyzed, a vulner-ability of 1 is proved, and fault-handling abilities in presence of faulty nodes or links are demonstrated.

40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} novel {{technique}} of laparoscopic 10 mm Single Port Access IntraPeritoneal Onlay Mesh (SPA-IPOM) using bioresorbable composite mesh fixed with Endoclose suture (percutaneous subcutaneous suture) in 3 cases of bilateral inguinal hernia. Methods: Laparoscopic SPA-IPOM is done through a 10 mm trocar with one 10 mm instrument that has 5 mm optical lens and 5 mm channel for grasper. After inserting 10 mm trocar at umbilicus using semi-open technique, intraperitoneal anatomical landmark of inguinal her-nia is identified. A 10 × 15 cm pre-tied bioresorbable composite mesh is then placed to cover hernia defect {{and all three}} potential area of indirect, direct and femoral hernia. Using Endoclose? needle, each pair of pre-tied sutures is retrieved percutaneously through a needle wound and extracorporeal tied with knot in subcutaneous space. After the upper <b>half</b> of <b>mesh</b> is sutured to the posterior surface of abdominal wall, the lower <b>half</b> of <b>mesh</b> is fixed by hernia tacker to Symphysis Pubis, Cooper Ligament and Iliopubic tract. Re-sults: Three men, average 48 year olds were operated by laparoscopic 10 mm SPA-IPOM for bilateral in-guinal hernia repair using bioresorbable composite mesh. Average operative time was 36 minutes. No imme-diate complication. All patients were discharge on the 2 nd post-operative day and average 6 months follow up has no recurrence. Conclusions: Laparoscopic SPA-IPOM is an optional operation and {{is much easier to}} be performed. Benefits include operative time saving, cosmesis, early discharge and early return to work. Bio-resorbable composite mesh prevents bowel adhesion, however, is much more expensive. Long term follow up study for complications and recurrence is needed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm {{to enhance the}} capabilities of generating all hexahedral finite element meshes by the sweeping process. Traditional sweeping techniques are very useful and robust. They create meshes by projecting an existing single-surface mesh along a specified trajectory to a specified singletarget surface.

40|$|In {{conventional}} prediction {{methods for}} turbulent flow influence on surface properties, very small mesh sizes and considerable computational effort {{is required to}} adequately resolve the intense velocity and temperature profile variations {{that occur in the}} wall-layer region. In this study, an approach is described wherein an outer region numerical solution is smoothly matched to a set of embedded analytic profile functions in the near-wall region; these wall-layer profile functions having been derived through consideration of the coherent structure of the time-dependent near-wall flow provide analytic expressions for the mean velocity and enthalpy profiles in the wall layer. The concept is demonstrated through example applications to turbulent boundary-layer flows in two dimensions.

40|$|In the {{calculation}} of turbulent boundary layers, {{a large number of}} mesh points are required to adequately resolve the intense variation in the velocity and enthalpy in the near-wall region. A substantial reduction in computational effort may be realized by representing the velocity and enthalpy profiles in the wall layer by analytical embedded functions. The effectively inviscid flow in the outer part of the boundary layer may then be resolved by employing a relatively coarser mesh. To obtain complete profiles, the outer numerical solution is matched asymptotically to the inner wall-layer analytical solution. To date, this approach has been restricted to two-dimensional flows; in the present study, a method which may be utilized for turbulent boundary layers with heat transfer in a plane of symmetry is developed as a first step in the application of the embedded-function method to full three-dimensional flows. The present method uses only about <b>half</b> as many <b>mesh</b> points as that required in a conventional procedure, which calculates the flow {{all the way to the}} wall, but there is no degradation in accuracy of the computed results...|$|R
30|$|In our study, PRF {{membranes}} were additionally to collagen membranes used {{to cover}} the CAD-CAM mesh. The aim of this clinical approach was to improve and accelerate wound healing. The results with the low exposure rates and the sufficient augmentation heights indicated that these PRF membranes are a promising technique. However, due to low case number {{in the control group}} without a PRF membrane, definitive conclusions are not possible. The positive effects of PRF regarding wound healing may be explained by the contents of the PRF clot. These clots contain stem cells, fibrin, platelets, and leucocytes [26, 27]. Furthermore, PRF membranes have a sustained release of high quantities of the growth factors TGFbeta- 1, PDGF-AB, and VEGF and coagulation matricellular glycoprotein (thrombospondin- 1, TSP- 1) during 7  days [27]. Therefore, PRF is a biodegradable scaffold that promotes the development of microvascularization and epithelial cell migration to its surface [28, 29]. There are several clinical studies and systematic reviews that show the promising potential of PRF for bone and soft tissue regeneration [28, 30, 31]. Torres et al. examined the effect of platelet-rich plasma in preventing mesh exposure by using it to cover conventional meshes [32]. In this study, 43 alveolar bone augmentations with the mesh technique using anorganic bovine bone as graft material were performed. In half of the patients, the meshes were covered with platelet-rich plasma, whereas in the other <b>half,</b> the <b>meshes</b> were not. The results showed that mesh exposure was significantly less in the platelet-rich plasma group as well as that bone augmentation was higher in the platelet-rich plasma group than in the control group. In conclusion, these results promote the use of PRP/PRF in augmentation procedures.|$|R
40|$|Three {{techniques}} {{are used to}} introduce wire models into Transmission Line Matrix (TLM) Electromagnetic field solvers. The first involves the setting up of a one dimensional time-domain transmission-line model {{of a pair of}} wires. Voltages and currents coupled into the wires can be obtained from the incident fields. The differentials of these fields are used as source terms of the one dimensional model. Results obtained by this model were compared with frequency domain results and good agreement was found. Non-linear loads can easily be modelled, and the response of a simple non-linear device is presented. Wires of realistic radii can only be modelled in 2 - or 3 -dimensional TLM by using a fine mesh. Using progressively finer meshes the modelled radius converges to an unexpected result. The problem lies with the two forms of the TLM mesh, each giving a different modelled radius. This can lead to velocity of propagation errors of up to 10 %. A short-circuit node was developed but this has poor propagational characteristics and a radius equal to <b>half</b> the <b>mesh</b> spacing. Diakoptics was re-examined and some operating conditions suggested. Frequency Domain Diakoptics was also introduced and tested. Time Domain Diakoptics was used to create blocks of space containing wires which could be pre-solved for future use. Since a very fine mesh was used to describe the wire, but a coarse mesh was used {{for the remainder of the}} geometry there is a very crude approximation between the two meshes. This effect meant that long wires could not be constructed out of a multitude of pre-solved short-wires. A longer wire could be pre-solved as a single element and a reasonable modelled radius obtained. The technique became unstable after about 750 iterations. Comparisons between the wire models developed show reasonable agreement. The one-dimensional method was the easiest technique to use...|$|R

As to arms, each man had one of the long single-barrelled fowling-pieces that are supplied by the Fur Company to the natives, and are styled Indian guns. Stanley had a double-barrelled flint fowling-piece; and Frank had a rifle, besides a single gun of a description somewhat finer than that supplied to the Indians.

3000|$|In this paper, {{as far as}} we know, the {{numerical}} solution of the singularly perturbed boundary value problem containing both control parameter and integral condition is first being considered. For {{the numerical}} solution of such problems, a specific approach is required to construct the appropriate difference scheme and examining the error analysis. The scheme is constructed by the method of integral identities with the use of appropriate quadrature rules with the remainder terms in integral form. The aim here is to construct an ε-uniformly numerical method which gives ε-uniformly convergent numerical approximations to solve problem (1)–(3). For this, we use a finite difference scheme on a Bakhvalov mesh which is dense in the initial layer. The Bakhvalov mesh is dependent on ε and mesh points have to be condensed in a neighborhood of t= 0 [...] in order to resolve the initial layer. In the Bakhvalov <b>mesh,</b> basically <b>half</b> of the <b>mesh</b> points are concentrated in O(εε [...]) neighborhood of the point t= 0 and the remaining half forms a uniform mesh on the rest of [0, T] [...] (see [2, 4, 10, 30, 32, 34, 35]). We show that the proposed scheme is uniformly convergent in the discrete maximum norm accuracy of O(N^- 1) on Bakhvalov meshes. Note that, in [10], the first order convergent difference scheme in Bakhvalov type mesh under the first type boundary conditions for equation (1.1) was presented. Also, in the above-mentioned work [9] that includes integral boundary condition, while conditions (2.1) and (4.8) are generally provided for sufficiently small values of ε, as the integral boundary condition of our work is more general, and the convergence is uniform for both small and moderate values of perturbation parameter ε.|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis / aims of study: Study the {{efficacy}} and complications of a mini sling {{used for the}} treatment of female stress incontinence. The material used is Mini Sling Ophira, tha is an anatomical approach that involves placing a midurethral low-tension tape anchored to the obturator internus muscles bilaterally at the level of tendineous arc. Study design, materials and methods From February 2008 to March 2009, 109 female patients (mean age: 53 years old) with stress urinary incontinence underwent outpatient management using the Ophira Mini Sling System. This Mini sling System has a polypropylene monofilament mesh, held between two self-anchoring polypropylene columns in a fishbone design connected to a delivering mini trocar. During the follow-up, patients were reviewed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months as to urinary incontinence, lower urinary tract symptoms and dyspareunia. The pad test was used in the objective evaluation of urine loss. The procedure was carried under local anesthesia, using 10 ml of 2 % lydocaine solution, injected at the midurethra towards the vaginal fornix, advancing 2 cm in the internus muscles. A vertical 1 -cm long vaginal incision was performed at 1 cm from the urethral meatus. Minimal vaginal dissection was performed laterally towards the ascending ramus of the ischiopubic bone, preserving the endopelvic fascia. The delivery trocar was introduced through the small vaginal incision, guided by the surgeon’s index finger previously introduced at the vaginal forn ix to avoid vaginal wall perforation. Once the needle was felt at the fornix, the tip was introduced towards the obturator internus muscle, 1 cm above the vaginal fornix. When <b>half</b> of the <b>mesh</b> was within the incision, the deploying bottom at the handle of the mini trocar was retracted, deploying the sling was in place, allowing for the self-anchoring fishbone columns to provide strong primary fixation.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} measure the behavioral responses of lobsters, Homarus americanus (Milne-Edwards), to reductions in salinity. In the first experiment animals were placed in a 3 ft diameter tank that was divided in <b>half</b> by plastic <b>mesh.</b> Spontaneously active lobsters were able to move between {{the two halves of}} the tank by passing through either of two conduits. The conduits were equipped with optical sensors to monitor the passage of animals, and a perfusion system to control the salinity of the area in, and around, the conduit. When the salinity in the vicinity of both conduits was the same (28 – 32 ppt), lobsters exhibited no preference for either conduit. However, when the salinity in one of the conduits was lowered, lobsters preferred to pass through the high salinity (20 – 25 ppt) conduit rather than the one with low salinity (10 – 15 ppt). In addition, females appeared to be more selective in their preference and exhibited higher overall activity than males when exposed to reduced salinity. In the second experiment, individual lobsters were placed in a shelter at one end of a long seawater table and exposed to seawater of gradually decreasing salinity. The salinity required to cause a movement out of a shelter, i. e. an avoidance response, was recorded. On average, lobsters first ventured small distances (3 ̆c one body length) out of their shelter when the salinity reached a level of 18. 4 ppt ± 1. 42 (SEM), and definitively moved away from their shelter (3 ̆e one body length) when levels approached 12. 62 ppt ± 1. 59. Although it was not statistically significant, females again seemed to be either more sensitive to salinity or found it more aversive, because they tended to initiate movements at salinities greater than those required to influence males. These behavioral data indicate that: (1) adult lobsters are capable of detecting changes in salinity which are comparable to the levels found during natural fluctuations in coastal bays and estuaries; (2) when exposed to low salinity of sufficient magnitude, they attempt to avoid it, and; (3) females appear to be more sensitive to drops in salinity and/or they find it more aversive. Previous studies have demonstrated that estuarine lobster populations are dominated by males and that there are seasonal migrations of lobsters into, and out of, estuaries. We conclude that the behavioral responses of male and female lobsters to low salinity may determine, in part, the distribution and movements of lobsters in estuarine habitats...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{incidental}} catches of sub-legal flounder (smaller than 25 cm in TL) in the cuttlefish trammel-net fishery in Southern Kyushu, Japan, a species-selective trammel-net was developed. On the basis of preliminary studies; (1) observation of behaviour of cuttlefish in a tank and (2) survey of vertical positions of captured cuttlefish and flounder in commercial fishing, semi-demersal trammel-nets which have a space around the bottom were designed. The control net which was similar to commercial nets used {{in the region and}} two types of test nets were constructed. In order to make a space, the main net webbing and the footrope were rigged with brown-coloured PA span twine # 36. The rigging was vertically zigzag with the width same as that of the outer net, while, two variations were given to the height, i. e. one or <b>half</b> an outer <b>mesh</b> height. These are referred to as test- 1 and test- 2 nets. A total of 20 operations were conducted in 9 to 23 m-deep and sandy/muddy bottomed grounds by two fishing vessels using a set of two each of control, test- 1 and test- 2 nets respectively. The submersion period of time was the same as that in commercial operations, i. e. 3 to 5 days. There {{was no significant difference in}} the numbers of cuttlefish caught by the three types of nets (56 by control, 54 by test- 1 and 40 by test- 2 nets). The catches of small individuals of flatfishes by the three nets (27, 17 and 3) were significantly different. There was no significant difference in large individuals of flatfishes caught by the three nets (16, 15 and 14). There was also no significant difference in other finfishes from the three nets (171, 171 and 126). The catches including crablet, starfish and shellfishes from the three nets (95, 43 and 58) were significantly different. The experiment was evaluated as having achieved the objectives. The vertical distributions of the caught cuttlefish were not significantly different among the three nets, although there was a common tendency that the lower positions of net caught a larger number of cuttlefish. Flatfishes were also caught in the lowest positions of net. The vertical distributions of small individuals of flatfishes caught by the two test nets were similar to such a distribution excluding the number from the lowest position of the control net. No decline of cuttlefish caught by the test nets was considered to be attributable to the brown-coloured PA span twine used for rigging at the space which might enhance cuttlefish staying around the nets. A hypothesis was proposed that no loss of large individuals of flatfishes occurred for the test nets, while, reduction of small ones was attributable to the swimming layers being different between large and small flatfish and spaces might largely affect the small ones which are conjectured to swim in lower layers. ...|$|R
