500|$|Sunset Overdrives {{gameplay}} {{was also}} commended by many reviewers. Prell compared the game favorably to Jet Grind Radio, Saints Row The Third, Infamous, and Ratchet & Clank. He singled out the traversal system, which {{he thought was}} fluid and well-executed. He added that the fast travel system was not useful in this game, since players can {{find a lot of}} fun by simply traveling between different locations in the game's world. He thought that all of the game's systems intertwined with each other, and ultimately made the game a complete and worthwhile experience. Reiner echoed similar thoughts, and considered getting around Sunset City fun for players. He added that the traversal system increased the game's replay value. However, he was disappointed by the game's occasionally repetitive mission design. Sliva and Brown shared similar thoughts, with the latter saying that the game featured too many fetch quests. Patterson disliked the game's traversal; he found that the system was frustrating at times. However, he thought that this problem [...] lessened as players unlocked new moves and skills. Gies felt overwhelmed by the traversal options. He added that Insomniac had successfully created a system that was accessible for ordinary players, while creating challenges <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> master the system. However, he noted the camera system may not able to track the movement of the character accurately. He further commended the game's world design, and described it {{as one of the most}} [...] "navigationally sophisticated" [...] worlds he had ever experienced in a game. [...] Bischoff considered the shooting mechanic [...] "loose", but thought that the problem was overshadowed by the game's forgiving aiming and steady difficulty curve. Lucas Sullivan also criticized the mechanic, calling it [...] "inconsistent".|$|E

2500|$|Other factors {{contributing}} to the rapid adoption of plug-in electric vehicles are the relative small size of the country, which reduces range anxiety (the Netherlands stretches about [...] east to west); {{a long tradition of}} environmental activism; high gasoline prices ( [...] per gallon as of January 2013), which make the cost of running a car on electricity five times cheaper; and also some EV leasing programs provide free or discounted gasoline-powered vehicles <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take a vacation driving long distances.
