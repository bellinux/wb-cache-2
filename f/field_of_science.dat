5|$|Hergé first {{devised the}} idea of sending Tintin {{on a mission to}} the Moon while he was working on Prisoners of the Sun (1949). His {{decision}} to move into the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> fiction might have been influenced by his friendly rivalry with his colleague Edgar P. Jacobs, who had recently had success with his own science fiction comic, The Secret of the Swordfish (1950–53). He decided {{that it would be a}} two-volume story arc, as had proved successful with his earlier arcs, The Secret of the Unicorn (1943) and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944), and The Seven Crystal Balls (1948) and Prisoners of the Sun. He had initially intended on beginning this story after the culmination of Prisoners of the Sun, but both his wife Germaine Remi and his close friend Marcel Dehaye convinced him to proceed with Land of Black Gold (1950), a story that he had previously left unfinished, instead.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the Higher Education Strategy Associates, an {{organization}} that ranks universities {{on the basis of}} their research strength, ranked McMaster tenth nationally in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> and engineering and seventh nationally in the field of social sciences and humanities. The 2016 Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities, a ranking based on a university's scientific output, ranked McMaster 111th in the world and sixth in Canada. HEEACT placed McMaster 95th in the world and fifth nationally for its overall research performance. The University also placed in several of their subject rankings. In their 2016 ranking for social science, McMaster ranked 68th in the world and seventh in Canada. In the same year's ranking, for the field of clinical medicine McMaster ranked 51st in the world and fourth in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Marburger's {{tenure as}} Director {{was the longest}} {{in the history of}} that post. After the September 11 attacks, he helped to {{establish}} the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology within the new Department of Homeland Security. He has been called a central player opposing new restrictions of international scientific exchanges of people and ideas after the attacks. He later was responsible for reorienting the nation's space policy after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, and played an important part in the nation's re-entry into the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor program. Marburger was also known for his support of the emerging <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> of science policy, which seeks to analyze how science policy decisions affects a nation's ability to produce and benefit from innovation.|$|E

Coleman, who {{discovered}} leptin, Richard Bader, noted {{for his work}} on the atoms in molecules theory, Harold E. Johns, who pioneered the use of cobalt-60 in the treatment of cancer, Karl Clark, who pioneered the separation method to extract bitumen from the oil sands, and Steve Mann, a researcher and inventor in the field of computational photography. Notable faculty members include chemist Ronald Gillespie, who helped shape VSEPR theory, as well as David Sackett and Gordon Guyatt, whose research team was largely credited for largely establishing the methodologies used in evidence-based medicine. Prominent alumni in the field of social sciences was Harold Innis, who helped shape communication theory and the staples thesis, and sociologist Henry Giroux, one of the founding theorists of critical pedagogy.|$|E
5|$|Public {{sociology}} {{refers to}} an approach to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a style of sociology rather than a particular method, theory, or set of political values. This approach is primarily associated with Michael Burawoy who contrasted it with professional sociology, a form of academic sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists. Public sociology {{is also part of}} the broader <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> communication or science journalism. In a distinct but similar vein, applied sociology, also known as clinical sociology, policy sociology or sociological practice, applies knowledge derived from sociological research to solve societal problems.|$|E
5|$|Scholar-officials and gentry also {{distinguished}} {{themselves through}} their intellectual pursuits. While {{some such as}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and Su Song (1020–1101) dabbled in every known <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>science,</b> study, and statecraft, Song elites were generally most interested in the leisurely pursuits of composing and reciting poetry, art collecting and antiquarianism. Yet even this pursuit {{could turn into a}} scholarly one. It was the official, historian, poet, and essayist Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) who compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early epigraphy and archeology. Shen Kuo even took an interdisciplinary approach to archeological study, in order to aid his work in astronomy, mathematics, and recording ancient musical measures. The scholar-official and historian Zeng Gong (1019–1083) reclaimed last chapters of the ancient Zhan Guo Ce, proofreading and editing the version that would become the accepted modern version. The ideal official and gentry scholars were also expected to employ these intellectual pursuits {{for the good of the}} community, such as writing local histories or gazetteers. In the case of Shen Kuo and Su Song, their pursuits in academic fields such as classifying pharmaceuticals and improving calendrical science through court work in astronomy fit this ideal.|$|E
