It consists of a large tank of water, over which a volunteer sits on a collapsing seat. When a ball strikes a target, the seat collapses, [...] "dunking" [...] the person into the water. People will often volunteer to get dunked fully clothed for a humorous effect.|$|E

[...] According to the director's commentary on the DVD, the <b>dunking</b> <b>machine</b> was constructed specifically for the film and was an exact duplicate of the actual one used by the Navy. As of 2010, Mountain View Elementary is closed and is now home to the Mountain View Commons, which holds the police station, food bank and the YMCA, the latter of which holds the pool.|$|E
