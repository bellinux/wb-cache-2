5|$|Following the turnover, Indiana's offense {{began work}} at its 32-yard line. Despite the {{opportunity}} {{presented by the}} interception, the Hoosiers were unable to <b>gain</b> a first down and punted back to Virginia Tech. Tech's Steve Sanders returned the kick to the Tech 27-yard line, and Tech's offense returned to the field. The Hokie offense was no more successful than Indiana's had been, and Tech punted after going three and out. Following the kick and a short return, the Hoosiers began work at their 41-yard line. After being stopped for no <b>gain</b> on two consecutive plays, Paci completed a long pass to Tech's 40-yard line for the Hoosiers' first first down of the second half. Indiana continued advancing the ball via short passes, but came up oneyard short of a first down.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the distribution of}} the benefits associated with reductions in capital <b>gains</b> taxes. Plans which reduce capital <b>gains</b> taxes by excluding a fixed fraction of capital <b>gains</b> from taxable income, by taxing real rather than nominal <b>gains,</b> and by using a sliding scale capital <b>gains</b> exclusion are considered. We reach three main conclusions. 1. Using plausible measures of economic status, capital <b>gains</b> receipts are highly concentrated among those with high incomes. The richest 2 percent of Americans receive more than 50 percent of all capital <b>gains.</b> Claims that capital <b>gains</b> recipients only appear to be rich because their capital <b>gains</b> income is transitory are not supported by longitudinal data. Likewise, claims that a large fraction of the benefits from capital <b>gains</b> tax reductions flow to middle income taxpayers result from failing to consider tax shelters.

Now inside Virginia Tech territory, Linton ran for a five-yard <b>gain,</b> which {{was followed by a}} pass from Keldorf to Linton, who gained 26 yards on the play. Following the catch, North Carolina had a first down at the Virginia Tech 16-yard line. Linton left the field limping slightly, and backup running Mike Geter replaced him, then ran for four yards up the middle. Geter was stopped for no <b>gain</b> on the next play, and a third down pass by Keldorf fell incomplete. North Carolina kicker Josh McGee entered the game to attempt a 29-yard field goal, which was good. With 9:15 remaining in the quarter, North Carolina took a 30 lead.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In a {{cross-border}} takeover, the {{tax base}} associated with future capital <b>gains</b> is transferred from target shareholders to acquirer shareholders. Cross-country differences in capital <b>gains</b> tax rates enable us to estimate the discount in the takeover price on account of future capital <b>gains.</b> The estimation suggests that a one percentage point increase in the capital <b>gains</b> tax rate reduces the valuation of new equity by 0. 136 %. The implied average effective tax rate on capital <b>gains</b> is 4. 57 %, indicating that capital <b>gains</b> taxation is a significant cost to firms when raising new equity capital. Apart from the taxation of future capital <b>gains,</b> we also find that takeover prices are affected by capital <b>gains</b> taxation resulting from the accelerated realization of past capital <b>gains</b> by target shareholders...|$|R

The first question is what {{the size of the}} Flynn effect in South Korea is. The <b>gains</b> per decade are 7. 7 points for persons born between 1970 and 1990. These <b>gains</b> on broad intelligence batteries are much larger than the <b>gains</b> in Western countries of about 3 IQ points per decade. The second question is whether the Korean IQ <b>gains</b> are comparable to the Japanese IQ <b>gains</b> with a lag of a few decades. The <b>gains</b> in Japan of 7. 7 IQ points per decade for those born approximately 1940 - 1965 are identical to the <b>gains</b> per decade for Koreans born 1970 - 1990. The third question is whether the Korean <b>gains</b> in height and education lag a few decades behind the Japanese <b>gains.</b> The Koreans reach the educational levels the Japanese reached 25 - 30 years before, and the <b>gains</b> in height for Koreans born 1970 - 1990 are very similar to <b>gains</b> in height for Japanese born 1940 - 1960, so three decades earlier.

40|$|Lowering or {{eliminating}} {{the tax on}} capital <b>gains</b> may be a tempting undertaking for Canada's federal government facing electorate pressure. It {{may also be a}} tempting course of action for interest groups and public policy stakeholders. To analyse the merits of such a policy measure, this paper explores two queries. Fist, how the previous changes in capital <b>gains</b> taxation affected the level of realization of capital <b>gains?</b> And, second, do provincial differences in tax rates transpire into differences in the intensity of realizing capital <b>gains?</b> The analysis shows that only {{a relatively small number of}} Canadians report capital <b>gains</b> and a smaller proportion of them effectively pay taxes on capital <b>gains.</b> The changes in capital <b>gains</b> tax rate introduced in 2000 lead to only a temporary increase in intensity and volume of realized capital <b>gains.</b> Similarly, no significant increase in holdings of capital assets by households was observed. The analysis of provincial differences in tax rates levied on capital <b>gains</b> also does not conclusively show that lower tax rates lead to a higher turnover of investments. capital <b>gains,</b> taxation of capital <b>gains...</b>|$|R
