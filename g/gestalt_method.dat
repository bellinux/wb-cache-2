According to Ervin Polster (1968), a pre-eminent Gestalt therapist, [...] "Rank brought the human relationship directly into his office. He influenced analysts to take seriously the actual present interaction between therapist and patient, rather than maintain the fixed, distant, 'as though' relationship that had given previous analysts an emotional buffer for examining the intensities of therapeutic sensation and wish. Rank's contributions opened the way for encounter to become accepted as a deep therapeutic agent" [...] (p. 6).|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] - The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{demonstrate}} how to measure the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype using the new 4 -Digit Diagnostic Code and the previously developed D-Score and to demonstrate how these two measures of the FAS facial phenotype correlate with brain function and structure; correlations that fail to be identified by the older <b>gestalt</b> <b>method</b> of facial measurement. The D-Score and the facial component of the 4 -Digit Code quantitatively measure the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype using three facial features (palpebral fissure length, philtrum smoothness and upper lip thinness). These facial measurement systems were developed by the Washington State FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FASDPN) of clinics and are used to screen and diagnose the facial component of FAS for all patients evaluated in the network of clinics (1, 500 to date). The 4 -Digit Code is a comprehensive diagnostic system developed by the FAS DPN in 1997 to diagnose {{the full spectrum of}} outcomes among patients with prenatal alcohol exposure. The four digits reflect the magnitude of expression of the four key diagnostic features of FAS in the following order: 1) growth deficiency, 2) the FAS facial phenotype, 3) brain dysfunction, and 4) gestational alcohol exposure. The 4 -Digit Code was developed to overcome the subjective, highly variable <b>gestalt</b> <b>method</b> of diagnosis that has been used as the standard to date, worldwide. Prior {{to the development of the}} 4 -Digit Code, the first 445 patients evaluated in the FAS DPN were diagnosed using the <b>gestalt</b> <b>method.</b> For research purposes, their gestalt diagnoses were transformed into 4 -Digit Diagnostic Codes, presenting a unique opportunity to directly compare the two diagnostic methods. When the facial phenotype was measured using the 4 -Digit Code or D-Score, the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype was significantl...|$|E
40|$|Now {{there are}} many {{pipelines}} to deliver liquid-like water diversions in the world. Optimal route for pipeline transportation {{is a major concern}} for engineers, economists, and decision makers. Pipeline route selection is governed by many factors such as the shortest distance between supply and demand points, constructability, affordability, environmental impacts, and approachability. There are many methods developed for the pipeline route selection like <b>Gestalt</b> <b>method,</b> land suitability mapping techniques, geographic information systems (GIS), imaging technologies for pipeline mapping with the use of airborne lidar, etc. But these methods, though robust in translating physical constraints into feasible alternatives for route location, have their own pros and cons for applications, which are weak in incorporating the decision maker 2 ̆ 7 s preferences. This paper presents an easy approach to route selection with the goal of saving energy and having the shortest distance. The method in this paper makes an attempt to establish a method for the route with minimum energy required with the aid of mathematics computing and GIS or the data coming from Google Earth. This method is demonstrated here through two different case studies of pipe route selection, the Los Angeles aquaduct, the second Los Angeles aquaduct in USA, and water diversion from Palmer to Millbrook Reservoir in Australia.

3000|$|In {{this section}} {{we discuss the}} {{affordance}} of virtual reality in comparison to non-immersive computer displays. We consider direct perceptual properties such as spatial perception, shape recognition, colour differentiation, movement detection, haptics and aural positioning, but also highlight emergent relational properties such as perceived complexity, regularity, perceptual grouping and segmentation. Direct perceptual properties based on gestalt theory typically underpin visual analytics and are reasonably well understood. However, while these perceptual organisational principles have been extensively considered in the two-dimensional visual context, the shift to immersive environments augment vision with convincing spatialized sound, engages the kinaesthetic senses, and privileges egocentric spatial coding over allocentric visual reasoning. In short, the user is immersed {{in an environment of}} data, rather than observing graphic patterns on a visual display. Does this require a re-evaluation of gestalt principles, as typically used in relation to screen based data visualization?

5000|$|Gestalt therapy theory {{essentially}} rests atop four [...] "load-bearing walls": phenomenological method, dialogical relationship, field-theoretical strategies, {{and experimental}} freedom. Although all these tenets {{were present in}} the early formulation and practice of Gestalt therapy, as described in Ego, Hunger and Aggression (Perls, 1947) and in Gestalt Therapy, Excitement and Growth in the Human Personality (Perls, Hefferline, & Goodman, 1951), the early development of Gestalt therapy theory emphasized personal experience and the experiential episodes understood as [...] "safe emergencies" [...] or experiments. Indeed, half of the Perls, Hefferline, and Goodman book consists of such experiments. Later, through the influence of such people as Erving and Miriam Polster, a second theoretical emphasis emerged: namely, contact between self and other, and ultimately the dialogical relationship between therapist and client. Later still, field theory emerged as an emphasis. At various times over the decades, since Gestalt therapy first emerged, {{one or more of these}} tenets and the associated constructs that go with them have captured the imagination of those who have continued developing the contemporary theory of Gestalt therapy. Since 1990 the literature focused upon Gestalt therapy has flourished, including the development of several professional Gestalt journals. Along the way, Gestalt therapy theory has also been applied in Organizational Development and coaching work. And, more recently, <b>Gestalt</b> <b>methods</b> have been combined with meditation practices into a unified program of human development called Gestalt Practice, which is used by some practitioners.|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{primary goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{determine}} accuracy for diagnosing acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in the undifferentiated dyspneic emergency department (ED) patient using a lung and cardiac ultrasound (LuCUS) protocol. Secondary objectives were to determine if US findings acutely change management and if findings are more accurate than clinical <b>gestalt.</b> <b>Methods</b> This was a prospective, observational study of adult patients presenting to the ED with undifferentiated dyspnea. The intervention consisted of a 12 -view LuCUS protocol performed by experienced emergency physician sonographers. The primary objective was measured by comparing US findings to the final diagnosis independently determined by two physicians blinded to the LuCUS result. Acute treatment changes based on US findings were tracked in real time through a standardized data collection form. Results Data on 99 patients were analyzed; ADHF was the final diagnosis in 36 %. The LuCUS protocol had sensitivity of 83 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 67 % to 93 %), specificity of 83 % (95 % CI = 70 % to 91 %), positive likelihood ratio of 4. 8 (95 % CI = 2. 7 to 8. 3), and negative likelihood ratio of 0. 20 (95 % CI = 0. 09 to 0. 42). Forty-seven percent of patients had changes in acute management, and 42 % had changes in acute treatment. Observed agreement for the LuCUS protocol was 93 % between coinvestigators. Overall, accuracy improved by 20 % (83 % vs. 63 %, 95 % CI = 8 % to 31 % for the difference) over clinical gestalt alone. Conclusions The LuCUS protocol may accurately identify ADHF and may improve acute clinical management in dyspneic ED patients. This protocol has improved diagnostic accuracy over clinical gestalt alone...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Nothing {{has been}} {{published}} to describe the practices of medical societies in choosing abstracts for presentations at their annual meetings. We surveyed medical societies to determine their practices, and also present a theoretical analysis of the topic. Methods: We contacted {{a convenience sample of}} large U. S. medical conferences, and determined their approach to choosing abstracts. We obtained information from web sites, telephone, and email. Our theoretical analysis compares values-based and empirical approaches for scoring system development. Results: We contacted 32 societies and obtained data on 28 (response rate 88 %). We excluded one upon learning that research was not presented at its annual meeting, leaving 27 for analysis. Only 2 (7 %) made their abstract scoring process available to submitters. Reviews were blinded in most societies (21; 78 %), and all but one asked reviewers to recuse themselves for conflict of interest (96 %). All required ≥ 3 reviewers. Of the 24 providing information on how scores were generated, 21 (88 %) reported using a single gestalt score, and three used a combined score created from pooled domain-specific sub-scores. We present a framework for societies to use in choosing abstracts, and demonstrate its application {{in the development of a}} new scoring system. Conclusions: Most medical societies use subjective, <b>gestalt</b> <b>methods</b> to select research for presentation at their annual meetings and do not disclose to submitters the details of how abstracts are chosen. We present a new scoring system that is transparent to submitters and reviewers alike with an accompanying statement of values and ground rules. We discuss the challenges faced in selecting abstracts for a large scientific meeting and share the values and practical considerations that undergird the new system. ...|$|R

This parameter has an intuitive interpretation as it controls the expected number of false detections. We show that the iterative application of our method can (1) provide robustness to noise and (2) solve a masking phenomenon in which a highly populated and salient cluster dominates the scene and inhibits the detection of less-populated, but still salient, clusters...|$|R

40|$|Parameter mapping {{sonification}} is {{the most}} widely used technique for representing multi-dimensional data in sound. However, it is known to be unreliable when used for detecting information in some types of data. This is generally thought {{to be the result of}} the co-dependency of the psychoacoustic dimensions used in the mapping. Positing its perceptual basis in a theory of embodied cognition, the most common approach to overcoming this limitation involves techniques that afford the interactive exploration of the data using gross body gestures. In some circumstances, such exploration is not possible and, even when it is, it may be neither necessary nor sufficient. This article explores some other possible reasons for the unreliability of parameter mapping sonification and, drawing from the experience of expressive musical performance, suggests that the problem lies not in the parametric approach per se, nor in the lack of interactivity, but in the extent to which the para meters employed contribute to coherent <b>gestalts.</b> A <b>method</b> for how this might be achieved that relies on the use of micro-gestural information is proposed. While this is speculative, the use of such gestural inflections is well known in music performance, is supported by findings in neuroscience and lends itself to empirical testing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Phylogenetic {{reconstruction}} from gene rearrangements {{has attracted}} increasing attention from biologists and computer scientists {{over the last}} few years. Methods used in reconstruction include distance-based methods, parsimony methods using sequence-based encodings, and direct optimization. The latter, pioneered by Sankoff and extended by us with the software suite GRAPPA, is the most accurate approach, but has been limited to small genomes because the running time of its scoring algorithm grows exponentially with the number of genes in the genome. We report here on a new method to compute a tight lower bound on the score of a given tree, using a set of linear constraints generated through selective applications of the triangle inequality (in the spirit of <b>GESTALT).</b> Our <b>method</b> generates an integer linear program with a carefully limited number of constraints, rapidly solves its relaxed version, and uses the result to provide a tight lower bound. Since this bound is very close to the optimal tree score, it can be used directly as a selection criterion, thereby enabling us to bypass entirely the expensive scoring procedure. We have implemented this method within our GRAPPA software and run several series of experiments on both biological and simulated datasets to assess its accuracy. Our results show that using the bound as a selection criterion yields excellent trees, with error rates below 5 % up to very large evolutionary distances, consistently beating the baseline Neighbor-Joining. Our new method enables us to extend the range of applicability of the direct optimization method to chromosomes of size comparable to those of bacteria, as well as to datasets with complex combinations of evolutionary events. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is the quality of}} life subjectively felt by senior {{citizens}} living in the town Mikulov. For the elderly, a high-quality life is very important. It is usually a consequence of how the senior citizens are prepared for their own old age. The level of self-sufficiency and autonomy is equally crucial, as well as the extent of changes connected to ageing. Presence of an illness that limits the senior citizen also plays an important role. The thesis consists of two main parts. The first one is theoretical and deals with the above mentioned quality of life and factors that might influence it. Terms such as old age and ageing are defined in this part and also the periodization of old age and categorization of senior citizens are given. This part also describes the changes connected with ageing. The practical part of the thesis aims to determine the impact of different lifestyle on the quality of life and in general the factors influencing it. The method used is SEIQoL. This method uses direct answers of respondents, who give themselves five life goals (34). The necessary data was received on the bases of an additional method ? the semi-structured interview, which enabled to profoundly treat the different goals and {{to get to know the}} respondents better (understand their values). The data were then analysed using the pattern (<b>gestalt)</b> recognition <b>method.</b> The nature of this method is to detect certain patterns and structures that are more general and that based on similarity or diversity (21). The respondents were chosen intentionally according to certain criteria (21). For the purposes of this research, male and female senior citizens of very various ages and with various lifestyles were chosen. More precisely, the senior citizens chosen are four women between 67 and 80 and four men between 65 and 83. According to the research, the main factors affecting the quality of life of senior citizens are health and family. Different lifestyle of respondents is apparent once regarded their social life (family structures, friendships) in a closer perspective. As for the senior citizens that do not live in their own house or apartment, the research didn?t indicate any important differences. Three (out of eight) respondents are in this living situation. They affirm to have gotten used to the current living situation and be happy about it in the present. The living situation is also connected to the financial situation of the senior citizens. In case of respondents living in their own house or apartment, the monthly payments are reduced only to the overhead costs. In case of those living in a nursing home or home for the elderly, there is also the rent. I therefore suppose that different lifestyle of the senior citizens is not that important overall. What is more important, it is the level of satisfaction of senior citizens? needs and different factors affecting the quality of life in general. Among the most important ones can be mentioned: family, health and financial security (8). The respondents also agreed on the importance of their leisure time and of the way they are spending it. The void that comes naturally after the children leave home is generally filled by some domestic animal to keep the senior citizen company. Two of the respondents equally mentioned contentedness among other factors affecting their life. On the basis of this research we can assume that senior citizens in Mikulov are generally happy and the level of their subjectively felt quality of life is high. This thesis can serve as a source of information for those who are interested in related topics. Moreover, it can be used as a bases for creating measures that would improve the life quality of senior citizens in Mikulov...|$|R
