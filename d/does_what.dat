5|$|Mimi pulls Carey in two {{opposite}} directions. Most of {{the tracks}} find her paired with the hottest hip hop producers of the day; there, she exercises restraint and settles into a groove. But on the rest, she <b>does</b> <b>what</b> comes most naturally to her—belting to her heart's desire, perhaps to mollify those who don't care much for her detours into raunchier rap territory.|$|E

5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave off all his fur. Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and <b>does</b> <b>what</b> others, for fear of reaction from the people around them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E
5|$|Nikki is {{manipulative}} of Paulo {{and appears}} to care more about the diamonds than her relationship. After the crash, Paulo becomes suspicious Nikki is just using {{him to get the}} diamonds. The first thing she asks him after the crash is the whereabouts of the diamonds, and avoids answering Paulo when he asks if they would still be together if she did not need him to help find the diamonds. Paulo <b>does</b> <b>what</b> Nikki tells him to because of his fear of losing her, which results in their deaths.|$|E

Peter Berg was the next director to consider, but he too, eventually dropped out for undisclosed reasons. A year later {{it was confirmed that}} Phillip Noyce would direct. Noyce was attracted to Salt for its espionage themes, which are present in most of his filmography, as well as the tension of a character who tries to prove his innocence yet also <b>does</b> <b>what</b> he was previously accused of.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not {{really want to be}} an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating <b>does</b> <b>what</b> others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.|$|E

She unselfishly <b>does</b> <b>what</b> others expect of her, doing things like helping Charley escape their father to go to school, and living with Jenny Wren. Marrying Wrayburn is the only truly selfish act Lizzie commits in Our Mutual Friend, and even that is debatable, since she only did it because Wrayburn appeared to be on his deathbed.|$|E

25|$|Introduced {{in chapter}} six, {{he prefers to}} be called Joseph, and is known also as the Wandering Jew, or the “Magician of the Flow”, he is a mysterious being {{that looks like a}} young boy, but is much older. A long time ago, people said that “God’s Son” cast an immortal curse on him. Holding no clear intention, he’s just a monster that simply <b>does</b> <b>what</b> he feels like. He seems to travel around the world experimenting with the living and dead {{for the sake of his}} experiments, {{although}} he has apparently forgotten why he experiments. He has the appearance of a human but the body of a non-human – as seen in chapter eleven when he was struck with a magic bullet. He dislikes his “Cartaphilius” name.|$|E

Behind the scenes of their great business partnership, {{there is not much}} of a relationship going on. Den has a posh mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How), a fact that Angie is all too aware of. Early in the year, Den even manages to get on holiday to Spain with Jan, telling Angie that he is checking out a possible time-share holiday home purchase. With Den gone, Angie <b>does</b> <b>what</b> she always does in times of trouble, and turns to alcohol to drown her sorrows. She also sets about trying to seduce the men of Walford in a bid to get back at her philandering husband. Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) and even Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) are all subject to Angie's not-so-subtle flirting, but her only successful conquest is local builder, Tony Carpenter (Oscar James). Tony falls for Angie, but she is only using him to get back at Den. The affair is conducted in secret, but they are caught in a passionate clinch in the middle of The Queen Vic by Sharon. Angie has to bribe her daughter to ensure her silence, and even informs her about Den's infidelity. Sharon is disgusted that both her parents are guilty of adultery. Upon Den's return from his holiday, Angie calls off the affair, but it isn't long before Sharon gives Den the impression that her mother has been up to no good. Den confronts Angie, and she admits to the affair, but unfortunately for her, Den isn't concerned about her infidelity, more about his reputation, which upsets Angie even more.|$|E
