2500|$|Homosexuality of the {{protective}} type involves a motive that Bergler describes {{as an attempt}} to show that [...] "father loves his little boy". Homosexuality of the seeking the older protector type is found in homosexual men who search for partners who resemble good fathers who can love them, but unconsciously want to be mistreated by a [...] "bad mother". Homosexuality combined with other types of perversions may involve sado-masochism, exhibitionism, transvestism, urolagnia, or scatology. Bergler maintains that all supposed bisexuals are homosexuals, that bisexuality is a fraud perpetrated by homosexuals, and that efforts by homosexual men to have sex with women involve only [...] "lustless mechanical sex". Homosexuality of the criminal <b>institution</b> <b>type</b> shows, according to Bergler, the similar psychological bases of homosexuality and criminal behavior.

Bergler describes puberal homosexuality as harmless, and denies that it is [...] "indicative of future homosexuality", criticizing Kinsey for including prepuberbal and early puberal sex play among boys in his estimates of homosexual activity among males.

During the 1990 s affordable lending in the prime market was increasingly done by mortgage company subsidiaries of depositories.

Across most <b>institution</b> <b>types,</b> we find that (1) origination volume is negatively related to affordable lending, though there are offsetting positive relationships among very large depositories; (2) affordable lending is probably procyclical; and (3) affordable lending is positively related to market concentration among certain <b>institution</b> <b>types</b> (savings <b>institutions</b> and both independent and depository-affiliated mortgage companies).

40|$|Tinto’s (1993) Theory of Individual Departure from Institutions of Higher Education {{conceptualized}} {{the decision}} making process students navigate when committing to {{institutions of higher education}} and persisting to graduation. Transfer students are gaining the attention of administrators and policy-makers because of the high level of transfer activity in higher education. Many of these students face a uniquely difficult transition when moving from one institutional environment to another. The phenomenon, known as transfer shock, is the overall integration and adaptation difficultly that transfer students face (Hills, 1965). Since previous institution cumulative grade point average (GPA) is a criterion used in transfer admissions decisions, it was studied. Six-year graduation totals were also observed in the study because they indicates student commitment to their institution and goals toward graduation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine Ball State University entering transfer students and how to predict post-transfer GPA and six-year graduation based on previous institution cumulative grade point average, age, sex, previous <b>institution</b> <b>type,</b> and BSU college. Regression analysis was used to make predictive models for post-transfer GPA and six-year graduation using the observed variables (i. e., previous institution cumulative GPA, age, sex, previous <b>institution</b> <b>type,</b> and BSU college). The sample consisted of 1, 857 entering transfer students at Ball State University, a state-assisted, residential university with high research activity in Muncie, Indiana. Previous institution cumulative GPA averaged 2. 994 while the average post-transfer GPA was 1. 681. Nearly 60 % of the sample achieved six-year graduation. The results of the revised model for predicting post-transfer GPA found only previous institution cumulative GPA, age, previous <b>institution</b> <b>type,</b> and whether or not the student was in CAST to be statistically significant predictors. The model used to predict six-year graduation found previous <b>institution</b> <b>type,</b> age, sex, previous <b>institution</b> <b>type,</b> and three of the BSU colleges (CAST, CCIM, and TC) to be statistically significant predictors. When applied to the data, the six-year graduation prediction model correctly predicted six-year graduation at a rate of 79. 6 % and had an overall correct prediction percentage of 63. 6 % of the time.
