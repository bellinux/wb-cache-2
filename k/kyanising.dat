50|$|When {{it became}} {{possible}} to preserve wooden sleepers with mercuric chloride (a process called <b>Kyanising)</b> and creosote, they gave a much quieter ride than stone blocks {{and it was}} possible to fasten the rails directly using clips or rail spikes. Their use spread worldwide and acquired Vignoles' name.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the early}} {{applications}} of the process was the <b>kyanising</b> of the palings round the Inner Circle, Regent's Park, which {{was carried out in}} 1835 as an advertisement, small brass plates being attached to the palings at intervals stating that the wood had been submitted to the new process. The plates soon disappeared, but the original palings still remain in good condition.|$|E
50|$|It {{became evident}} that iron {{fastenings}} {{could not be}} used in wood treated with corrosive sublimate, on account of the corrosive action, and it was said that the wood became brittle. The salt was somewhat expensive and Sir William Burnett's method of preserving timber by chloride of zinc, and afterwards the application of creosote for that purpose, proved severe competitors. Doubts began to be expressed as to the real efficiency of <b>kyanising</b> (see Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, 11 January 1853, pp. 206-243), and the process gradually ceased to be employed.|$|E
50|$|The {{track gauge}} was 4 foot 8½ inches, {{intentionally}} to match {{that of the}} other Liverpool-Hull lines and that of the London-Birmingham and North Midland railways. The track consisted of track constructed of both laterally and longitudinally laid sleepers of which two thirds was longitudinal track. The sleepers were <b>kyanised.</b>|$|R
25|$|Throughout his railway {{building}} career, but {{particularly on the}} South Devon and Cornwall Railways where economy was needed {{and there were many}} valleys to cross, Brunel made extensive use of wood for the construction of substantial viaducts; these have had to be replaced over the years as their primary material, <b>Kyanised</b> Baltic Pine, became uneconomical to obtain.|$|R
50|$|While the Derby-Nottingham tracks {{had been}} {{supported}} on stone blocks, the section to Rugby used <b>kyanised</b> timber sleepers. At Leicester {{there was another}} magnificent station in Campbell Street, originally planned as a terminus on a spur from the main line. However, it was built as a loop with a single long platform next to the through running lines. It {{was replaced by the}} present London Road station in 1892.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinctive}} timber viaducts {{were constructed}} using yellow pine which was preserved by <b>Kyanising</b> (using chloride of mercury), or sometimes by Burnettising (using chloride of zinc) in the workshops at Lostwithiel. The various timbers were seated in cast iron chairs, and wrought iron {{was used for}} parts of the bridge which would be in tension, such as tie rods between spans. Five distinct types of viaduct were built to suit local conditions at each site. Peter John Margaryo0, the Cornwall Railway engineer from 1868 to 1891, classified them as classes A to E.|$|E
5000|$|By early 1839 {{plans for}} the railway depot, {{workshops}} and related equipment were being drawn up; the company acquired tanks for <b>kyanising</b> sleepers were acquired, and an order placed with Bereton and Vernon of Hull for a [...] steam engine to power machinery at the Hull workshop, including that for sawing the wood for sleepers. By July the Humber embankment near Hull was complete, and the Hull depot, station and offices were underconstruction; much of the civil work {{of the rest of}} the line was complete, including the Market Weighton Canal bridge, with the superstructures of the Derwent and Ouse bridges in preparation for installation. Much of the line was in the process of being ballasted, and the <b>kyanising</b> of sleepers for the track had begun. Of the main building works only the contracts for station houses remained to be awarded.The Ouse bridge was required by the 1836 Act to have an opening arch of 44 ft, whilst the Ouse at Selby was nearly 200 ft in width, with an underlying geology consisting of silt, quicksand and then hard clay. The bridge consisted of two main spans, one opening; plus sections on either side from land to the first pier and to the second pier, and a section across the central piers. Each span consisted of six [...] cast iron longitudinal ribs, with one rib under the line of each rail and two outer ribs on either side under a handrail. [...] cast iron plates covered the ribs; the track ran on timber bearers [...] wide by deep. The opening mechanism was operated by man power using a geared drive with a hand wheel of 9 ft giving a mechanical advantage of 285.|$|E
50|$|The steepest {{gradient}} was 1 in 330, {{with the largest}} earthworks being on the Rugby line at the Leire cutting and embankment. There were 148 bridges in all, and three tunnels. The rails were double headed in 15 foot lengths at 77 lb. per yard at a gauge throughout of 4 foot 8½ inches. These were laid either on gritstone blocks from Cromford, laid diagonally, or on embankments, timber sleepers of oak or <b>kyanised</b> larch. For a length near Rugby, Evans's dove-tailed bridge rails of 57 lb per yard, were tried, mounted on longitudinal Memel fir timbers with pine cross sleepers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{gauge of}} the track was [...] The first rails ordered were of a {{flat-bottom}} wrought iron design, 3½ in deep, and [...] "of parallel form" [...] {{as opposed to the}} fish-bellied pattern that had been popular previously. They were 15 feet long. <b>Kyanised</b> half-round timber sleepers at 3 feet spacing were used, with stone ballast from St Georges Hill, Weybridge. However it appears that some sleepers did not have preservative treatment, and their lives were accordingly short. The rails were to be in 15 lb chairs at the joints, but otherwise fastened direct to the sleepers.|$|R
5000|$|The line {{opened the}} 14+1/2 mi to the Leeds & Selby Railway, with a {{ceremony}} on 29 May 1839. After breakfast in York, a train with a steam locomotive {{at the front}} and back conveyed the guests in eighteen carriages to the train then returned on a dinner in York. The line to Burton Salmon was open on 11 May 1840 and the final section, with the junction at Altofts with the North Midland, opened at the end of June. After 1 July 1840 it was possible to travel to London in 14 hours by a service that left York at 7:30 am. The route taken by the line had required {{little in the way of}} earthworks, apart from a cutting at Fairburn, and gave a maximum gradient of 1 in 484 with broad curves. There were 31 bridges, the principal ones being over the Rivers Aire, Wharfe and Calder. These were of stone, with those over the Calder and at Holdgate Lane built on the skew. The joint station with the Great North of England Railway, was within the city walls at York, and piercing of the walls was required to preserve the upper walkway; designs by G.T. Andrews and by Thomas Cabry (Y&NM engineer) were submitted to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society who chose Andrews' tudor arches. The track was of straight sided pattern at [...] lb per yard supported either on stone blocks or <b>kyanised</b> wooden sleepers. The gauge was [...] over blocks, or [...] over sleepers. Locomotives were supplied by Robert Stephenson and Company and the first class carriages were lit with lamps at night, the second class were open at the sides, and in third class passengers seat on longitudinal benches without cover.|$|R
