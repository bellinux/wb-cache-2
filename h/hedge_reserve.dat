40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview of the profound and rapid changes in banking brought about by technology and deregulation, and discusses the hurdles {{that will have to be}} negotiated for putting in place the three pillars-capital adequacy rules, supervision, and market discipline-of the bank regulatory framework envisioned by the New Basel Accord (Basel II). It argues that, especially for developing countries, finding the right balance between regulation, supervision, and market discipline is likely to be difficult. Considerable technical expertise as well as political discipline-which can be viewed as a fourth pillar-will be required to implement Basel II.

While the policy debate on {{how to respond to}} boom-bust credit cycles remains unsettled, it has been conjectured that credit subsidies may provide a particularly effective policy tool to counter a credit bust. This paper reports on a rare policy experiment where credit subsidies were used to buffer the impact of the global financial crisis on Serbia in 2009.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the effect of firm {{characteristics}} such as firm size, leverage, profitability, liquidity, complexity, and type of auditor to the level of corporate risk disclosure. Risk disclosure is disclosures made by the company with regard to the opportunities or prospects, danger, threat or exposure, which may have an impact on the company, and management opportunities, prospects, dangers, threats or the exposure. To explain the relationship between variables in this study, use of agency theory and signaling theory. The population of this study are all manufacture companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange period 2015. Total sample of 94 companies was determined by purposive sampling method. Content analysis method used to calculate the risk disclosures by counting the number of sentences that relate to risk category in the annual report. There are seven categories of risk disclosures used in this study, namely a general risk information, accounting policies, financial instruments, derivatives <b>hedging,</b> <b>reserves,</b> financial and other risks and commodity risks. The method used to test the hypothesis is multiple regression analysis. The results show that the category’s mean of risk disclosures sentences in non-financial companies was 39 sentences. The category of risk disclosure that most widely performed by the companies is accounting policy category. The results of hypothesis testing showe that company size, leverage, profitability, liquidity, and complexity affect the level of risk disclosure.

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{domestic}} financial intermediation of foreign capital inflows based on agency costs is developed for studying financial crises in emerging markets. In equilibrium, the banking system becomes progressively more fragile under imperfect prudential regulation and public sector loan guarantees until a crisis occurs with a sudden reversal of capital flows. The crisis evolves endogenously as the banking system becomes increasingly vulnerable through the renegotiation of loans after idiosyncratic firm-specific revenue shocks. The model generates dynamic relationships between foreign capital inflows, domestic investment, corporate debt and equity values in an endogenous growth model. The model''s assumptions and implications for {{the behavior of the}} economy before and after crisis are compared to the experience of five East Asian economies. The case studies compare three that suffered a crisis or near-crisis, Thailand and Malaysia, to two that did not, Taiwan Province of China and Singapore, and lend support to the model.

40|$|Pricing exotic options or {{guarantees}} in equity-indexed annuities can be problematic. The authors present closed-form formulas for pricing lookback {{options and}} dynamic guarantees that facilitate the <b>hedging</b> and <b>reserving</b> for such products. The principal tool used is a closed-form expression for B(u, T), the Laplace-Stieltjes transform {{of the expected}} excess of the running maximum of a Wiener process above a positive constant u in a finite time interval of length T. If the aggregate net income of a company is modeled with a Wiener process, then the excess of the running maximum above u {{can be interpreted as}} aggregate dividend payments, and the quantity B(u, T) is the expectation of the discounted value of the dividend payments up to time T. The formula for B(u, T) is used to price European lookback options (call and put, fixed and floating strike). It is also used to price dynamic fund protection, which is a guarantee on an investment fund: The number of units of the investment fund is increased whenever necessary, so that their total value does not fall below a guaranteed level. The guaranteed level can be stochastic, such as that given by a stock index. Some well-known results for the first passage time of the Wiener process are explained in the appendix...|$|R

The 29th Division, which was already undermanned after heavy casualties on D-Day, was even further depleted in the intense fighting for Saint-Lô. Eventually, the 29th was able to capture the city in a direct assault, supported by airstrikes from P-47 Thunderbolts.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} key {{findings of}} the Financial System Stability Assessment, including Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes on Monetary and Financial Policy Transparency, Banking Supervision, and Securities Regulation for Chile. The assessment reveals the Chilean banking system to be sound, resilient to shocks, and well supervised. Banks are well capitalized, profitable, internationally integrated, and have relatively low nonperforming loans. Stress tests indicate that they would absorb sizable macroeconomic shocks with only a moderate impact on their solvency. Although bank competition remains limited, it has increased significantly in recent years.

40|$|In this chapter, {{we present}} an {{introductory}} overview of risk management {{and of the}} techniques that operations managers can use to mitigate risks. We start by viewing risk management as an ongoing 4 -step process and integral part of operations strategy. We discuss the various operational risks that companies are exposed to and distinguish tactical from strategic risk management, and operational from financial hedging. Then we review methodologies to assess and value those risks both qualitatively and quantitatively. The goal of risk assessment is to improve how we react to risk and to proactively reduce our exposure to it. The remainder of the chapter illustrates how operations can be structured to mitigate specific risks using the four generic operational <b>hedging</b> strategies: 1) <b>reserves</b> and redundancy; 2) diversification and pooling; 3) risk sharing and transfer; and 4) reducing or eliminating root causes of risk. We also review financial hedging of operational risk using options and derivatives and finish by illustrating how operational hedging can be tailored to the operations strategy of the firm...|$|R

40|$|In product {{pricing and}} reserving, actuaries are often {{required}} to make predictions of future death rates. In the past, this has been performed by using deterministic improvement scales that give only a single mortality trajectory. However, there is enormous likelihood that future death rates {{will turn out to}} be different from the projected ones, and so a better assessment of longevity risk would be one that consists of both a mean estimate and a measure of uncertainty. Such assessment can be performed using a stochastic mortality model, which is the core of this thesis. The Lee-Carter model is one of the most popular stochastic mortality models. While it does an excellent job in mean forecasting, it has been criticized for providing overly narrow prediction intervals that may have underestimated uncertainty. This thesis mitigates this problem by relaxing the assumption on the distribution of death counts. We found that the generalization from Poisson to negative binomial is equivalent to allowing gamma heterogeneity within each age-period cells. The proposed extension gives not only a better fit, but also a more conservative prediction interval that may reflect better the uncertainty entailed. The proposed extension is then applied to the construction of mortality improvement scales for Canadian insured lives. Given that the insured lives data series are too short for a direct Lee-Carter projection, we build an extra relational model that could borrow strengths from the Canadian population data, which covers a far longer period. The resultant scales consist of explicit measures of uncertainty. The prediction of the tail of a survival distribution requires a special treatment due to the lack of high quality old-age mortality data. We utilize the asymptotic results in modern extreme value theory to extrapolate death probabilities to the advanced ages, and to statistically determine the age at which the life table should be closed. Such technique is further integrated with the Lee-Carter model to produce a stochastic analysis of old-age mortality, and a prediction of the highest attained age for various cohorts. The mortality models we considered are further applied to the valuation of mortality-related financial products. In particular we investigate the no-negative-equity-guarantee that is offered in most fixed-repayment lifetime mortgages in Britain. The valuation of such guarantee requires a simultaneous consideration of both longevity and house price inflation risk. We found that house price returns can be well described by an ARMA-EGARCH time-series process. Under an ARMA-EGARCH process, however, the Black-Scholes formula no longer applies. We derive our own pricing formula based on the conditional Esscher transformation. Finally, we propose some possible <b>hedging</b> and capital <b>reserving</b> strategies for managing the risks associated with the guarantee...|$|R
