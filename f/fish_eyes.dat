5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. <b>Fish</b> <b>eyes</b> {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E
25|$|Water absorbs {{light of}} long {{wavelengths}}, so less light from these wavelengths reflects back {{to reach the}} eye. Therefore, warm colors from the visual light spectrum appear less vibrant at increasing depths. Water scatters light of shorter wavelengths, meaning cooler colors dominate the visual field in the photic zone. Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% as intense {{as it is on}} the surface, and is only 1% as intense at 150 m as it is on the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light they are capable of absorbing, are better suited to different depths. Theoretically, some <b>fish</b> <b>eyes</b> can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the aphotic zone, the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence.|$|E

40|$|We {{use both}} FEM (finite element method) and FDTD (finite {{difference}} time domain method) {{to simulate the}} field distribution in Maxwell's <b>fish</b> <b>eye</b> lens {{with one or more}} passive drains around the image point. We use the same Maxwell's <b>fish</b> <b>eye</b> lens structure as the one used in recent microwave experiment [arXiv: 1007. 2530]: Maxwell's <b>fish</b> <b>eye</b> lens bounded by PEC (perfect electric conductor) is inserted between two parallel PEC plates (as a waveguide structure). Our simulation results indicate that if one uses an active coaxial cable as the object and set an array of passive drains around the image region, what one obtains is not an image of the object but only multiple spots resembling the array of passive drains. The resolution of Maxwell's <b>fish</b> <b>eye</b> is finite even with such passive drains at the image locations. We also found that the subwavelength spot around the passive drain is due to the local field enhancement of the metal tip of the drain rather than the <b>fish</b> <b>eye</b> medium or the ability of the drain in extracting waves.

40|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>eye</b> STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, 2 -group comparison, {{experimental}} laboratory study. <b>Fish</b> <b>eye</b> OBJECTIVES: Examining {{and comparing}} the work {{profiles of the}} shoulder flexors and extensors between sport climbers and nonclimbers. <b>Fish</b> <b>eye</b> BACKGROUND: Sport climbing places high demands on the shoulder, {{which could lead to}} unique work profiles of the agonist/antagonist muscle groups. <b>Fish</b> <b>eye</b> METHODS AND MEASURES: Isokinetic work output of the dominant shoulder flexors and extensors of 31 sport climbers and 27 nonclimbers were measured from 0 ° to 180 ° of flexion at a test speed of 60 °/s. Profiles for work data (concentric flexion [conFlex], eccentric flexion [eccFlex], concentric extension [conExt], eccentric extension [eccExt]) normalized to body mass, conventional work ratios (conFlex/conExt and eccFlex/eccExt), and functional work ratios (eccFlex/conExt and eccExt/conFlex) were developed for both climbers and nonclimbers. <b>Fish</b> <b>eye</b> RESULTS: All work profiles were different between the 2 groups (P<. 001). All normalized work data were higher in climbers than nonclimbers, especially for conExt and eccExt. In the climbers, the conventional ratios were smaller than 1 for conFlex/conExt (0. 74) and eccFlex/eccExt (0. 74), whereas for the nonclimbers the ratios were 1. 13 and 1. 05, respectively. For the functional work data, the eccFlex/conExt ratio was 0. 9 for the climbers compared to 1. 46 for the nonclimbers. Conversely, the eccExt/conFlex ratio was much higher in the climbers (1. 73) compared to the nonclimbers (1. 28). <b>Fish</b> <b>eye</b> CONCLUSION: The differences in work profiles for the shoulder flexors and extensors between the climbers and nonclimbers suggest training-induced adaptations, stronger shoulder flexors, and, especially, stronger extensors, resulting from the sport of climbing. <b>Fish</b> <b>eye</b> LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 5.

50|$|Tylodelphys is a {{parasitic}} fluke that infects {{the small}} water fish. It induces many behavioral changeson its host.
