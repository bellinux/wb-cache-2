50|$|L. periclymenum is one {{of several}} {{honeysuckle}} species valued in the garden, for its ability to twine around other plants, or to cover unsightly walls or outbuildings; and for the intense fragrance of its profuse flowers in summer. It needs to be planted with its roots in the shade, and its <b>flowering</b> <b>top</b> in sun or light shade. Plants need to be chosen with care as they can grow to a substantial size. The cultivars 'Graham Thomas' and 'Serotina' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
40|$|Background: Hypericum is a {{well-known}} plant genus in herbal medicine. Hypericum mysorense (Family: Hypericaceae), a plant belonging to the same genus, {{is well known in}} folklore medicine for its varied therapeutic potential. Objective: The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the different parts of the plant for antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties. Materials and Methods: The methanol extracts of Hypericum mysorense prepared from various parts of the plant were tested in vitro for their free radical scavenging activity against ABTS• (diammonium salt), DPPH• (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl), NO•, O 2 •− and •OH radicals, using standard systems of assays. The total antioxidant capacity, total phenolic and total flavonoid content of the extracts were analyzed. Further, the leaf and <b>flowering</b> <b>top</b> extracts were tested for their in vivo antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities on Wistar rats using a carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic injury model. Results: The leaf and <b>flowering</b> <b>top</b> extract showed potent antioxidant activity and also possessed highest total phenolic and flavonoid content. The antioxidant activity and the total phenolic and flavonoid content present in these extracts showed a good correlation. The leaf and <b>flowering</b> <b>top</b> extracts at 200 mg/kg restored aspartate amino transferase (ASAT), alanine amino transferase (ALAT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin and protein levels significantly in CCl 4 -intoxicated rats. The tested extracts also showed a significant (p < 0. 001) reduction in 2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels with an increase in SOD and CAT levels. The histopathology of liver did not show any toxicity after the treatment with the extracts. The active extracts were standardized using two marker compounds, hyperoside and rutin, which were isolated from the plant by HPLC. HPLC studies revealed that the maximum concentration of hyperoside and rutin is present in the <b>flowering</b> <b>top</b> extract...|$|E

Mahame aromatin was methanol extracted and showed low activity against Bacillus spp and nothing against p. aeroginosa. Lantana camara was extracted using methanol and showed varying against tested micro organisms. Therefore the observed antimicrobial activities justify their traditional uses and calls further studies to isolate and purify the active antimicrobial ingredients that ultimately may lead to discovery of novo substances/compounds...|$|E

40|$|Broccoli {{is one of}} {{the healthiest}} {{vegetable}} that can be found, that is why studying it seemed the right thing to do. The word broccoli, from the Italian plural of broccolo, refers to "the <b>flowering</b> <b>top</b> of a cabbage". Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species Brassica oleracea (Buck, 2009). Broccoli has large flower heads, usually green in color, arranged in a tree-like fashion on branches sprouting from a thick, edible stalk. The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves. Broccoli most closely resembles cauliflower, which is a different cultivar group of the same species (Ciofu et al., 2003). Broccoli doesn’t have a long history in Romania, it’s cultivated on small parcels by small gardeners for their own consumption. Broccoli is high in vitamin C, as well as dietary fiber; it also contains multiple nutrients with potent anti-cancer properties, such as diindolylmethane and small amounts of selenium, also calcium and potassium (Kirsh et al., 2007). Romania also has a temperate climate that is recommended for broccoli growing. It can be grown in early spring, spring and autumn. That is why the main scope of the research was to find the best way to produce broccoli. Six hybrids: Fiesta F 1, Marathon F 1, Belstar F 1, Calabrese Nataliano F 1, Ramoso Calabrese F 1 and Mylady F 1 were tested to see which one is the best suited fo...|$|E

In the <b>flowering</b> <b>tops</b> and <b>flowers</b> the main constituents were α-zingiberene, α-cadinol and ar-curcumene, while in the leaves the principal compounds were α-cadinol, juniper camphor, germacrene D and spathulenol.

Also in these analyses, sesquiterpenes were the main constituents but with a clear dominance of hydrocarbon derivatives.

Fifteen fatty acids and sixteen volatile compounds were determined by GC-ITMS, being saturated fatty acids and monoterpenes the main compounds. The antioxidant and antibacterial potential of this matrix was checked for the first time by several in vitro assays. A concentration-dependent activity was noticed against DPPH, nitric oxide and superoxide radicals. Antibacterial capacity was assessed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, being more effective against the first. Additionally, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity was also evaluated, but no effect was found. Our results provide evidence of a wide diversity of compounds with several biological properties, improving the knowledge on this poorly studied matrix, which can lead to an increment of the use of C. tinctoria <b>flowering</b> <b>tops,</b> namely in food and pharmaceutical applications...|$|R
