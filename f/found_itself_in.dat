5|$|Because of {{its large}} {{financial}} power, the Kingdom of Hungary quickly rebuilt its army and <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> {{conflict with the}} Holy Roman Empire in 1337. However, the Hungarian king maintained a de jure suzerainty over Wallachia until the diplomatic disputes had been resolved.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} weeks of 1919, {{following}} the retreat of the German Ober-Ost forces under Max Hoffmann, Vilnius <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> a power vacuum. It promptly became the scene of struggles among competing political groups and experienced several internal revolutions.|$|E
5|$|Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. {{had planned}} to publish The Well of Loneliness in the United States {{at the same time}} as Cape in the United Kingdom. But after Cape brought forward the {{publication}} date, Knopf <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> the position of publishing a book that had been withdrawn in its home country. They refused, telling Hall that nothing they could do would keep the book from being treated as pornography.|$|E

5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective Britain’s situation was likened to that which the Austrian Empire <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> after it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866. As Austria was thereafter formally excluded from German affairs, so too would Britain be excluded from continental affairs {{in the event of}} a German victory. Yet afterwards, Austria-Hungary became a loyal ally of the German Empire in the pre-World War I power alignments in Europe, and it was hoped that Britain would come to fulfill this same role.|$|E
5|$|In an {{environment}} where motor transport could not operate, the Australian Army was forced to rely on air transport and native carriers, two modes of transportation that it had never used before. The Australian Army had many lessons to learn, but it proved capable of adapting to the circumstances it <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in.</b> The fighting along the Kokoda Track was but {{the start of the}} effort to drive the Japanese from New Guinea that would continue in 1943.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} century, as the Roman Empire divided, Egypt <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. In the waning {{years of the}} Empire, Egypt fell to the Sassanid Persian army (618-628 AD), was re{{captured}} by the Roman Emperor Heraclius (629-639 AD), and then was finally captured by Muslim Rashidun army in 639-640 AD, ending Roman rule.|$|E

5|$|The {{failures}} of these titles were further compounded by Atari's business dealings from 1981. Confident in strong sales, {{the company had}} told its distributors to place their 1982 orders all at once. However, video game sales in 1982 had slowed, and distributors who had ordered en masse in expectation of high turnover were left to simply return large quantities of unsold stock to Atari. As a result, the company soon <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> possession of several million essentially useless video game cartridges, which it would be entirely unable to sell.|$|E
5|$|Before {{construction}} could begin, the Navy <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> {{the midst}} of political situation because the Hungarian government demanded that {{a substantial portion of}} the submarine contracts be allocated to Hungarian firms. After intricate negotiations, the order was split into two orders of two submarines each, with U-20 and U-21 built at the Pola Navy Yard, and U-22 and U-23 built at the Hungarian UBAG yard at Fiume. The subcontracts were also divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, with about two-thirds going to Hungarian companies and one-third to Austrian companies. This allocation of contracts, while politically expedient, exacerbated technical problems that resulted in numerous modifications and delays.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E

5|$|De Hauteclocque {{arrived in}} London on 25 July 1940, {{and met with}} de Gaulle, who {{announced}} that he was promoting him to Chef d'escadrons (major). He also encountered his cousin Pierre de Hauteclocque, Xavier's brother, who was serving with the 13e Demi-Brigade de Légion Étrangère (13e DBLE, an infantry regiment of the French Foreign Legion). This was the largest unit that had joined the Free French Forces. After participating in the Battles of Narvik, it had <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> Britain when France surrendered. Formed after the war began, it contained many men who had fought for the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War, and many refugees from Nazi and Fascist countries. De Hauteclocque then offered his own services to the unit, but its commander, Colonel Raoul Magrin-Vernerey, rejected his offer on the grounds that he was high-born, over-qualified and a cavalryman.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{the still}} poorly {{developed}} peninsula suddenly <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> a strategic position, as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the ice-free harbors of the Murman Coast remained {{the only means}} of sending the war supplies to the Eastern Front. In March 1915, the construction of the railroad was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, even though it was only partially completed and poorly built. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (modern Murmansk) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Lacking {{military}} discipline, in what likely {{seemed to}} the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> trouble despite the fact {{they were still in}} Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at Belgrade, but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At Nish the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of Bohemians and Saxons did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.|$|E
50|$|The association, however was {{cancelled}} in {{the summer}} of the 2013, when the company <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> involved <b>in</b> the chit-fund scam. The name was again changed to United Sports Club.|$|R
50|$|Laski {{tried to}} {{mobilise}} Britain's academics, teachers, and intellectuals behind the socialist cause; the Socialist League was one effort. He {{had some success}} but this element typically <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> marginalised <b>in</b> the Labour Party.|$|R
50|$|The station <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> {{isolated}} <b>in</b> 1947 following record flooding. Both {{the station}} and the township of Noccundra were completely cut off and had no mail from late December 1946 to late February 1947.|$|R
5|$|Southern Rhodesia was {{represented}} in the Dodecanese Campaign of September–November 1943 by the Long Range Desert Group, which was withdrawn from the North African front in March 1943. After retraining for mountain operations in Lebanon, the LRDG moved in late September to the Dodecanese island of Kalymnos, north-west of Kos and south-east of Leros, {{off the coast of}} south-west Turkey. In the fall-out from the armistice between Italy and the Allies, which had been concluded {{in the first week of}} September, the Allies were attempting to capture the Dodecanese so the islands could be used as bases against the German-occupied Balkans. Most of the Italian forces had changed sides; the LRDG <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> an infantry role, acting as a mobile reserve for Italian troops.|$|E
5|$|Strategic Air Command <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> {{an uncomfortable}} position; bombers had been tuned for {{efficiency}} {{at high speeds}} and altitudes, performance that had been purchased at great cost in both engineering and financial terms. Before the B-70 was to replace the B-52 in the long-range role, SAC had introduced the B-58 Hustler to replace the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the medium-range role. The Hustler was expensive to develop and purchase, and required enormous amounts of fuel and maintenance {{in comparison to the}} B-47. It was estimated that it cost three times as much to operate as the much larger and longer-ranged B-52.|$|E
5|$|The Company {{suggested}} to the UK government {{that it might}} despatch 500 troopers from the Rhodesian Reserves to Europe {{to act as an}} all-Southern Rhodesian unit on the Western Front (in Belgium and France), but the War Office in London replied that such an expeditionary force would be more practically deployed in Africa, within the South African forces. When the Company relayed this idea south, the South Africans said they were happy to take the Southern Rhodesians, but only if they enlisted independently in existing Union regiments. The Company <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> the unusual position of having a prospective expeditionary force that nobody wanted. Unwilling to wait, some Southern Rhodesian would-be soldiers made their own way to England to join the British Army directly, as individuals or in groups. By the end of October 1914, about 300 were on their way.|$|E

50|$|The Russian {{delegation}} now <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> stranded <b>in</b> Japan, {{and while}} the diplomats renegotiated, Russian sailors and technicians worked with Japanese carpenters {{to build a new}} vessel at Heda to enable the delegation to return to Russia.|$|R
50|$|With {{the end of}} the Nazi era, the Gauligas {{ceased to}} exist and the state of Württemberg <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> {{predominantly}} <b>in</b> the US occupation zone. Only the very south of the state was part of the French zone.|$|R
5|$|The {{fall of the}} {{communist}} regime marked {{a new chapter in}} the history of Poland and in the history of Solidarity. Having defeated {{the communist}} government, Solidarity <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> a role it was much less prepared for — that of a political party — and soon began to lose popularity. Conflicts among Solidarity factions intensified. Wałęsa was elected Solidarity chairman, but support for him could be seen to be crumbling. One of his main opponents, Władysław Frasyniuk, withdrew from elections altogether. In September 1990, Wałęsa declared that Gazeta Wyborcza had no right to use the Solidarity logo.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opened in}} more than a {{thousand}} screens across the U.S. There were many promotions to accompany the release of the film. As with Jaws 2, Topps produced a series of trading cards. Television stations were encouraged to broadcast the featurette, Making of Jaws 3-D: Sharks Don't Die, in a prime-time slot between July 16 and 22, 1983 to take advantage of an advertisement in that week's issue of TV Guide. Alan Landsburg Productions <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> trouble for using 90 seconds of footage from the National Geographic's 1983 documentary film The Sharks in the featurette without authorization.|$|E
5|$|UConn went unbeaten {{through the}} Conference {{regular season and}} Tournament and easily {{advanced}} into the NCAA Tournament; in the regional final against Virginia a 4-points win in their closest {{game of the year}} opened the doors of the Final Four at the Target Center in Minneapolis. UConn blew out Stanford in the semifinals behind Wolters' 31 points, reaching the championship game for a rematch against Tennessee. In the final game UConn <b>found</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> early trouble when Lobo was called for three personal fouls in 94 seconds in the first half, but in the second half the team was able to rally from a 9-point deficit and a key Rizzotti layup gave UConn the lead with less than 2 minutes to go, a lead that the team kept until the final score of 70–64 and their first national title. Rebecca Lobo was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player.|$|E
