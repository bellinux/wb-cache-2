Whereas in biology the competition of various organisms can result {{in the death of}} a species or organism, the kind of competition Spencer advocated is closer to the one used by economists, where competing individuals or firms improve the well being of the rest of society. Spencer viewed private charity positively, encouraging both voluntary association and <b>informal</b> <b>care</b> to aid those in need, rather than relying on government bureaucracy or force. He further recommended that private charitable efforts would be wise to avoid encouraging the formation of new dependent families by those unable to support themselves without charity.|$|E

[...] This means that residents pay only what they can afford, and the Commonwealth government pays what a resident cannot. An Australian statutory authority, the Productivity Commission, conducted a review of aged care commencing in 2010 and reporting in 2011. That review concluded that approximately 80% of care for older Australians is <b>informal</b> <b>care</b> provided by family, friends and neighbours. Around a million people received government-subsidised aged care services, most of these receiving low-level community care support, with 160 000 people in permanent residential care.

2500|$|In {{the colonial}} era of the United States, some {{settlers}} adapted community health nursing practices. Individuals with mental defects that were deemed as dangerous were incarcerated or kept in cages, maintained and paid fully by community attendants. Wealthier colonists kept their insane relatives either in their attics or cellars and hired attendants, or nurses, to care for them. In other communities, the mentally ill were sold at auctions as slave labor. Others were forced to leave town. [...] As {{the population in the}} colonies expanded, <b>informal</b> <b>care</b> for the community failed and small institutions were established. In 1752 the first “lunatics ward” was opened at the Pennsylvania Hospital which attempted to treat the mentally ill. Attendants used the most modern treatments of the time: purging, bleeding, blistering, and shock techniques. Overall, the attendants caring for the patients believed in treating the institutionalized with respect. They believed if the patients were treated as reasonable people, then they would act as such; if they gave them confidence, then patients would rarely abuse it.|$|E
40|$|In {{calling for}} the {{creation}} of 'community social work', the Barclay Report argues that social workers should aim to develop <b>informal</b> <b>caring</b> networks. This entails exploiting an individual's informal social contacts, such as kin, friends, and neighbours, to provide care. This paper firstly examines the assumptions and thinking behind the concept of <b>informal</b> <b>caring</b> networks. It then assesses the feasibility of using different <b>informal</b> relations in <b>care</b> provision by analysing the normative patterning and exchange content underlying them. It concludes that strategies like Barclay's are unlikely to be successful because they entail a transformation of these relationships that is incompatible with their normal organisation. As Gillian Stewart has shown, over the last 15 years or so, there has been a broad consensus between the main political parties about the desirability of developing community care policies (Stewart, 1978). Equally, in this period, community care has been taken as signifying care provided by ordinary members of the community as much as professional care located in the community (Abrams, 1977; Walker, 1982). This policy trend has been actively encouraged by the present Government with its non-interven...|$|R

2500|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{employment}}: Formal and Informal. Formal employment is government regulated and workers are insured a wage and certain rights. Informal employment takes place in small, unregistered enterprises. It is generally a large source of employment for women. The burden of <b>informal</b> <b>care</b> work falls predominantly on women, who work longer and harder in this role than men. This affects their ability to hold other jobs and change positions, the hours they can work, and their decision to give up work. However, women who have University degrees or other forms of higher learning tend to stay in their jobs even with caring responsibilities, which suggests that the human capital from this experience causes women to feel opportunity costs when they lose their employment. Having children has also historically affected women's choice to stay employed. While this [...] "child-effect" [...] has significantly decreased since the 1970s, women's employment is currently decreasing. This {{has less to do with}} child-rearing and more with a poor job market for all women, mothers and non-mothers alike.|$|E

40|$|Aims and objectives: This paper {{presents}} a theory explaining the processes used by informal carers {{of people with}} dementia to mange alterations to their, and people with dementias' relationships with and places within their social worlds. Background: Informal carers provide the majority of care to people with dementia. A great deal of international <b>informal</b> dementia <b>care</b> research is available, much of which elucidates the content, impacts and consequences of the <b>informal</b> <b>caring</b> role and the coping mechanisms that carers use. However, the socially situated experiences and processes integral to <b>informal</b> <b>caring</b> in dementia {{have not yet been}} robustly accounted for. Design: A classic grounded theory approach was used as it is designed for research enquiries that aim to generate theory illustrating social patterns of action used to address an identified problem. Methods: Thirty interviews were conducted with 31 participants between 2006 – 2008. The theory was conceptualised from the data using the concurrent methods of theoretical sampling, constant comparative analysis, memo writing and theoretical sensitivity. Results: Informal carers' main concern was identified as ‘Living on the fringes’, which was stimulated by dementia-related stigma and living a different life. The theory of ‘Sustaining Place’ explains the social pattern of actions employed by informal carers to manage this problem on behalf of themselves and the person with dementia. Conclusions: The theory of ‘Sustaining Place’ identifies an imperative for nurses, other formal carers and society to engage in actions to support and enable social connectedness, social inclusion and citizenship for informal carers and people with dementia. Relevance to clinical practice: ‘Sustaining Place’ facilitates enhanced understanding of the complex and socially situated nature of <b>informal</b> dementia <b>care</b> through its portrayal of informal carers as social agents and can be used to guide nurses to better support those who live with dementia. 12 page(s...|$|R

Results: Data for 109 people with dementia were collected at baseline; 95 (87. 2 %) entered hospital from their own homes. By 12 months, 40 (36. 7 %) had died and 85 % of the survivors were living in care homes. Over one-half of people with dementia reported social care packages at baseline; those living alone had larger packages than those living with others.

40|$|Introduction <b>Informal</b> <b>caring</b> {{networks}} {{contribute significantly}} to end-of-life (EOL) care in the community. However, to ensure that these networks are sustainable, and unpaid carers are not exploited, primary carers need permission and practical assistance to gather networks together and negotiate the help they need. Our aim {{in this study was}} to develop an understanding of how formal and informal carers work together when care is being provided in a dying person's home. We were particularly interested in formal providers’ perceptions and knowledge of <b>informal</b> networks of <b>care</b> and in identifying barriers to the networks working together. Methods Qualitative methods, informed by an interpretive approach, were used. In February-July 2012, 10 focus groups were conducted in urban, regional, and rural Australia comprising 88 participants. Findings Our findings show that formal providers are aware, and supportive, of the vital role informal networks play in the care of the dying at home. A number of barriers to formal and informal networks working together more effectively were identified. In particular, we found that the Australian policy of health-promoting palliative is not substantially translating to practice. Conclusion Combinations of formal and <b>informal</b> <b>caring</b> networks are essential to support people and their primary carers. Formal service providers do little to establish, support, or maintain the informal networks although there is much goodwill and scope for them to do so. Further re-orientation towards a health-promoting palliative care and community capacity building approach is suggested...|$|R
