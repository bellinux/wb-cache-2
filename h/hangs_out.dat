5|$|Clannad story {{revolves}} around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year {{high school student}} who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him {{to distance himself from}} others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often <b>hangs</b> <b>out</b> in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.|$|E

While attempting to scale a cliff face, Haddock slips and <b>hangs</b> <b>out</b> of reach, imperilling Tintin, who is tied to him.

25|$|A stuff gag is {{very similar}} to, and works {{in the same way}} as, the ball gag. The person's mouth is stuffed with handkerchiefs, scarves, socks, hosiery, panties, day sheers, bandanas or any item rolled into a ball, acting as a stopper. To reduce the chances of choking, the stuff gag is never pushed all the way into the person's mouth. Instead, a large part of it <b>hangs</b> <b>out</b> of the mouth, {{allowing}} the top to pull it out easily when he/she has to. Sometimes, to further ensure that the gag does not accidentally slip deeper into the person's mouth, the top may use a larger gag. It is then secured with a cleave gag, cloth gag or tape gag.|$|E
25|$|The tongue evolved {{with the}} {{amphibians}} {{from the same}} structures that form fins in fishes. Most amphibians show a proper tongue after their metamorphosis. As a consequence most vertebrate animals - amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals - have tongues. In mammals such as dogs and cats, the tongue {{is often used to}} clean the fur and body by licking. The tongues of these species have a very rough texture which allows them to remove oils and parasites. Some dogs have a tendency to consistently lick a part of their foreleg which can result in a skin condition known as a lick granuloma. A dog's tongue also acts as a heat regulator. As a dog increases its exercise the tongue will increase in size due to greater blood flow. The tongue <b>hangs</b> <b>out</b> of the dog's mouth and the moisture on the tongue will work to cool the bloodflow.|$|E
