25|$|Maria demanded as Quisling's wife to get {{half the}} value of the bo. The {{directorate}} did not accept this, but accepted that she should get back <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> brought into it. She obtained many letters of support, including from Odd Nansen, a son of Fridtjof Nansen who had been imprisoned by the authorities during the occupation. In 1950, the Compensation directorate undid the sale of the apartment in Erling Skjalgssons street and she got it back. She continued to provide letters that were meant to document which things she had brought into the bo.|$|E
25|$|Wanting {{to go back}} to his {{interesting}} life, Kyon activates {{the program}} and goes back in time to the Tanabata of three years ago. After meeting up with the future Mikuru, he obtains an uninstall program from the past's Yuki, which needs to be shot at the culprit right after the change in the early hours of December 18. Returning to the present, they find the culprit, Yuki, who had borrowed Haruhi's power to change everyone's memories except Kyon's, giving him the choice of which world he would rather live in. Kyon questions himself about his choice and thinks to himself that a normal world without the SOS Brigade and Haruhi Suzumiya would be calm and peaceful and thinks Yuki was tired of <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to do like monitoring Haruhi's behavior and protecting Kyon, but finally decides that his original world was more interesting and fun. Kyon tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who had retained her psychotic behavior. Before Ryoko can finish him off, he is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself. He wakes up a few days later in a hospital, where the world is back to normal, but almost everyone believes Kyon had been in a coma since December 18 after falling down the stairs. When Yuki mentions to Kyon how the Data Integration Thought Entity would punish her for her actions, Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so the organization would cease to exist. As December 24 comes and his everyday life returns, Kyon decides there is still time before he has to go back in time to save himself and decides to join in on the Christmas party.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of former Prime Minister and Conservative Leader Margaret Thatcher in 2013, Miliband spoke in a House of Commons sitting {{specially}} convened to pay tributes to her. He noted that, although he disagreed {{with a few of}} her policies, he respected [...] "what her death means to the many, many people who admired her". He also said that Thatcher [...] "broke the mould" [...] in <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> achieved in her life, and that she had had the ability to [...] "overcome every obstacle in her path". He had previously praised Thatcher shortly before the Labour Party Conference in September 2012 for creating an [...] "era of aspiration" [...] in the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|Swift {{began writing}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] with the lyric [...] "And Abigail gave <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to a boy/ Who changed his mind/ We both cried", which {{eventually}} became the song's bridge, and continued writing {{everything else in}} a backwards manner. The song was written about Swift's freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, where she met her best friend Abigail Anderson. [...] "I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because I felt in my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far", Swift stated. The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks. Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone would have told her in a song when she was younger. [...] "The thing about high school, you don't know anything. You don't know anything, but you think you know everything", Swift said.|$|E
500|$|Erika Ramirez of Billboard {{magazine}} {{noted that}} there were two highlights of the night, aside from the choreography and vocal prowess; the dynamic between Beyoncé and her fans and the video montages from her personal life. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Beyoncé was in a [...] "fighting shape, breezing through four nights of wickedly aggressive modern R" [...] and added that the most [...] "attention-grabbing" [...] moments of the night were the covers of other artists that she performed during the concert. Chuck Darrow of the Philadelphia Media Network noted that [...] "Beyonce and her small army of supporting singers, dancers and musicians... conjured an impressive onslaught of sight, sound and motion." [...] He further noted that unlike Lady Gaga and Madonna who used [...] "sartorial extremism" [...] to call attention to themselves, [...] "It is testament to Beyonce's star-power that her stage incandescent presence never allowed the visual pyrotechnics behind her or the hyperkinetic dancers beside her to rise above the peripheral." [...] Praising the feminism showcased during the show, Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger wrote in his review that Beyoncé gave <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> for the concert pulling them out as vigorously as she could. He further added [...] "The star gave Ovation Hall exactly what it wanted, and left the new theater smoking. The problem for Revel now: following it up." [...] In another review, he described the concert as [...] "spellbinding", wrote that everything onstage was perfectly choreographed, down to the [...] "goofy mid-song mugging" [...] that added so much character to her performances. He concluded that no other pop artist sounds [...] "quite as awake" [...] as Beyoncé does.|$|E
2500|$|Harlean was nicknamed [...] "The Baby", a {{name that}} would stick with her {{for the rest of}} her life. She did not learn that her name was {{actually}} [...] "Harlean" [...] until the age of five, when she began to attend Miss Barstow's Finishing School for Girls in Kansas City. [...] Harlean and [...] "Mother Jean", as she became known when Harlean became a film star, remained very close. Harlean's mother was extremely protective and coddling, reportedly instilling a sense that her daughter owed <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to her.

2500|$|Stern made {{headlines}} after former child star Dana Plato committed suicide {{one day after}} visiting the show. Plato {{had been living in}} Tulsa, Oklahoma, surrounded by rumors of her sexuality and drug abuse, which became the biggest topic of the interview. After telling Stern she had been sober for over a decade and denying rumors about her lesbian relationship, some callers accused her of lying. At some point Stern suggested that Plato do a urinalysis to prove them wrong, while Plato agreed to give a hair sample for analysis. Plato was crying several times, mostly while offering her gratitude to callers who believed <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> said. Stern also asked her if she had ever considered suicide to which she replied, [...] "Hell no. I've got a beautiful boy. I'm OK in my skin. I'm OK with who I am." [...] Plato died of a drug overdose the next day.|$|E
2500|$|Teeny, {{also known}} as [...] "Little Girl" [...] and [...] "Sis" [...] (Marian Jordan) – a {{precocious}} youngster who frequently tried to cadge loose change from Fibber (often in cahoots with her rarely heard best friend Willie Toops). She often ended her sentences with [...] "I betcha!", and when someone mentioned food, or a word {{that sounded like a}} food, she usually responded [...] "I'm hungry." [...] Teeny was also known to lose track of her own conversations. When Fibber showed interest in what she was saying, she would forget all about it, and her conversation would switch from telling to asking. After Fibber repeated <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been telling him, Teeny would reply [...] "I know!" [...] or [...] "I know it!" [...] in a condescending way. Her appearances were sometimes foreshadowed by Molly excusing herself to the kitchen or to have a nap. Fibber would wistfully deliver a compliment to her, saying, [...] "Ah, there goes a good kid," [...] upon which the doorbell would ring and Teeny would appear, usually greeting Fibber with [...] "Hi, mister!" [...] On rare occasions Molly and Teeny would interact. In the December 21, 1948 broadcast Fibber learned that her real name was [...] "Elizabeth" [...] from a Christmas card she had sent him. She was perpetually a child, and her permanent youth was only mentioned once; Fibber asked her how old she was, to which she responded, [...] "Five". Then he asked how long she'd been coming over to visit him and Molly. [...] "Nine years," [...] she answered. Then, after a pause, she asked, [...] "Ain't it a wonderful world, mister?" ...|$|E
