25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E
500|$|In the evening, tens of {{thousands}} of government supporters, borrowing the anti-government protesters' slogan [...] "no Sunni, no Shia, only Bahraini", gathered in Al Fateh Mosque in Juffair. [...] One participant interviewed by The New York Times said, [...] "The democracy they have been asking for is already here, but the Shias, they have their ayatollahs, and whatever they say, they will run and do it. If they tell them to burn a house, they will. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a clear intention to disrupt this country".|$|E
500|$|By {{the same}} 8-1 majority, the Court found a {{separate}} and independent {{ground for the}} reversal of Burton's convictions. Burton had requested certain jury instructions, which the trial judge had delivered. But, along with the requested instructions, the trial judge had stated that: [...] " [...] asked by counsel for the defendant to give certain declarations here, and while <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> in the main, been covered by the charge, yet I will give them to you[...] [...] [...] These are abstract propositions of law, which I give {{in connection with the}} charge, as perhaps more fully amplifying it. I am willing to give them, inasmuch as they are asked, and they contain general propositions of law." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{did not see}} him any more, but I detest his memory. Of course my resentment did {{not extend}} to the students, and so I had an unforgettable good time talking to them. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a good time too, for they responded [...] "as one man," [...] to use Susy's unimprovable phrase.|$|R
5000|$|They {{definitely}} caught us by surprise. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been on patrol, or {{had been}} scrambled, and {{when they saw the}} smoke from the train they knew where we were and attacked out of the cloud. The Spitfire XIV is definitely better than the Me 109, as I could do a better climbing turn even with my drop tanks still on! ...|$|R

Then I fixed my eyes upon the bird.|$|R
500|$|David Jaffe, {{creator and}} Game Director of the {{original}} God of War, spoke with NowGamer prior to the first press announcement in late April. He {{said that if he}} had worked on Ascension, he would have incorporated three specific elements: different myths, a co-star, and [...] "look to the Zelda structure as a jumping off point". He liked the idea of a cooperative mode, and added [...] "I'd love to see player one be Kratos and player two be this stupid annoying sidekick that—for some to be determined story reason—Kratos is stuck with for the whole adventure and in the end, once the main quest is over, Kratos just snaps the poor kid's neck". In May 2012, Jaffe spoke with IGN about the multiplayer element: [...] "I think it looks cool. It looks like another great, impeccably executed Sony Santa Monica game", and added, [...] "If {{it turns out to be}} the case that the single player is watered down because of , then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> some justification. But I don't see any evidence of that, and I don't see evidence of that based on the team they are." ...|$|E
500|$|Milan were {{regarded}} as favourites and their team included many players who had experienced success in the competition. The most notable was captain Paolo Maldini, who had won the competition four times previously, all with Milan, and Clarence Seedorf who had won the competition three times with three different clubs. Liverpool had been considered underdogs throughout the competition, but had beaten more favoured opposition, including Juventus and Chelsea, to reach the final. Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez acknowledged this: [...] "Maybe Milan are favourites, but we have confidence, and we can win". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger felt Liverpool would win the match: [...] "I fancy Liverpool as Milan look jaded physically and certainly mentally, by losing the [...] title, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> never had a better chance than now to beat Milan." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was not so optimistic, stating that the Liverpool side were {{not as good as}} the one that had won the 2001 UEFA Cup Final: [...] "No disrespect to the squad we have got now but it is obvious we are not as strong as we were when we won the UEFA Cup in 2001. Back then we had a settled team and that season when we went into games against Barcelona and Roma, we always felt we were as good as them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conwell {{talked to}} Zap2it about Leslie's romance with Neil, stating [...] "hopefully we'll be working {{together}} more. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> good energy." [...] They have since began to inch closer {{and he gave}} her a job offer for Jabot Cosmetics. Luke Kerr from Daytime Confidential recapped the storyline, [...] "At Jabot, Leslie told Neil she couldn’t accept his job offerbecause she was thinking about him as a man. She told him it would be inappropriate for them to end up in a relationship if they were working together. Neil finally convinced her that if they had an overwhelming urge to date, he would fire her. Leslie accepted the job." [...] In December 2012, Redaric Williams was introduced to the series as her brother Tyler Michaelson, Leslie's first family member to appear on the soap opera. Williams told Soap Opera Digest that although Tyler is [...] "impatient", he gets along with his sister [...] "really well" [...] and they are [...] "very comfortable with each other".|$|E

30|$|Actually I {{would have}} liked to have pursued it a bit but we had already spent more than the allotted amount of time on this {{demonstration}} and I had shown them periodicity for shorter periods already so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> grasped the concept quite well so the fact that I didn’t actually get a period of 16 bugged me a bit but not enough to ruin the rest of the lecture.|$|R

And then, after a disappearance of more than eight years, Crispina returned with dramatic suddenness to the home she had left so mysteriously.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo {{commented on}} the rivalry by saying: [...] "I think we push each other {{sometimes}} in the competition, {{this is why the}} competition is so high", while Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, Alex Ferguson opined that [...] "I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best". Messi has denied any rivalry, saying that it was [...] "only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano". In response to claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: [...] "We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't {{with a lot of other}} players", before adding that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: [...] "We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing".|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1982 when the Compact Disc was being introduced, Blyth {{researched}} {{the possibilities of}} creating a digital mixing console. He told Billboard magazine that Soundcraft would not be [...] "leaping into digital {{in the way that}} Neve has done. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> gone too far, too quickly.... We are looking at the digital control of analog functions as the first step in that direction." [...] Picking up the pace in the 2000s, Blyth, together with Product Manager Andy Brown, created the Soundcraft Vi6, a digital mixer intended for sound reinforcement applications, released mid-2006. Its interface was a development of Vistonics, a broadcast and studio mixing concept from Harman-owned Studer combined with a digital effects package from Lexicon. Regarding digital audio equipment, Blyth is of the opinion that [...] "companies that take great care over their analog stages, use the best internal digital format and write the best DSP code end up with the best sounding product." [...] He said that he has [...] "strong views on the whole subject of digital consoles, which could fill an article with mostly purple prose", but he notes that [...] "best-in-class analog product these days is truly excellent, but so is digital." [...] Blyth continues today as technical director at Soundcraft Studer's design offices at Potters Bar, [...] north of London.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a reward}} {{for some of the}} stuff he has done over the past two years.

He has fought against a perception and broken it down. This should be his reward.|$|R

But there was something even in this flat humility that seemed to him to mock him, so that he flushed crimson with rage and spite and flung her away. [...] "You always were an idiot!

5000|$|In 2002 Noel Gallagher of Oasis {{revealed}} that [...] "I {{started to get}} into music early on because all the older guys that lived round our way were in a band from Burnage called the Stockholm Monsters.
