The loan performance indices estimated reveal that over 75 % of the loans disbursed by AKSALB in the period under review were still held by 59 percent of the loan beneficiaries. This situation {{is an indication of}} high level of loan defaulting among the benefiting farmers. Certain personal and facility factors are estimated to determine the probability of default among the beneficiaries.

30|$|Fertilizers {{are one of}} {{the major}} inputs into dairy farming, {{accounting}} for approximately 12.5  % of operating <b>farm</b> <b>expenditure</b> (DairyNZ 2013). Fertilizer production, in general, is considered a high, energy-intensive process as, for example, nitrogen-based fertilizers are made primarily from natural gas. This is confirmed by the studies of Baffes (2007) and Baffes (2011), in which high pass-through from energy indices, for example, crude oil to fertilizer indices, is found. In addition, processing milk to butter also requires significant energy input. This suggests that a direct relationship between butter and crude oil is to be expected. In addition, transportation costs for butter and dairy commodities are mainly influenced by oil costs, thus further strengthening the relationship between butter and crude oil. This argument was used to explain correlation effects between crude oil and agricultural commodities, and, in particular, butter, in the study of Huchet-Bourdon (2011).|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} three decades {{following}} the implementation of land reforms, the agricultural sector in Kerala has undergone wide-ranging changes in terms of farm size, cropping pattern, cultivation practices and productivity. There has been a phenomenal {{growth in the number of}} agricultural holdings leading to the emergence of a large number of very smallholdings. Of course, agricultural productivity also increased significantly during this period. The major question examined in this paper is whether the increase in productivity of land is explained by the decrease in the size of holdings. The agricultural census figures suggest a possible relation between the two. In order to verify this relationship data were collected through a sample survey in a rural locality in Kerala. A size-wise analysis of productivity indicated that it is the large farms, which have higher productivity. However, more detailed analysis using regression methods shows that no firm relationship exists between farm size and productivity. To identify the causal factors of productivity further in-depth analysis of the data was made.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{characteristics}} of contract farming and its profitability based on the field survey conducted in the paddy region of Central Taiwan in 2007. The feature of mechanization of rice farming in Taiwan is characterized by contract farming. The study case is a typical example of large scale operation of the "long-distance" type contract work. Features of contract farming are as follows. The first is introduction of imported, large and high-performance machines. The second is the operation of "long-distance" type, covering a travel distance of over 100 km. The third is the different charge settings for the neighboring country and the local town. The fourth is the use of auxiliary labor force in the contract work. Based on the actual state of contract farming in 2007, as well as the work journal and record of <b>farm</b> <b>expenditures</b> of the study case, we will examine the profitability of contract farming.

40|$|In this paper, input {{subsidies}} (fertiliser {{subsidies to}} be exact) have {{been related to}} the allocative efficiency of fertiliser input. Fertiliser was singled out not to ignore other inputs but to emphasise the fact that fertiliser accounts for at least 30 {{percent of the total}} <b>farm</b> <b>expenditure</b> in most of Asia, {{and the rest of the}} expense is accounted for by labour (which is primarily family labour). The regression results are based on a sample survey data of 150 farms of Khulna Division (Bangladesh) for the year 1986 - 87. We have first estimated a production function based on Hoque (1991) and then calculated the efficiency indices based on the estimated parameters of the production function. In the second stage regression, different farm sizes were regressed on efficiency indices which showed an overall inverse relationship (that is, the smaller the farm size, the higher the efficiency). This tendency is observed upto the size of 10 acres in case of fertiliser input. Thus, the farms upto the size of 10 acres should be subsidised to promote efficiency in production. However, if the selective subsidy programme is difficult to administer, one hundred percent subsidy may be worthwhile. It is argued that the withdrawal of the fertiliser subsidy will reduce efficiency and have an adverse impact on employment and output in the rural sector of Asia. The IFPRI (1987) study on Indonesia also clearly indicates this. Some indicative discussions in Section II and Section V support the statistical results in favour of fertiliser subsidy. ...|$|E
40|$|Commissioner Fischler {{reiterated the}} EU's {{approach}} to reform {{at a meeting}} on March 11 th 2002 with Stuart Harbinson, the new Chair of the agricultural negotiations in the WTO. He {{pointed out that the}} EU would say 'yes' to more market opening, provided it is done in a way which enables everyone to benefit from new market opportunities and protects geographical indications such as 'Roquefort' cheese or 'Parma' ham against usurpation of names; 'yes' to reductions in forms of export assistance, which is already subject to WTO disciplines, provided other forms of export subsidies are similarly disciplined and reduced; and 'yes' to reductions in trade distorting support, provided that WTO members remain free to ensure that their farmers can continue to meet the wider goals and expectations of society, such as environment or food safety. Comment: The EU's approach to WTO negotiations is conditional upon progress in related areas and an acceptance of new ways of promoting wider agricultural and rural development objectives. The EU rightly points out how, prior to the initiation of CAP reform (in the 1989 - 91 period), EU <b>farm</b> <b>expenditure</b> for price support and export refunds accounted for 90. 7 % of the farm budget, and how, {{as a consequence of the}} process of CAP reform, these trade distorting forms of assistance will have fallen to only 21. 3 % of the CAP budget by 2006, with 78. 7 % of the budget going to less trade distorting or non-trade distorting forms of assistance. However it needs to be borne in mind that the notion of less trade distorting is a relative concept. In the cereals sector these less trade distorting forms of aid have nevertheless allowed EU production to increase 26 % in response to a 50 % decline in average cereal prices. This is not a normal supply side response to price declines. Thus it can be seen that even less trade distorting forms of aid have profound effects on production decisions in the EU.

In 2013, the AERU developed and tested a methodology for identifying and quantifying the socio-economic impacts of expenditure flows from the rural sector on adjacent urban areas. The impacts of expenditure flows from farms, farm households, rural-servicing businesses and food processing businesses located in the Selwyn and Waimakariri districts on the Christchurch economy have been estimated during three stages of the study. In the first stage the methodology was developed and the expenditure flows from farms and rural-servicing businesses were estimated. In the second stage, the inter-annual differences in <b>farm</b> <b>expenditure</b> flows, and the potential impacts of increasing irrigation development were examined, and lastly the contribution of the food processing sector in Selwyn and Waimakariri districts to economic activity in Christchurch was estimated. A three-step process was used to estimate the total expenditure flows from farms, farm households and rural-servicing businesses into Christchurch from the two adjoining districts. A postal survey of farms was carried out to obtain information about the proportions of farm and farm household expenditure spent locally, in Christchurch, and elsewhere by expenditure category. Estimation of the expenditure by all farms and farm households was undertaken by overlaying the survey data with data from the Statistics New Zealand Household Economic Survey and the Ministry of Primary Industries Farm Monitoring data. A web-based survey of rural businesses to acquire information on where they purchased supplies was conducted, and the survey results and secondary data were used to estimate the total value of rural business expenditure in Christchurch.

Calculating impacts using differences between forecast and actual <b>farm</b> production and <b>expenditure</b> by <b>farm</b> type is both feasible and produces far more reliable impact estimates.

40|$|With a {{large portion}} of U. S. <b>farm</b> {{production}} <b>expenditures</b> related to the cost of fertilizer, seed, and chemicals, producers within the Corn Belt region are looking for new methods and/or planting processes that would deliver higher levels of production efficiencies and lower operating costs. Specifically within the planting operation, Corn Belt producers are faced with the challenge to better manage the higher cost of crop inputs in order to sustain profitability. The primary objective of this thesis is to examine new planting technologies that would better manage planting applications while directly lowering related input costs. Another objective is to understand through regression analysis how various planting variables affect yield potential. Results from the regression analysis illustrate how the various planting variables affect yield and show the importance of “real-time ” planter management, advancements possible only with the new planter technology. Customer surveys and several on-site customer visits were conducted throughout the Corn Belt to better understand the actual needs of producers for new planting technologies. Throughout the customer visits, specific questions about the producers...|$|R
40|$|The President {{has called}} for a $ 6. 96 billion savings in {{expenditures}} to agriculture over a five year period. A budget reconciliation is required to achieve these targeted savings from <b>farm</b> bill authorized <b>expenditures.</b> This study uses optimal control theory and farm level simulation to quantify the impacts on U. S. crop producers of reducing federal spending for agricultural income supports. Results indicate that the least harmful method for the Agricultural Committees to achieve budget savings of $ 3 billion is to reduce loan rates. At higher levels of net budget savings, some risk adverse decision makers would prefer that the Committees reduce target prices. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R
