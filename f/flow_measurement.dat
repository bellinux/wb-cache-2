25|$|Weirs allow hydrologists and {{engineers}} a simple method of measuring the {{volumetric flow rate}} in small to medium-sized streams/rivers or in industrial discharge locations. Since the geometry {{of the top of}} the weir is known and all water flows over the weir, the depth of water behind the weir can be converted to a rate of flow. However, this can only be achieved in locations where all water flows {{over the top of the}} weir crest (as opposed to around the sides or through conduits/sluices) and at locations where the water that flows over the crest is carried away from the structure. If these conditions are not met, it can make <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> complicated, inaccurate or even impossible.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} catchments {{that are}} almost ungauged, i. e., catchments for which {{only a small number}} of point <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> are available. In these catchments, hydrologists may still need to simulate continuous streamflow time series using a rainfall-runoff model, and the methodology presented here allows using few point measurements for model parameterization. The method combines regional information (parameter sets of neighboring gauged stations) and local information (contributed by the point measurements) within a framework where the relative weight of each source of information is made dependent on the number of point measurements available. This approach is tested with two different hydrological models on a set of 609 catchments in France. The results show that on average a few <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> can significantly improve the simulation efficiency, and that 10 measurements can reduce the performance gap between the gauged and ungauged situations by more than 50 %. The added value of regional information progressively decreases until being almost insignificant when sufficient <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> are available. Model parameters tend to come closer to the values obtained by calibration in fully gauged conditions as the number of point <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> increases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background One {{potential}} source of error in phase contrast (PC) congenital CMR <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> is caused by phase offsets due to local non-compensated eddy currents. Phantom correction of these phase offset errors {{has been shown to}} result in more accurate <b>measurements</b> of blood <b>flow</b> in adults with structurally normal hearts. We report the effect of phantom correction on PC <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> at a clinical congenital CMR program. Results Flow was measured in the ascending aorta, main pulmonary artery, and right and left pulmonary arteries as clinically indicated, and additional values such as Qp/Qs were derived from these measurements. Phantom correction in our study population of 149 patients resulted in clinically significant changes in 13 % to 48 % of these phase-contrast measurements in patients with known or suspected heart disease. Overall, 640 measurements or calculated values were analyzed, and clinically significant changes were found in 31 %. Larger vessels were associated with greater phase offset errors, with 22 % of the changes in PC <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> attributed {{to the size of the}} vessel measured. In patients with structurally normal hearts, the pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio after phantom correction was closer to 1. 0 than before phantom correction. There was no significant difference in the effect of phantom correction for patients with tetralogy of Fallot as compared to the group as a whole. Conclusions Phantom correction often resulted in clinically significant changes in PC blood <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> in patients with known or suspected congenital heart disease.
