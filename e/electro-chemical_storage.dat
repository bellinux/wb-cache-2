40|$|For {{large-scale}} {{energy storage}} application, flow battery has {{the advantages of}} decoupled power and energy management, extended life cycles and relatively low cost of unit energy output ($/kWh). In this thesis, an overview of various flow battery technologies has been presented, with comparison to other energy storage technologies available in the market. It {{has been found that}} though flow batteries generally have lower energy density than other <b>electro-chemical</b> <b>storage</b> systems, the easy scalability of energy/power capacity at very low O&M cost enables flow batteries {{to be one of the}} fastest emerging energy storage technologies. The intellectual property landscape of current flow battery market has also been reviewed. The three dominating flow battery technologies in the market are Regenesys polysulfide/bromide redox flow battery (PBR), zinc/bromine battery (ZBB) and all vanadium redox flow battery (VRB). VRB has been chosen for an in-depth analysis of its design and technology, mainly because of its halogen-free operation and superior electrolyte properties. A cost model based on VRB system has been built in the context of Singapore, and the Capital Cost per Cycle (CCPC) for a 250 kW VRB system with 8 hours of discharge duration is estimated to be about $ 0. 0828 /kWh. However, this figure changes considerably with the materials' costs, the design of electrolyte and cell stack, as well as the power and energy capacity of the system. Based on this cost model, it is also investigated in this thesis that in view of the current electricity prices, it is economically unfeasible to implement VRB system for bulk electricity price arbitrage in Singapore. (cont.) The VRB-based flow battery system has also been evaluated together with other technologies, such as solar PV panels for electricity generation, in the implementation models in group project. The final conclusion is that at current electricity and oil price in Singapore, implementing "green technologies", such as electricity generation from solar energy with energy storage system, still faces tremendous financial barrier. Greater government incentives and higher fossil fuel price volatility are necessary for these green technologies to be viable in the near future. by Yaliang Chen. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Modern society uses {{electrical}} energy {{for a wide}} range of needs and requirements. Electrical energy is considered high value as it requires a prior conversion step from kinetic/thermal or solar energy. However, electrical power is always defined by certain properties which typically need to be adjusted in multiple stages to satisfy the specifications of electrical loads such as motors, lighting and consumer electronics. For DC (direct current) power systems, switching DC-DC power converters are the state-of-the-art solution to achieve a low-loss modification of the voltage magnitude. The Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter is an attractive DC-DC conversion topology that can widely satisfy the future needs of DC power management and the integration of <b>electro-chemical</b> <b>storage.</b> It offers an unmatched capability to transfer energy in either direction between two DC sources while its inherent Zero Voltage Switching capability offers potential for high conversion efficiency and high power density. The current and future research activities on DAB converters mainly focus on maximising the power density through a volume reduction of the embedded passive power devices. This trend is encouraged by the market introduction of wide bandgap fast-switching semiconductor devices using Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium-Nitride (GaN) to replace conventional Silicon material in many applications. The reduced parasitic capacitance and transition time of these devices allow to significantly increase the converter operating frequencies, which is the only way to increase the power density unless the material specifications of passive power devices drastically evolve. However, a higher operating frequency inevitably leads to a stronger influence of practical second-order effects, which for a DAB, particularly address the non-ideality of the switch devices, the parasitic coupling impedances in the high-frequency transformer, the peripheral connecting traces of the AC link network and the DC bus filter. Hence, all these effects have to be accommodated by a universal design framework which is yet to be found in literature. A DAB is conventionally designed using time domain analysis of the modulation sequence and device waveforms to evaluate its key performance design criteria such as active power transfer, Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) and AC link circulating power. This analysis technique typically presumes an idealized single parameter AC link inductance to substitute for the more complex circuit model of a practical high-frequency transformer. This becomes particularly relevant as the operating frequencies increase, causing both active and passive power devices to become less ideal. More than that, advanced multi-level DAB Phase Shifted Square Wave (PSSW) modulation strategies lead to a wide solution space of control parameters that can be used to enhance the performance of a DAB by shaping the AC link current in certain ways. Within the time domain, such volatile modulation strategies require a complicated structure model analysis. This thesis now shows how to apply frequency domain harmonic analysis techniques to a DAB DC-DC converter. The approach readily accommodates the influence of complex impedance structures, practical switching effects and advanced multi-level modulation concepts, and leads to generic numerical and analytical solution expressions that significantly enhance the converter design process. The work thus establishes a new analysis strategy in the advancing field of DAB research. The thesis begins with the harmonic decomposition of the bridge output voltages and the expression of the DAB coupling network as a generic two-port impedance model. These steps establish the frequency domain analysis (FDA) framework. Next, the FDA approach is applied to derive explicit solution terms for the ZVS regions of single and three-phase DAB converters, which are crucial to minimise the power loss of the semiconductor devices during the switching transition. These expressions are used to separately investigate the impact of single impedance parameters, non-ideal switching transitions and PSSW modulation concepts on the ZVS limiting conditions, which determine the preferable operating regions to achieve minimum switching loss operation and best possible controllability of the DAB. From this work, it is shown how a single element high-frequency transformer with a reduced coupling factor is sufficient to ensure continuous and reliable ZVS operation without adding software or auxiliary hardware complexity. More than that, the strategy quantifies the impedance design parameters of the coupling network in correlation with the selected PSSW modulation concept. In this context, the benefit of adaptive 3 -level DAB modulation is presented to support continuous ZVS operation and thus allow for high-efficient operation of a single phase DAB across its entire operating range. Finally, the established modeling framework is extended to identify the DC bus harmonics injected by the PSSW modulation process, for any particular DAB design and operating context. It is also shown how adaptive modulation can be used to mitigate certain harmonic frequencies that can otherwise cause severe harmonic interferences, DC bus oscillations, and thus impact on the DC side filter design process. To complete the work, experimental results are presented to verify the analytical development, using a laboratory DAB converter that can operate across a wide range of DC voltages at power levels up to 1 kW. Simultaneously, as part of an industry project with BOSCH, a customised 1. 2 kW DAB prototype was built using the presented design guidelines, which achieved a conversion efficiency between 96. 5 % and 98. 5 % across the operating range...|$|E

40|$|A {{transcritical}} {{heat pump}} (THP) cycle using carbon dioxide (CO 2) as the refrigerant {{is known to}} feature an excellent coefficient of performance (COP) as a thermodynamic system. Using this feature, we are designing and building a system that combines a water-to-water CO 2 heat pump with both hot and cold thermal storages know as Thermal Battery (TB) (Blarke, 2012). Smart and effective use of intermittent renewable energy resources (for example solar and wind power) is obtained supplying water heating (3 ̆e 70 oC) and cooling services (3 ̆c 10 oC) for residential and commercial buildings. Our fundamental hypothesis is that if electricity generated by intermittent sources is destined for thermal end-uses an efficient conversion of electricity to thermal energy and storage enables a flexible power supply. Thermal storage is more cost-effective than any <b>electro-chemical</b> or mechanical <b>storage</b> technology.

40|$|International audienceAnatase TiO 2 is a {{potential}} negative electrode for sodium-ion batteries. The sodium storage mechanism is, however, still under debate, yet its comprehension is required to optimize the electrochemical properties. To clarify the sodium storage mechanism occurring in anatase, we have used both electrochemical and chemical routes from which we obtained similar trends. During the first discharge, an irreversible plateau region is observed which corresponds to the insertion of Na + within the interstitial sites of anatase and {{is accompanied by a}} drastic loss of the long-range order as revealed by x-ray diffraction, high resolution of high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. Further structural analysis of the total scattering data indicates that the sodiated phase displays a layered-like rhombohedral R- 3 m structure built from the stacking of Ti and Na slabs. Because of the initial 3 D network of anatase, the reduced phase shows strong disorder due to cationic inter-mixing between the Ti and Na slabs and the refined chemical formula is (Na 0. 43 Ti 0. 57) 3 a(0. 22 Na 0. 39 Ti 0. 39) 3 bO 2 where refers to vacancy. The presence of high valence Ti ions in the Na layers induces a contraction of the c-parameter as compared to the ordered phase. Upon de-sodiation, the structure further amorphized and the local structure probed by PDF is shown to be similar to the anatase TiO 2 suggesting that the 3 D network is recovered. The reversible sodium insertion/de-insertion is thus attributed to the rhombohedral active phase formed during the first discharge, and an oxidized phase featuring the local structure of anatase. Due to the amorphous nature of the two phases, the potential-composition curves are characterized by a sloping curve. Finally, a comparison between the intercalation of lithium and sodium into anatase TiO 2 performed by DFT calculations confirmed that for the sodiated phase, the rhombohedral structure is more stable than the tetragonal phase observed during the lithiation of nanoparticles. In many areas of modern life, lithium-ion batteries are ubiquitous as energy-storage solutions. The growing demand for higher energy density and lower cost of <b>electro-chemical</b> energy <b>storage</b> devices, however, has motivated a search for auxiliary technologies based on alternative chemistries. 1, 2 One possible candidate is the sodium-ion battery, which is attractive because of the high earth– abundance of sodium, and lower cost versus lithium-ion batteries, due to compatibility with aluminum as the an-odic current collector. 3 - 5 Development of sodium-ion batteries has been largely stimulated by knowledge of lithium-ion analogues. The intercalation of Na + or Li + ions into a host lattice can, however, give qualitatively different voltage profiles, corresponding to different intercalation mechanisms. For example, lithium insertion in Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is accompanied by a spinel to rock-salt phase transition. 6, 7 The equivalent sodium insertion, however, proceeds via a complex three-phase–separation mechanism (spinel to two rock-salt phases of Li 7 Ti 5 O 12 and Na 6 LiTi 5 O 12). 8 Such differences in intercalation behaviour can often be attributed to different properties of Li versus Na, such as ionic radius and polarizability. 9, 10 In general, however, the performance of electrodes in sodium-ion batteries cannot be understood by simply extrapolating from their behaviour versus lithium, when it is necessary to carefully reexamine the sodium-intercalation behaviour...|$|R
