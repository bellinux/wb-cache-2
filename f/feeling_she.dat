Actress Jami Gertz was also offered the role but declined, while actress Leah Remini auditioned for Monica before ultimately being cast as Carrie Heffernan in the sitcom The King of Queens in 1998; Remini would eventually guest star in an episode of Friends.

Keaton's girlfriend, on the sitcom Family Ties; and Melissa Robinson in the comedy film [...] (1994), opposite Jim Carrey. After guest starring on the sitcom Seinfeld as Meryl, main character Jerry Seinfeld's girlfriend, the producers offered Cox the role of Monica's spoiled best friend Rachel because the actress [...] "had this cheery, upbeat energy", which was significantly different than how they had envisioned Monica at the time. <b>Feeling</b> <b>she</b> was not [...] "quirky" [...] enough to portray Rachel, Cox lobbied in favor of playing Monica instead because she {{was drawn to the}} character's [...] "strong" [...] personality, but the producers feared that she was not [...] "tough" [...] enough for the role, which was offered to actress Jennifer Aniston, alongside whom Cox would eventually co-star. Meanwhile, a close competitor for the role was actress Nancy McKeon; Littlefield recalled having greatly enjoyed both actress' auditions equally, and left the final decision up to Crane and Kauffman. Ultimately, Cox won the role over McKeon because the creators noticed [...] "something fresh" [...] in her audition; Kauffman elaborated that Cox ultimately [...] "brought a whole bunch of other colors" [...] to Monica than what they had first envisioned back when they were considering Garofalo for the part. Meanwhile, Aniston ultimately won the role of Rachel.|$|E
