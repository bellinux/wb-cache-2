40|$|The <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishant</b> storage {{temperature}} requirements were examined for several commercially available dry chemicals. Particular emphasis {{was placed on}} the development of dry powder extinguishant that, when discharged into a jet engine fuel leak fire, would stick to the hot surfaces. Moreover, after putting out the initial fire, these extinguishants would act as antireignition catalysts, even when the fuel continued to leak onto the heated surface...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} use of bromotrifluoromethane (CBrF 3) as a <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishant</b> in aircraft, spacecraft and submarines has stimulated {{increasing interest}} {{and research in}} the toxicological properties of this compound. In a spacecraft, because of its unique recirculating life support system, the introduction of CBrF 3 by leakage or intentional discharge, will result in continuous exposure of crewman to low concentrations of this compound for periods of up to 7 days, or possibly even longer. The effects of low concentrations of CBrF 3, under continuous exposure conditions, on the CNS and cardiovascular systems of animals to enable an assessment of these risks were investigated...|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} F-gases are {{hydrofluorocarbons}} (HFCs), which contain hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon.

50|$|In 1993, 3M {{considered}} fluorocarbons as <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishants</b> {{to replace}} CFCs. This extinguishing effect has {{been attributed to}} their high heat capacity, which takes heat away from the fire. It has been suggested that an atmosphere containing a significant percentage of perfluorocarbons on a space station or similar would prevent fires altogether.|$|R
40|$|A 41 -year-old chemist {{developed}} {{methyl iodide}} intoxication. His case is {{presented with a}} review of pertinent literature. Characteristics of the poisoning include a delay between exposure and onset of symptoms; early systemic toxicity with congestive changes in the lungs and oliguric renal failure; prominent cerebellar and Parkinsonian neurologic symptoms as well as seizures and coma in severe cases; and psychiatric disturbances that can last from months to years. Although methyl iodide is a rare form of intoxicant, its manifestations are {{similar to that of}} poisoning with the other monohalomethanes that are not uncommon. INTOXICATION with the monohalomethanes is not rare. Methyl bromide has been used extensively in the United States and Europe as a fumigant, refrigerant, and <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishant.</b> More than 150 cases of methyl bromid...|$|E
40|$|Bromotrifluoromethane (CBrF 3), {{commonly}} known as Ha-lon 1301, {{is used as a}} <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishant</b> in the Space Shuttle. Several scenarios, such as a fire or a faulty alarm, could lead to its discharge resulting in a Halon 1301 concentration of up to 1 % in the spacecraft cabin atmosphere. To examine the effects of Halon 1301 on mental performance and physiologic func-tion, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration spon-sored a human inhalation study. Four pairs of adult male sub-jects were each exposed in a double-blind fashion for 24 hr to 1 % (10, 000 ppm or 60, 875 mg/m 3) Halon 1301 and to air in two separate exposures approximately 1 week apart. Mental perfor-mance and physiologic function were assessed and the results are reported in a companion paper (D. S. Calkins, J. J. Degioanni, M. N. Tan, J. R. Davis, and D. L. Pierson. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 20, in press). Blood and breath samples from th...|$|E

The effect of Halon 1301 on mental performance and physiologic function was investigated in a NASA-sponsored human inhalation study in which four pairs of male subjects were each exposed in a double-blind fashion for 24 hr to 1 percent Halon 1301 and to air in two exposures about 1 week apart. Blood and breath samples from the exposed subjects were collected to provide dosimetric and toxicokinetic information. Halon 1301 blood levels increased rapidly and approached a steady state within 2 hr of the beginning the exposure; the steady-state concentration was approximately 3 - 4. 5 microg/ml. Breath samples collected during exposures closely reflected chamber concentrations. Analysis of postexposure blood samples revealed that Halon 1301 was eliminated biphasically with an average t(1 / 2) alpha and t(1 / 2) beta of 4. 5 min and 200 min, respectively...|$|E
50|$|Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are the {{compounds}} consisting of fluorine and carbon. They {{are widely used}} in the electronics, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries, {{as well as in}} refrigeration when combined with other gases.

40|$|CONTEXT: Although {{there are}} ample {{data on the}} {{respiratory}} effects of exposure to fire extinguisher gas, the potential hematologic effects have not been fully documented. We conducted this study to determine the possible etiologic agent(s) for a decrease in red blood cells among community residents in Taipei, Taiwan, after they were exposed to leakage of mixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishants</b> containing bromotrifluoromethane (CF 3 Br, Halon 1301), bromochlorodifluoromethane (CF 2 BrCl, Halon 1211), and dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl 2 F 2, CFC- 12). CASE PRESENTATION: We studied 117 exposed residents who came into one hospital for physical examinations. We also selected age- and sex-matched referents for comparison from residents {{who came to the}} same hospital for health examinations. Nine months after the exposure to mixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishants,</b> 91 of the exposed residents came back for a second physical examination. In the first examination of the exposed residents, we found a significant reduction in red blood cell count and hemoglobin and a relationship between dose and response. DISCUSSION: After excluding iron-deficiency anemia, thalassemia, and other possible agents, we suspected that the hematologic effects might have resulted from pyrolytic products of CFC- 12 and Halon 1211, which may contain phosgene, among other products. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The acute transient hematologic effects observed in the exposed residents were associated with the incident of leakage of mixed fire-extinguisher gases and were most likely caused by a small amount of pyrolytic products, probably phosgene. Nine months after the exposure, we found a significant improvement in the abnormalities without any specific treatment...|$|R
2500|$|The haloalkanes (also {{known as}} halogenoalkanes or alkyl halides) are {{a group of}} {{chemical}} compounds derived from alkanes containing one or more halogens. They are {{a subset of the}} general class of halocarbons, although the distinction is not often made. Haloalkanes are widely used commercially and, consequently, are known under many chemical and commercial names. They are used as flame retardants, <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishants,</b> refrigerants, propellants, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Subsequent to the widespread use in commerce, many halocarbons have also been shown to be serious pollutants and toxins. For example, the chlorofluorocarbons have been shown to lead to ozone depletion. Methyl bromide is a controversial fumigant. Only haloalkanes which contain chlorine, bromine, and iodine are a threat to the ozone layer, but fluorinated volatile haloalkanes in theory may have activity as greenhouse gases. Methyl iodide, a naturally occurring substance, however, does not have ozone-depleting properties and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated the compound a non-ozone layer depleter. For more information, see Halomethane. Haloalkane or alkyl halides are the compounds which have the general formula [...] "RX" [...] where R is an alkyl or substituted alkyl group and X is a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I).|$|R
40|$|According to the ADR {{regulations}} (Section 8. 1. 4) vehicles transporting {{dangerous goods}} shall have as minimum a 6 kg dry powder {{portable fire extinguisher}} suitable against fires in brakes, tyres or in the goods. Due {{to the fact that}} there is a doubt in whether a 6 kg dry powder portable fire extinguisher will be sufficient to extinguish a severe fire in a twin tyre, the Directorate for Fire and Explosion Prevention in Norway has initiated a test programme at Norges branntekniske laboratorium as (NBL) for testing of different types of portable fire extinguishers against tyre fires. In addition, a literature study is carried out in order to obtain updated information concerning fire fighting of tyre fires. The objective of the test programme has been to achieve reliable information concerning the fire extinguishing efficiency of different <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishants</b> or agents and to select the best-suited portable fire extinguisher or agent agianst tyre fires. The experience gained from the project will be used in connection with a forthcoming revision of the ADR regulations. This report describes the experimental set-up, the expermental procedure and the results from the test series involving 22 tyre fire trials as well as the literature study.
