40|$|The {{quality of}} fruit of Cox 2 ̆ 7 s Orange Pippin and Red Jonathan from {{different}} soil management treatments was tested in 1969 {{and again in}} 1970. The range of tests included soluble solids, reducing sugar and acid contents, texture measurements and taste <b>panel</b> assessment. <b>The</b> non-cultivation treatment gave the highest yields {{and the quality of}} fruit of both cultivars from all treatments was acceptable. Grass improved the quality of Cox 2 ̆ 7 s Orange Pippin in 1969 but not in 1970. Cultivation gave higher soluble solids levels than non-cultivation for Red Jonathan in both seasons. There was no correlation between soluble solids content and taste panel response for either cultivar. However, solids levels of fruit from the different treatments tested were close together thus making <b>it</b> difficult <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> to distinguish between samples. Soluble solids levels increased in fruit of Cox 2 ̆ 7 s Orange Pippin during storage at 1 °C in 1969 but remained constant in 1970. Levels in Red Jonathan decreased in both seasons. Fruit of Cox 2 ̆ 7 s Orange Pippin became softer during storage in both seasons while fruit of Red Jonathan softened only in 1969. Acid levels for fruit of both cultivars from the different soil management treatments were not significantly different in either season...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—the main {{objective}} of this project is {{to develop and implement}} a prototype of a controller scheme using latest control algorithms and drives technology to capture maximum sun energy from sun through solar panel in day time. The efficiency of a solar panel is related to the amount of solar energy it acquired, so <b>it</b> is necessary <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> to track <b>the</b> sun’s position accurately. A new approach to implement a control unit so that the position of <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> is always kept perpendicular to the sun so as to capture maximum amount of energy. In this control unit a new tracking system is proposed, which comprises of a sensor (position), a microcontroller, and a stepper motor. The position sensor (pyranometer) always detects the position of the sensor. This sensor also detects the radiation from the sun. The fuzzy logic control approach is developed in the microcontroller to design a drive unit for stepper motor as well as to detect the sun position. By implementing this tracking system, <b>the</b> solar <b>panel</b> can be perpendicular to the sun at any moment in day time to obtain maximum solar radiation. The resulting structure has high efficiency, low cost and can be easily modified. This improves the performance of regular tracker nearby 30 - 40 %.

40|$|The access {{provided}} by streets and highways to adjacent lands are managed by controlling the spacings between the access points including signals, driveways, and media openings on mid-block segments, {{and setting the}} limit on the corner clearances around intersections. There have been studies on evaluating the impact of access management techniques on safety and mobility in urban areas. Samples of mid-block segments and intersections can be collected from selected arterials. Because the mid-block segments or intersections in the same arterials share the same missing information, safety and mobility on them show unique features that {{should be taken into}} account when modeling. In this study panel data models were proposed for safety analysis on mid-block segments and intersections. A virtual 2 ̆ 2 mid-block 2 ̆ 2 segment was assumed to exist <b>for</b> each arterial. <b>The</b> observations of the mid-block segments on this arterial were viewed as repeated observations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> virtual 2 ̆ 2 mid-block 2 ̆ 2 segment. This perspective of the mid-block segments or intersections over space made <b>it</b> feasible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> data model to evaluate the impact of access management techniques on safety. In addition, this study also recognized that interdependency existed between safety and mobility for a mid-block segment or an intersection. Therefore, for mid-block segments, simultaneous equation models were adopted by integrating with <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> data modeling structure. <b>For</b> intersections, <b>the</b> interdependence between safety and mobility wasn 2 ̆ 7 t considered {{due to the lack of}} data, and only count data models combining with <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> data structure was developed. Data were collected from different sources <b>for</b> <b>the</b> urban areas of Southern Nevada. The results from <b>the</b> models <b>for</b> mid-block segments indicate that there is a strong interdependency between safety and mobility. The length of mid-block segments, driveway density, and median opening density are very significant factors that influence crash rate on mid-block segments. From the results of <b>the</b> models <b>for</b> intersections, <b>it</b> was found that corner clearance significantly influenced the number of crashes occurred at intersections. Other factors also influence the occurrence of crashes at intersections that include land use, traffic flow, number of lanes, and posted speed limit...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the causal relationship between electricity consumption, exports and {{gross domestic product}} (GDP) for a panel of Middle Eastern countries.

A 1 per cent increase in electricity consumption increases GDP by 0. 04 per cent, a 1 per cent increase in exports increases GDP by 0. 17 per cent and a 1 per cent increase in GDP generates a 0. 95 per cent increase in electricity consumption. The policy implications are that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> as a whole these countries should invest in electricity infrastructure and step up electricity conservation policies to avoid a reduction in electricity consumption adversely affecting economic growth. Further policy implications are that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> as a whole promoting exports, particularly non-oil exports, is a means to promote economic growth and that expansion of exports can be realized without having adverse effects on energy conservation policies. <br /...|$|R
