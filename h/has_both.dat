5|$|Banksia violacea {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of Banksia species that <b>has</b> <b>both</b> lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous populations.

Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north-eastern populations, in the vicinity of Woodanilling. An investigation into the biogeography of these plants failed to find any vegetative, climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a lignotuber.|$|E
