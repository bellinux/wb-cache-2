5|$|The {{use of a}} {{subwoofer}} augments {{the bass}} capability of the main speakers, and allows them to be smaller without sacrificing low frequency capability. A subwoofer does not necessarily provide superior bass performance in comparison to large conventional loudspeakers on ordinary music recordings due to the typical lack of very low <b>frequency</b> <b>content</b> on such sources. However, there are recordings with substantial low <b>frequency</b> <b>content</b> that most conventional loudspeakers are ill-equipped to handle {{without the help of}} a subwoofer, especially at high playback levels, such as music for pipe organs with 32' (9.75 meter) bass pipes (16Hz), very large bass drums on symphony orchestra recordings and electronic music with extremely low synth bass parts, such as bass tests or bass songs.|$|E
5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus to track the groove. Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low <b>frequency</b> <b>content</b> to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.|$|E

40|$|We {{reviewed}} the studies which examined, by using various methods, how different spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>contents</b> contribute to face recognition. Pioneering studies suggested that low spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>contents</b> provide critical information for recognizing faces (Harmon, 1973; Ginsberg, 1980).

50|$|The {{most common}} method used in signal {{analysis}} is the FFT, or Fourier transform. The Fourier transform and its inverse counterpart offer two perspectives {{to study a}} signal: via the time domain or via the frequency domain. The FFT-based spectrum of a time signal shows us the existence of its <b>frequency</b> <b>contents.</b> By studying these and their magnitude or phase relations, we can obtain various types of information, such as harmonics, sidebands, beat frequency, bearing fault frequency and so on. However, the FFT is only suitable for signals whose <b>frequency</b> <b>contents</b> do not change over time; however, as mentioned above, the <b>frequency</b> <b>contents</b> of the sound and vibration signals obtained from a rotating machine are very much time-dependent. For this reason, FFT-based spectra are unable to detect how the <b>frequency</b> <b>contents</b> develop over time. To be more specific, if the RPM of a machine is increasing or decreasing during its startup or shutdown period, its bandwidth in the FFT spectrum will become much wider {{than it would be}} simply for the steady state. Hence, in such a case, the harmonics are not so distinguishable in the spectrum.|$|R

25|$|If we {{just look}} at the {{short-term}} spectrum of modulation, changing as it would for a human voice for instance, then we can plot the <b>frequency</b> <b>content</b> (horizontal axis) as a function of time (vertical axis) as in Fig. 3. It can again be seen that as the modulation <b>frequency</b> <b>content</b> varies, at any point in time there is an upper sideband generated according to those frequencies shifted above the carrier frequency, and the same content mirror-imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency. At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total sideband power.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the <b>frequency</b> <b>contents</b> of capnogram were investigated. Capnogram is the {{graphical}} output of capnography {{that represents the}} different changes in expiratory volume. Capnography is generally used for the monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO 2) level during respiration. This method is not only simple, non- invasive and relatively inexpensive, but also mandated or recommended for patient monitoring during clinical procedures by medical societies representing anaesthesiology, cardiology, critical care, paediatrics, respiratory care and emergency medicine. Hence, the signal processing and analysis of capnogram will help in understanding its nature for the diagnosis and prognosis {{of a variety of}} respiratory disorders. It should be noted that till now there is no attempt to investigate the <b>frequency</b> <b>contents</b> of capnogram. Therefore, we investigated the frequency properties of capnogram to lead towards better and more accurate diagnostic algorithms related to respiratory malady. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and autoregressive (AR) modelling-Burg method were used to calculate the power spectral density (PSD) in both normal and asthmatic capnograms, and the preliminary results showed that the frequency properties of the capnograms were significant to distinguish between asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. These results revealed the potential of using the <b>frequency</b> <b>contents</b> of capnogram as a diagnostic tool or indicator, thus significantly helping medical practitioners involved in respiratory care...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{exploring}} effects of <b>frequency</b> <b>contents</b> of aftershock ground motions on seismic responses of reinforced concrete (RC) bridge columns. It {{has been well}} recognized that RC columns damaged by a sizeable main shock event become more vulnerable to following aftershocks. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} use proper main shock-aftershock sequential ground motions in seismic analyses to ensure the safety and integrity of infrastructure. Using frequency &# 8211;invariant scaling factors, conventional methods were developed in the past. These methods combine sequential ground motions when performing a time history nonlinear analysis. However, these conventional methods neglect <b>frequency</b> <b>contents</b> of aftershock ground motions, which are usually different from those of main shock ground motions. This research demonstrates the importance of properly representing aftershock ground motions in estimating seismic responses of RC columns, and presents the differences in <b>frequency</b> <b>contents</b> between aftershock ground motions and the corresponding main shock ground motions. Time history seismic analyses using a finite element analysis program OpenSees are carried out. First, main shock motions recorded during the 1994 Northridge, California, the United States of America, the 1997 Umbria-Mache, Italy and the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquakes are used in this study. Then, the corresponding aftershock motions are selected or obtained: (1) from recordings during the seismic events, (2) by scaling main shock (which represents a traditional method), or (3) by spectrally matching main shock motions to the aftershock motions. The peak displacements and residual displacements of the RC columns using the spectrally matched motions are closer to those results using real aftershock motion records, as opposed to using the scaled motions. This demonstrates that the <b>frequency</b> <b>contents</b> of aftershock ground motions have significant impacts on the seismic responses of RC columns. clos...|$|R

25|$|In signal {{processing}} terms, a function (of time) is {{a representation of}} a signal with perfect time resolution, but no frequency information, while the Fourier transform has perfect frequency resolution, but no time information: {{the magnitude of the}} Fourier transform at a point is how much <b>frequency</b> <b>content</b> there is, but location is only given by phase (argument of the Fourier transform at a point), and standing waves are not localized in time – a sine wave continues out to infinity, without decaying.

25|$|In weightlessness, astronauts {{must rely}} {{much more on}} vision to {{maintain}} their spatial orientation, because the otolith organs can no longer signal the “down” direction. During prolonged exposure, however, reliance seems to shift toward an intrinsic, body vertical reference. The erroneous illusions of self-motion during head movements performed during and after return to Earth gravity are presumably due to a re-interpretation of vestibular inputs. Ground-based {{studies suggest that the}} CNS resolves the “tilt-translation” ambiguity based on the <b>frequency</b> <b>content</b> of the linear acceleration detected by the otolith organs, with low frequency indicating “tilt” and high frequency indicating “translation”. A crossover exists at about 0.3Hz where the otolith signals are then ambiguous. Exposure to weightlessness presumably results in a shift of this crossover frequency, which could then contribute to spatial disorientation and SMS.|$|E

2500|$|Pitch is {{perceived}} as how [...] "low" [...] or [...] "high" [...] a sound is and represents the cyclic, repetitive nature of the vibrations that make up sound.

Sometimes individuals identify different pitches for the same sound, based on their personal experience of particular sound patterns. Selection of a particular pitch is determined by pre-conscious examination of vibrations, including their frequencies and the balance between them. Specific attention is given to recognising potential harmonics. [...] Every sound is placed on a pitch continuum from low to high.
