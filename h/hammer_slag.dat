50|$|Malleable iron {{was used}} {{as early as the}} 4th century BCE, and {{malleable}} iron artifacts have been discovered by archaeologists between 4th century BCE and 9th century CE in China. By the Tang Dynasty, the use of malleable iron in China waned, although there are malleable iron artifacts dating to the 9th century. Malleable iron is mentioned in England in a patent dating to the 1670s. Réaumur conducted extensive research on malleable iron in 1720. He discovered that iron castings which were too hard to be worked could be softened by packing them into iron ore or <b>hammer</b> <b>slag</b> and exposing them to high temperature for a number of days. Creating malleable iron began in the United States in 1826 when Seth Boyden started a foundry for the production of harness hardware and other small castings.|$|E
40|$|To {{explore the}} role of the Caherconnell Cashel in the Burren, this thesis focuses {{particularly}} upon the possibility of ferrous and non-ferrous metal production at the site. Using data from excavations dating back to 2007, this thesis looks at the main cashel, or ringfort, at the site. Caherconnell, a site much larger in size than the standard ringfort, is situated at the junction of three major zones of concentration in the Burren – the main route into the Burren, the religious route way used between AD 800 and 1160 (the Early Medieval Period), and the area of fertile farmland in the Burren. The production of metal at Caherconnell is clearly evidenced by the amount of high status artifacts found at the site and, of course, the clear evidence of metal production found within the site walls. Bronze and iron <b>slag,</b> <b>hammer</b> stones, a burnishing stone, and a stone mould used for pouring bronze have all been recovering during excavations of the main cashel. There has not been extensive publication on {{the role of}} Caherconnell in the region, nor has there been extensive excavation of other ringforts in the area. Caherconnell, however, is certainly an important site in the region. Not only is it far larger than the average ringfort, it was occupied by a subsidiary branch {{of one of the most}} powerful families in the region, the O’Lochlainns. The site also had a surplus of wealth due to its production of ferrous and non-ferrous metal, and it is this part of Caherconnell’s history I have focused on...|$|R
