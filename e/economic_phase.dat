40|$|The paper {{examines}} the basic intermarket {{model of the}} four traditional capital asset classes. The model is created by using four most widely followed global market indices S&P 500, R/J CRB, 30 -Year US Treasury Bond Price and Dollar Index. Relative performances of those leading global benchmarks are calculated from monthly adjusted close prices and used in product momentum correlations to reflect the statistical significance of the observed empirical results. Dividend yields are not considered in calculations. The selected fifteen year time period allow the user to investigate performances of the four different capital markets during the different <b>economic</b> <b>phases</b> including <b>economic</b> prosperity, economic slowdown or <b>economic</b> turndown <b>phase</b> and indicate how they interrelate. The research identified statistically significant positive correlation between indexes S&P 500 and US Dollar Index in the Faze 2, statistically significant negative correlation between indexes 30 -Year US Treasury Bond Price and R/JCRB during the Faze 4 and finally statistically significant negative correlation between indexes R/J CRB and US Dollar Index during the Faze 4 at the 95, 0 % confidence level. In other cases and fazes statistically significant non-zero correlations were detected.

30|$|Our {{observation}} period from 1996 to 2010 contains two business cycles and thus several economic up- and downturns. 39 The first cycle comprises the years 1996 to 2003 {{and the second}} one starts in 2004. With these two cycles {{it is possible to}} investigate whether firms’ adjustment behavior has changed over time. For such an analysis I need to compare entire business cycles instead of single years. If two single years are compared, these two years could originate from different <b>economic</b> <b>phases</b> of the business cycle. This may lead to a comparison of employment adjustment in economic upturn (predominantly hirings) with that in economic downturns (predominantly firings).

Hence the confederation of communes [...] "the Commune of communes" [...] is reworked economically as well as politically into a shared universe of publicly managed resources. The management of the economy, precisely because it is a public activity, does not degenerate into privatized interactions between enterprises; rather it develops into confederalized interactions between municipalities. That is to say, the very elements of societal interaction are expanded from real or potential privatized components to institutionally real public components. Confederation becomes a public project by definition, not only because of shared needs and resources. If there is any way to avoid the emergence of the city-state, not to speak of self-serving bourgeois [...] "cooperatives," [...] it is through a municipalization of political life that is so complete that politics embraces not only what we call the public sphere but material means of life as well.|$|E

[...] He urged [...] "workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism." [...] This would result in [...] "Capitalistic and proprietary exploitation, stopped everywhere, the wage system abolished, equal and just exchange guaranteed."

[...] When the First Spanish Republic was established in 1873 after the abdication of King Amadeo, the first president, Estanislao Figueras, named Francesc Pi i Margall Minister of the Interior. His acquaintance with Proudhon enabled Pi to warm relations between the Republicans and the socialists in Spain. Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to George Woodcock [...] "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's." [...] According to the Encyclopædia Britannica [...] "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized, or “cantonalist,” political system on Proudhonian lines." ...|$|E
