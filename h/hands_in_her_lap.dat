60|$|The lady {{folded her}} <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> {{and looked at}} me steadily.|$|E
60|$|Her head sank. She clasped and unclasped the <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> She shivered slightly.|$|E
60|$|Rose sat rigidly {{still in}} her chair, her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> holding the letter.|$|E
60|$|That ring manifestly {{occupied}} {{her thoughts}} a great deal. She kept pausing <b>in</b> <b>her</b> work and regarding it, and when Capes came round to her, she first put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> and then rather awkwardly {{in front of}} him. But men are often blind to rings. He seemed to be.|$|R
60|$|The glad light <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes seemed}} to promise a greater meed than all the gold in the Mono claim. He was aware of a {{movement}} of <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> next to his. Under the screen of the tablecloth he thrust his own hand across and met a firm grip of woman's fingers that sent another wave of warmth through him.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked out}} of the window to avoid those eyes. Was this New York, or Jerusalem? Were these the streets through which she had driven and trod <b>in</b> <b>her</b> former life? Her whole soul cried out denial. No episode, no accusing reminiscences stood out--not one: the very corners were changed. Would it all change back again if he were to lessen the insistent {{pressure}} on the <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{sat down}} in a rocking chair, and {{clasping}} her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> rocked slowly back and forth.|$|E
60|$|She got {{a little}} back of the others, and sat looking wistfully out over the bay, with her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} Squire attentively, while Ida folded her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> and sat still {{with her eyes}} fixed upon the fire.|$|E
60|$|He looked {{round and}} saw that she had <b>in</b> the <b>hand</b> dropped <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> the bills {{he had given her}} after supper.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat still}} {{considering}} {{him from the}} piano stool, her knees apart, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> folded <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> Mockery came into her eyes.|$|R
60|$|When he had gone, Edna Markham {{sat down}} on the rock again. With <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> clasped <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> she gazed at the sand at her feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don’t {{like to tell}} you," [...] said Chrissie, folding her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> [...] "I know you’ll be cross. You’re so unreasonable." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Lapham {{sat down}} with her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> {{and stared at the}} smile on her husband's face, where he sat facing her.|$|E
60|$|She {{sank back}} to her chair, folded her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> and fell into meditation. The faintest of flushes crept into her wax-like cheeks.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not evident}} that Hetty quite {{understood}} him, for she sat {{looking at the}} fire with <b>hands</b> crossed <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> and Sewell turned to Tomlinson.|$|R
6000|$|... "Burned!" [...] cried Mamie, {{starting}} a little from {{the attitude of}} quiescent capacity {{in which she had}} hitherto sat to hear me, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> folded <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Kenton sat dreamily {{watching}} him, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> fallen <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> She suddenly started up, {{with the}} cry, [...] "Good gracious! What {{are we all}} thinking of?" ...|$|R
60|$|She began {{mechanically}} {{to rearrange}} her hat and veil; and after that, sitting upright, {{to watch the}} cross streets with feverish anticipation, her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Five years," [...] {{said the}} old woman, shaking her head and folding her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> [...] "How long do you say you’ve been looking for Captain Jackson?" ...|$|E
60|$|There was Mr. May as a pug dog begging, too lifelike and too impossible. The {{audience}} shouted. Alvina {{sat with}} her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> The Pug was a great success.|$|E
60|$|Rosamund {{sank down}} upon the divan, and sat there with bowed head, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> folded <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> Sakr-el-Bahr stood by {{in silence for a}} long moment contemplating her.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{sat with}} <b>hands</b> folded <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes on the}} dim violet {{after-glow}} in the west, and her mind wrestling with this problem that Diana had brought her.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Boffin, {{a smiling}} creature, broad of figure and simple of nature, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> folded <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> and with buxom creases <b>in</b> <b>her</b> throat, {{proceeded}} to expound her views.|$|R
60|$|She {{searched in}} the pocket of her gown, drew out a pair of black lace mittens, put them on with the stoniest and steadiest composure, and then quietly crossed her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the many}} virtues of this admirable woman was invincible courage. She did not faint; {{she did not}} cry out; she sat quietly down again, folded her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> and said calmly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{old lady}} resumed her seat, and, folding her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> gazed in a troubled fashion across the river, until {{the figure of}} another woman coming along the walk {{brought her back to}} every-day affairs.|$|E
60|$|Janet Gordon locked <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> {{together}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> like a {{woman who}} nerves herself to some hateful task. She looked very old; the lines on her face seemed doubly deep and harsh.|$|R
60|$|He {{had left}} his wife sitting on the sofa <b>in</b> the drawing-room, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> crossed <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> manifestly {{waiting for him to}} go out. This was not unusual. It happened, in fact, every day.|$|R
60|$|Poor Mrs Mitford, who {{had been}} sitting with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> clasped <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> and an utterly woebegone {{expression}} on her pale face, raised her head with a troubled look on being thus directly appealed to.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Leighton {{gathered}} up her sewing {{and held it}} with both <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> while she came round, and looked critically at the sketch and the model over her glasses. [...] "It's very good, Alma," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|Here Mrs. Lecks {{leaned back}} in her chair, folded her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> and ejaculated, [...] "Well, well!" [...] and then allowed her face to assume a rigid {{intention}} of having nothing more to say at the present moment.|$|E
6000|$|Without looking around, {{with her}} <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> an absent {{look in her}} eyes, the girl began in a husky contralto voice: [...] "Bounded on the north--" [...] {{and went through the}} whole {{rigmarole}} in the same way, careless, but certain.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tucker {{looked from}} one to the other in silent misery; then, {{shielding}} his eyes with his hand, he averted his head. Mrs. Bowman, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> folded <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> regarded him with anxious solicitude.|$|R
5000|$|Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva (...) takes a {{feminine}} form {{as she sits}} serenely {{on the back of}} a lion. <b>Her</b> right <b>hand</b> rests <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> cradling an orb, while her left <b>hand</b> is raised <b>in</b> a gesture of instruction.|$|R
6000|$|She slowly {{turned her}} vague eyes upon Newman, {{squeezing}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> together <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> [...] "You {{are not quite}} faithful, sir. I thought it was {{to tell me about}} Mr. Valentin you asked me to come here." ...|$|R
