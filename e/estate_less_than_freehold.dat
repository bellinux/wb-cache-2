50|$|After discussing, {{in their}} logical order, other {{freehold}} interests in land, he passes to interests in land that were called by later writers interests <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>freehold</b> - namely, tenancies for terms {{of years and}} tenancies at will. With the exception of tenancy from year to year, now so familiar to us, but which was a judicial creation of a date later than the time of Littleton, the first book is a complete statement {{of the principles of}} the common law, as they, for the most part, existed until 1925, governing and regulating interests in lands. The first book concludes with a very interesting chapter on copyhold tenures, which marks the exact point at which the tenant—by-copy-of-court-roll, the successor of the villein, who, in his turn, represented the freeman reduced to villeinage by the growth of the manorial system, acquired security of tenure.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the Snow Bowl, citing {{concerns}} about his health and family, Fesler resigned to go into real <b>estate.</b> <b>Less</b> <b>than</b> two months later, however, he was named head coach at Minnesota. Detractors of Ohio State in general and Woody Hayes in particular have cited Fesler {{as a victim of}} unremitting abuse by [...] "big football" [...] at Ohio State but throughout the 1950season speculation that Minnesota's Bernie Bierman would retire had repeatedly suggested that Fesler was a prime candidate for his replacement.|$|R

50|$|George John died in 1916 {{and his son}} Charles L G Moore {{inherited}} the Hall and <b>estate</b> (now <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 2400 acres).

25|$|The {{grandeur}} of the mansion and its handsomely landscaped grounds served to match the impressive scale of the estate, which at 1,700 acres was unusually large by Valley standards. The wide, spacious lawn, dotted with large tress, slopes gently towards a spring-fed brook that arises {{on the grounds of}} the <b>estate</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a mile away and meanders gently towards Smith Creek, which also runs through the estate. Smith Creek was used to power the plantation's mill, which produced flour and other products that were transported up and down the Great Wagon Road. The estate remained in the Moore family until 1879, when Oscar Fitz Allen Moore, grandson of Reuben Moore, Jr., sold the estate to William C. & George H. Harrison.|$|R

5000|$|In 1873, Prince Edward Island {{agreed to}} join Confederation, {{and one of the}} terms of union was that the federal {{government}} of Canada agreed to contribute $800,000 towards the purchase of absentee landholdings on the Island. To that end, the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island passed the Land Purchase Act, 1875, which provided a procedure for the compulsory acquisition of all such estates that were larger than 500 acre, other <b>than</b> untenanted <b>estates</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 1000 acre. Awards in disputes relating to land values were made by the Commissioners of Public Lands, whose decisions could be appealed to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island under s. 45 of the Act within 30 days of the award. The same section provided that the Court could remit the award back to the Commissioners; otherwise, such awards were declared to be [...] "binding, final and conclusive on all parties." ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the year}} to 30 September 2013, there were 579 {{business}} failures with tenants, being 257 agreement failures and 322 agreement surrenders.

50|$|ASPA is {{conceived}} of as an advance from the State rather than a grant, and payments can be reclaimed by the State after the person's death if their estate {{is worth more than}} €39,000. Reclaimed payments will not reduce the value of the <b>estate</b> to <b>less</b> <b>than</b> this amount. To prevent the recipient artificially reducing the value of their estate by making gifts or taking out life insurance, for example, these payments are included in the calculation of net assets.|$|R
5000|$|Following Elvis' death, {{his manager}} [...] "Colonel Tom" [...] Parker {{had set up}} a {{licensing}} operation with Factors Etc. Inc, to control Presley merchandise and keep a steady income supporting his estate. Due to an ill-advised agreement between Parker and Elvis which gave RCA sole ownership of all his recording royalties prior to 1973, the estate was relying heavily on the income from Factors Etc. Inc. However, because Parker was still entitled to 50% of all Elvis' income, and after taxes were taken off, the overall amount going towards the upkeep of the <b>estate</b> was <b>less</b> <b>than</b> $1 million a year.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike Alleyn or {{his fellow}} King's Man Shakespeare, Burbage never {{retired from the}} stage; he {{continued}} acting until his death, aged 52, in 1619. He was not as astute a businessman as either Alleyn or Shakespeare; at his death he {{was said to have}} left his widow [...] "better than £300" [...] in land - a respectable <b>estate</b> but far <b>less</b> <b>than</b> Alleyn's substantial wealth, and <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the net worth of Shakespeare at his death in 1616.|$|R

500|$|In 1840 and 1842, {{mother and}} son {{travelled}} together on the continent, journeys that Mary Shelley recorded in Rambles in Germany and Italy in 1840, 1842 and 1843 (1844). In 1844, Sir Timothy Shelley finally {{died at the age}} of ninety, [...] "falling from the stalk like an overblown flower", as Mary put it. For the first time, she and her son were financially independent, though the <b>estate</b> proved <b>less</b> valuable <b>than</b> they had hoped.|$|R
50|$|He succeeded to the peerage on his father's {{death in}} 1886. Thenceforth he devoted {{the greater part}} of his time and {{energies}} to the management of the large property which came to the family through his mother. The Penrhyn <b>estate</b> contained no <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 26,278 acres, with a rent-roll of £67,000, and the family owned the Bethesda slate quarries which, when fully employed and in former times of good trade, were estimated to produce £150,000 a year.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{estate is}} worth R400,000. There are three {{children}}; therefore, one should divide the entire estate by four (three children plus one) to calculate a child’s share. A child’s share is thus R100,000. Because the spouse inherits the greater of R125,000 and a child’s share, the spouse {{in this example}} will inherit R125,000. The remaining R275,000 is then divided equally between the children. Thus each child will receive R91,666.67. If the <b>estate</b> is worth <b>less</b> <b>than</b> R125,000, the spouse will inherit everything.|$|R

50|$|Bingham {{resided in}} the Riverside Drive mansion for a decade after her husband's demise. Passers-by noticed statues and black {{curtains}} inside. Its interior also housed gilt-framed mirrors with intricate decorative patterns, clocks, coats of armor, helmets, lances, swords, candelabra, and crucifixes. Many of the items were collected by Lloyd Bingham and some were sold when {{it was discovered that}} Bingham's <b>estate</b> amounted to <b>less</b> <b>than</b> $5,000. In 1925 two thieves stole $1,500 in jewelry from the home. Bingham's quick thinking prevented them from noticing a bag which contained $20,000 in jewels.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, the Madhvanis who {{had known}} no home other than Uganda, left the country penniless, along with {{thousands}} of other Ugandan-Asians. However, the family returned in 1982 to repossess their properties under the Expropriated Properties Bill extended by the Obote government to lure Asians back into the country.

25|$|McDaniel's last {{will and}} {{testament}} of December 1951 bequeathed her Oscar to Howard University, {{where she had}} been honored by the students with a luncheon after she had won her Oscar. At the time of her death, McDaniel would have had few options. Very few white institutions in that day preserved black history. Historically, black colleges had been where such artifacts were placed. Despite evidence McDaniel had earned an excellent income as an actress, her final <b>estate</b> was <b>less</b> <b>than</b> $10,000. The IRS claimed the estate owed more than $11,000 in taxes. In the end, the probate court ordered all of her property, including her Oscar, sold to pay off creditors. Years later, the Oscar turned up where McDaniel wanted it to be: Howard University, where, according to reports, it was displayed in a glass case in the university's drama department.|$|R
