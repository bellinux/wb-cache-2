25|$|In 1998, {{the parent}} company was renamed Diamond Aircraft GmbH to better align with the naming {{convention}} of the North American operation. The company also purchased the Wiener Neustadt East Airport in that same year. The firm continued to work on multiple new aircraft types {{in order to further}} grow its product line; these were developed in line with a company-wide philosophy of seeking to offer aircraft that lacked any equivalent in terms of performance to any existing major product being produced from any of its competing manufacturers; this was an measure to consciously avoid instances of direct <b>head-to-head</b> <b>competition.</b>|$|E
25|$|The DV20, while owing much of {{its design}} and sharing many {{features}} of the Dimona, had several major differences as well. In particular, it had a reduced wingspan, was equipped with flaps, and made use of a tricycle landing gear arrangement. The Katana has also been developed with a philosophy of offering aircraft that weren't equivalent in terms of performance to any major existing product from competing manufacturers, consciously avoiding instances of direct <b>head-to-head</b> <b>competition.</b> In 1991, the Katana conducted its maiden flight; during May 1993, the type received certification.

Both institutions are public universities supported by the state of South Carolina, and their campuses are separated by only 132 miles.

Kloss and McMillan played both mixed doubles set for the Golden Gaters and split them winning 12 games and losing 12. The Golden Gaters drew 4,012 fans for their opener at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Arena.

5000|$|In each episode, {{the eight}} contestants face off in <b>head-to-head</b> <b>competitions</b> in a single-elimination bracket format. The first round bracket match-ups are chosen at random. The {{challenges}} {{vary in their}} format, but are generally very physically demanding and often involve physical contact between the two contestants. In addition, all competitions take place outdoors in hot, desert-like conditions, so the contestants are also battling {{the elements of the}} weather.

500|$|In [...] "Double-up" [...] or [...] "50/50" [...] cash game competitions, players win a prize {{equal to}} double their entry fee if they {{finish with a}} score within the top 50% of all participants. <b>Head-to-head</b> <b>competitions</b> are similar, except that the player must win against another user of their choice. Guaranteed prize pool {{contests}} have higher stakes, using tiered payouts based on finishing in different percentiles or positions {{of the field of}} contestants. Further variations of double-up games, including Triple-up, Quadruple-up, and Quintuple-up, may also be offered.

500|$|The <b>head-to-head</b> <b>competition</b> for the Memorial Cup {{has changed}} formats several times. [...] The CAHA {{moved to a}} best-of-three format in 1925 as {{the first team to}} win two games was {{declared}} the champion. [...] In 1938, the series was increased to best-of-five, and to best-of-seven in 1943. [...] There were two exceptions to these formats. The 1949 final between the Montreal Royals and the Brandon Wheat Kings required an eighth game after the third game ended in a tie. The 1971 final between the Quebec Remparts and the Edmonton Oil Kings was nearly canceled outright in the wake of controversy surrounding the inclusion of the previously outlawed Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) as the western league was allowed to use more over-age players and received a larger travel allowance from the CAHA. [...] The differences were resolved, and an abbreviated best-of-three series was held in Quebec City.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{his sophomore}} season, he was {{considered}} more raw, but more athletic than Okafor, according to the Chicago Sun-Times basketball reporter Joe Henricksen. At that stage in <b>head-to-head</b> <b>competition,</b> Alexander was overmatched by Okafor. Following his sophomore season, Reggie Rose (Derrick Rose's brother) noted that Alexander was more suited toward a fast break offense while Okafor {{would be more likely}} to excel in a half-court set. He is also compared to Anthony Bennett, although Alexander needs to improve his outside shooting to make the comparison valid and he needs to improve his low post mastery for a valid comparison to Jared Sullinger. Alexander feels he is most often compared to Amar'e Stoudemire, which he is comfortable with because he views Stoudemire as someone who [...] "...can shoot the 15-footer, put it on the floor, post moves, sets good screens." [...] NBADraft.net compares Alexander to Thomas Robinson, while Bleacher Report's Kerry Miller compared him to Robinson and Julius Randle, noting despite his phenomenal physicality, he is undersized to play center and lacking the midrange jump shot necessary to play power forward.|$|E

2500|$|In 1900, {{when the}} LAW no longer governed {{professional}} bicycle {{races in the}} U.S., Taylor's future as a professional racer was in jeopardy. Fortunately, the ARCU and the NCA, who had banned Taylor from competing in their leagues, readmitted him after payment of a $500 fine. Taylor won the American sprint championship on points in 1900. He also beat Tom Cooper, the 1899 NCA champion, in a head-to-head match in a one-mile race at Madison Square Garden in front of 50,000 to 60,000 spectators. In addition, Taylor set world records in the half-mile and two-thirds-mile sprints, and raced indoors using a [...] "home trainer" [...] in <b>head-to-head</b> <b>competitions</b> with other riders as a vaudeville act.

40|$|We {{measured}} the relative fitness among {{a set of}} experimentally evolved Escherichia coli strains differing by {{a small number of}} adaptive mutations by directly measuring allelic frequencies in <b>head-to-head</b> <b>competitions</b> using a mass spectrometry-based method. We compared the relative effects of mutations to the same or similar genes acquired in multiple strains when expressed in allele replacement strains. We found that the strongest determinant of fitness among the evolved strains was the impact of beneficial mutations to the RNA polymerase β and β′ subunit genes. We also identified several examples of epistatic interactions between rpoB/C and glpK mutations and identified two other mutations that are beneficial only in the presence of previously acquired mutations but that have little or no adaptive benefit to the wild-type strain. Allele frequency estimation is shown to be a highly sensitive method for measuring selection rates during competitions between strains differing by as little as a single-nucleotide polymorphism and may be of great use for investigating epistatic interactions...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the merge, tribes {{compete against}} each other in challenges. These most often are multi-segment {{obstacle}} courses that include both physical and mental elements with the tribe that finishes first declared the winner; commonly, these start with tribe members collecting puzzles pieces that are then used to solve a puzzle by other tribe members. Other challenges may be based on winning a number of rounds of <b>head-to-head</b> <b>competitions.</b> Challenges are normally held with equal numbers of all tribes participating and in some cases equal splits of gender. Tribes with more players will be asked to sit out as many players as needed to balance the numbers, with the stipulation that those players cannot sit out in back-to-back reward and immunity challenges. When one tribe has more than twice the other tribe members, then players in the larger tribe cannot participate in back-to-back challenges. Tribes are given time to strategically decide who should sit out and who will perform the various duties on a challenge.|$|R
