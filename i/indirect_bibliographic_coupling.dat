50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> was {{introduced}} by M. M. Kessler of MIT in a paper published in 1963, and has been embraced {{in the work of}} the information scientist Eugene Garfield. It is one of the earliest citation analysis methods for document similarity computation and some have questioned its usefulness, pointing out that two works may reference completely unrelated subject matter in the third. Furthermore, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> is a retrospective similarity measure, meaning the information used to establish the similarity relationship between documents lies in the past and is static, i.e. <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> strength cannot change over time, since outgoing citation counts are fixed.|$|R

30|$|Second, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> {{counts the}} number of {{references}} that two (or more) documents share in their bibliographies (Kessler 1963). As opposed to co-citation analysis, which is conducted {{at the level of}} cited references, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> is an attribute of citing documents: two documents are coupled when they have at least one reference in common. Since <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> is independent of {{the number of}} received citations, the method has a focus on the present and covers more recent works than co-citation analysis. The procedure is ‘static’, because the reference lists do not change once the documents are published. Hence, the degree to which documents are coupled is definite at the time of publication.|$|R

50|$|Co-citation {{analysis}} {{provides a}} forward-looking assessment on document similarity {{in contrast to}} <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Coupling,</b> which is retrospective. The citations a paper receives in the future depend {{on the evolution of}} an academic field, thus co-citation frequencies can still change. In the adjacent diagram, for example, Doc A and Doc B may still be co-cited by future documents, say Doc F and Doc G. This characteristic of co-citation allows for a dynamic document classification system when compared to <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Coupling.</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{is general}} {{consensus}} that the field of nanotechnology will be very important in the future. An open question is, however, which technological approaches or paradigms will be important in the field. The paper assumes that the carbon nanotube will be {{a key element of}} an emerging technological paradigm in nanotechnology. This study employs a bibliometric method — <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> — to identify important nanotubes-related ‘leitbilder’ — a concept meaning ‘guiding images’ that provide a basis for different professions and disciplines to work in the same direction. Until recently, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> has been applied rarely for purposes of research evaluation, not to mention technology foresight. Our case study seems to suggest that <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> is particularly suitable for anticipating technological breakthroughs. <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> analysis of recent nanotube-related patents focused our attention to recent patents owned by Nantero Inc. Nantero’s main focus is the development of NRAM — a high-density nonvolatile random access memory. The NRAM leitbild seems to be an important emerging leitbild. It connects technical opportunities and promising applications relating to the memories in devices such as cell phones, MP 3 players, digital cameras, as well as applications in networking arena...|$|R

5000|$|Two {{documents}} are bibliographically coupled if they both cite {{one or more}} documents in common. The [...] "coupling strength" [...] of two given documents is higher the more citations to other documents they share. The figure to the right illustrates the concept of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling.</b> In the figure, documents A and B both cite documents C, D and E. Thus, documents A and B have a <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> strength of 3 - the number of elements in the intersection of their two reference lists.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> can {{be useful}} {{in a wide variety of}} fields, since it helps {{researchers}} find related research done in the past. On the other hand, two documents are co-cited if they are both independently cited by one or more documents.|$|R
40|$|In 1965, Derek de Solla Price foresaw the {{day when}} a citation-based {{taxonomy}} {{of science and technology}} would be delineated and correspondingly used for science policy. A taxonomy needs to be comprehensive and accurate {{if it is to be}} useful for policy making, especially now that policy makers are utilizing citation-based indicators to evaluate people, institutions and laboratories. Determining the accuracy of a taxonomy, however, remains a challenge. Previous work on the accuracy of partition solutions is sparse, and the results of those studies, while useful, have not been definitive. In this study we compare the accuracies of topic-level taxonomies based on the clustering of documents using direct citation, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling,</b> and co-citation. Using a set of new gold standards - articles with at least 100 references - we find that direct citation is better at concentrating references than either <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> or co-citation. Using the assumption that higher concentrations of references denote more accurate clusters, direct citation thus provides a more accurate representation of the taxonomy of scientific and technical knowledge than either <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> or co-citation. We also find that discipline-level taxonomies based on journal schema are highly inaccurate compared to topic-level taxonomies, and recommend against their use.

40|$|Attribute {{selection}} {{is one of}} the steps before patent clustering. Various attributes can be used for clustering. In this study, the effect of using citation and citation title words, respectively, in form of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> and citation title words sharing, were measured and compared with each other, as patent attributes. This study was done in an experimental method, on a collection of 717 US Patent cited in the patents belong to 977 / 774 subclass of US Patent Classification. Fuzzy C-means was used for patent clustering and extended BCubed precision and extended BCubed recall were used as evaluation measure. The results showed that the clustering produced by <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> had better performance than clustering used citation title words and existence of cluster structure were in a wider range of exhaustivity than citation title words...|$|R
50|$|The co-citation {{analysis}} approach {{introduced by}} Henry Small {{and published in}} 1973 addressed this shortcoming of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> by considering a document's incoming citations to assess similarity, a measure that can change over time. Additionally, the co-citation measure reflects the opinion of many authors and thus represents a better indicator of subject similarity.|$|R
5000|$|These {{approaches}} are primarily based on using bibliographical references to organize networks of papers, mainly by <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> (introduced by Kessler 1963) or co-citation analysis ( [...] independently suggested by Marshakova 1973 and Small 1973).

40|$|This {{contribution}} explores how work on Triple Helix (TH) indicators has evolved. Over {{the past}} 15 years {{a body of}} literature has emerged that brings together a variety of approaches to capture, map or measure the dynamics of TH relationships. We apply <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> and co-citation in combination with content analysis to develop {{a better understanding of}} this literature. We identify several clusters that can be aggregated to two broad streams of work—one ‘neo-evolutionary’, the other ‘neo-institutional’ in nature. We make this observation both for <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> and co-citation analyses which we take as indication of an emerging differentiation of the field. Our content analysis underlines this observation about the ‘two faces’ of the TH. We conclude this paper with a discussion of future opportunities for research. We see great potential in developing the application side of TH indicators...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of bibliometric networks, such as co-authorship, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling,</b> and co-citation networks, {{has received a}} considerable amount of attention. Much less {{attention has been paid to}} the construction of these networks. We point out that different approaches can be taken to construct a bibliometric network. Normally the full counting approach is used, but we propose an alternative fractional counting approach. The basic idea of the fractional counting approach is that each action, such as co-authoring or citing a publication, should have equal weight, regardless of for instance the number of authors, citations, or references of a publication. We present two empirical analyses in which the full and fractional counting approaches yield very different results. These analyses deal with co-authorship networks of universities and <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> networks of journals. Based on theoretical considerations and on the empirical analyses, we conclude that for many purposes the fractional counting approach is preferable over the full counting one...|$|R
40|$|Bibliometric methods (<b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> and co-citation) implicitly {{postulate}} {{impact factor}} and influence factor as criteria {{for evaluation of}} „knowledge maps“ or „intellectual structures“. However, bibliometric methods {{can also be used}} for presentations of „Historio-Bibliography“, that is genealogical tree of primordial publications. Visual presentation of history of key publications which E. Garfield (2001) named historiograph. Using corpus of bibliographic data from doctoral dissertations (1978 - 2009) we want to show the network of nodal publications from information science in the period from 1960 until today. Historiographs for presentations of Network of scientific publications could be generated with different methods (N. P. Hummon, P. Doreian, 1989) : critical path method, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> method, citation method, co-citation method. We use these methods in order to show, by historiograph, historical overview of key publications in information science in Croatia. Chronological presentation of the development of scientific publication network also enables chronological analysis of certain authors’ roles in scientific community from researchers and scholars to predecessors...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} a novel method of science mapping is {{presented}} which combines <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling,</b> {{as a measure}} of document-document similarity, with an agglomerative hierarchical cluster method. The focus in this study is on the mapping of so called ‘core documents’, a concept presented first in 1995 by Glänzel and Czerwon. The term ‘core document’ denote documents that have a central position in the research front in terms of many and strong <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> links. The identification and mapping of core documents usually requires a large multidisciplinary research setting and in this study the 2003 volume of the Science Citation Index was applied. From this database, a sub-set of core documents reporting on the outbreak of SARS in 2002 was chosen for the demonstration of the application of this mapping method. It was demonstrated that the method, in this case, successfully identified interpretable research themes and that iterative clustering on two subsequent levels of cluster agglomeration may provide with useful and current information...|$|R
40|$|While interdisciplinarity {{continues}} to increase in popularity among funders and other scientific organizations, its potential to promote scientific advances remains under-examined. For HIV/AIDS research, we examine the dynamics of disciplinary integration (or lack thereof) providing insight into a field’s knowledge base and those questions that remain unresolved. Drawing on the complete histories of two interdisciplinary journals, we construct <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> networks based on overlapping citations to identify segregation into research clusters and estimate topic models of research content. We then compare how readily those <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> clusters account for the structuring of topics covered within the field as it evolves over two decades. These comparisons challenge one-dimensional and/or cross-sectional approaches to interdisciplinarity. Some topics are increasingly coordinated across disciplinary boundaries (e. g., vaccine development); others remain relatively segmented into disconnected disciplinary domains for the full period (e. g., drug resistance). This divergence indicates heterogeneity in interdisciplinarity and emphasizes the need for critical approaches to studying the organization of science...|$|R
50|$|Co-citation, like <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Coupling,</b> is a {{semantic}} similarity measure for documents that {{makes use of}} citation relationships.

30|$|Due {{to these}} differences, co-citation {{analysis}} and <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> produce different yet complementary results. However, {{the structure of}} the aggregated data is the same: the raw data are reorganized in symmetric matrices with documents as column and row headers and number of co-occurrences as values. This structure of the data corresponds to the structure of networks: in the case of co-citation analysis, the column and row headers (i.e., network nodes) are cited documents and the values (i.e., network ties) are co-citations of each pair of documents. In contrast, the method of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> results in network data with citing documents as nodes and the number of couplings as ties. Accordingly, we used these matrices as inputs to a network analysis with UCINET Version 6.581. For the detection of subgroups within the networks, we applied the Girvan–Newman clustering procedure (Girvan and Newman 2002) as well as categorical core/periphery partition (Borgatti and Everett 1999). The network graphs were created with a spring embedding algorithm as provided by the NetDraw software version 2.153.|$|R
40|$|Clustering {{of hybrid}} {{document}} networks combining citation based links with lexical similarities suffered {{for a long}} time from the different properties of these underlying networks. In this paper we evaluate different processing options of noun phrases extracted from abstracts using natural language processing to improve the measurement of the lexical component. Term shingles of different length are created from each of the extracted noun phrases. We discuss twenty different extraction-shingling scenarios and compare their results. Some scenarios show no improvement compared with the previously used single term lexical approach used so far. But when all single term shingles are removed from the dataset the lexical network has properties which are comparable with those from a <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> based network. Next, hybrid networks are built based on weighted combination of the two types of similarities with seven different weights. We demonstrate that removing all single term shingles provides the best results at the level of computational feasibility, comparability with <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> and also in a community detection application. nrpages: 15 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective - This paper {{investigated}} the intellectual {{structure of the}} cited journals by science doctoral students in the University of Ibadan, Nigeria through field-mapping mechanism namely co-citation analysis. The study also explored the relationship and its strength between the science disciplines in terms of journals that were co-referenced through <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> analysis. The deployment of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> techniques with co-citation analysis was adopted to model the pattern of scientific communications among scientists and scholarly journals. Methods - The scholarly citation {{data were collected from}} science doctoral theses submitted between 2006 and 2013 across ten disciplines in the Faculty of Science, University of Ibadan. Variety of data techniques were deployed such co-citation analysis, factor analysis, and <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> to identify the characteristics of the citation network, the subgroups that constituted the intellectual structure of the cited journals by science doctoral students, most influential journals, and degree of relation between science disciplines. Results - The bibliometric citation network analysis of science doctoral students revealed that 1, 290 journals were co-cited and 40. 62 % journals were co-referenced within two or more disciplines. Factor analysis revealed seven subgroups and network diagram largely matches the first subgroup which constitutes 88 % of the journals with total variance explained of 51. 21 % while other subgroups were beclouded. Conclusion - The analysis provide insights about citation network structure, the influence of some journals and the fair rate of indices of cross disciplinary journals, which is a good harbinger of relationship among science disciplines, though degree of association with each other differs. Meanwhile, explicit identification of specialties (subgroups) from factor analysis is still subjected to further investigations perhaps using authors as a unit of analysis.

40|$|Biomedical {{literature}} {{is an essential}} source of biomedical evidence. To translate the evidence for biomedicine study, researchers often need to carefully read multiple articles about specific biomedical issues. These articles thus need to be highly related to each other. They should share similar core contents, including research goals, methods, and findings. However, given an article r, it is challenging for search engines to retrieve highly related articles for r. In this paper, we present a technique PBC (Passage-based <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Coupling)</b> that estimates inter-article similarity by seamlessly integrating <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> with the information collected from context passages around important out-link citations (references) in each article. Empirical evaluation shows that PBC can significantly improve the retrieval of those articles that biomedical experts believe to be highly related to specific articles about gene-disease associations. PBC can thus {{be used to improve}} search engines in retrieving the highly related articles for any given article r, even when r is cited by very few (or even no) articles. The contribution is essential for those researchers and text mining systems that aim at cross-validating the evidence about specific gene-disease associations...|$|R

Fifty-one theories were selected and their bibliographic information was obtained from Web of Science and then citation analysis and <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> analysis were performed.

A few of the theories were proposed by scientists from the fields of sociology, psychology, computer science and a few other disciplines. Citation analysis showed that LIS literature has been used extensively in HIB theories; however, there were also citations to the sources of 29 other fields especially to sociology, communication, psychology, management, educational science and computer science. This is an indication of the interdisciplinary nature of HIB domain. <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> map showed that about four fifths of the theories were linked to each other as a whole network.

40|$|Drakkar {{is a novel}} {{algorithm}} for {{the creation}} of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> graphs in huge document spaces. The algorithm approaches this as an All-Nearest Neighbour search problem and starts from a bipar- tite graph constituted by the citing publications and the cited references and the directed citations connect- ing them. The approach is inspired by dimensionality reduction techniques like Random Projection and Lo- cality Sensitive Hashing which use global random functions for dimension or feature selection. The proposed algorithm enables the use of local selection functions {{at the level of the}} individual nodes. For the particular case of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> the selection functions are based on the boat-shaped information distribu- tion associated with the indegree of the cited references. This distribution resembles the typical symmetri- cal shape of a Viking ship (called ‘Drakkar’ in Dutch, hence the name). An experiment with several di erent random functions reveals that focussing on the end of the distribution related to the references with low in- degree results in a graph with accurate strong links but many false negatives while the other end of the dis- tribution can detect most links but underestimates the strength of the link. The algorithm is implemented in GraphX, the library for distributed graph processing within Spark. It is using Pregel’s messaging framework. status: publishe...|$|R
