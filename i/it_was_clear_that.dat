5|$|After <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Austria-Hungary {{had lost}} World War I, the Austrian {{government}} {{decided to give}} Viribus Unitis, along {{with much of the}} Austro-Hungarian fleet, to Yugoslavia, the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.

5|$|By February 1326, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Isabella was {{involved}} in a relationship with the exiled Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer. It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both wanted to see Edward and the Despensers removed from power. The King appealed for his son to return, and for Charles to intervene on his behalf, but this had no effect.|$|E

5|$|By July 1918, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the German Spring Offensive on the Western Front, {{which had}} forced the {{postponement}} of offensive plans in Palestine, had failed, {{resulting in a}} return to trench warfare on the Western Front.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1850s <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> France {{was unable}} to match British {{building}} of steam warships, and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required.

5|$|In the 1990s, after Per Bak Jensen {{had joined}} the {{teaching}} staff at the Royal Academy in Copenhagen, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> photography had been accepted as an art form.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Edward now {{regarded}} the struggle {{not as a}} war between two nations, but as the suppression of a rebellion of disloyal subjects.

5|$|Problems arose {{quickly for}} the new Princeps.

Germanicus and Tiberius's son, Drusus Julius Caesar, were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line.|$|E

Seale writes that Abu Nidal's absence from Jordan during this period, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that Abu Nidal was interested only in saving himself.|$|E

5|$|Arise is {{the fourth}} studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, {{released}} in 1991 by Roadrunner Records. Upon its release, the album received top reviews from heavy metal magazines such as Rock Hard, Kerrang! and Metal Forces. Arise is considered Sepultura's finest hour among longtime fans. While the music on Arise was mostly in the same death/thrash style as their previous album, Beneath the Remains, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Sepultura sound was acquiring an experimental edge.|$|E
5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the race was}} close: Democrats had carried most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, {{an increasing number of}} immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of Republican votes), but Republicans realized that if they held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would emerge with an electoral college majority.|$|E

By 17:45 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair.|$|E
