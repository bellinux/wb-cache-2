As such, they {{play an important role in}} early <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> <b>collaboration</b> of appropriate care for patients with eating disorders or subthreshold conditions. Current research indicates that the majority of dental practitioners have low levels of knowledge of the physical signs of an eating disorder and are usually not engaging in eating disorder specific secondary prevention practices. The present study extended these findings and examined skills essential to secondary prevention practices; namely, the ability to identify the physical signs of an eating disorder and the ability to communicate findings to the patient or another healthcare professional. Using an online survey, students and practitioners in dentistry and dental hygiene professions from the Pacific Northwest completed demographic information and assessments of their knowledge and communication skills regarding eating disorders. Results confirmed previous findings that the majority of dental practitioners hold low levels of knowledge of the oral and physical manifestations of eating disorders. Findings also indicated that students similarly have low levels of knowledge in this area. Additionally, all participants who had received training in the communication skills to use with patients exhibiting signs of an eating disorder reported significantly higher levels of knowledge, and of those, dental hygiene students and dentists reported significantly higher communication self-efficacy. Together, the results support the need for improved education and training in the secondary prevention of eating disorders in the dental setting...|$|R

Qualitative methods of data collection were used in this research. The results suggest that DV in Native American communities may be distinct {{in a number of}} ways. The cause of Native American DV may be anchored in historic trauma, poverty, alcohol and drugs, and rural isolation. Cultural and economic features of Native American DV are discussed. The complexity of DV in the Native American community, its association with a number of co-morbid problems, suggests a multi-modal <b>intervention</b> approach <b>and</b> <b>collaboration</b> among a variety of professionals...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we seek to build on efforts to apply the {{insights}} of social learning theory to interpret patterns of continuity and change in the archaeological record. This literature suggests that stable and often highly arbitrary material culture traditions {{are likely to be}} founded on our biologically-evolved capacity for imitation. However, it has recently been argued that the latter may be insufficient to explain the long-term maintenance of complex and difficult-to-master skills, such as those required to produce stone tools, pots, textiles and other cognitively opaque cultural forms. To ensure that these skills are accurately transferred to the next generation, adults must actively guide and control the learning activities of their children, a mode of transmission that can be labelled ‘pedagogy’. The importance of pedagogy has often been overlooked in the theoretical and empirical literature on craft learning, a fact that can probably be attributed to an unnecessarily narrow conception of teaching that equates it with explicit linguistic instruction. Using ethnographic data gathered from detailed case studies, we characterise pedagogy in the context of craft apprenticeships as involving the gradual scaffolding of skill in a novice through demonstration, <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> <b>collaboration.</b> Although these processes cannot be directly observed in the archaeological record, they can sometimes be inferred through the detailed reconstruction of operational chains in past technologies. The evidence we present suggests that pedagogy has played an essential role in securing the faithful transmission of skills across generations, and should be regarded as the central mechanism through which long-term and stable material culture traditions are propagated and maintained...|$|R

This paper describes the genesis and the successful establishment of Life! and its key outcomes for participants and implementation. Research Design and Methods Life!, a behavior change intervention, comprises six group sessions over eight months. The Victorian Department of Health funded Diabetes Australia-Victoria to implement the program. Experience of the Greater Green Triangle diabetes prevention implementation trial was used for intervention design, workforce development, training and infrastructure. Clinical and anthropometric data from participants, used for program evaluation, was recorded on a central database. Results Life! has a state-wide workforce of 302 trained facilitators within 137 organizations. 29, 000 Victorians showed interest in Life! and 15, 000 individuals have been referred to the program. In total, 8, 412 participants commenced a Life! program between October 2007 and June 2011. 37 % of the original participants completed the eight month program. Participants completing sessions one to five lost an average of 1 · 4 kg weight (p< 0 · 001) and waist circumference of 2 · 5 cm (p< 0. 001). Those completing six sessions lost an average of 2 · 4 kg weight (p< 0 · 001) and waist circumference of 3 · 8 cm (p< 0 · 001). The weight loss of 2. 4 kg represents 2. 7 % of participants’ starting body weight.

The {{purpose of the study}} was to develop a model of emotional support for student nurses working in the {{mental health care}} environment. The objectives were set in two phases: Phase one – identification of concepts; Phase two – development of a model of emotional support for student nurses. A theory-generating design, based on a qualitative, explorative and descriptive research approach, was used to meet the aim of the study. Data was purposively collected from 40 nursing students using (n= 6) focus group discussions and eight educators and nine clinical staff by way of semi-structured interviews. Data was analysed by means of Tesch’s method of data analysis. The model was developed by means of the four steps of which the first two are discussed in this paper as step three and four will be discussed elsewhere. Step one is the concept development consisting of concept identification and concept definition. A total of 22 concepts were identified, which were synthesised into six main concepts, namely, positive self-concept, positive work environment, academic and professional development, effective communication, formal <b>and</b> informal supportive <b>interventions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>collaboration</b> between the higher education institution and the mental health care setting. step two is the model development during which the main concepts were placed in relation to one another, which formed an emotional support model for students working in mental health care settings. this paper gives an account of the methodological processes that were utilised to meet the aim and objectives of the study.

40|$|School-based {{occupational}} therapy practitioners actively support students’ functional participation in school-related activities. Underlying these daily school activities are executive functioning skills. Although addressing executive functioning (EF) skills is within {{occupational therapy}}’s scope of practice, school-based practitioners typically {{do not support}} the development of these skills in students. Identified factors that contribute to this gap in practice are limited (1) EF knowledge, (2) availability and access to EF resources, and (3) time to complete job demands. To address this clinical gap, an interactive online course for school-based occupational therapy practitioners was developed which presents current EF research, knowledge, and resources.

Handgrip strength was the most frequently used objective diagnostic measure (33. 9 %). Five months after attendance, reported use of diagnostic tests was increased, i. e. handgrip strength up to 67. 4 %, gait speed up to 72. 1 % and muscle mass up to 20. 9 %. Bottlenecks during implementation of the diagnostic strategy were experienced by 67. 1 %; lack of awareness among other healthcare professionals, acquisition of equipment and time constraints to perform the diagnostic measures were reported most often.

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{declines in}} {{physical and sexual}} abuse over recent decades, child maltreatment remains a public health priority. In 2014, 702, 000 children were determined to be victims of maltreatment, 75 % of whom experienced neglect (DHHS, 2016). An area in need of further scrutiny is the complex relationship of multiple risk factors and the association of those risk factors with subsequent child welfare involvement. The purpose of this three-manuscript dissertation was to examine evidence-based child maltreatment prevention through an empiric examination of risk and novel prevention efforts. The first paper, Getting the Most Juice for the Squeeze: Where SafeCare® and Other Evidence-based Programs Need to Evolve to Better Protect Children, discusses the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based prevention programs using SafeCare as an applied example. The paper concludes with recommendations for evidence-based practices to improve the outcomes of children and families. Among several recommendations, this paper suggests considering innovative implementation settings, <b>collaboration</b> between systems, <b>and</b> response to the underlying risk factors for maltreatment. The second paper, Drug Court as a Potential Point of Intervention to Impact the Well-being of Children and Families of Substance-Using Parents, responds to the recommendation of <b>collaboration</b> <b>and</b> innovation from the first paper. This descriptive study sought to describe the needs of families of adult drug court populations related to parenting and mental health services.

The third paper, An Examination of Risk Profiles among Mothers Involved with Child Protective Services, responds to the need to better understand underlying risk factors among child welfare involved families as discussed in the first paper. A latent class analysis was conducted to explore the heterogeneity among women reported to child protective services. In what is typically a homogenously treated and characterized sample, this analysis indicated three classes of risk and examined the classes’ association with subsequent referral to child protective services. The findings of this research support the recommendation of the importance of better understanding underlying risk factors to better align services with needs of children and families...|$|R

In the past few years, leaders have pursued wilderness conservation initiatives while simultaneously promoting petroleum extraction in their own backyards. Both political positions run counter to those pursued in previous decades, when opposition to both oil development and strict forms of conservation within their territory was strong. To address this reversal, I trace some of the development <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> North-South <b>collaborations</b> that have contributed to the emergence of “nature” as a meaningful imaginary for Amazonian indigenous leaders and {{for a new generation of}} young people, drawing connections to William Cronon’s critical analysis of how wilderness conservation became a priority in the United States. I conclude that more than two decades of conservationist interventions in the Upper Napo region have led to some largely unintended consequences, as Amazonian leaders increasingly subscribe to Northern environmentalists’ romanticization of “the Amazon” as a wild place, one that therefore must be distant from the places where they work and live...|$|R

The aim of the present study is to identify the therapeutic tech-niques and elements of the psychotherapy process characterizing sessions with increasing versus decreasing trend of TA. The sample consisted of 156 audiotaped and transcripted sessions (N= 156) of different therapeutic approaches. Therapeutic alliance <b>and</b> <b>collaboration</b> shifts inside sessions have been evaluated with Collaborative Interactions Scale (Colli & Lingiardi, 2009), the therapeutic interventions with the Comparative Psychotherapy Process Scale (Blagys & Hilsenroth, 2000, 2005), the psychotherapy process with the Psychotherapy Process Q-set (Jones, 1985, 2000). Three groups, each of three independent raters, evaluated the sessions. Discriminant analysis (Garson, 2008; Barbaranelli, 2006) identified the distinctive features of the sessions with (a) increasing and (b) decreasing trends of alliance. Results showed that sessions with TA increasing trend are characterized mainly by the presence of therapist's interventions focused on the here and now of the relationship and exploration of affects. The sessions with TA decreasing trend were characterized by a stance of major rigidity of the therapist, that were more focused on manualized treatment of his/her therapeutic approaches and not on the patient's concrete experience.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe {{mental health}} care {{environment}} is a stressful environment because of the environment, perceived unpreparedness of students and the emotional demands placed on the students which are inherent {{in the nature of}} the work. The use of the self as a therapeutic tool also presents challenges for students. Whilst researchers have identified supportive <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> strategies to address students support needs in {{mental health care}} settings, these interventions/strategies focus on meeting clinical learning objectives with the assumption that if the student learning needs are met, they will feel emotionally supported. Literature and experience indicates that it is imperative that in this field of study, students should be prepared to cope emotionally with the demands of mental health work. The aim of this research was to develop a model of emotional support for student nurses working in mental health care settings. A theory-generating design based on a qualitative, explorative and descriptive research approach was used to achieve the aim of the study. Purposive sampling was employed to select participants namely: students, educators and clinical staff who met the eligibility criteria. A sample of 40 students, nine educators and nine clinical staff who worked in the four psychiatric hospitals and community mental health clinics in the Western Cape participated in the study. Data collection was by means of focus group interviews (students) and indepth individual interviews (educators and clinical staff). Data was analysed by means of Tesch’s method of content analysis. The model was developed by means of the four steps of the theory generation process. Step one was concept development which consisted of two sub-steps namely concept identification and concept definition. A total of 22 concepts were identified which was further synthesised into six main concepts. The main concepts which were used to develop the model were: positive self-concept; positive work environment; academic and professional development; effective communication; formal <b>and</b> informal supportive <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> <b>collaboration</b> between the Higher Education Institution and the mental health care setting. Step two of the theory generating process was model development. These main concepts were placed in relation with each other which formed an emotional support model for students working in mental health care settings. Step three was model description. The model was described using the three phases of interpersonal communication namely orientation phase, working phase and the termination phase. A visual application of the model which depicts the main concepts, the process and the context was shown. Step four dealt with the development of the guidelines for the implementation of the emotional support model. A critical reflection of the model was done using five criteria for model evaluation according to Chinn & Kramer. Trustworthiness of the data was ensured by means of applying Guba’ model of truth value, applicability, consistency and neutrality. Reflexivity was used by the researcher to further enhance trustworthiness. Permission to conduct the study was obtained from the relevant authorities. The ethical principles of respect for human dignity, beneficence and justice were applied throughout the study. Limitations were identified and ecommendations for nursing practice, education concluded the study...|$|R

This dissertation reflects {{on the relationship between}} location fixed resources, market forces <b>and</b> state <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> how the interaction of these factors influence urban spatial outcomes. It first develops the underlying economic theory that could inform good planning practice and then illustrates how state-market relations have had an impact on urban spatial outcomes in South Africa's recent history. These insights are then used to describe the spatial development of Cape Town and identifies ineffective <b>and</b> counterproductive <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> illustrate how economic theories and concepts can be used to inform good planning practice.

40|$|AbstractThe EU Research Training Network on Augmented Reality in Surgery (ARIS*ER) was {{established}} with two aims: (1) to develop next-generation novel image guidance (augmented reality based on medical images) and cross-linked robotic systems (automatic control loops guided by information sensed from the patient) and (2) to educate young {{researchers in the}} user-centred, multidisciplinary design of emerging technologies for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> radiology. <b>Collaborations</b> between engineers, Human Factors specialists, industrial designers and medical end users were foreseen, but actual methodologies had to be developed. Three applications were used as development vehicles and as demonstrators. The resulting teamwork and process of indentifying requirements, finding solutions (in technology and workflow), and shifting between these to optimize and speed development towards quality of care were studied. The ARIS*ER approach solves current problems in collaborative teams, taking a systems approach, and manages the overview of requirements and solutions, which is too complex to manage centrally...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{emergency}} <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> rescue operations, {{the coordination}} <b>and</b> <b>collaboration</b> {{of the rescue}} personnel is highly important {{for the success of}} the mission. Data networks formed between the devices carried by the rescue personnel can provide the means for <b>collaboration</b> <b>and</b> coordination on the operation scene. Unfortunately, the unforeseeable conditions and characteristics (e. g., size of the scene, availabilities of access ways for the rescue personnel, availability and status of the infrastructure) of the rescue operations can hinder (e. g., intermittently unavailable network infrastructure) and disrupt (e. g., network partitions) communication of data networks. Even in these adverse conditions coordination <b>and</b> <b>collaboration</b> need to be enabled between the participants of the rescue operation. In this technical report we analyse the usage of streaming services (data, audio and video) to improve coordination <b>and</b> <b>collaboration</b> tasks in rescue and emergency operations. We present a detailed requirement analysis for middleware services that support streaming of data, imposed by this application domain from a research and an industrial perspective. For this purpose, we present two rescue scenarios, which helped us perform the requirements analysis for supporting streaming in intermittently connected networks. Additionally, we also present an example from a middleware for streaming voice traffic within large organizations with multiple working sites. Although these examples might seem different, they have similar requirements considering the availability and awareness of network resources. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} is part 2 of 2. This report provides {{case studies of}} recent <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> initiatives advanced by the racial justice field to disrupt and supplant unproductive mainstream discussions of race and racism. The cases include a campaign entitled "Drop The I-Word," launched in September 2010 by Race Forward itself (at the time still known as the Applied Research Center). This second report also provides lessons gleaned from these <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> initiatives, perhaps most applicable to racial and social justice advocates, but also relevant to others who are eager {{to respond to the}} dominant frames and stories that negatively impact people of color, and/or to proactively advance values and narratives that will lead our society toward a racially equitable future. These lessons are accompanied by important considerations for organizations to bear in mind when selecting spokespersons for racial equity communications. And finally, we also provide recommendations for those in philanthropy curious about current needs and opportunities to support the development of framing expertise, skills-building <b>and</b> <b>collaboration...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{evaluate}} an Enhanced School Home Note (ESHN) intervention as a brief, modified behavioral-parenting training intervention for students with externalizing problems who were non-responsive to a school-home note-as-usual. The ESHN intervention was designed to enhance a common school-based behavioral intervention, the School Home Note (SHN), by incorporating key treatment ingredients found in evidence-based behavioral parent training interventions to improve positive parenting practices to improve student behavior at school. Parents attended three one-on-one coaching sessions that focused on instruction, modeling, and practice of behavior management skills within the context of their child's SHN. Using a single-subject multiple baseline design, the ESHN intervention was shown to reduce levels of disruptive behavior and increase duration of student academic engagement in participants. Social validity results also revealed that both parents and teachers perceived the strategy to acceptable, feasible and effective. Data collected on parenting stress and efficacy was inconclusive. Implications for the use of school-based behavioral parent training <b>interventions,</b> school-home <b>collaboration,</b> <b>and</b> school psychologist and counselor preparation are explored...|$|R
