2500|$|There are, however, {{components}} of electrical circuits {{which do not}} obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their I–V curve) is nonlinear (or non-ohmic). [...] An example is the p-n junction diode (curve at right). [...] As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode. [...] One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of [...] "resistance" [...] is not constant {{as a function of}} applied voltage. [...] Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative. [...] The ratio V/I for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the static, or chordal, or DC, resistance, but as seen in the figure the value of total V over total I varies depending on the particular point along the nonlinear curve which is chosen. [...] This means the [...] "DC resistance" [...] V/I at some point on the curve {{is not the same as}} what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude ΔV volts or ΔI amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring ΔV/ΔI. However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the dynamic, small-signal, or incremental resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the V–I curve at the average value (<b>DC</b> <b>operating</b> point) of the voltage (that is, one over the derivative of current with respect to voltage). [...] For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the V-I curve at the <b>DC</b> <b>operating</b> point.|$|E
2500|$|All {{semiconductor}} detectors function rather inefficiently {{in crystal}} receivers, because the low voltage input to the detector {{is too low}} to result in much difference between forward better conduction direction, and the reverse weaker conduction. [...] To improve the sensitivity {{of some of the}} early crystal detectors, such as silicon carbide, a small forward bias voltage was applied across the detector by a battery and potentiometer. [...] The bias moves the diode's operating point higher on the detection curve producing more signal voltage at the expense of less signal current (higher impedance). There is a limit to the benefit that this produces, depending on the other impedances of the radio. [...] This improved sensitivity was caused by moving the <b>DC</b> <b>operating</b> point to a more desirable voltage-current operating point (impedance) on the junction's I-V curve. The battery did not power the radio, but only provided the biasing voltage which required little power.|$|E

5000|$|Although a {{transient}} analysis might provide a convergent DC solution, the transient analysis itself can still fail to converge.

5000|$|Once a <b>DC</b> <b>operating</b> {{point is}} defined by the DC load line, an AC load line can be drawn through the Q point. The AC load line is a {{straight}} line with a slope equal to the AC impedance facing the nonlinear device, which is in general different from the DC resistance. The ratio of AC voltage to current in the device {{is defined by}} this line. Because the impedance of the reactive components will vary with frequency, the slope of the AC load line depends on the frequency of the applied signal. So there are many AC load lines, that vary from the DC load line (at low frequency) to a limiting AC load line, all having a common intersection at the <b>DC</b> <b>operating</b> point. This limiting load line, generally referred to as the AC load line, is the load line of the circuit at [...] "infinite frequency", and can be found by replacing capacitors with short circuits, and inductors with open circuits.|$|E
