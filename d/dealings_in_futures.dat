40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the subject of Keynes as a speculator. We look first at the primary sources of information, which are {{in the form of}} {{unpublished}} letters and broker's statements. Secondly, we look at the theory Keynes sparingly presented in his writings, but which nevertheless is grounded on his first-hand knowledge of speculative behavior. Thirdly, we examine the focus on speculation in commodities, which had great weight in his portfolio, and have chosen a particular commodity -wheat- for our investigation. In particular, we examine some of Keynes's <b>dealings</b> <b>in</b> wheat <b>futures</b> with the aim of shedding light on the underlying investment strategy...|$|R

5000|$|Franklin Savings {{was founded}} in 1889. In 1972, Ernest Fleischer, a tax lawyer bought control. In 1981, a new {{business}} plan was developed for the thrift, and its assets grew from $200 million to $11 billion. The thrift bought {{a large amount of}} mortgage-backed securities and had <b>dealings</b> <b>in</b> financial <b>futures</b> and interest rate swaps. They had various complex securities that included deep discounted securities, long call and put options and strips (both interest only and principal only). They had also purchased junk bonds. The thrift had few traditional home mortgage loans on its books. The thrift's liabilities consisted primarily of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and repurchase agreements. In addition, over 70% of its deposits were obtained through brokers or telephone marketing programs. [...] The thrift also bought the stock brokerage firms of L. F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., Stern Brothers & Company, and Underwood, Neuhaus & Company.|$|R
5000|$|This {{proposal}} was greatly worrying to the DITC, {{and they became}} much more active in the negotiations. Their concern was based on existing Defence Production Sharing Agreement (DPSA) between the United States and Canada that {{was put in place}} to balance the amount of trade in military goods between the countries. A major procurement like the NFA meant the United States either had to purchase a similar amount of military equipment from Canada, or alternately offset the purchase though military production in Canada. A program like Northop's F-18L was purely military in nature, so any production in Canada would be counted against this balance, but the McDonnell Douglas offer was mostly in civilian goods, which had to be accounted separately. McDonnell was adamant that their DC-9 and DC-10 work be counted against the balance, an attitude the Canadians described as [...] "insistent". The DITC was concerned that the U.S. government would have to be persuaded to re-negotiate the agreement in this case, or make a large military purchase. Neither option seemed straightforward, and would have placed a burden on the DITC's <b>dealings</b> <b>in</b> the <b>future.</b>|$|R

40|$|E-mail {{recently}} {{has become a}} popular mode of communication for lawyers negotiating deals and conducting settlement discussions. But the obvious conveniences of e-mail as a negotiation medium can blind users to its pitfalls. The impoverished nature of the e-mail medium can lead to misunderstandings, sinister attributions, and ultimately, negotiation impasse. How can lawyers {{make use of the}} advantages of e-mail for negotiation while overcoming its disadvantages? One solution consists of a very simple insurance measure: small talk. In the empirical demonstration described in this Article, law students each negotiated a commercial transaction with another law student at a different university using e-mail as the mode of communication. Negotiators who engaged in a brief, getting-to-know-you phone conversation built substantial rapport that resulted in positive social and economic benefits for both parties. This initial small talk by telephone made subsequent e-mail interaction proceed more smoothly because the early creation of rapport helped the negotiators approach the negotiation with a more cooperative mental model, thereby trusting in each other 2 ̆ 7 s good intentions. This, in turn, led to a successful negotiation that concluded with a contract, and engendered positive feelings about one another and expectations of successful <b>dealings</b> <b>in</b> the <b>future.</b> By contrast, negotiators who did not engage in small talk were over four times more likely to reach an impasse, and ended up feeling resentful and angry about the negotiation. The Article concludes by discussing implications and recommendations for lawyers who use e-mail to negotiate...|$|R
