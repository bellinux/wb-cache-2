40|$|This issue {{deals with}} several concerns. For 2010 model regulation, {{previous}} year’s rebates {{were added to}} the numerator directly. One argument in support of this treatment was that the MLR rebate was similar to an <b>experience</b> <b>refund</b> and experience refunds were included in the numerator. This IRD would include these rebates in incurred claims, rather than have them be an adjustment to the numerator. Another adjustment would remove the current year incurred rebate. Section 158. 140 (a) (5) would have the section beginning “and exclude… ” replaced with language including the rebate from 158. 240. Documentation in support: Making this change would allow the current year’s MLR rebate {{to be included in the}} calculation of the current year’s Risk Corridor charge, since the RC regulation references 158. 140. The result of this will be to reduce RC charges, not affect RC payments, increase MLR rebates, and reduce the combined MLR rebate/Risk Corridor Charge paid by issuers.

40|$|Should <b>experience</b> <b>refunds,</b> rate credits, {{and state}} rebates be {{subtracted}} from premium or added to incurred {{claims in the}} rebate calculation? Preliminary Resolution: Preliminary, 11 / 7 : <b>Experience</b> <b>refunds,</b> rate credits, and state rebates should {{be added to the}} numerator of the formula, consistent with treatment in the current regulation...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a unique}} household-level data set, this article investigates the taxfiling <b>experiences</b> and <b>refund</b> {{behavior}} of low- and moderate-income (LMI) households. We document households 2 ̆ 7 tax-filing behavior, {{attitudes about the}} withholding system, use of tax refunds to consume and save, and the mechanisms by which households would prefer to receive their income. We also document the prevalence {{of the use of}} tax-preparation services and the receipt of tax refunds and refund-anticipation loans. Finally, we argue {{that there may be a}} role for tax administration to enable LMI households to make welfare-improving financial decisions...|$|R
40|$|In {{practical}} {{applications of the}} collective theory of risk one is very often confronted {{with the problem of}} making some kind of assumptions about the form of the distribution functions underlying the frequency as well as the severity of claims. Lundberg's [6] and Cramér's [3] approach are essentially based upon the hypothesis that the number of claims occurring in a certain period obey the Poisson distribution whereas for the conditional distribution of the amount claimed upon occurrence of such a claim the exponential distribution is very often used. Of course, by weighting the Poisson distributions (as e. g. done by Ammeter [1]) one enlarges the class of "frequency of claims” distributions considerably but nevertheless there remains an uneasy feeling about artificial assumptions, which are just made for mathematical convenience but are not necessarily related to the practical problems to which the theory of risk is applied. It seems to me that, before applying the general model of the theory of risk, one should always ask the question: "How much information do we want from the mathematical model which describes the risk process?” The answer will be that in many practical cases it is sufficient to determine the mean and the variance of this process. Let me only mention the rate making, the <b>experience</b> control, the <b>refund</b> problems and the detection of secular trends in a certain risk category. In all these cases the practical solutions seem to be sufficiently determined by mean and variance. Let us therefore attack the problem of determining mean and variance of the risk process while trying to make as few assumptions as possible about the type of the underlying probability distributions. This approach is not original. De Finetti [5] has already proposed an approach to risk theory only based upon the knowledge of mean and variance. It is along his lines of thought, although in different mathematical form, that I wish to procee...|$|R
