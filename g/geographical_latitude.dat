25|$|Hipparchus is {{credited}} with the invention or improvement of several astronomical instruments, which were used {{for a long time}} for naked-eye observations. According to Synesius of Ptolemais (4th century) he made the first astrolabion: this may have been an armillary sphere (which Ptolemy however says he constructed, in Almagest V.1); or the predecessor of the planar instrument called astrolabe (also mentioned by Theon of Alexandria). With an astrolabe Hipparchus was the first to be able to measure the <b>geographical</b> <b>latitude</b> and time by observing fixed stars. Previously this was done at daytime by measuring the shadow cast by a gnomon, by recording the length of the longest day of the year or with the portable instrument known as a scaphe.|$|E
25|$|Hyperbolas {{may be seen}} in many sundials. On {{any given}} day, the sun {{revolves}} in a circle on the celestial sphere, and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground {{over the course of a}} day (this path is called the declination line). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the <b>geographical</b> <b>latitude</b> and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a pelekinon by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.|$|E

50|$|The Kp-index is {{used for}} the study and {{prediction}} of ionospheric propagation of high frequency radio signals. Geomagnetic storms, indicated by a Kp = 5 or higher, have no direct effect on propagation. However they disturb the F-layer of the ionosphere, especially at middle and high <b>geographical</b> <b>latitudes,</b> causing a so-called ionospheric storm which degrades radio propagation. The degradation mainly consists of a reduction of the maximum usable frequency (MUF) by as much as 50%. Sometimes the E-layer may be affected as well. In contrast with sudden ionospheric disturbances (SID), which affect high frequency radio paths near the Equator, the effects of ionospheric storms are more intense in the polar regions.|$|R

The components of the total magnetic field at a given point of observation have to be expressed in a single fixed {{coordinate system}}, and our choice is to use, besides the z component, the (geographical) north and east components. To achieve this, information of the geographical direction of the line between each train and the corresponding substation(s) is needed.
