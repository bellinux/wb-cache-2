5|$|Like {{several other}} luxury neighbourhoods in the city, apartments in the David's Village {{development}} are mostly owned by foreigners who visit {{for only a}} few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks</b> a year. Critics contend that this makes it a ghost town in the city centre.|$|E
5|$|Even {{interpreting}} the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded {{by a number}} of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks</b> at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.|$|E
5|$|Large parties trimmed the cut stems, {{and left}} them to dry for <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks.</b> As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk {{below the surface of}} the ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E

5|$|In the Ixodidae, {{the tick}} stays {{in place until}} it is {{completely}} engorged. Its weight may increase by 200 to 600 times as compared to its weight before it started feeding. To accommodate this large expansion, cell division takes place and its cuticle grows larger; the tick may remain attached for <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks,</b> depending on species, life stage and host. In the Argasidae, the tick's cuticle stretches to accommodate the fluid ingested but does not grow new cells, {{the weight of the}} tick increasing five to tenfold over the unfed state. The tick then drops off the host and typically remains in the nest or burrow until its host returns to provide its next meal.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating system}} of bears has {{variously}} {{been described as}} a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously {{over a period of several}} <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks,</b> depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.|$|E
5|$|With treatment, {{symptoms}} {{should improve}} within 36hours. About 50% {{of people will}} recover without treatment within a few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks.</b> Fluoroquinolones are not recommended as a first treatment. The Infectious Diseases Society of America states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication. Amoxicillin-clavulanate appears less effective than other options. Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed {{to all of these}} medications related to their widespread use. Trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX in some countries. For simple UTIs, children often respond to a three-day course of antibiotics. Women with recurrent simple UTIs may benefit from self-treatment upon occurrence of symptoms with medical follow-up only if the initial treatment fails.|$|E

5|$|For otariids {{and some}} phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups {{for a few}} days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These {{foraging}} trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. While their mothers are away, the pups will fast. Lactation in otariids may last 6–11 months; in the Galápagos fur seal it can last as long as 3 years. Pups of these species are weaned at lower weights than their phocid counterparts. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. The female rests at the surface with its head held up, and the young suckle upside down. Young pinnipeds typically learn to swim on their own and some species can even swim at birth. Other species may wait <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks</b> before entering the water. Elephant seals do not swim until weeks after they are weaned.|$|E

25|$|Commonly, {{saturation}} diving allows professional divers to {{live and}} work at pressures greater than 50 msw (160 fsw) for <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks</b> at a time. This type of diving allows for greater economy of work and enhanced safety for the divers. After working in the water, they rest and live in a dry pressurized habitat on or connected to a diving support vessel, oil platform or other floating work station, at approximately the same pressure as the work depth. The diving team is compressed to the working pressure only once, {{at the beginning of the}} work period, and decompressed to surface pressure once, after the entire work period of <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to nitrous oxide may cause vitamin B deficiency. It inactivates the cobalamin form of vitamin B12 by oxidation. Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, including sensory neuropathy, myelopathy, and encephalopathy, may occur within <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks</b> of {{exposure to}} nitrous oxide anaesthesia in people with subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency.|$|E
25|$|During labour and birth, the infant's skull changes {{shape to}} fit through the birth canal, {{sometimes}} causing {{the child to}} be born with a misshapen or elongated head. It will usually return to normal on its own within a few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks.</b> Special exercises sometimes advised by physicians may assist the process.|$|E

25|$|The HAM, a quasi-governmental {{organization}} {{mandated by}} the transitional constitution, imposed sanctions on both privately owned and state-owned media during the year, particularly during the election campaign, for inciting ethnic hatred or violence and for violating media regulations intended to ensure balanced electoral reporting. The sanctions included broadcast suspensions of several <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{array of}} more subtle and {{lingering}} symptoms after orgasm, {{which do not}} constitute POIS, may contribute to habituation between mates. They may show up as restlessness, irritability, increased sexual frustration, apathy, sluggishness, neediness, dissatisfaction with a mate, or weepiness over the <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks</b> after intense sexual stimulation. Such phenomena {{may be part of}} human mating physiology itself.|$|E
25|$|Bear Camp Road is a rugged, narrow, crooked road, {{which is}} not {{suitable}} for travel in the winter. Numerous motorists have been stranded for <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks</b> on Bear Camp Road {{or one of the}} many gravel roads that branch off from it. Dewitt Finley and James Kim both died after being stranded on the road in winter.|$|E
30|$|Service {{availability}}: Service availability at both {{origin and}} destination is very important. Although rail {{is not able to}} compete with road transport in terms of flexibility, which is an important key to ‘service availability’, the frequency of a service in a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>week</b> can complement this aspect.|$|R
5000|$|According to Marx, {{absolute}} {{surplus value}} is obtained {{by increasing the}} amount of time worked per worker in an accounting period. [...] Marx talks mainly about the length of the working <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>week,</b> but in modern times the concern is about the number of hours worked per year.|$|R
50|$|The Irish {{physicist}} John Tyndall was guided to {{the summit}} in a group led by Ulrich Lauener in August 1858, but returned the next <b>day</b> (<b>or</b> <b>week?)</b> {{to make the first}} solo ascent of Dufourspitze on 17 August 1858, which he described in his account, Glaciers of the Alps.|$|R
25|$|Patients {{may be able}} {{to return}} home soon after the vitrectomy, or may be asked to stay in the {{hospital}} overnight. After the operation, the eye will be red and sensitive, and patients usually need to wear an eyepatch for a few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks</b> to protect the eye. Medicated eye drops are also prescribed to protect against infection.|$|E
25|$|Nifong {{contended that}} lack of DNA {{evidence}} is not unusual and that 75–80% of all sexual assault cases lack DNA evidence. Rape victims often delay reporting by <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks,</b> inadvertently destroying DNA evidence. However, in this case, Mangum had a rape-kit exam administered only hours {{after the end of}} the party, so the absence of DNA evidence was considered unlikely by legal experts.|$|E
25|$|Information brokerages {{and other}} tools that {{aid in the}} {{valuation}} of virtual items on secondary markets have increased in number. This has occurred {{as a response to}} alleviate the labor involved in leveling that requires hours, <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>weeks</b> to achieve. Being able to exchange real money for virtual currency provides the player purchasing power for virtual commodities. As such, players are guaranteed opportunities, increased skills and a fine reputation, which is a definite advantage over others.|$|E
