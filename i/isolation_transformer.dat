25|$|Generally every AC {{power line}} {{transformer}} {{acts as an}} <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer,</b> and every step up or down {{has the potential to}} form an isolated circuit. However, this isolation would prevent failed devices from blowing fuses when shorted to their ground conductor. The isolation that could be created by each transformer is defeated by always having one leg of the transformers grounded, {{on both sides of the}} input and output transformer coils. Power lines also typically ground one specific wire at every pole, to ensure current equalization from pole to pole if a short to ground is occurring.|$|E
500|$|In {{conventional}} graph {{representation of}} circuits, {{there is no}} means of explicitly representing mutual inductive couplings, such as occurs in a transformer, and such components {{may result in a}} disconnected graph with more than one separate part. [...] For convenience of analysis, a graph with multiple parts can be combined into a single graph by unifying one node in each part into a single node. [...] This makes no difference to the theoretical behaviour of the circuit so analysis carried out on it is still valid. [...] It would, however, make a practical difference if a circuit were to be implemented this way in that it would destroy the isolation between the parts. [...] An example would be a transformer earthed on both the primary and secondary side. [...] The transformer still functions as a transformer with the same voltage ratio but can now no longer be used as an <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Laboratory rooms, medical facilities, {{construction}} sites, repair workshops, mobile electrical installations, {{and other}} environments that are supplied via engine-generators {{where there is}} {{an increased risk of}} insulation faults, often use an IT earthing arrangement supplied from <b>isolation</b> <b>transformers.</b> To mitigate the two-fault issues with IT systems, the <b>isolation</b> <b>transformers</b> should supply {{only a small number of}} loads each and should be protected with an insulation monitoring device (generally used only by medical, railway or military IT systems, because of cost).|$|R
2500|$|In the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta, {{there is}} a two-pin plug and socket for use with {{electric}} shavers and toothbrushes. The plug has insulated sleeves on the pins. The BS 4573 socket is suitable for use in dry areas only, so is rarely used in a stand-alone form. It is more usual to find shaver supply units meeting BS EN 61558-2-5; these include an <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer</b> and sockets accepting various two-pin plug types including BS 4573, Europlug and Australian and sometimes a 115V output for two-pin US plugs.

50|$|The PLRI {{interface}} can {{be connected}} {{directly to the}} radio(s), or connected to a Rigblaster-typeinterface The latter method is preferred, as the PLRI interface contains no audio circuitry such as <b>isolation</b> <b>transformers</b> or bypass capacitors.|$|R
50|$|If two {{electronic}} systems {{have a common}} ground, they are not galvanically isolated. The common ground might not normally and intentionally have connection to functional poles, but might become connected. For this reason <b>isolation</b> <b>transformers</b> do not supply a GND/earth pole.|$|R
5000|$|Specially wired signal {{adaptors}} {{may leave}} the shield connection disconnected, or connected to safety ground through an RF bypass capacitor. <b>Isolation</b> <b>transformers</b> {{may be used}} to convert from balanced lines to single-ended inputs, and also to isolate the cable shield from the equipment safety ground.|$|R
50|$|Instrument {{transformers}} {{may also}} be used as an <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer</b> so that secondary quantities may be used in phase shifting without affecting other primary connected devices.|$|E

50|$|It is {{a special}} {{application}} of an <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer,</b> and {{is often used to}} prevent ground loops or earth loops, which cause humming or buzzing in audio circuits. It also prevents low direct current voltages from passing.|$|E
50|$|In {{classical}} transformers, {{there are}} two electrically separate windings of wire coils around the transformer’s core. The advantage of transformer-type over other types is that the electrically separate windings for input and output allow these baluns to connect circuits whose ground-level voltages are subject to ground loops or otherwise electrically incompatible; for that reason they are often called <b>isolation</b> <b>transformers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{the term}} is used to {{emphasize}} that a device is not an autotransformer whose primary and secondary circuits are connected. Power transformers with specified insulation between primary and secondary are not usually described only as [...] "isolation transformers" [...] unless this is their primary function. Only transformers whose primary purpose is to isolate circuits are routinely described as <b>isolation</b> <b>transformers.</b>|$|R
50|$|SWER is {{a viable}} choice for a {{distribution}} system when conventional return current wiring would cost more than SWER’s <b>isolation</b> <b>transformers</b> and small power losses. Power engineers experienced with both SWER and conventional power lines rate SWER as equally safe, more reliable, less costly, but with slightly lower efficiency than conventional lines. SWER can cause fires when maintenance is poor, and bushfire is a risk.|$|R
50|$|Cheater plugs {{are also}} used to break ground loops in audio systems. This {{practice}} has been condemned as disregarding electrical safety. A safer and more reliable alternative is to use an <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer</b> made specifically for this purpose.|$|E

40|$|The {{combined}} asymmetric half-bridge {{power converter}} topology {{is often used}} to drive switched reluctance machines (SRMs). This letter describes a transformer-isolated power semiconductor gate driver circuit that uses only two transformers to supply all three power devices in a combined asymmetric half bridge with local power supplies and drive signals. Therefore, the entire gate driver circuitry for a six-switch converter driving a four-phase SRM requires only four <b>isolation</b> <b>transformers,</b> thereby reducing cost. Operation of a prototype circuit is demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|Transformers couple by {{magnetic}} flux. The {{primary and}} secondary windings of a transformer are not connected to each other (an autotransformer has a conductive connection between its windings and so does not provide isolation). The voltage difference that may safely be applied between windings without risk of breakdown (the isolation voltage) is specified in kilovolts by an industry standard. The same applies to transductors. While transformers are usually used to change voltages, <b>isolation</b> <b>transformers</b> with a 1:1 ratio are used in safety applications.|$|R

In order to improve PV efficiency, a transformerless power conditioning subsystem (PCS) is proposed for a grounded PV array having two and three connections to a utility. An additional transformerless PCS configuration is proposed for an ungrounded PV array. A detailed schematic drawing of the interconnections between the elements of a transformerless PCS is provided...|$|R
50|$|Much Hallicrafters {{equipment}} {{is still in}} common use by collectors and vintage amateur radio enthusiasts, and widely available on the used market. Due to the transformerless design of many tube radios of this period, an <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer</b> should be used with any radio that has not had safety wiring modifications.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{so-called}} balanced power system, an <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer</b> with a center tap {{is used to}} create a separate supply with conductors at a balanced Vnom/2 with respect to ground. The purpose of a balanced power system is to minimize the noise coupled into sensitive equipment from the power supply.|$|E
50|$|Isolation {{transformers}} {{are also}} used for the power supply of devices not at ground potential. An example is the Austin transformer for the power supply of air-traffic obstacle warning lamps on radio antenna masts. Without the <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer,</b> the lighting circuits on the mast would conduct radio-frequency energy to ground through the power supply.|$|E

50|$|<b>Isolation</b> <b>{{transformers}}</b> are transformers for {{low frequency}} analog and digital audio connections or rarely for high-frequencies in antenna cables between TV outlets and devices (tuner, VCR, TV, etc.). This filter then suppresses low-frequency ground loop currents on the sheath and core of coaxial cables, which {{can result from}} multiple grounds at different potentials. They affect the signal because of their upper and lower frequency limits and therefore can not transmit DC. In addition, analog signals can suffer from nonlinear distortion, especially near the frequency limits of the device.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} level usesRS-485 {{levels at}} 1 Mbit/s data rate. The encoding uses a Manchester II code and a HDLC frame protocol with proper voltage balancing to avoid DC {{components in the}} galvanic <b>isolation</b> <b>transformers.</b> The Manchester decoder uses a phase/quadrature demodulation (not RS485, that operates with zero-crossings) which allows to span 750 m under worst-case conditions, especially when only the two extremity vehicles are equipped, {{as is the case}} with multiple traction for freight trains. No repeaters are foreseen since vehicles in between can have discharged batteries.|$|R
5000|$|National wiring {{regulations}} sometimes {{prohibit the}} use of sockets within certain areas adjacent to water taps etc. In such cases shaver supply units meeting IEC 61558-2-5 may be permissible. These include an <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer</b> and usually accept multiple two-pin plug types including Europlug (Type C), Australian (Type I) and BS 4573. The <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer</b> often includes a 115 V output accepting two-pin US plugs (Type A). Shaver supply units must also be current limited, IEC 61558-2-5 specifies a minimum rating of 20 VA and maximum of 50 VA. [...] IEC 61558-2-5 requires sockets to be marked with the shaver symbol defined in IEC 60417-5225, the words [...] "shavers only" [...] are also often used but not required. IEC 61558-2-5 has been adopted as a European CENELEC standard EN 61558-2-5 and also as a national standard in some countries, e.g. UK (BS EN 61558-2-5) and Malaysia (MS IEC 61558-2-5).|$|E
50|$|Exposed live grounds are dangerous. They are live, and can electrocute {{end users}} if touched. Headphone sockets fitted {{by end users}} to live chassis TVs are {{especially}} dangerous, as {{not only are they}} often live, but any electrical shock will pass through the user’s head. Sets that have both a headphone socket and a live chassis use an audio <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer</b> to make the arrangement safe.|$|E
5000|$|Transformers {{allow the}} output of a device to [...] "float" [...] {{relative}} to ground to avoid potential ground loops. Power isolation transformers increase {{the safety of a}} device, so that a person touching a live portion of the circuit will not have current flow through them to earth. Power sockets intended for electric razor supply may use an <b>isolation</b> <b>transformer</b> to prevent an electric shock if the razor should be dropped into water.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the danger}} of {{electric}} shock is high, special ungrounded power systems {{may be used to}} minimize possible leakage current to ground. Examples of such installations include patient care areas in hospitals, where medical equipment is directly connected to a patient and must not permit any power-line current to pass into the patient's body. Medical systems include monitoring devices to warn of any increase of leakage current. On wet construction sites or in shipyards, <b>isolation</b> <b>transformers</b> may be provided so that a fault in a power tool or its cable does not expose users to shock hazard.|$|R
