5|$|Returning to Louisville on July 16, the Third Kentucky mustered out on July 21. During {{their time}} in Mexico, over 100 members of the 1,000-man {{regiment}} had died of illness. Although <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> combat, Breckinridge's military service proved an asset to his political prospects in Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{enlisted in}} the 7th Bavarian Field Artillery Regiment as an infantryman at the {{outbreak}} of World War I. He was wounded several times {{over the course of}} the war, and won the Iron Cross, 2nd class, in 1915. Shortly before the war ended, Hess enrolled to train as an aviator, but <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> action in this role. He left the armed forces in December 1918 with the rank of Leutnant der Reserve.|$|E
5|$|In early 1813, Ernest was {{involved}} in political scandal during an election contest in Weymouth following the general election the previous year. The Duke was shown {{to be one of}} three trustees who were able to dictate who would represent Weymouth in Parliament. It being considered improper for a peer to interfere in a Commons election, there was considerable controversy, and the Government sent Ernest to Europe as an observer to accompany Hanoverian troops, which were again engaged in war against France. Though <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> action, Ernest was present at the Battle of Leipzig, a major victory for the Allies.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> {{apparently}} <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> {{value in}} the art associated with the backward Vodou religion.|$|R

5|$|While still convalescing, Hess had {{requested}} {{that he be}} allowed to enrol to train as a pilot, so after some Christmas leave with his family he reported to Munich. He received basic flight training at Oberschleissheim and Lechfeld Air Base in March to June 1918 and advanced training at Valenciennes in France in October. On 14 October, {{he was assigned to}} Jagdstaffel 35b, a Bavarian fighter squadron equipped with Fokker D.VII biplanes. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> action with Jagdstaffel 35b, as the war ended on 11 November 1918, before he had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> reason to hand it over to someone {{who had not been}} involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E
5|$|Reassigned, Bolt flew to Hawaii, then to Long Beach, California. He {{reunited with}} Dorothy Wiggins in San Francisco, {{and the two}} married on 23 May 1944 in Oakland, before going on a one-month honeymoon. His next {{assignment}} was with the newly formed VMF-471 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. While posted to VMF-471, he attended the Aviation Ground Officer's School at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico, Virginia, from November 1944 through February 1945. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> combat {{for the rest of}} the war, but did manage to break the Corsair endurance record by keeping an aircraft aloft for 14 hours and 9 seconds. After briefly returning to VMF-471, Bolt was reassigned to VMF-215 in March 1945, tasked with training pilots for new carrier-based aircraft. He remained in this role until V-J Day, the end of hostilities.|$|E
60|$|Avice had gone, and <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her <b>no</b> {{more that}} day. Since {{he could not}} again call upon her, she was as {{inaccessible}} {{as if she had}} entered the military citadel on the hill-top beyond them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have said}} as much as can be necessary,--perhaps more, and I would rather go now." [...] Then {{she left the room}} with the same slow, stately step, and <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her <b>no</b> more on that day.|$|R

5|$|Duchesne {{now called}} on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd {{to counter the}} defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had {{suddenly}} abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> evidence that Lamb was insane {{and said that he}} was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able {{to understand the nature of}} what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} regimental {{promotion to}} major in the 28th Foot on 9 May 1816. The regiment moved to a garrison posting in the Ionian islands in 1819, and {{his time in the}} islands saw him command a force which put down a local rising on Santa Maura. On 2 September 1819 he purchased the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel and command of the 92nd Gordon Highlanders. His tenure at the 92nd was short and contentious; since it was garrisoned in Jamaica, he did not actually join the regiment until October 1820, and then scandalised his officers and men by his approach to regimental traditions. He appeared on parade in a cocked hat rather than the conventional highland bonnet, and attempted to order the regiment to wear trousers rather than the kilt. The Duke of York quickly arranged for his transfer to a less sensitive role, and he was transferred to command the 90th Light Infantry, a Lowland—and safely trousered—regiment, on 9 August 1821. The 90th were in the Ionian Islands, where Stovin had been posted some years earlier, but his second tour was substantially quieter; <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> further active service before he retired from the 90th on half-pay on 23 April 1829. For his services there, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.|$|E
25|$|In public comments, Selig said <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> {{reason to}} reconsider Rose's punishment; however, in March 2003, Selig {{acknowledged}} that he was considering Rose's application, leading to speculation that Rose's return might be imminent. Ultimately, however, Selig took no action.|$|E
60|$|And {{when the}} Hermit had given away his {{knowledge}} of God, he fell upon the ground and wept, and a great darkness hid from him {{the city and the}} young Robber, so that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them <b>no</b> more.|$|R
5000|$|And Elisha <b>saw</b> it, and <b>he</b> cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the {{horsemen}} thereof. And <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>no</b> more: and he {{took hold}} of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.|$|R
60|$|His {{garrulity}} was {{an instant}} arrested; for lifting his eyes, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> what <b>no</b> one else saw--the black figure of Dr Oman standing on the sunlit lawn and looking steadily into the room. Before he could quite recover himself Cray had cloven in.|$|R
25|$|A {{few minutes}} before, a flame-throwing squad had blasted fire into the position. Near the entrance, {{two of the}} enemy lay dead. 1stLt Rouh could hear nothing. He stepped over the pair, and into the dark interior, his carbine ready. Creeping along the wall, he could see stores of supplies. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> life.|$|E
25|$|In March 2014 Bäckman {{was invited}} to {{participate}} as observer by the Eurasian Observatory for Democracy & Elections (EODE), a far-right Russia-based self-proclaimed election monitoring organization, in disputed Crimean status referendum which resulted annexation of Crimea by Russia. Bäckman stated that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> violations and considered the referendum to be {{within the framework of}} international law.|$|E
25|$|In May 1864 Gladstone {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> reason in {{principle}} why all mentally able men {{could not be}} enfranchised, but admitted that this would only come about once the working classes themselves showed more interest in the subject. Queen Victoria was not pleased with this statement, and an outraged Palmerston considered it seditious incitement to agitation.|$|E
60|$|They parted {{amid the}} {{flowering}} shrubs and caged {{birds in the}} hall, and <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her <b>no</b> more. De Stancy came up, and spoke a few commonplace words, his sister having gone out, either without perceiving Somerset, or with intention to avoid him.|$|R

25|$|On {{the conduct}} of the war, <b>he</b> still <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> need for a smaller and more {{powerful}} War Cabinet, but Churchill, already First Lord of the Admiralty and Chairman of the Military Co-ordinating Committee of the Cabinet, was to be given powers to direct the Chiefs of Staff Committee.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} she was cast, Varsi already had an agent and had been searching for film roles for a long while, without any luck. She made rounds at several studios, but {{according}} to the actress, they all thought she was suitable for character parts only. She was even dropped by her agent in 1956, because <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> future in her career.|$|E
25|$|Cardinal O'Malley {{praised the}} new {{tone of the}} papacy of Pope Francis. He stated however that those that {{expected}} change in doctrine from the pope on sexual ethics like abortion, contraception, and gay marriage would be disappointed. He also indicated that the church would not alter the ban on communion for the divorced remarried and that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> theological justification for doing so.|$|E
25|$|In early 2004 former Los Alamos National Laboratory {{director}} Siegfried S. Hecker, {{as part of}} {{an unofficial}} U.S. delegation, was allowed to inspect North Korea's plutonium production facilities. Hecker later testified before the United States Congress that while North Korea seems to have successfully extracted plutonium from the spent fuel rods, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> evidence at the time that they had actually produced a workable weapon. In 2007, the former senior scientist of Pakistan, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan claimed that North Korea's nuclear program was well advanced before his visit in 1993 with Benazir Bhutto, former prime minister.|$|E
60|$|He spat. He {{choked with}} rage--for <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> visions, <b>no</b> doubt. <b>He</b> jumped {{up from his}} chair, and went away to flee from them--perhaps. He went into the room where Mrs. Schomberg sat. Her aspect {{could not have been}} very {{soothing}} to the sort of torment from which he was suffering.|$|R
60|$|She {{was walking}} towards {{him from the}} Marble Arch, and <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>no</b> mannerism of her gait had been changed. It was good to find her still Maisie, and, so to speak, his next-door neighbour. No {{greeting}} passed between them, because there had been none in the old days.|$|R

25|$|In the 2003 {{legislative}} session, Frist enjoyed many successes. He {{was able}} to push many initiatives through to fruition, including the Bush administration's third major tax cut and legislation that was against partial-birth abortion. However, the tactics {{that he used to}} achieve those victories alienated many Democrats. He also was instrumental in developing and then passing the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the historic and unprecedented funding commitment to fight disease. In 2004, by comparison, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> major legislative successes, with the explanations ranging from delay tactics by Democrats to lack of unity within the Republican Party.|$|E
25|$|One witness {{interviewed by}} the NTSB, a pilot driving on a road {{southwest}} of the airport, told investigators that he saw the airplane in normal flight at normal altitudes, and that {{he believed that the}} approach was not abnormal. The airplane completed a 180-degree turn from the downwind leg of the approach and continued the turn. He then saw the aircraft pitch slightly, before it rolled to the left until the wings were vertical. The airplane then turned nose-down and smashed into the ground. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> fire or smoke during the flight and he believed both propellers were rotating.|$|E
25|$|Between January 26, 1864 and August 24, 1864, Mackall {{served as}} chief of staff in the Army of Tennessee under General Joseph E. Johnston. Mackall {{declined}} to serve with the Army of Tennessee when General John Bell Hood replaced General Johnston. After the end of his service with the Army of Tennessee on August 24, 1864, Mackall was inactive at Macon, Georgia. He was in command of Confederate forces in south Georgia between March 23, 1865 and April 20, 1865, when he was captured by Union troops at Macon, but <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> active service during this time. No record of his parole has been found.|$|E

5000|$|He {{had been}} conscripted into the Red Army in August, 1944 {{and was sent}} to the front, where he participated in two battles.
