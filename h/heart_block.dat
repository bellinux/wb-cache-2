5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as <b>heart</b> <b>block,</b> or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or <b>heart</b> <b>block,</b> a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E

25|$|The same {{principle}} applies for this drug's {{actions in the}} <b>heart.</b> <b>Blocking</b> sodium channels in the conduction system, {{as well as the}} muscle cells of the heart, raises the depolarization threshold, making the heart less likely to initiate or conduct early action potentials that may cause an arrhythmia.|$|R

40|$|Hyperkalemia {{affects the}} {{myocardial}} tissue producing electrocardiographic abnormalities, such as prolongation of the P-R interval, tall peaked T waves, {{a reduction in}} the amplitude and an increase in the duration of P wave, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, including variable degree <b>heart</b> <b>blocks.</b> Elderly patients are particularly predisposed to developing hyperkalemia and the associated abnormalities due to an age-related reduction in glomerular filtration rate and pre-existing medical problems. Therefore, the impact of aging on potassium homeostasis must be taken into consideration, and preventive measures, such as early recognition of possible hyperkalemia in the geriatric population treated with certain medications or supplements must be investigated. The threshold for cardiac arrhythmias in the elderly can be lower than the general population. We report 3 unusual cases of mild hyperkalemia in elderly patients presenting with hypotension, syncope and variable degree <b>heart</b> <b>blocks</b> which resolved spontaneously with the correction of hyperkalemia...|$|R

5000|$|Disorders {{affecting}} the cardiomyocytes {{that make up}} the electrical conduction system of the heart are called <b>heart</b> <b>blocks.</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>blocks</b> are separated into different categories based on the location of the cellular damage. Damage to any of the conducting cells in or below the bundle of His are collectively referred to as [...] "infra-Hisian blocks". To be specific, blocks that occur in the right or left bundle branches are called [...] "bundle branch blocks", and those that occur in either the left anterior or the left posterior fascicles are called [...] "fascicular blocks", or [...] "hemiblocks". The conditions in which both the right bundle branch and either the left anterior fascicle or the left posterior fascicle are blocked are collectively referred to as bifascicular blocks, and the condition in which the right bundle branch, the left anterior fascicle, and the left posterior fascicle are blocked is called trifascicular block. Infra-hisian <b>blocks</b> limit the <b>heart's</b> ability to coordinate the activities of the atria and ventricles, which usually results in a decrease in its efficiency in pumping blood.|$|R

50|$|Two {{major groups}} of arrhythmias are {{bradycardia}} and tachycardia. Bradycardia {{can be caused}} by <b>heart</b> <b>blocks.</b> Tachycardias include SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) and VT (ventricular tachycardia). SVT does not cause syncope except in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Ventricular tachycardia originate in the ventricles. VT causes syncope and can result in sudden death. Ventricular tachycardia, which describes a heart rate of over 100 beats per minute with at least three irregular heartbeats as a sequence of consecutive premature beats, can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, which is rapidly fatal without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation.|$|R

25|$|Sublingual {{nifedipine}} {{has previously}} been used in hypertensive emergencies. It was once frequently prescribed as needed to people taking MAOIs for real or perceived hypertensive crises. This {{was found to be}} dangerous, and has been abandoned. Sublingual nifedipine causes blood-pressure lowering through peripheral vasodilation. It can cause an uncontrollable decrease in blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, and a steal phenomenon in certain vascular beds. There have been multiple reports in the medical literature of serious adverse effects with sublingual nifedipine, including cerebral ischemia/infarction, myocardial infarction, complete <b>heart</b> <b>block,</b> and death. As a result of this, the FDA reviewed all data regarding the safety and efficacy of sublingual nifedipine for hypertensive emergencies in 1995, and concluded that the practice should be abandoned because it was neither safe nor efficacious. An exception to the avoidance of this practice is in the use of nifedipine in the treatment of hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the risk factors and mid-term {{outcomes}} associated with post-procedure <b>heart</b> <b>blocks</b> (PPHBs) after transcatheter closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect (pmVSD). BackgroundThe development of <b>heart</b> <b>blocks</b> remains a major challenge for transcatheter closure of pmVSD. MethodsTranscatheter closure of pmVSD was carried out in 228 patients. Electrocardiography and 24 -h Holter monitoring were performed before the procedure, within 1 week after the procedure, then 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and every year thereafter. ResultsThirty-three patients (14. 5 %) who received transcatheter closure of pmVSD developed PPHBs. PPHBs included right bundle branch block (57. 6 %), left bundle branch block (24. 2 %), and atrioventricular block (18. 2 %). High-degree atrioventricular blocks occurred in 4 patients and recovered to normal conduction after intravenous administration of hydrocortisone. PPHBs recovered to normal conduction in 21 patients by the time of hospital discharge. Compared with the patients without PPHBs, the patients suffering PPHBs were characterized by a significantly longer distance between the aortic valve and the defect (DAVD), a shorter distance from the lower rim of the defect to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve (DLRD-SLTV), and a larger diameter difference between the occluder and ventricular septal defect (DDOV). The earlier the PPHBs developed after the procedure, the more difficult the recovery to normal conduction. ConclusionsThe outcome of PPHBs after transcatheter closure of pmVSD was satisfactory, as most patients recovered to normal conduction. Measurements of DLRD-SLTV, DAVD, and DDOV may be useful in predicting the incidence of PPHBs...|$|R
50|$|Like {{all other}} class I {{antiarrhythmic}} agents, quinidine primarily works by blocking the fast inward sodium current (INa). Quinidine's effect on INa {{is known as}} a 'use dependent block'. This means at higher <b>heart</b> rates, the <b>block</b> increases, while at lower <b>heart</b> rates, the <b>block</b> decreases. The effect of blocking the fast inward sodium current causes the phase 0 depolarization of the cardiac action potential to decrease (decreased Vmax).|$|R

2500|$|History of arrhythmias, {{particularly}} <b>heart</b> <b>block</b> to {{any degree}} ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{very slow}} heart rate (bradycardia) may be {{associated}} with <b>heart</b> <b>block.</b> [...] It may also arise from autonomous nervous system impairment.|$|E
2500|$|ECG showing {{features}} of <b>heart</b> <b>block,</b> {{such as a}} prolonged PR interval (Cannot be included if carditis is present as a major symptom) ...|$|E
50|$|Clinically speaking, {{the blocks}} {{tend to have}} more serious {{potential}} the closer they are to the 'end' of the electrical path (the muscles of the heart regulated by the heartbeat), and less serious effects the closer they are to the 'start' (at the SA node), because the potential disruption becomes greater as more of the 'path' is 'blocked' from its 'end' point. Therefore, most of the important <b>heart</b> <b>blocks</b> are AV nodal blocks and infra-Hisian blocks. SA blocks are usually of lesser clinical significance, since in the event of SA block, the AV node contains a secondary pacemaker which would still maintain a heart rate of around 40 - 60 beats per minute, sufficient for consciousness and much of daily life in the majority of individuals.|$|R
50|$|The {{prognosis}} after {{myocardial infarction}} varies greatly {{depending on the}} extent and location of the affected heart muscle, and the development and management of complications. Prognosis is worse with older age, and social isolation. Anterior infarcts, persistent ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, development of <b>heart</b> <b>blocks,</b> and left ventricular impairment are all associated with poorer prognosis. Without treatment, {{about a quarter of}} those affected by MI die within minutes, and about forty percent within the first month. Morbidity and mortality from myocardial infarction has however improved over the years due to earlier and better treatment: in those who have an STEMI in the United States, between 5 and 6 percent die before leaving the hospital and 7 to 18 percent die within a year.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the path}} of the {{electrical}} signals, the places where conduction can be blocked give rise to different kinds of heart blocks:SA and AV node blocks are each divided into three degrees, with second degree blocks being divided into two types (written either [...] "type I or II" [...] or [...] "type 1 or 2"). In an SA block, the electrical impulse is delayed or blocked {{on the way to the}} atria, thus delaying atrial depolarization. By contrast, an AV block occurs in the AV node and delays ventricular depolarization. The term [...] "Wenckebach block" [...] is also used for some <b>heart</b> <b>blocks,</b> and can refer to a second degree type I block in either the SA node or the AV node, however the ECG features of the two are quite distinctly different.|$|R
2500|$|The ECG {{findings}} in atrial septal defect {{vary with the}} type of defect the individual has. Individuals with atrial septal defects may have a prolonged PR interval (a first-degree <b>heart</b> <b>block).</b> [...] The prolongation of the PR interval is probably due to the enlargement of the atria common in ASDs and the increased distance due to the defect itself. [...] Both of these can cause an increased distance of internodal conduction from the SA node to the AV node.|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact and}} {{symptoms}} of atrial flutter depend on the heart rate of the patient. [...] Heart rate {{is a measure of}} the ventricular rather than atrial activity. [...] Impulses from the atria are conducted to the ventricles through the atrio-ventricular node (AV node). [...] Due primarily to its longer refractory period, the AV node exerts a protective effect on heart rate by blocking atrial impulses in excess of about 180 beats/minute, for the example of a resting heart rate. (This block is dependent on the age of the patient, and can be calculated roughly by subtracting patient age from 220). [...] If the flutter rate is 300/minute only half of these impulses will be conducted, giving a ventricular rate of 150/minute, or a 2:1 <b>heart</b> <b>block.</b> [...] The addition of rate-controlling drugs or conduction system disease can increase this block substantially (see image below).|$|E
2500|$|Reducing {{the force}} of {{contraction}} of the myocardium {{is known as the}} negative inotropic effect of calcium channel blockers. Slowing down the conduction of electrical activity within the heart, by blocking the calcium channel during the plateau phase of the action potential of the heart (see: cardiac action potential), results in a negative chronotropic effect, or a lowering of heart rate. [...] This can increase the potential for <b>heart</b> <b>block.</b> [...] The negative chronotropic effects of CCBs make them a commonly used class of agents in individuals with atrial fibrillation or flutter in whom control of the heart rate is generally a goal. [...] Negative chronotropy can be beneficial when treating a variety of disease processes because [...] lower heart rates represent lower cardiac oxygen requirements. Elevated heart rate can result in significantly higher [...] "cardiac work", which can result in symptoms of angina.|$|E

Asystole, premature ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, conduction disorders (various degrees of <b>heart</b> <b>blocks,</b> bundle-brunch blocks), supraventricular tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation are the other arrhythmic complications of electrical injury.
