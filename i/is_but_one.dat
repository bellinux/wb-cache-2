5|$|Some {{speculative}} {{theories have}} proposed that our Universe <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>one</b> {{of a set of}} disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the multiverse, challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the Universe.

5|$|Therefore I shall again {{repeat the}} {{doctrine}} of the Trinity, as it is positively affirmed in Scripture: that God is there expressed in three different names, as Father, as Son, and as Holy Ghost: that each of these is God, and that there <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>one</b> God. But this union and distinction are a mystery utterly unknown to mankind.|$|E

5|$|Sometime around 1850, PedroII began having {{discreet}} {{affairs with}} other women. The {{most famous and}} enduring of these relationships involved Luísa Margarida Portugal de Barros, Countess of Barral, with whom he formed a romantic and intimate, though not adulterous, friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor's daughters in November 1856. Throughout his life, the Emperor held onto a hope of finding a soulmate, something he felt cheated of due to {{the necessity of a}} marriage of state to a woman for whom he never felt passion. This <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>one</b> instance illustrating his dual identity: one who assiduously carried out his duty in the role of emperor which destiny had assigned to him and another who considered the imperial office an unrewarding burden and who was happier in the worlds of literature and science.|$|E

25|$|Strangites reject {{both the}} {{traditional}} Christian {{doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus Christ and the Mormon doctrine of plurality of gods. They insist that there <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>one</b> eternal God, the Father, and that alleged progression to godhood (a doctrine supposedly taught by Smith; Strangites reject that assertion) is impossible. God has always been God, say they, and he is one Person (not three, as in the traditional Christian Trinity).|$|E
25|$|These axioms are all {{first order}} statements. That is, all {{variables}} range over the natural numbers and not sets thereof, a fact even stronger than their being arithmetical. Moreover, there <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>one</b> existential quantifier, in axiom 3. Axioms 1 and 2, {{together with an}} axiom schema of induction make up the usual Peano-Dedekind definition of N. Adding to these axioms any sort of axiom schema of induction makes redundant the axioms 3, 10, and 11.|$|E
25|$|Though Jayewardene indeed did {{not take}} {{measures}} to stop the attack on Tamils, he was not opposed to them personally, only politically. One of his most esteemed friends was a supreme court judge of Tamil ethnicity, {{a member of an}} elite family and raised in Colombo, but who was strongly linked to his Jaffna Tamil heritage. This <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>one</b> close Tamil friend of the president's, and it is quite clear that he was not a racist but rather a man who knew how to exploit racism to win the majority.|$|E

25|$|Many biblical authors draw {{a strong}} {{connection}} between love {{of others and}} love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman {{is the same as}} hatred of God. Thomas Jay Oord has argued in several books that altruism <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>one</b> possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.|$|E

500|$|After John Sigismund's conversion, {{most of his}} courtiers also {{adhered to}} Unitarianism. According to {{historian}} Gábor Barta, political factors also contributed to John Sigismund's conversion, because he [...] "found in [...] the means through which he could express both his adherence to the Christian world and the distance from it". István Keul says that {{the simplicity of the}} idea that [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>one</b> God!" [...] also contributed to the spread of Unitarianism, especially among the Székely villagers and the townspeople of Kolozsvár. A religious enthusiast, György Karácsony, stirred up many peasants in Partium to wage holy war against the Ottomans in 1569. They marched against Debrecen, but the neighboring noblemen routed them near the town in early 1570.|$|E

The song {{reached the top}} position on the Croatian music charts and was widely played during Euro 2008.

500|$|In February 2004, the Union of Concerned Scientists {{published}} a report accusing the Bush administration of manipulating science for political purposes, listing more than 20 alleged incidents of censoring scientific results or applying {{a litmus test}} in the appointment of supposedly scientific advisory panel members. In April 2004, Marburger {{published a}} statement rebutting the report and exposing errors and incomplete explanations in it, and stating that [...] "even when the science is clear—and often it is not—it <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>one</b> input into the policy process," [...] but [...] "in this Administration, science strongly informs policy." [...] The Union of Concerned Scientists issued a revised version of their report after Marburger's statement was published. Marburger also called the report's conclusions illusory {{and the result of}} focusing on unrelated incidents within a vast government apparatus, and attributed the controversy as being related to the upcoming elections. It was noted that Marburger enjoyed close personal relationships with President Bush, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and Office of Management and Budget Director Joshua Bolten, attesting to his active involvement within the administration.|$|E
