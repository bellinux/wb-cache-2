40|$|This {{paper is}} the first of two parts and {{describes}} the fundamental research into software techniques for automating fault analysis in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits.</b> Part 2 (see Hogan et al. (1)) provides a detailed description of some important aspects of the software development and the applications and experimental procedures used to test its effectiveness. The objective of the project is the development of a software toolkit, DESHC (Diagnostic Expert System for <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Circuits),</b> which can be used to automate the two techniques used in an assessment of the integrity of a hydraulic system, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). The purpose of an integrity assessment is to highlight potential problem areas in a system {{so that they can be}} dealt with at the design stage. The toolkit has been used to build model-based expert systems for the analysis of faults in a number of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits.</b> It consists of a library of re-usable objects representing hydraulic, mechanical and electrical components which can be called and linked together at run-time to represent the particular circuit under analysis. This approach obviates the need to re-write the expert system for each new circuit under consideration. A robust expert system for analysing faults in engineering systems should use both heuristic knowledge (empirically derived shallow knowledge) and knowledge of the structure and behaviour of the system (deep knowledge). The second section of this paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of these different types of knowledge. This is followed in the third section by a description of the use of deep knowledge alone to model the components of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits</b> as software objects. The fourth section provides an outline of software development an [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|Hydrostatic shock or {{hydraulic}} shock {{is a term}} which describes the observation that a penetrating projectile can produce remote wounding and incapacitating effects in living targets through a hydraulic effect in their liquid-filled tissues, in addition to local effects in tissue caused by direct impact. Just as force applied by a pump in a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuit</b> is transmitted throughout the circuit because of the near incompressibility of the liquid, so the kinetic energy of a bullet can sometimes send a shock wave through the body, transferring physical shock to tissues whose physiologic function may be disrupted by it (especially in the circulatory or nervous systems). (Other kinds of shock, namely circulatory and psychological, may follow, but mechanical shock is the immediate disruptor.) There is scientific evidence that hydrostatic shock can produce remote neural damage and produce incapacitation more quickly than blood loss effects. In arguments about the differences in stopping power between calibers and between cartridge models, proponents of cartridges that are [...] "light and fast" [...] (such as the 9×19mm Parabellum) versus cartridges that are [...] "slow and heavy" [...] (such as the [...]45 ACP) often refer to this phenomenon.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For the {{limitations}} of the existing hydraulic test bench for experimenting with multi-species of hydraulic components, the additional cartridge valve circuit and multi-way directional valve circuit were designed. The AMESim simulation models of the hydraulic test bench’s basic <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits</b> were established and simulated. Then the simulation results were compared with the experimental data to get some principles of simulation modeling and optimize the models. These principles were used to simulate the additional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits.</b> Through analysis of the simulation results, theory supports were provided to the optimal design of hydraulic test bench. In this way, the existing hydraulic test bench can be fully used and the suitable components were selected, reducing the waste of resources. Besides, the simulation models can be used as part of the virtual hydraulic teaching...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVibrational {{behaviour}} {{of fluid}} power systems {{is a very}} important aspect regarding lifetime of the components and especially noise problems within <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits.</b> Vibration emitting and noise generating elements of primary evidence especially in hydraulic systems are pumps. In completed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits</b> it is often seen that even vibration and noise-optimised pumps show noise problems due to the inter-activeness of all system components built in. Noise problems can be investigated with several vibration and noise measurement methods, which are mostly based on the analysis of the noise relevant frequency spectre of the vibration emitting source and the evaluation of frequencies which are of maximum influence. A precise analysis of the phenomena gives the basis to eliminate {{one or more of the}} dominant noise frequencies with the help of hydraulic silencers...|$|R

40|$|An {{adaptive}} synthesis {{method for}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits</b> is proposed by using case-based reasoning technique {{based on their}} functional structure. Since synthesis of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits</b> is a typical problem of conceptual design and its property is expertise-oriented and combinatorial, {{it is difficult to}} declaratively represent useful design knowledge. In our design method, past design cases are afore-stored in the case base, and then a circuit is generated by arranging suitable past cases which are retrieved from the case base in accordance with the difference related to functional structure. In order to measure such functional structure, design specifications are represented with labels. Design cases are adaptively manipulated into a target design with three synthesis strategies, decomposition, series combination and parallel combination, based on surplus or deficit of labels. Moreover, arranged circuits are verified with a logical simulation method based on symbol manipulation. These synthesis and simulation methods are applied to some design problems in order to show their effectiveness and validity. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>circuits</b> are {{typically}} controlled by throttling valves or variable displacement pump/motors. The first method throttles fluid for a desired pressure output and excess {{energy is lost}} through heat. While variable displacement pumps are more efficient, they are often large and expensive. An alternate method is the switch-mode control of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits</b> through high-speed on-off valves. The proposed on-off valve design makes use of a continuously rotating disc to modulate flow between on and off states; the average power output or pulse duration {{is determined by the}} relative phase shift between the input and output ports. The addition of a directional valve to the the high-speed three-way valve allows any fixed displacement actuator to behave like a virtually variable displacement unit that is capable of four-quadrant control. In this paper a mathematical model focusing on the throttling, compressibility, internal leakage and viscous friction losses is developed and utilized to optimize the valve design for highest efficiency...|$|R
50|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuit</b> is {{a system}} {{comprising}} an interconnected set of discrete components that transport liquid. The purpose of this system may be to control where fluid flows (as in a network of tubes of coolant in a thermodynamic system) or to control fluid pressure (as in hydraulic amplifiers). For example, hydraulic machinery uses hydraulic circuits (in which hydraulic fluid is pushed, under pressure, through hydraulic pumps, pipes, tubes, hoses, hydraulic motors, hydraulic cylinders, and so on) to move heavy loads. The approach of describing a fluid system in terms of discrete components is inspired {{by the success of}} electrical circuit theory. Just as electric circuit theory works when elements are discrete and linear, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuit</b> theory works best when the elements (passive component such as pipes or transmission lines or active components such as power packs or pumps) are discrete and linear. This usually means that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuit</b> analysis works best for long, thin tubes with discrete pumps, as found in chemical process flow systems or microscale devices.|$|E

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the design of a {{hydraulic}} device on which simulations of pressure shocks can be performed. The hydraulic device was constructed to allow simulations of pressure shocks transferred directly in operating conditions because simulation programs for hydraulic accumulators have only theoretical values while simulation on the designed hydraulic device enables obtaining specific readings directly in operating conditions that can be set. At the first control measurement on the hydraulic device, there occurred pressure shocks generated by the hydraulic device itself, these pressure shocks being undesirable in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits.</b> In order to eliminate pressure shocks in the circuit, a diaphragm accumulator was added to the hydraulic device and was used to verify the function of simulating pressure shocks and eliminating undesirable pressure shocks. During the second control measurement on the hydraulic device, a reduction of unwanted pressure shocks was shown with the help of added diaphragm accumulator, thus the function of the hydraulic device to simulate pressure shocks was confirmed, which may also refect practical application in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits</b> of mobile machines...|$|R
