30|$|Status quo bias is an {{important}} factor which affects investors’ decision-making. The extant research on this issue only takes the prospect theory into consideration. In fact, framing effect, investor emotion and information structure are also important variables affecting status quo bias. This paper explores the impact on investors’ status quo bias from the perspectives of framing effect, investor emotion and information structure, using the experimental method. Results show that investors’ status quo bias is higher in the price <b>differential</b> <b>frame</b> than in the ratio frame of the investable portfolio. In addition, investors’ status quo bias does exist in the three emotions conditions. Particularly, status quo bias is lower in the positive emotion investors and higher in the negative emotion. Respondents’ choice of certain options is five times as uncertain options. The level of status quo bias in self-status assignment group is higher than that in external-status assignment group.|$|E

In recent papers, we and colleagues have introduced ways to visualize these two fields: tidal tendex lines (integral curves {{of the three}} eigenvector fields of $E$) and their tendicities (eigenvalues of these eigenvector fields); and the corresponding entities for the frame-drag field: frame-drag vortex lines and their vorticities. These entities fully characterize the vacuum Riemann tensor. In this paper, we compute and depict the tendex and vortex lines, and their tendicities and vorticities, outside the horizons of stationary (Schwarzschild and Kerr) black holes; and we introduce and depict the black holes' horizon tendicity and vorticity (the normal-normal components of $E$ and $B$ on the horizon). For Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, the horizon tendicity {{is proportional to the}} horizon's intrinsic scalar curvature, and the horizon vorticity is proportional to an extrinsic scalar curvature.

At this spin, the tendex lines that stick out from the horizon’s poles switch from reaching radially outward toward infinity to emerging from one pole, swinging poloidally around the hole and descending into the other pole...|$|E

40|$|Strong situations" {{have been}} shown to {{decrease}} behavioral variability, thereby attenuating the criterion-related validity of non-ability individual differences for criteria such as job performance (Barrick&Mount, 1993; Meyer, Dalal,&Bonaccio, 2009). However, {{it has been suggested that}} individuals, based on individual differences in implicit motives, may impute discrepant psychological meaning to social stimuli like situational strength [...] a process sometimes known as <b>differential</b> <b>framing</b> (James&McIntyre, 1996). If different psychological interpretations are attached to strong situation stimuli (e. g., Meyer, Dalal,&Hermida, 2010), an interesting behavioral "double-edged sword" is possible. On the one hand, behaviors pertinent to "primary criteria" (i. e., criteria for which external situational influences and pressures lead to targeted behavioral homogeneity) may occur among those who would not normally engage in them. But, at the same time, behaviors pertinent to "secondary criteria" (i. e., unintended, unforeseen, and potentially reactionary behaviors and/or attitudes) might also increase for some individuals (i. e., those with certain implicit motive characteristics). In other words, high situational strength may simultaneously constrain behavioral variability in primary criteria while serving as a stimulus for <b>differential</b> <b>framing,</b> thereby expanding variability on secondary criteria. The purpose of the present dissertation was twofold: 1) to explore the degree to which situational strength is differentially framed, and 2) to ascertain how the <b>differential</b> <b>framing</b> of situational strength may lead to unintended secondary outcomes. Study 1 findings indicate that, to a partial extent, situational strength is differentially framed by individuals with different implicit motives.

40|$|When one splits spacetime {{into space}} plus time, the Weyl {{curvature}} tensor (vacuum Riemann tensor) gets {{split into two}} spatial, symmetric, and trace-free tensors: (i) the Weyl tensor’s so-called electric part or tidal field Ɛ_(jk), which raises tides on the Earth’s oceans and drives geodesic deviation (the relative acceleration of two freely falling test particles separated by a spatial vector ξ^k is Δa_j=-Ɛ_(jk) ξ^k), and (ii) the Weyl tensor’s so-called magnetic part or (as we call it) frame-drag field B_(jk), which drives <b>differential</b> <b>frame</b> dragging (the precessional angular velocity of a gyroscope {{at the tip of}} ξ^k, as measured using a local inertial frame at the tail of ξ^k, is ΔΩ_j=B_(jk) ξ^k). Being symmetric and trace-free, Ɛ_(jk) and B_(jk) each have three orthogonal eigenvector fields which can be depicted by their integral curves. We call the integral curves of Ɛ_(jk) ’s eigenvectors tidal tendex lines or simply tendex lines, we call each tendex line’s eigenvalue its tendicity, and we give the name tendex to a collection of tendex lines with large tendicity. The analogous quantities for B_(jk) are frame-drag vortex lines or simply vortex lines, their vorticities, and their vortexes. These concepts are powerful tools for visualizing spacetime curvature. We build up physical intuition into them by applying them to a variety of weak-gravity phenomena: a spinning, gravitating point particle, two such particles side-by-side, a plane gravitational wave, a point particle with a dynamical current-quadrupole moment or dynamical mass-quadrupole moment, and a slow-motion binary system made of nonspinning point particles. We show that a rotating current quadrupole has four rotating vortexes that sweep outward and backward like water streams from a rotating sprinkler. As they sweep, the vortexes acquire accompanying tendexes and thereby become outgoing current-quadrupole gravitational waves. We show similarly that a rotating mass quadrupole has four rotating, outward-and-backward sweeping tendexes that acquire accompanying vortexes as they sweep, and become outgoing mass-quadrupole gravitational waves. We show, further, that an oscillating current quadrupole ejects sequences of vortex loops that acquire accompanying tendex loops as they travel, and become current-quadrupole gravitational waves; and similarly for an oscillating mass quadrupole. And we show how a binary’s tendex lines transition, as one moves radially, from those of two static point particles in the deep near zone, to those of a single spherical body in the outer part of the near zone and inner part of the wave zone (where the binary’s mass monopole moment dominates), to those of a rotating quadrupole in the far wave zone (where the quadrupolar gravitational waves dominate). In Paper II we will use these vortex and tendex concepts to gain insight into the quasinormal modes of black holes, and in subsequent papers, by combining these concepts with numerical simulations, we will explore the nonlinear dynamics of curved spacetime around colliding black holes. We have published a brief overview of these applications in R. Owen et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 106 151101 (2011). We expect these vortex and tendex concepts to become powerful tools for general relativity research in a variety of topics...|$|E
40|$|Many {{amorphous}} materials show spatially heterogenous dynamics, {{as different}} regions of the same system relax at different rates. Such a signature, known as Dynamic Heterogeneity, has been crucial to understand the jamming transition in simple model systems and, currently, is considered very promising to characterize more complex fluids of industrial and biological relevance. Unfortunately, measurements of dynamic heterogeneities typically require sophysticated experimental set-ups and are performed by few specialized groups. It is now possible to quantitatively characterize the relaxation process and the emergence of dynamic heterogeneities using a straightforward method, here validated on video microscopy data of hard-sphere colloidal glasses. We call this method Differential Variance Analysis (DVA), since it focuses on the variance of the <b>differential</b> <b>frames,</b> obtained subtracting images at different lag-times. Moreover, direct visualization of dynamic heterogeneities naturally appears in the <b>differential</b> <b>frames,</b> when the lag-time is set to the one corresponding to the maximum dynamic susceptibility.

40|$|Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) is {{a severe}} form of child maltreatment and {{the leading cause}} of death among infants who are victims of abuse. When an infant is forcefully shaken, he/she {{typically}} sustains a unique constellation of injuries that result in high rates of morbidity and mortality. There are approximately 1, 300 reported cases of SBS per year in the United States, but research suggests that the true incidence may be as much as 150 times higher than reported rates. The detection and diagnoses of SBS is often difficult, making efforts toward preventing this form of child maltreatment all the more important. ^ Parent education programs are the most prominent type of SBS prevention activity. There are two evidence-based primary prevention SBS parent education models: the Dias model and The Period of PURPLE Crying. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Dias model and PURPLE model as secondary prevention strategies through an alternative treatment experimental design. The study took place within an intensive home visiting program for first time mothers who screened as being at-risk for child maltreatment. The study used framing theory as the conceptual basis for understanding the <b>differential</b> <b>framing</b> effects of the two models. The models were evaluated for effectiveness across four dependent variables: crying knowledge, SBS knowledge, behavioral responses to infant crying, and sharing information with other caregivers. ^ A total of 126 mothers were enrolled in the study; 92 completed both pre-test and post-test. Outcome data suggest significant improvements in crying knowledge, behavioral responses to infant crying, and sharing information with other caregivers among subjects in the PURPLE model group; subjects in the Dias model group showed no significant improvement on these variables. An unanticipated finding was that both groups showed a high baseline knowledge of SBS. ^ In this first attempt at comparing these two parent education models within a secondary risk group, findings indicate a likelihood that the PURPLE model is the more effective SBS prevention strategy for this population. The study findings show a <b>differential</b> <b>framing</b> effect between the parent education models, making a contribution to the existing literature on framing theory and frame analysis. ...|$|R

The products are formed {{with a wide range}} of kinetic energies, and the mean fractions of the total available energy becoming product translational energy are 0. 25 and 0. 23 for the respective reactions. The CH 2 Cl and CH 2 Br are formed with considerable internal excitation, estimated to correspond, on average, to fractions of the total available energy of 0. 69 and 0. 72, respectively. The scattering dynamics are interpreted with the aid of ab initio calculations of the minimum energy pathways for the two reactions, which exhibit low barriers late on the reaction coordinate...|$|R
40|$|Space {{trajectory}} design always {{requires the}} solution of an optimal control problem {{in order to maximize}} the payload launch-mass ratio while achieving the primary mission goals. A certain level of approximation always characterizes the dynamical models adopted to perform the design process. Furthermore the state identification is usually affected by navigation errors. Thus, after the nominal optimal solution is computed, a control strategy that assures the execution of mission goals in the real scenario must be implemented. In this <b>frame</b> <b>differential</b> algebraic techniques are here proposed as an effective alternative tool to design the guidance law. By using differential algebra the final state dependency on initial conditions, environmental and control parameters is represented by high order Taylor series expansions. The mission constraints can then be solved to high order using a so-called high order partial inversion of the polynomial relationship for every admissible uncertainty. The control strategy is eventually reduced to a simple function evaluation. The performances of the proposed methods are assessed by two examples of space mission trajectory design: a continuous propelled Earth-Mars transfer and an aerocapture maneuver at Mars...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground/Objective: Self-reported health {{depends on}} the {{internal}} frame of reference and on response styles. One way of studying this dependency is using anchoring vignettes. Response shift effects are assumed to induce a negative correlation between self-reported health and the health assessments attributed to the vignettes. Method: A representative sample of the German adult population (N= 2, 409) was selected. Participants {{were asked to rate}} their health state and the health states of two rather complex vignettes representing patients with several health complaints on a 0 - 100 scale. Results: The mean score of self-assessed health was M= 76. 20 (SD= 20. 6). There was a very small positive correlation between the assessment of the vignettes and the self-assessed health state (r=. 12). After controlling for a proxy of objective health, measured in terms of chronic conditions, the relationship remained slightly positive. Chronic conditions were only marginally associated with the assessments of the vignettes (0 conditions: M= 44. 8; ≥ 2 conditions: M= 42. 2). Conclusions: The lack of the postulated association between self-reported health and vignettes’ ratings means that we cannot derive tools to correct the subjective ratings for <b>differential</b> use of <b>frames</b> of reference...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the news}} is {{generally}} understood to be crucial for democracy as it allows citizens to politically participate in an informed manner; yet, one may wonder about the unintended side effects it has for the mental well-being of citizens. With news focusing on the negative and worrisome events in the world, framing that evokes a sense of powerlessness, and lack of entertainment value, this study hypothesizes that news consumption decreases mental well-being via negative hedonic experiences; thereby, we differentiate between hard and soft news. Using a panel survey in combination with latent growth curve modeling (n = 2, 767), we demonstrate that the consumption of hard news television programs has {{a negative effect on}} the development of mental well-being over time. Soft news consumption, by contrast, has a marginally positive impact on the trend in well-being. This {{can be explained by the}} <b>differential</b> topic focus, <b>framing</b> and style of soft news vis-à-vis hard news. Investigating the effects of news consumption on mental well-being provides insight into the impact news exposure has on variables other than the political ones, which definitively are not less societally relevant...|$|R
40|$|How do {{individuals}} {{judge the}} risks and benefits of toxicogenomics, an emerging field of research which is completely unfamiliar to them? The hypothesis is that individuals' perceptions of {{the risks and}} benefits of toxicogenomics are fragile and can by influenced by different issues and context framings as a technology. The researchers expected that the effects on risk and benefit judgements would differ between lay individuals and experts in toxicogenomics. A 2 × 2 × 2 experiment that encompassed three factors was conducted. The first factor, issue framing incorporated the field of application for the technology (therapy vs. diagnosis setting). The second factor, context framing included organisations and institutions that would profit from the technology (companies vs. regulatory agencies) and the third factor encompasses the quality of individuals' level of knowledge, for example lay vs. expert knowledge. Research results suggest the <b>differential</b> power of <b>framing</b> effects. It seems that the clues provided by context frames - but not by issue frames - are able to influence the ways in which lay people and experts process information. The findings are interpreted in the line of the fuzzy trace theory that predicts reliance on fuzzy gist representations formed by stereotypes {{on a wide range of}} judgement problem including risk and benefit perceptions...|$|R
40|$|Fructans are {{multifunctional}} fructose-based {{water soluble}} carbohydrates {{found in all}} biological kingdoms but not in animals. Most {{research has focused on}} plant- and microbial fructans and has received a growing interest because of their practical applications. Nevertheless, the origin of fructan production, the so-called ‘fructan syndrome’, is still unknown. Why fructans only occur in a limited number of plant and microbial species remains unclear. In this review, we provide an overview of plant and microbial fructan research with a focus on fructans as an adaptation to the environment and their role in (a) biotic stress tolerance. The taxonomical and biogeographical distribution of fructans in both kingdoms are discussed and linked (where possible) to environmental factors. Overall, the fructan syndrome may be related to water scarcity and differences in physicochemical properties, for instance water retaining characteristics, at least partially explain why different fructan types with different branching levels are found in different species. While a close correlation between environmental stresses and fructan production is quite clear in plants, this link seems to be missing in microbes. We hypothesize that this can be at least partially explained by <b>differential</b> evolutionary time <b>frames</b> for plants and microbes, combined with potential redundancy effects. status: accepte...|$|R
