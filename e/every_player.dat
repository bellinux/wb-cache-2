5|$|McGary {{was drafted}} 21st overall by the Oklahoma City Thunder. With {{teammates}} Stauskas and Robinson also being drafted, {{it marked the}} first time Michigan had at least three draft picks since the 1990 NBA draft.

The three 2014 {{selections}} (Stauskas, McGary and Robinson) contributed to one of the best Big Ten draft classes in some time; of the seven athletes selected, five were first-round picks. That was the most first-rounders since 1990 and the most overall since 2000, when eight players were selected.|$|E

5|$|A {{squad of}} 16 members, {{built around the}} core of the former Rhodesia team, was hastily {{assembled}} by Liz Dreyer, {{the president of the national}} women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. <b>Every</b> <b>player</b> and official was white. Ann Grant, the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. Anthea Stewart, who had played for South Africa 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. Liz Chase, the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while Arlene Boxall, the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in Sandy Chick and Sonia Robertson.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks back-line {{formation}} {{was also}} {{different from that}} in Britain. They played two five-eighths, a position invented in New Zealand, that refers to the player between the half-back and three-quarters. These two five-eighths gave the All Blacks a defensive advantage. The British press were also surprised to see All Blacks fullback Billy Wallace attacking so often—They had generally viewed the fullback as a defensive position. The All Blacks also thought that <b>every</b> <b>player,</b> whether a back or a forward, should make themselves available to take a pass in support of an attacking player. The teams they encountered had forwards that understood their main role of winning possession for their backs, but would not support them when attacking.|$|E

5|$|Tute in Pairs {{is played}} by four players—two teams of two players each—and <b>every</b> <b>player</b> {{receives}} ten cards (since there are 40 cards, this means {{that all of the}} cards in the deck are dealt).

The four people sit in a circle, with opponent players to the right and left of each player, and players sitting opposite their team members.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Conviction, {{the game}} {{would have no}} {{interactive}} torture sequences. Instead, players could choose whether to kill or incapacitate a target after interrogation. The system was not complex, and {{it was hoped that}} players would choose based on instinct. According to Béland, <b>every</b> <b>player</b> choice is gray and there are no right or wrong choices. However, the game demo has an interactive torture scene in which players can decide how deeply a knife penetrates a person's shoulder. After a mixed-to-negative response, Ubisoft removed the scene from its final product.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1906–07 season, {{the players}} were not paid to play hockey, as the team was abiding by the {{principles}} of amateur sports. Ottawa HC had an advantage in attracting top players to its squad. The players could work for the government, and the work allowed the players {{to play for the}} team. Meanwhile, in the United States, the International Hockey League was paying players. In response to this, the ECAHA, while still having several purely amateur teams, started to allow professional players. The top teams could therefore compete for the top players and the gate attractions that they were. The only restriction was that the status of each and <b>every</b> <b>player</b> had to be publicized.|$|E

50|$|In game theory, an aggregative {{game is a}} game {{in which}} <b>every</b> <b>player’s</b> payoff is a {{function}} of the player’s own strategy and the aggregate of all players’ strategies. The concept was first proposed by Nobel laureate Reinhard Selten in 1970 who considered the case where the aggregate is the sum of the players' strategies.|$|R
5|$|<b>Every</b> <b>player</b> has a {{limit to}} the number of units they can create—a {{population}} limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population capacity, which can be capped at anywhere between 75 – 200 in intervals of 25, is {{based on the number of}} houses, Castles, or Town Centers—the main building in a player's town—which have been built. The Age of Kings introduced two significant new features for unit management: the idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all a player's villagers into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for safety; units garrisoned within these three buildings, especially archers, increase the building's firepower (towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside) including the town center, which cannot fire anything at all without someone garrisoned there.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, women's {{football}} was a niche sport in Germany and was frowned upon. When the DFB appointed Gero Bisanz to coach the newly founded women's national team, he was initially very reluctant about his assignment and feared it would harm his reputation. Winning the 1989 European Championship was the team's first international success, but it had little lasting effect on their popularity. As a gift for the first European trophy, <b>every</b> <b>player</b> received a tea set, which is often cited {{as an example of}} male chauvinism and general lack of interest in the women's national team at that time. This attitude within the German Football Association has changed considerably in the last two decades, in particular during the term of Theo Zwanziger as DFB president, an outspoken supporter of women's football.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 2015, the league's Board {{unanimously}} {{approved of}} several charges for {{players and coaches}} from the Rainmen. The organization {{as a whole was}} fined $20,000 per league rules, head coach Josep Clarós was fined $10,000 and assistant coach Pedro Monteiro was fined $5,000. Both coaches received lifetime bans from the NBL Canada as well. A $5,000 fine was imposed on <b>every</b> <b>player</b> on the team's roster, excluding Douglas Appiah, Jr. who was injured {{at the time of the}} brawl. They were also suspended indefinitely during the investigation. Later on, the league allowed the Rainmen's players to apply for reinstatement into the league, although the coaches remained banned for life. Halifax's fines totaled $90,000. The Rainmen were not notified of their fines and suspensions through e-mail or a phone call. Instead they learned of it through Twitter. Clarós officially received his termination letter on May 5, after his contract had already been renewed for one more month. In an effort to give the players and coaches their final paychecks, he contacted the Canadian labour board. After one month, Clarós won the decision, but Levingston declared bankruptcy on July 6, the following day. According to bankruptcy documents, the Rainmen were about $700,000 in debt.|$|E
