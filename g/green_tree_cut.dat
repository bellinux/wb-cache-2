5000|$|The emerald <b>green</b> snail, <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> snail, or Manus <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> snail, {{scientific}} name Papustyla pulcherrima, sometimes listed as Papuina pulcherrima, is {{a species of}} large, air-breathing tree snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Camaenidae.|$|R
50|$|Despite this {{a flourishing}} illegal trade continues, {{and it became}} {{apparent}} that wildlife breeding farms were serving as conduits to funnel wild-caught <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> pythons out of Indonesia. Investigation in the provinces of Maluku, West Papua and Papua from 2009 to 2011 revealed that 80% of <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> pythons exported were caught in the wild, and estimate of around 5337 individuals a year. Harvesting of wild <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> pythons was heaviest in Biak and neighbouring islands, with resulting population decline.|$|R
50|$|Larger {{than most}} Australian frogs, the Australian <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> frog reaches 10 cm (4 in) {{or more in}} length. Its average {{lifespan}} in captivity, about 16 years, is long compared with most frogs. Docile and well suited to living near human dwellings, Australian <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> frogs are often found on window sills or inside houses, eating insects drawn by the light. The <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> frog screams when it is in danger to scare off its foe, and squeaks when it is touched.|$|R
50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> python (Morelia viridis) is {{a species}} of python native to New Guinea, islands in Indonesia, and Cape York Peninsula in Australia. Described by Hermann Schlegel in 1872, it was known for many years as Chondropython viridis. As its name suggests, it is a bright green snake that can reach 2 metres in length and 1.6 kg in weight, with females {{slightly}} larger and heavier than males. Living generally in <b>trees,</b> the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> python mainly hunts and eats small reptiles and mammals. It is a popular pet and numbers in the wild have suffered with large-scale smuggling of wild-caught <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> pythons in Indonesia. Despite this, the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> python is rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered species.|$|R

50|$|The {{process of}} {{multimodal}} signaling {{is believed to}} help facilitate the courtship process in many species. One such species in which multimodal signaling is seen to improve mating success is in the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> frog (Hyla cinerea). Many anuran amphibians, such as the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> frog, may use visual cues as well as auditory signals to increase their chances of impressing a mate. When the calls of the tree frogs were held equal, {{it was determined that}} females tended to overlook an auditory-only stimulus in favor of males who combined auditory/visual multimodal signal. It was seen that female <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> frogs preferred when males coupled the visual display with the auditory communication, concluding that male <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> that are visually accessible can increase their probability of mating success.|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} online visual {{analytics}} approach to helping users explore and understand hierarchical topic evolution in high-volume text streams. The key idea behind {{this approach is}} to identify representative topics in incoming documents and align them with the existing representative topics that they immediately follow (in time). To this end, we learn a set of streaming <b>tree</b> <b>cuts</b> from topic <b>trees</b> based on user-selected focus nodes. A dynamic Bayesian network model has been developed to derive the <b>tree</b> <b>cuts</b> in the incoming topic trees to balance the fitness of each <b>tree</b> <b>cut</b> and the smoothness between adjacent <b>tree</b> <b>cuts.</b> By connecting the corresponding topics at different times, {{we are able to}} provide an overview of the evolving hierarchical topics. A sedimentation-based visualization has been designed to enable the interactive analysis of streaming text data from global patterns to local details. We evaluated our method on real-world datasets and the results are generally favorable. Comment: IEEE TVCG 201...|$|R

50|$|The {{bank was}} {{involved}} {{with a series of}} secured and unsecured loans. A primary source of losses was the purchase of the servicing rights to manufactured home loans that were originated by <b>Green</b> <b>Tree,</b> a subsidiary of Midwest Federal's. Midwest then subcontracted with <b>Green</b> <b>Tree</b> to service these loans. It is speculative, but it is believed that <b>Green</b> <b>Tree</b> actively solicited the borrowers of the serviced loan portfolio to refinance. The accelerated prepayment of {{a significant portion of the}} servicing portfolio caused the assumptions made about the transaction to not be met and caused a significant loss to Midwest Federal.|$|R
