500|$|The piece {{opened in}} {{conjunction}} with {{the annual meeting of the}} Music Critics Association, guaranteeing what the Houston Chronicle described as a [...] "very discriminating audience". [...] Members of the association also attended meetings with the opera's production team. [...] When Carolann Page, originating Pat Nixon, waved to the audience in character as First Lady, many waved back at her.

500|$|The initial {{running time}} for [...] "The Front" [...] was [...] "way, way short", and the writers {{had to use}} [...] "every trick in the book" [...] to make the episode reach the minimum length. Even after greatly {{expanding}} the original script and adding an extra-long couch gag during the opening sequence, the episode was still one minute too short; [...] "The Adventures of Ned Flanders" [...] was added to address the problem. The segment, which plays {{at the end of}} the episode, was designed purely as filler and had nothing to do with the other events of the episode. Showrunner Mike Reiss later commented, [...] "As always, when we try something bold and new the <b>general</b> <b>reaction</b> is, 'What the hell was that?'" [...] The scene was also an homage to Archie Comics, which sometimes used a similar technique to fill a final page; the font used in the scene's title card is similar to the font used by Archie.

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the first episode was not favourable; in The Independent, Nicholas Barber called it the most depressing TV programme he had ever seen. He wrote of the six main characters, [...] "Are we supposed to care about these people? The theory, I think, {{is that we should}} relate to them, because their lives are as prosaic as our own, and because Cold Feet is a portrait of urban life as it really is in the Nineties. This is another way of saying the writer hasn't bothered with research or imagination." [...] He criticised the conclusion of Episode 1 but praised the other five, which he had seen on preview tapes. On The Late Review, Germaine Greer and Tony Parsons singled out Nesbitt's acting; Greer called him [...] "especially awful" [...] and Parsons wished that he had plunged to his death from the scissor lift Adam appears on {{at the beginning of the}} episode. <b>General</b> <b>reaction</b> improved as the first year went on. At the conclusion of the first series, Andrew Billen compared it with Vanity Fair in the Evening Standard and was pleased that it offered a televisual outlet for the [...] "forgotten" [...] twentysomethings.

Other specialized cycloadditions include multicomponent reactions such as alkyne trimerisation to give aromatic compounds and the -cycloaddition of an alkyne, alkene and carbon monoxide in the Pauson–Khand reaction. Non-carbon reagents also undergo cyclization, e.g. Azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition to give triazoles.

The book, bearing E.A.Poe and Charles Baudelaire's influences but also tinged with the author's newly found religious ideas, became a younger readership's favourite.

In October 1892 Merezhkovsky's lecture [...] "The Causes of the Decline of the Contemporary Russian Literature and the New Trends in it" [...] was first read in public, then {{came out in}} print.
