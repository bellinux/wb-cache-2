40|$|Drain current {{multiplication}} in vertical MOSFETs due to body isolation by {{the drain}} depletion region and gate–gate charge coupling is investigated at pillar thicknesses {{in the range}} of 200 – 10 nm. For pillar thickness > 120 nm depletion isolation does not occur and hence the body contact is found to be completely effective with no multiplication in drain current, whereas for pillar thicknesses < 60 nm depletion isolation occurs for all drain biases and hence the body contact is ineffective. For <b>intermediate</b> <b>pillar</b> thicknesses of 60 – 120 nm, even though depletion isolation is apparent, the body contact is still effective in improving floating body effects and breakdown. At these <b>intermediate</b> <b>pillar</b> thicknesses, a kink is also observed in the output characteristics due to partial depletion isolation. The charging kink and the breakdown behavior are characterized as a function of pillar thickness, and a transition in the transistor behavior is seen at a pillar thickness of 60 nm. For pillar thickness greater than 60 nm, the voltage at which body charging occurs decreases (and the normalized breakdown current increases) with decreasing pillar thickness, whereas for pillar thickness less than 60 nm, the opposite trend is seen. The relative contributions to the drain current of depletion isolation and the inherent gate–gate charge coupling are quantified. For pillar thickness between 120 and 80 nm, the rise in the drain current is found to be mainly due to depletion isolation, whereas for pillar thicknesses < 60 nm, the increase in the drain current is found to be governed by the inherent gate–gate charge coupling...|$|E
40|$|The {{continued}} {{scaling of}} MOSFETs to the deca-nanometre regime {{has reached the}} point where the transistor size is now comparable with the grain size in a polysilicon film (typically 100 - 200 nm). The time is therefore right to research processing techniques that would allow a transistor to be fabricated inside a grain of polysilicon. Such transistors would be expected to have significantly better performance than thin film transistors (TFTs) because grain boundaries would be eliminated from the channel region. The transistor performance might also approach that achievable in single-crystal silicon if good control could be obtained over the quality of the silicon inside the polysilicon grain. The applications for transistor-in-a-grain technology would potentially be enormous, and would include high-performance large area electronics, displays and any technology where low temperature processing was required. In the longer term, this technology may also be attractive for post-scaling CMOS, since it would enable 3 D CMOS technologies to be implemented. Layers of polycrystalline silicon self-assemble during growth and hence the positions of the grains and grain boundaries are random. The key issue in researching transistor-in-a-grain technology is therefore to devise processing techniques that allow the polysilicon grains to be precisely located with respect to the position of the transistor. This thesis investigates grain localization techniques and transistor architectures for transistor-in-grain technology. Two novel methods of low temperature crystallization of amorphous silicon are researched to increase the grain size and controlling the grain boundary locations. One method uses fluorine during metal induced lateral crystallization (MILC) of amorphous silicon. It is shown that fluorine implantation can be used to increase the lateral crystallization width during nickel-induced lateral crystallization of amorphous silicon at 500 °C. The fluorine implant also gives an improved grain texture and a five times lower density of nickel-silicide precipitates in the laterally crystallized silicon. It is unambiguously shown that these effects are due to the suppression of random crystallization at the bottom interface by a chemical effect of fluorine. To devise a lateral crystallization technique that does not introduce metal contamination germanium induced lateral crystallization of amorphous silicon is also studied. A new ?-Si crystallization phenomenon is identified which originates from the perimeter of a germanium layer during a low temperature anneal, giving a uniform lateral crystallization at a significantly lower thermal budget. The effect of amorphous Si thickness and doping on the perimeter crystallization are investigated. The perimeter crystallization is only observed in amorphous silicon films with thicknesses ? 100 nm, and the crystallization width increases with decreasing film thickness and increasing doping level. It is shown that the perimeter crystallization is due to the formation of large grains {{as a result of an}} increased growth rate of pre-existing grains and this is attributed to the strain generated by the thermal expansion of the germanium layer during anneal. Fabrication of single grain transistors in vertical pillars is a promising approach as completely single crystal silicon pillars can be realized by metal-induced crystallization of amorphous silicon. Hence, we simulate the electrical characteristics of very thin pillar vertical MOSFETs at pillar widths compatible with complete pillar crystallization. Floating body effects in vertical MOSFETs due to body isolation by the drain depletion region at the bottom of the pillar are investigated for pillar thicknesses in the range 200 - 10 nm. The transition from partial to fully depleted behavior is simulated and the impact of the body contact during this transition is described. For pillar thickness > 120 nm depletion isolation does not occur and hence the body contact is found to be completely effective, whereas for pillar thicknesses < 60 nm depletion isolation occurs for all drain biases and hence the body contact is ineffective. For <b>intermediate</b> <b>pillar</b> thicknesses of 60 - 120 nm, floating body effects are observed in the output characteristics due to partial depletion isolation. The relative contributions to the drain current of depletion isolation and gate-gate charge coupling are quantified and it is found that depletion isolation has a significant effect on the drain current down to a pillar thickness of 40 nm...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} construction of a bridge across a pond and a local road on the road I/ 35 Bílý Kostel - Hradek nad Nisou. The bridge comprises 5 spans with lenghts of 40, 00 + 3 x 50, 00 + 40, 00 m. Total length of the bridge is 247 m. The substructure of the bridge consists of concrete abutments and four intermediate concrete piers. Abutment foundations are supported on bored piles and <b>intermediate</b> <b>pillars</b> on spread foundations. Two pillar foundations have been constructed on the lake bed which required sheet pile cofferdam. The superstructure was manufactured by sections in a dedicated area and launched using the incremental launching method. The continuous steel-concrete composite superstructure {{was designed as a}} twin steel plate girder with steel bracings and a top flange connected to a composite concrete haunch slab. Plate girders both of which rest upon a set of pot bearings are 2, 5 m high and 7, 0 m apart. The fabrication yard was stationary and located behind the abutment. A lightweight nose was fitted to the cantilever end of the superstructure to reduce the cantilever deformations during launching. The bridge supports were equipped with special teflon sliding bearings and friction was recorded at each jacking operation. Temporary support was incorporated between the abutment and the pier. The reinforced concrete composite haunch slab was cast on travelling formwork primarily at the midspans and subsequently above the piers. The construction was accomplished rapidly without any complications in the difficult access terrain. This proved the chosen steel concrete composite superstructure tangible, especially for the case of segmental launching construction...|$|R
40|$|Since the Industrial Revolution, {{chlorine}} has featured as {{an iconic}} molecule in process chemistry {{even though its}} production by electrolysis of sodium chloride is very energy-intensive. Owing to its high energy and reactivity, chlorine allows the manufacture of chlorinated derivatives in a very easy way: AlCl 3, SnCl 4, TiCl 4, SiCl 4, ZnCl 2, PCl 3, PCl 5, POCl 3, COCl 2, etc. in turn are <b>pillar</b> <b>intermediates</b> {{in the production of}} numerous everyday goods. This kind of chloride chemistry is widely used because the energy is transferred to these intermediates, making further syntheses easy. The environmental and health constraints (toxicity and eco-toxicity, ozone layer depletion) and the growing need for energy (energy efficiency, climate change) force us to take advantage from available knowledge to develop new chemical strategies. Substitution of chlorine in end products in compounds where "chlorine is used in the making" means that we avoid electrolysis as primary energetic source; this makes chemistry "without chlorine" considerably more difficult and illustrates why it has not found favor in the past. The rationale behind this Special Topic issue is to seek useful and industrially relevant examples for alternatives to chlorine in synthesis, so as to facilitate the development of industrially relevant and implementable breakthrough technologies...|$|R
