A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising damp. A <b>French</b> <b>drain</b> was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem. A [...] Ruston & Hornsby 4YHR diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base {{with the aid of}} a mobile crane. After fitting it was then painted.

500|$|Kila Drome was {{originally}} considered too poorly-located {{to be more}} than an emergency strip, because a high ridge [...] {{from one end of the}} runway, restricted air operations. However, the airfield was seldom fogged in, and could often operate when all the other airfields were closed. It was therefore decided to increase the runway to [...] The first coat of bitumen was applied in November 1942, but before the final coat could be applied, heavy rains came and saturated the subgrade. The runway rutted and became more hazardous than ever. The 96th Engineer General Service Regiment dug a ditch along the length of the runway, but this became another aviation safety hazard. The ditch was then filled in with rock to create a <b>French</b> <b>drain.</b>|$|E

50|$|Willow roots spread {{widely and}} are very {{aggressive}} in seeking out moisture; for this reason, they can become problematic when planted in residential areas, where the roots are notorious for clogging <b>French</b> <b>drains,</b> drainage systems, weeping tiles, septic systems, storm drains, and sewer systems, particularly older, tile, concrete, or ceramic pipes. Newer, PVC sewer pipes are much less leaky at the joints, and are therefore less susceptible to problems from willow roots; {{the same is true}} of water supply piping.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{forms of}} <b>French</b> <b>drains</b> were simple ditches, pitched {{from a high}} area to a lower one and filled with gravel. These may have been invented in France but were described and popularised by Henry Flagg French (1813-1885) of Concord, Massachusetts, a lawyer and Assistant US Treasury Secretary, in his 1859 book Farm Drainage. <b>French's</b> own <b>drains</b> were made of sections of ordinary roofing tile laid with a 1/8 in gap left in between the sections to admit water. Later, specialised drain tiles were designed with perforations. To prevent clogging, the gravel size varied from coarse at the center to fine at the outside and was designed based on the gradation of the soil surrounding the drain. The particle sizing was critical to keep the surrounding soil from washing into the voids in the gravel and clogging the drain. The development of geotextiles greatly simplified this procedure.|$|R

50|$|While an {{external}} <b>French</b> <b>drain</b> can operate {{for ten years}} or more {{without the need for}} maintenance, it is prone to clogging without any warning and can eventually lead to a flooded basement. When there is no filter fiber, sediments can make their way through the stone as years pass and clog the drain, and when the filter fabric is present, that can instead clog with sediments. It may be wise to provide cleanouts, much as is done with sanitary sewers, to provide access for inspection with a camera snake. Also, a <b>French</b> <b>drain</b> that is not installed with a sump pump counts on gravity alone to drain foundation water, and if the house is not located on a hill or near a steep incline, finding this slope can be problematic. Additionally, maintenance on {{an external}} <b>French</b> <b>drain</b> involves expensive exterior excavation, which includes removal of walkways, shrubberies, porches, gardens, and anything else along the perimeter.|$|E

40|$|At {{the present}} time the vast {{majority}} of the stormwater generated on the Main Campus of Utah Valley University is exported to Utah Lake, which is only 1. 4 miles from campus. Although there is a large boulder-lined detention pond on campus, it is used only as a holding pond before the stormwater is exported. The objective of this study was to determine what percentage of the average annual stormwater and the stormwater generated by a 100 -year 24 -hour precipitation event could be retained on campus and used for groundwater recharge by constructing a series of <b>French</b> <b>drains.</b> It was determined that the Main Campus could be divided into 33 watersheds that currently export stormwater (72. 8 % of the surface area) and 28 additional self-contained watersheds. Using the NRCS Runoff Curve Method, it was determined that the Main Campus exports 0. 4998 ac•ft of stormwater annually and would export 23. 2969 ac•ft of stormwater following a 100 -year 24 -hour precipitation event, while the self-contained watersheds capture 0. 0330 ac•ft annually and would capture 2. 7913 ac•ft following a 100 -year 24 -hour event. The construction of nine <b>French</b> <b>drains</b> (including subsurface expansion of the existing detention pond with discontinuation of pumping) with a combined surface area of 0. 9260 ac would convert to groundwater recharge 0. 1402 ac•ft annually (28. 1 % of current export) and 6. 2083 ac•ft following a 100 -year 24 -hour precipitation event (26. 6 % of current export). Further reduction of stormwater export could not be accomplished without disruption to current paved areas or other built infrastructure...|$|R

5000|$|Construction aggregate, {{or simply}} [...] "aggregate", {{is a broad}} {{category}} of coarse particulate material used in construction, including sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag, recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world. Aggregates are a component of composite materials such as concrete and asphalt concrete; the aggregate serves as reinforcement to add strength to the overall composite material. Due to the relatively high hydraulic conductivity value as compared to most soils, aggregates are widely used in drainage applications such as foundation and <b>French</b> <b>drains,</b> septic drain fields, retaining wall drains, and road side edge drains. Aggregates are also used as base material under foundations, roads, and railroads. In other words, aggregates are used as a stable foundation or road/rail base with predictable, uniform properties (e.g. to help prevent differential settling under the road or building), or as a low-cost extender that binds with more expensive cement or asphalt to form concrete.|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that improving drainage around walls affected by rising damp can help to reduce the height of rise by reducing the amount of water available to be absorbed into the capillaries of the wall.

50|$|Napoleon {{left behind}} a {{garrison}} of 3,053 men, 5 companies of artillery and a medical unit in Malta and Gozo. The French proceeded to institute a number of policies. They declared the French language to be the official language. Although the French initially tried to win {{the support of the}} Catholic Church, they soon came into conflict with the Maltese Church as they instituted French revolutionary reforms. They abolished papal jurisdiction, authorized civil marriage, expelled all priests, regular clergy and nuns who were not native of Malta, and plundered the churches of gold and silver artifacts and paintings. The plundering of their churches outraged the staunchly pious Maltese. Furthermore, <b>French</b> <b>draining</b> of most of the cash of the Monte di Pietà and the Massa frumentaria precipitated an unprecedented financial crisis. On September 2, 1798 the Maltese rose against the French garrison in Notabile (Città Vecchia or Mdina). Soon both Malta and Gozo were in full rebellion, with the Maltese forming a National Assembly. They dispatched to a petition to Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, their official Suzerain, in Naples, to help them in their struggle against the French occupiers. Though Ferdinand promised much, he did little, having enough of his own troubles to worry much about his loyal Maltese subjects.|$|R
