50|$|In 2003, Pinney’s first monograph, Regarding Emma: Photographs of American Women & Girls, (With a Foreword by Ann Patchett), was {{published}} by The Center for American Places. For nearly twenty years, Melissa Ann Pinney had photographed girls and women, from infancy to old age, to portray how feminine identity is constructed, taught, and communicated. Her work depicted the rites of American womanhood-- a prom, a wedding, a baby shower, a tea party, and the informal passages of girlhood: combing a <b>dolls</b> <b>hair,</b> doing laundry with a mother, smoking a cigarette at a state fair. With each view, we gain {{a greater understanding of}} the connections between mother and daughter, and by extension the larger world of family, friends, and society. Pinneys approach to interpreting girlhood became more complicated and complex when her daughter, Emma, was born in 1995. Emmas childhood evoked in Pinney her own girlhood and gave her work new meaning and purpose. Ultimately, Regarding Emma shares with all of us the incremental and the ritualistic changes that take place in a womans life over time.|$|E

50|$|Teachers {{often use}} materials, {{including}} texts, images or examples that reinforce stereotyped roles. Typical examples given include, {{roles of the}} father (reading the newspaper) and the mother (serving dinner); the doctor (male) and the nurse (female); playing ball (boy) and combing <b>doll’s</b> <b>hair</b> (girl). By doing this, teachers are also promoting gender bias which favors girls as well. For instance, bullying and noise-making for boys and politeness and gentleness for girls. Gender bias does not only favor males over females; it can also {{go the other way}} around. They are both negative when considering a healthy relationship between the teacher and the learner.|$|R

50|$|Badgers {{have been}} trapped commercially for their pelts, {{which have been}} used for centuries to make shaving brushes, a purpose to which it is {{particularly}} suited owing to its high water retention. Virtually all commercially available badger hair now comes from mainland China, though, which has farms for the purpose. The Chinese supply three grades of hair to domestic and foreign brush makers. Village cooperatives are also licensed by the national government to hunt and process badgers to avoid their becoming a crop nuisance in rural northern China. The European badger is also used as trim for some traditional Scottish clothing. The American badger is also used for paintbrushes and as trim for some Native American garments. It has also been occasionally used for <b>doll</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} store chains {{dedicated}} to offering beauty services to girls, toy manufacturers have adapted to the trend by tying it to their doll products. The American Girl line of dolls and books has dedicated stores across the United States, such as Mall of America and American Girl Place in Los Angeles, that include a <b>doll</b> <b>hair</b> salon, a photo studio and party hosting. The Nickelodeon television company's resort in Florida includes a girls' spa. The formula {{is proving to be}} successful globally.

50|$|With the Crissy <b>doll’s</b> <b>hair</b> fully or {{partially}} extended, {{turning a}} knob {{located on the}} doll’s back retracts the hair into the torso to be wound on an internal rod or spindle. The design of the knob and the body mold form a one-way ratchet which along with internal spring tension serves to hold the hair locked and stationary. Pushing and holding in {{a button on the}} doll's abdomen disengages the locking ratchet to allow the hair to be pulled back out of the Doll's Head. From a child’s perspective this ability to “grow” hair was the Crissy doll’s main appeal, as in play, Crissy had the potential to sport various types of hairstyles by adjusting the hair to different lengths and styling the hair appropriately.|$|R

40|$|Prior {{research}} suggests that children younger than age 3 or 4 do not understand that an agent may be deceived by an object’s misleading appearance. The authors asked whether 14. 5 -month-olds would give evidence in a violation-of-expectation task that they understand that agents may form false perceptions. Infants first watched events in which an agent faced a stuffed skunk and a doll with blue pigtails; the agent consistently reached for the doll, suggesting that she preferred it over the skunk. Next, while the agent was absent, the doll was hidden in a plain box, and the skunk was hidden in a box with a tuft of blue hair protruding from under its lid. Infants expected the agent to be misled by the tuft’s resemblance to the <b>doll’s</b> <b>hair</b> and to falsely perceive it as belonging to the doll. These and other results indicate that 14. 5 -month-old infants can already reason about agents’ false perceptions...|$|R
5000|$|.....as {{the members}} {{began to get}} tired of medieval games, and I wasn't, I decided to add fantasy {{elements}} to the mix, such as a dragon that had a fire-breath weapon, a hero that was worth four normal warriors, a wizard who could cast fireballs, had the range and hit diameter of a large catapult, and lightning bolts, had the range and hit area of a cannon, and so forth. I converted a plastic stegosaurus into a pretty fair dragon, as there were no models of them around in those days. A 70 mm Elastolin Viking figure, with <b>doll's</b> <b>hair</b> glued to its head, and a club made from a kitchen match and auto body putty, and painted in shades of blue for skin color made a fearsome giant figure. I haunted the dime stores looking for potential additions and eventually found figures to represent ogres, elementals, etc. The players loved the new game, and soon we had twenty or more players showing up for every session.|$|R

The nose drill bits are used for creating and perfecting the nostrils of the doll. Acetone or a paint thinner medium is needed for removing the factory paint from the <b>doll.</b> <b>Hair</b> is an optional choice to add to a doll. Fine mohair, human hair, or wigs are usually used, but it is found in a variety of types. Rooting tools are utilized for this process and are available in numerous sizes 20,36,38, 40, and 42. The smaller the number the thicker the needle which will grab more hair and leave a bigger hole in the head of the doll. Eyes for a reborn doll are offered in a variety of brands and sizes.|$|R
