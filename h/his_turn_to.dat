5|$|To reach a {{complete}} peace Thurisind had first {{to deal with}} Ildigis who had found hospitality at Thurisind's court. Audoin demanded yet again to have him turned in, and Justinian joined in the request. Thurisind, despite his reluctance to resume the war with both Audoin and Justinian, {{did not want to}} openly breach the rules of hospitality and thus tried to evade the request by demanding in <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> have Ostrogotha given to him; in the end, to avoid both openly giving in {{and at the same time}} renewing the war, both kings murdered their respective guests but kept secret their involvement in the act.|$|E
5|$|They {{climb up}} and {{eventually}} reach a small abandoned house. While there, {{the man is}} attacked by a big cat, which the woman strikes away {{with a piece of}} wood. The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. Deciding that traveling in search of people towards the top of the mountain, where they see a structure, would be a better medical option than heading back home, they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky time lapse behind him. He wakes the woman to take <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they do not find people.|$|E

25|$|The match {{ended with}} Honinbo Shusai winning by two points. However, his victory was {{surrounded}} by controversies. At {{the time of the}} match, the tradition dictated that the player holding white had the right to adjourn the game at any time, and there was no sealing of moves before adjournment. This meant that Shusai, being the nominally stronger player and thus holding white, could adjourn the match whenever it was <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> move and continue deliberating at home before the match resumed. Shusai shamelessly abused this privilege by adjourning the game more than a dozen times, all at <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> play. For instance, on the eighth day of the match, Shusai played first, and Go Seigen replied within two minutes, Shusai then thought {{for three and a half}} hours, only to adjourn the game. It was no secret that Shusai, during adjournments, discussed and studied the game with his students to come up with the best moves. Go Seigen was therefore put into an especially adverse position for having to take on the entire Honinbo establishment.|$|E
25|$|In September 2006, Baldwin {{released}} his book titled The Unusual Suspect, which details highlights from his personal life, career, days of drug abuse, and <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> becoming a born-again Christian after the September 11 attacks in 2001. In the same year, Baldwin, Mario D'Ortenzio and Bobby Brewer founded Breakthrough Ministry, {{which was designed}} to use extreme sports as a ministry via arena tours, called AsSalt Tours. The tours featured extreme sports celebrities, including Christian Hosoi. In 2007, Daniel Southern joined Baldwin as president of his ministry.|$|E

25|$|His {{last summer}} of {{first-class}} cricket was in 1972/73 when he represented Tasmania against Pakistan. The Tasmanians bowled first and Palfreyman went for 41 runs off his seven overs but {{threw the ball}} which ran out Talat Ali. When it was <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> bat, Palfreyman was dismissed by Intikhab Alam for a duck, with the Pakistani finishing with his career best figures of 8-54. After Tasmania followed on, Palfreyman yet again lost his wicket to a spin bowler, this time Nasim-ul-Ghani for one run.|$|E
25|$|Ramtanu Lahiri {{had already}} {{come under the}} {{influence}} of David Hare and Henry Vivian Derozio. Now it was <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> be influenced by Thomas Babington Macaulay. Initially the English had sponsored classical education in India, based on Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit, but as new ideas came from England, it was felt essential to introduce Indians to western education, particularly the sciences. There were strong protagonists on both sides. Indeed, the setting up of Hindu College in 1817 was a big step forward in the direction of western education.|$|E
25|$|Menéndez {{decided in}} <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> attack the French fort, and deprive Ribault of that refuge.

The Spanish attack was brief and successful. Laudonnière escaped with a few companions to a vessel in the river, leaving his command to be slaughtered by Menéndez. The French fort was overrun, and the Spanish flag was raised above it.|$|E

[...] Once sober, Marge reminds Homer of {{his promise to}} spend one Saturday a month with the children. Much to Homer's chagrin, Bart traded <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> choose with Lisa for her dessert, and Lisa suggests that the family go to the traveling Smithsonian Institution exhibit. Homer attempts to punish Bart for giving <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> Lisa by forbidding him to have any dessert, but this backfires when Bart makes another deal to give <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> Lisa in exchange for her dessert again, much to Homer's discomfort. They arrive at the exhibit, which is sponsored by a cell phone company called OmniTouch, has Abraham Lincoln's hat, Fonzie's jacket, Archie Bunker's chair, and the Bill of Rights, which is ruined when Homer reads it with chocolate-covered hands. In an attempt to lick it clean he licks off the section that forbids cruel and unusual punishment. Homer is unable to pay the $10,000 repair bill and so Omnitouch installs a cellular transmitter {{on the roof of}} his house, with the control equipment in Lisa's room. [...] Lisa moves in with Bart, but she is overwhelmed when Bart has made up rules and noises distract her from her homework.|$|E
500|$|Heath had {{a career-high}} 27 home runs during the 1947 season, but the Browns {{finished}} in eighth and last {{place in the}} AL.

Upon the conclusion of the season, [...] Browns management was looking to overhaul the team roster. Browns General Manager Bill DeWitt tried to shop Heath to a National League team rather than leave him in the AL. On 4 December it was announced the Boston Braves of the National League had acquired Heath.|$|E
500|$|Following the Pearl Harbor attack, Littleton {{tried to}} {{volunteer}} in the Coast Guard, the Air Force, and the Marines, but was rejected {{because of his}} poor eyesight.

500|$|The band {{recorded}} the album quickly: early on, averaging almost one song every twenty-four hours. However, tension arose between songwriter Noel Gallagher {{and his younger}} brother, lead singer Liam, when Noel wanted to sing lead vocals on either [...] "Wonderwall" [...] or [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger". The younger Gallagher considered this tantamount to a temporary exile from his own group. The issue dissipated momentarily as Noel was pleased with Liam's vocal take of [...] "Wonderwall". However, tension returned due to Liam's strained attempts to sing the high notes on [...] "Champagne Supernova". When Noel subsequently took <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> record his vocals for [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger", Liam went to a local pub and came back accompanied by a crowd of people, including music journalist John Robb who was producing the band Cable in nearby studio Monnow Valley, Wales whilst recording was still underway. After an altercation with Cable that infuriated his brother, the siblings then began fighting viciously, the session was abandoned and recording was suspended.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, Loxton {{increased}} his primary vote to 45.77% and defeated Pettiona {{for the third}} time, ending with a fairly safe 57.72% after the distribution of preferences. In 1967, the retired cricketer repelled a political challenge by Jack Dyer, an iconic former footballer of the Richmond Tigers famed {{as one of the}} toughest players in history, and retained his seat at further elections in 1970, 1973 and 1976 before opting to retire at the 1979 poll. Without Loxton's personal appeal, the Liberals lost the seat to the ALP upon his departure. As he continued to play first-class cricket for three years after his election to parliament, he was a busy man, and teammates described him as a hard-working representative, recalling that he often brought his political paperwork to the ground with him, going through the material while waiting in the dressing room for <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> bat. Although he was a low-key presence in the parliamentary chambers, Loxton served on the library committee from 1958 to 1961, and he was known for his work ethic and thorough approach, as well as his [...] "sporting charisma".|$|E

500|$|As {{more troops}} were evacuated, more {{were ordered to}} {{withdraw}} from the lines and march to the ferry landing. Wagon wheels were muffled, and men were forbidden to talk. Mifflin's rear guard was tending campfires to deceive the British and convince them that nothing was going on. At 04:00, on August 30, Mifflin was informed that it was his unit's turn to evacuate. Mifflin told the man who had been sent to order him to leave, Major Alexander Scammell, that he must be mistaken, but Scammell insisted that he was not and Mifflin ordered his troops to move out. When Mifflin's troops were within a half mile of the ferry landing, Washington rode up and demanded to know why they were not at their defenses. Edward Hand, who was leading the troops, tried to explain what had happened, but Mifflin arrived shortly. Washington exclaimed [...] "Good God. General Mifflin, I am afraid you have ruined us." [...] Mifflin explained that he had been told that it was <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> evacuate by Scammell; Washington told him it had been a mistake. Mifflin then led his troops back to the outer defenses.|$|E
500|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22. The people {{discussed}} if Cisneros should stay in power and, in the case he was removed from office, which type of government should be established. Saavedra stayed silent for the most part, awaiting <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> speak. The most important speakers were Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, Juan José Castelli, Ruiz Huidobro, Manuel Genaro Villota, Juan José Paso and Juan Nepomuceno de Sola, among others. Saavedra {{was the last one}} to speak, and suggested that the political control should be delegated to the Cabildo until the formation of a governing Junta, in the manner and form that the Cabildo deemed appropriate. In his speech, he pointed out the phrase: [...] "(...) [...] "And there be no doubt that it is the people that confers the authority or command." [...] This statement was in line with the Retroversion of the sovereignty to the people, a political concept formulated by Castelli, stating that {{in the absence of the}} rightful governor the sovereignty returned to the peoples, who had then the power to give it to someone else. Castelli aligned his position with Saavedra's, becoming the common position which was eventually passed with 87 votes.|$|E
500|$|As {{the first}} four matches of the series were drawn, the final Test, played at The Oval, was decisive. Aware that England had beaten Australia only once in 19 matches, the {{selectors}} made several changes to the team; Chapman, at the time fourth in the national batting averages, replaced Carr as captain. This decision was controversial; the press favoured Carr, particularly as Chapman was young, unproven as captain and not fully established in the team. When the match began on 14 August, Chapman won the toss and decided that England should bat first. When it was <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> bat, {{he was given a}} good reception by the crowd. During his innings, Wisden noted, Chapman [...] "hit out in vigorous fashion", but once he was dismissed for 49, the remaining batsmen were out quickly, leaving England with a disappointing total of 280. Australia replied with 302. On a pitch affected by rain, England then scored 436, mainly because of a large partnership between opening batsmen Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe. Australia needed to score 415 to win, which was unlikely given the condition of the pitch. The team were bowled out for 125, and at least one of Chapman's tactical decisions resulted in Australia losing a wicket. Wisden reported that [...] "not a catch was missed nor was a run given away, the whole England side rising gallantly to the occasion. Naturally a scene of tremendous enthusiasm occurred at the end, the crowd swarming in thousands in front of the pavilion, and loudly cheering the players, both English and Australian." [...] The correspondent also commented [...] "Chapman... despite lack of experience in leading a first-class team in the field, turned out a very happy nomination for the post of captain, the young amateur, for the most part, managing his bowling with excellent judgement, and in two or three things he did, showing distinct imagination." [...] Throughout the match, Chapman chose to follow his own tactics rather than rely on the veteran players in the team for advice. In the series, he scored 175 runs at 58.33.|$|E
