5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Sihanouk's {{delicate}} <b>domestic</b> <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> balancing act {{was beginning to}} go awry. In 1966, an agreement was struck between the prince and the Chinese, allowing the presence of large-scale PAVN and Viet Cong troop deployments and logistical bases in the eastern border regions. He had also agreed to allow {{the use of the}} port of Sihanoukville by communist-flagged vessels delivering supplies and material to support the PAVN/Viet Cong military effort in South Vietnam. These concessions made questionable Cambodia's neutrality, which had been guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954.|$|E
5|$|From 1514 to 1529, Thomas Wolsey (1473–1530), a {{cardinal}} {{of the established}} Church, oversaw <b>domestic</b> <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> for the young king from his position as Lord Chancellor. Wolsey centralised the national government and extended {{the jurisdiction of the}} conciliar courts, particularly the Star Chamber. The Star Chamber's overall structure remained unchanged, but Wolsey used it to provide for much-needed reform of the criminal law. The power of the court itself did not outlive Wolsey, however, since no serious administrative reform was undertaken and its role was eventually devolved to the localities. Wolsey helped fill the gap left by Henry's declining participation in government (particularly in comparison to his father) but did so mostly by imposing himself in the King's place. His use of these courts to pursue personal grievances, and particularly to treat delinquents as if mere examples of a whole class worthy of punishment, angered the rich, who were annoyed as well by his enormous wealth and ostentatious living. Following Wolsey's downfall, Henry took full control of his government, although at court numerous complex factions continued to try to ruin and destroy each other.|$|E

25|$|After the Black Death in {{the late}} 14th century, England began to {{dominate}} the European cloth market, with trade reaching a first peak in 1447 when exports reached 60,000 cloths. The Low Countries were one of England's major export markets, particularly Antwerp. The cloth trade was important to Burgundy, {{as well as being}} a major component of the English economy. It was a major act of <b>domestic</b> <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> thus, for Henry VII to issue a trade embargo — reciprocated by Duke Philip IV of Burgundy — as a result of Margaret's meddling, with Henry forcing the Merchant Adventurers, the company which enjoyed the monopoly of the Flemish wool trade, to relocate from Antwerp to the Pale of Calais and ejecting Flemish merchants from England.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, the toponym Kangal and the {{shepherd}} dog {{of the same}} name appear to have their origins in the Turkic people of Eurasia, specifically the Kankalis branch of the Oghuz Turks. This ethnonym of Kankalis —and its variants, Kangars, Kengers, Kanglys, Kanglis, and Kangils— which refers to the various Turkic Tatar tribes leaving Turkestan and settling in Anatolia {{in the latter half of}} the 9th century CE, ultimately came to be associated with the eponymous Kang territory outlined in Byzantine Emperor Konstantinos Porphyrogennetos' influential <b>domestic</b> <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> manual De Administrando Imperio. These settlers built the commune of Kangal in the area where it is located today. The toponym derives directly from the ethnonym, and evidence is available that tribes designated by such names still exist among Turkic populations.|$|E

25|$|In 1871, Bismarck {{was raised}} {{to the rank of}} Fürst (Prince).

He was also promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general, and bought a former hotel in Friedrichsruh near Hamburg, which became an estate. He also continued to serve as his own foreign minister. Because of both the imperial and the Prussian offices that he held, Bismarck had near complete control over <b>domestic</b> <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> The office of Minister President of Prussia was temporarily separated from that of Chancellor in 1873, when Albrecht von Roon was appointed to the former office.

In July 1937, the Industry and Commerce Ministry nominated him as a specialist on the Superior Economic Council. Aside from this party and the PP, he helped finance the mainstream National Peasants' Party and National Liberal Party, as well as the fascist National Christians and the Iron Guard.

25|$|Obama's {{developing}} presidential {{agenda was}} divided into <b>domestic</b> <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> issues. In most cases, this agenda involved addressing crises already underway. His principal strategic decisions concerned how quickly to move bills through Congress. Some of his advisors suggested moving quickly, as Franklin D. Roosevelt did in 1933, under the belief that a more moderate approach would waste valuable time early in his presidency, when his political capital will be strongest. Others suggested moving more slowly, as Bill Clinton did before his attempt to enact a national healthcare program, based {{on the notion that}} rapid change could quickly wear down any bipartisan consensus. He was expected, in any case, to issue a series of executive orders within days of his inauguration, including a reversal of Bush-era executive orders restricting funding to family planning (including abortion) services and stem-cell research. There was also a possibility that a new cabinet level advisory post would be created overseeing the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
