40|$|We {{classify}} rational polynomials in {{two variables}} of simple type whose generic <b>fibres</b> do not <b>form</b> an isotrivial family, thus completing {{the classification of}} all rational polynomials in two variables of simple type. 1. Introduction The classification of polynomial maps f : C 2 ! C is an open problem with extremely rich structure. Various special cases are known. The theorem of Abhyankar-Moh-Suzuki [1, 12] classifies all polynomial maps with one fibre isomorphic to C. In the case that all fibres of a polynomial map have genus zero, we will call such a map a rational polynomial. Kaliman [5] classifies all rational polynomials maps with one fibre isomorphic to C. Kaliman [4] also classifies all polynomial maps whose generic <b>fibres</b> <b>form</b> an isotrivial family which covers earlier work of Miyanishi and Sugie [6] (except for a few non-hyperbolic cases) who classified isotrivial rational polynomial maps of simple type.

Complete frozen {{sections of the}} semitendinosus muscle were used to provide a qualitative and quantitative account {{of the development of}} the primary and secondary generations of muscle fibres. The results showed that the time of formation of primary and secondary fibres, and the numbers of primary <b>fibres</b> <b>formed,</b> were the same in both large and small littermates. The number of secondary <b>fibres</b> <b>formed,</b> however, was lower in the smaller fetuses and resulted in there being a 17 % difference in total fibre number at birth. Primary fibres in small fetuses were smaller, due to the smaller central myofibril-free region. This small size may have restricted the available surface area for secondary fibre formation. Fibre hyperplasia was found to cease between 85 and 95 days' gestation, and so the fibre number difference is likely to be permanent...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to detect the {{localisation}} of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive nerve fibres (THN) and distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase positive mast cells (THMC) in the wall of porcine gallbladder. THN were observed as single <b>fibres,</b> nerve <b>fibres</b> <b>forming</b> perivascular plexuses and nerve fibres grouped within the nerve fascicles. In the gallbladder`s fundus, body and neck, the TH+ <b>fibres</b> <b>formed</b> mucosal, muscular and serosal nonganglionated nerve plexuses. Toluidine blue (TB) staining was used to confirm that the TH positive cells were mast cells. The number of THMC in the propria of gallbladder`s fundus, body and neck was significantly higher than in the muscular and serosal layers in both genders. The number of mast cells in the musculature was higher than in the serosa. The density and location of the THMC were similar to the TB positive (with gamma meta-chromasia) mast cells in both males and females, and statistically significant difference was not established. In conclusion, original data concerning the existence and localisation of catecholaminergic nerves and THMC distribution in the porcine gallbladder’s wall are presented.

40|$|Structural {{changes in}} Purkinje cells have been {{identified}} in the essential tremor cerebellum, although the mechanisms that underlie these changes remain poorly understood. Climbing fibres provide one of the major excitatory inputs to Purkinje cells, and climbing fibre-Purkinje cell connections are essential for normal cerebellar-mediated motor control. The distribution of climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses on Purkinje cell dendrites is dynamically regulated and may be altered in disease states. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the density and distribution of climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses using post-mortem cerebellar tissue of essential tremor cases and controls. Using vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 immunohisto-chemistry, we labelled climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses of 12 essential tremor cases and 13 age-matched controls from the New York Brain Bank. Normally, climbing <b>fibres</b> <b>form</b> synapses mainly on the thick, proximal Purkinje cell dendrites in the inner portion of the molecular layer, whereas parallel <b>fibres</b> <b>form</b> synapses on the thin, distal Purkinje cell spiny branchlets.

40|$|Aligned fibres of {{partially}} stabilised zirconia (PSZ, 4 mol% Y 2 O 3) {{and fully}} stabilised zirconia (FSZ, 8 mol% Y 2 O 3), 3 - 5 mum in diameter, were blow spun from a sol-gel precursor, and then fired {{to give the}} ceramic fibre. Various potential sol precursors were investigated and characterised, the optimum being an aqueous sol made from hydrolysed and peptised zirconium iso-propoxide. The resulting zirconia fibres were characterised and their evolution studied by XRD, DTA/TGA and SEM, and their mechanical properties assessed. It was found that both PSZ and FSZ <b>fibres</b> <b>formed</b> poorly crystalline cubic zirconia at only 200 degreesC, which became fully crystalline after firing to 400 degreesC. The cubic form was the only phase seen in the FSZ fibre, whereas the PSZ <b>fibre</b> <b>formed</b> the tetragonal phase after firing between 1000 and 1200 degreesC/ 3 h, and all fibres were nanocrystalline (grain diameter m). Unusually the monoclinic form of zirconia was never observed in the PSZ fibres.
