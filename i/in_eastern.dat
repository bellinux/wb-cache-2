5|$|Operation Trio {{coincided with}} {{and contributed to}} the {{polarisation}} of the almost exclusively Serb rebels <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> Bosnia into two groups: the Serb-chauvinist Chetniks and the multi-ethnic and communist-led Partisans. Encouraged by Chetnik propaganda against Croats and Bosnian Muslims and repelled by the sectarian left-wing policies and actions of the communists, many Serb peasant fighters were swayed to the Chetnik cause. Violent coups occurred against the communist leadership of {{all but one of the}} Partisan detachments <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> Bosnia, and these detachments effectively defected to the Chetniks. Most of the surviving communist fighters from these detachments rejoined the Partisan forces, and many withdrew with Tito to western Bosnia during the Partisan Long March. Within a few weeks of the end of Operation Trio only 600 Partisan fighters were left <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> Bosnia, comprising the Group of Shock Battalions and the Birač Partisan Detachment. All these forces sought refuge in the Birač region.

For a time they ruled large parts of the region, after making accommodations with the Ustaše regime in May and June 1942.|$|E
