40|$|Abstract. Two Santa Gertrudis cattle from {{a herd of}} 105 aborted {{within a}} 24 -hour period. Bacteroides fragilis was {{isolated}} from tissues of each aborted fetus. Histopathologic lesions included placentitis and bron-chopneumonia in which gram-negative, rod-shaped organisms were visible. The diagnostic workup failed to reveal other causes of abortion. Anaerobes are rarely implicated <b>in</b> bovine <b>abortions,</b> and no other report was found that described <b>abortion</b> <b>in</b> cattle due to B. fragilis. Anaerobes are rarely incriminated as causative agents <b>in</b> <b>abortions</b> <b>in</b> livestock species, perhaps, in part, because an-aerobic culture is not a routine component of abortion di-agnostics. Despite the paucity of literature, anaerobes in-cluding Fusobacterium necrophorum 7 and Fusobacterium nucleatum 6 have been documented as infectious causes of <b>abortion</b> <b>in</b> cattle and sheep. 6 This report describes <b>abortions</b> <b>in</b> two Santa Gertrudis cows with fetal infection by Bacte-roides fragilis. No report was found that documented B. fra-gilis {{as a cause of}} <b>abortion</b> <b>in</b> cattle...|$|R

40|$|Abortion {{laws are}} {{inconsistent}} across {{the states and}} territories meaning Australian women do not have equitable access to lawful abortion. Due {{to the work of}} Australian Sex Party MLC, Fiona Patten, Victoria has recently joined Tasmania in legislating a 150 m safe access zone around abortion facilities. Our policy is to establish uniform abortion laws across Australia that: 	ensure legal and accessible <b>abortion</b> <b>in</b> all states; 	do not require minors to obtain the permission of a parent/guardian for the procedure; 	allow health professionals to conscientiously object to assisting <b>in</b> <b>abortions</b> but require them to refer patients to non-objecting professionals.

It is argued that just as it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation for the guest to protect him from physical harm, it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation of a fetus.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century saw {{improvements}} <b>in</b> <b>abortion</b> technology, {{increasing its}} safety, and reducing its side-effects. Vacuum devices, first {{described by the}} Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson in the 19th century, allowed {{for the development of}} suction-aspiration abortion. The process was improved by the Russian doctor S. G. Bykov in 1927, where the method was used during its period of liberal abortion laws from 1920 to 1936. The technology was also used in China and Japan before being introduced to Britain and the United States in the 1960s. The invention of the Karman cannula, a flexible plastic cannula which replaced earlier metal models in the 1970s, reduced the occurrence of perforation and made suction-aspiration methods possible under local anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Abortifacient {{advertising}} {{was highly}} {{effective in the}} United States, though apparently less so across the Atlantic. Contemporary estimates of mid-19th century abortion rates in the United States suggest between 20% - 25% of all pregnancies in the United States during that era ended <b>in</b> <b>abortion.</b> This era also saw a marked shift in those who were obtaining abortions. Before {{the start of the}} 19th century, most abortions were sought by unmarried women who had become pregnant out of wedlock. But, out of 54 abortion cases published in American medical journals between 1839 and 1880, over half were sought by married women, and of the married women well over 60 percent already had at least one child. In the post-Civil War era, much of the blame was placed on the burgeoning women's rights movement.|$|E

500|$|The {{approach}} to acne treatment underwent significant changes during the twentieth century. Retinoids were introduced {{as a medical}} treatment for acne in 1943. Benzoyl peroxide was first proposed as a treatment in 1958 and has been routinely {{used for this purpose}} since the 1960s. Acne treatment was modified in the 1950s with the introduction of oral tetracycline antibiotics (such as minocycline). These reinforced the idea amongst dermatologists that bacterial growth on the skin {{plays an important role in}} causing acne. Subsequently, in the 1970s tretinoin (original trade name Retin A) was found to be an effective treatment. The [...] development of oral isotretinoin (sold as Accutane and Roaccutane) followed in 1980. After its introduction in the United States it was recognized as a medication highly likely to cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. In the United States, more than 2,000women became pregnant while taking isotretinoin between 1982 and 2003, with most pregnancies ending <b>in</b> <b>abortion</b> or miscarriage.
