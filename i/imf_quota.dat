Even more groundbreaking was the decision to allocate voting rights among governments, not on a one-state one-vote basis, but rather in proportion to quotas.

In May 1980, the Chinese government appealed to adjust its <b>IMF</b> <b>quota</b> upward. With the approval from the board of IMF, the quota of China was increased from 1.2 billion SDR to 1.8 billion SDR. China also obtained a single-country seat in the IMF executive board, which expanded the number of IMF executive directors to 22 members. At present, the quota of China in the IMF is 30.5 billions of SDR, and it takes 6.09% of the total vote.|$|E
5000|$|As of August 2007, 78 low-income {{countries}} {{are eligible for}} PRGF assistance.Eligibility is based principally on the IMF's assessment of a country's per capita income, drawing on the cutoff point for eligibility to World Bank concessional lending (currently, 2005 per capita gross national income of $1,025).Loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent, with repayments made semiannually, beginning 5½ years and ending 10 years after the disbursement. A country may normally borrow up {{to a maximum of}} 140 percent of its <b>IMF</b> <b>quota</b> under a three-year arrangement, although this may be increased to 185 percent of quota in exceptional circumstances.

The expected average access under the initial three-year arrangement is 90 percent of quota, and 65, 55, 45, 35, and 25 percent of quota for second through sixth-time users of the facility, respectively. [...] "Low-access" [...] PRGF arrangements with a standard level of 10 percent of quota may be used for members with little or no immediate balance of payments need.

40|$|The current {{allocation}} {{of decision making}} in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), determined largely by the distribution of members' quotas, has failed {{to keep up with}} the changing world economy. The situation undermines the Fund's relevance and legitimacy in promoting global growth and economic and financial stability. A new simplified and transparent formula to guide the distribution of Fund quotas is key to IMF reform. The authors offer four recommendations to advance <b>IMF</b> <b>quota</b> reform: (1) The IMF executive board should complete its work on the new <b>IMF</b> <b>quota</b> formula by the 2007 annual meeting [...] rather than spring 2008 [...] to ensure that the other necessary elements of a reform package can be completed by spring 2008 and ratified by the IMF governors at their annual meeting in fall 2008. (2) The new quota formula should follow the recommendations of the quota formula review group (QFRG), deleting an "openness" measure from the formula. The openness variable has no economic or financial justification, and the traditional measures are biased. (3) The traditional industrial countries should agree to a target of limiting their quota shares to 60 percent of their GDP shares to facilitate the further redistribution of quota shares toward the nonindustrial countries. (4) A reasonable benchmark would be an increase in the size of the Fund (total quotas) by at least 50 percent to implement the redistribution of quota and voting shares under the new quota formula. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Increasing <b>IMF</b> <b>quotas</b> (or {{changing}} their distribution) requires {{the approval of}} the United States, which maintains enough votes at the IMF to block such decisions.

In this paper, I analyze congressional votes on legislation to increase the U. S. quota subscription to the IMF. I argue that legislators are more likely to support a quota increase (1) the more “liberal ” their ideology, (2) the larger the share of high-skilled “pro-globalization ” voters residing in their districts, and (3) the larger the share of campaign contributions they get from banks that specialize in international lending.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{argues that}} the perennial negotiations on adjustments {{of the law of}} the WTO (e. g. by means of the Doha Round negotiations) and of UN law (e. g. adjustments of the <b>IMF</b> <b>quota</b> and voting system, UN climate change regulations) reflect systemic problems of multilevel governance of international public goods (PGs) that call for reviewing traditional regulatory approaches at national and international levels of governance (as discussed in Sections II and III) so as to better respond to the 'collective action problems' of multilevel governance of international PGs (as discussed in Section IV). The concluding Section V draws policy lessons from the WTO agreements adopted at the WTO Ministerial Conference at Bali. Rather than lamenting about 'fragmentation' of UN and WTO law, bilateral, regional and other plurilateral agreements can be justified as necessary instruments for reforming international law for the benefit of citizens; the 'consistent interpretation'-and 'judicial comity'-requirements of national and international legal systems call for interpreting such agreements in conformity with the UN and WTO legal obligations of contracting parties as integral parts of multilevel governance of 'aggregate PGs' demanded by citizens...|$|E
40|$|The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is {{undergoing}} profound changes, {{not only in}} its policies, but also in its internal governance. These changes reflect the structural developments in the global economy, {{and in particular the}} growing role of emerging economies that demand a greater say at the Fund. In addition, the Fund has recognised that it needs to strengthen the voice of developing economies in order to increase ownership of IMF programmes and policy recommendations from this very large country group. At the heart of IMF governance lies the distribution of its quota: quotas are the percent share at the IMF that are attributed to the various members. Quotas {{play a central role in}} the Fund, because they determine not only member countries 2 ̆ 019 financial contributions, but also their rights to draw on IMF financial support and their voting rights within the institution. Therefore, quotas are essentially a matter of representation, visibility, and influence of countries at the IMF. Quotas are being calculated as a function of various economic variables and also include a certain degree of judgement. This paper provides a systematic analysis of the way <b>IMF</b> <b>quota</b> have been calculated in the past and of the current challenges of reform.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} most recent issues in the ongoing debate on the reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Fund has {{recognized}} that IMF surveillance should put greater weight on analyzing and discussing global economic issues. By taking account of international spillovers, surveillance should in future be multilateral rather than purely country-specific. Exchange rates and policies should also {{be the focus of}} renewed interest. Moreover, {{there is no doubt that}} <b>IMF</b> <b>quotas</b> will have to be adjusted to take account of the changing economic weight of many IMF member countries in the world economy. Negotiations on a new quota formula started after the Annual Meeting in Singapore in September 2006. The influence of low income countries should be strengthened by increasing the number of basic votes in order to prevent the Fund from loosing legitimacy. However, with the IMF’s intention to put more weight on GDP in the new quota formula, the stage is set for complex, difficult and time-consuming negotiations. Finally, the IMF will need to reform its financing system and budgeting procedures to ensure that expenditures will be adequately curtailed to enable it to work efficiently despite income shortfalls, which might well be not transitory but of a permanent nature.

40|$|The {{world is}} changing, moving towards multi-polarity. However, despite the {{explicit}} shifting {{of the center}} of economic gravity from the West to the East, the dominance of the West in establishing the rules of conduct in the global economy and global finance remain virtually immutable. The author argues that the widely-discussed reform of the <b>IMF</b> <b>quota</b> and governance has not led to a significant strengthening {{of the role of the}} most dynamically developing emerging economies in the Fund’s decision-making. Regional economic players (such as the BRICS) have been actively involved in the international division of labor. However, the existence of institutional financial monopolies hinders the redistribution of global value added. Armed with the advanced information technologies and financial innovations, the leaders of financial globalization are redirecting scarce global resources in favor of the world-systemic core. The study is based on comparative methods and system analysis and aims to provide a comprehensive view on the way of involvement of global financial institutions in the control of the processes of financial globalization. US dominance in international financial institutions contribute to the further advancement of the global role of dollar as reserve currency of central banks, the currency of international settlements, deposits, loans and investments. It’s shown that the implementation of financial globalization is strongly correlated with the concept of the «center-periphery» model, on which the functioning of the global capital market is dependent. The features of the modern structure of the global currency market are summarized. The article reveals some legal aspects of global governance, in particular the role of the Anglo-American law in the global economy and global finance. It is concluded that for full participation of emerging markets, particularly the BRICS countries, in the processes of globalization, it is necessary to create a parallel financial system, aimed at the development of the real sector of the economy, which would be independent of the rules that have been established within existing system of international financial institutions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} the {{relationship}} between the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since the PRC regained its IMF membership in 1980. It initially analyzes the China-IMF relationship with socialization theoretical framework, attempting to explore how the IMF has socialized China into accepting neoliberal international economic norms. The research borrows Alastair Johnston’s ‘microprocesses’ of socialization to assess the processes of IMF socialization via financial assistance, technical assistance, and surveillance and policy advice for China. The research shows socialization has taken place to a moderate degree, as IMF programs have had some impacts on China’s domestic economic and financial liberalization. Yet no evidence shows the IMF has convinced China to fully redefine its economic principles and norms. Socialization turns out to be an inadequate analytical approach to analyzing the China-IMF relationship in the long run. The research continues with a supplementary theoretical framework: principal-agent theory. Principal-agent theory overcomes some of the technical deficiencies in socialization theory, and helps us understand more thoroughly China’s role in the IMF and the governance of international financial economy in general in the long run. China is regarded as the principal, and the IMF as China’s international organization agent. Driven by its objective of acquiring a larger influence in the governance of international financial economy, China delegates several tasks to the IMF so that the Fund can accomplish these tasks more efficiently than if China took other cooperative or unilateral approaches. China-IMF interactions are assessed following a four-stage analytical approach based upon the key concepts of principal-agent theory. China’s and the IMF’s institutional features and functions are examined as important factors of the China-IMF relationship. They include China’s preferences regarding IMF operation, China’s role in IMF governance, and China’s impact among IMF staff. Based on this examination, the consequences of China’s delegation of tasks to the IMF are assessed. This dissertation indicates that the IMF plays a limited role in assisting China to access larger influence in the governance of international financial economy, because of the IMF’s westerndominated staffing rules, unbalanced governance structure, preference deviation from China, inadequate resources, and China’s incapability to facilitate strict controls on the IMF. The thesis contributes to the so far thin literature on the China-IMF relationship with selected case studies such as IMF Article IV Consultation for China, China’s role in <b>IMF</b> <b>quota</b> and voting share reforms, IMF staff with Chinese nationality, and so on. The research provides a model for analyzing the relationship between China and international organizations with a combination of socialization and principal-agent theoretical frameworks. Last but not least, it extends the research subject of principal-agent theory in international organization Studies to include an emerging market economy state as the principal, which correctly implies the increasing influence of emerging market economies in the governance of international political economy...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21 st century the International Monetary Fund (IMF) faced crises of legitimacy, relevance, and {{budgetary}} finance. It now confronts what likely will be the worst global recession since World War II, potentially huge demands for its financial assistance with limited resources, and calls for it to play a more central role in the international financial and regulatory systems. At the same time, the incoming Barack Obama administration must decide what to do about the modest package of IMF reforms that was completed in the spring of 2008. The package requires US congressional approval to go into effect. This paper reviews the recent, slow progress on IMF reform and makes recommendations to the Obama administration against the background of that record, the emerging global recession, and continuing financial turmoil. I recommend that the IMF package be reopened to include a doubling of <b>IMF</b> <b>quotas</b> and an amendment that will permit the Fund to swap special drawing rights (SDR) with major central banks to finance its short-term lending facility. I also recommend a special allocation of 50 billion SDR.

40|$|The special {{drawing rights}} (SDRs) [...] the International Monetary Fund's unit of account [...] could emerge as a rival to the US dollar as an {{international}} reserve currency. Williamson questions the assertion of Cato Institute's Swaminathan Aiyar that the SDR is not a currency and can never be one and {{the relevance of the}} fact that the IMF has no GDP and no taxing capacity and so lacks the fundamental requirements for creating a currency. It is true that only central banks accept SDRs in settlement of debts. But to the extent that they are so accepted, Williamson argues, they are money and could play a far more central role in the international monetary system than they have so far. Large SDR allocations could be a mechanism to ensure consistency in balance of payments objectives sought by countries around the world, one that ensures a much fairer distribution of gains from seigniorage [...] profit that accrues to whoever issues money. In the case of the SDRs, the IMF would be the issuer, and the seigniorage gains would be distributed in proportion to <b>IMF</b> <b>quotas,</b> which determine the proportion of allocations. For most countries, there is a clear advantage in boosting the role of the SDR and achieving a portion of the seigniorage gains. The interests of major reserve-currency countries, like the United States and potentially China, in displacing the dollar's reserve role can be disputed, but these countries too would benefit from an enhanced role of the SDR, depending on the evaluation of advantages and disadvantages. ...|$|R

Finally, some insist that international colleges of regulators are not enough-that it is desirable to create a World Financial Organization (WFO) with the power to sanction members whose national regulatory policies are not up to international standards. A WFO will similarly need staff support, of which the IMF would be one possible source. All this of course presupposes meaningful IMF governance reform so that the institution has the legitimacy and efficiency to assume these additional responsibilities.

40|$|December of 2008 {{marks the}} 30 th {{year of the}} {{beginning}} of China's economic opening. The country's rapid development since 1978 is without historical precedent. Yet this growth is even more impressive when one surveys the entire period from the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 to present. Although the years from 1949 to 1978 were close to catastrophic, and the basis for economic development over the next thirty years could have hardly been worse, on the 60 th anniversary of the government's founding, the country's achievements - at least from an economic perspective - must be viewed as an extraordinary success. On the 30 th anniversary of China's economic opening, the following article assesses that which has been achieved to date. It also explores the causes of the economic stagnation of the "lost decades" between 1949 and 1978. The deep stagnation experienced {{during the early years of}} the People's Republic as well as China's reorientation in 1978 and subsequent boom can only be understood with reference to this historical period. Any assessment of the country's present-day political and economic situation is also contingent upon an appreciation of the long cycles that characterize Chinese history. Since the opening of the country and its rise to the world's second-largest economy and trading partner, China has surpassed Japan and taken on equal standing with the EU as the most significant decision maker in economic and political affairs after the US. China's importance is not yet reflected in World Bank and <b>IMF</b> <b>quotas</b> or in the composition of the G 8 -yet China is sure to take on an increasingly prominent role in coming years. If China can maintain the growth rates witnessed over the past three decades, in less than 15 years it will surpass the US as the world's largest economy and most significant trading partner. While the future is by no means preordained, all of the preconditions for this to occur are in place. China still possesses large labor reserves; is a net creditor to the rest of the world and holds currency reserves of a historically unprecedented volume; will soon be the largest and most dynamic domestic market in the world (and will therefore continue to attract direct foreign investment); and displays considerable potential for growth in domestic demand. Furthermore, the reform of China's financial sector and the deregulation of capital flows could potentially stoke additional economic expansion. The current financial crisis has not left China unscathed, but is unlikely to have a lasting effect on the country's long-term development. China, Communism, Market Economy, Gradualism...|$|R
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{consequences}} of a hypothetical consolidated EU representation at the IMF, we regroup the 27 EU Member States into a euro area EU constituency and a non-euro area EU constituency (based on the <b>IMF’s</b> new <b>quota</b> formula) and calculate voting power measures as proposed by Penrose-Banzhaf (PBI) and Shapley-Shubik (SSI). For theoretical reasons and reasons of empirical plausibility, we favor the results based on the SSI. Concerning the Executive Board, our results confirm the PBI-based evidence in the literature, as we find that the two large constituencies (U. S. A and euro area) would have more voting power than their voting shares indicate. Above majority thresholds of 67 %, the PBI and SSI results become increasingly divergent, with the difference being most pronounced at the majority threshold of 85 %, at which the PBI has already plunged dramatically whereas the SSI remains more or less constant. Concerning the Board of Governors, we find that voting power depends on both EU-related decision rules and the power measure used. If decision-making within the group is based on EU Council votes, smaller EU Member States tend to gain voting power and would hence have an incentive to push EU consolidation. By contrast, most of the larger EU Member States tend to lose voting power and might consequently be inclined to retain the status quo. However, above all by bundling individual euro area concerns, a consolidated euro area representation would act as a booster for the euro area as a whole. IMF, EU, voting power analysis...|$|R
40|$|Food {{security}} is important side of national security. Generally, the food security based on three aspect, that is availability of food, society acces to food, {{and stability of}} food price. In Indonesia, rice is strategies commodity {{because it is not}} just economic problem, but it has relevance with social and political problem. Consideration of importance of rice, Indonesia government always try to carry out many policy of food to increase stability of national food. But economic crisis which experienced Indonesia in 1997 cause there are big change in Indonesia food policy. Indonesia government need big financial in handle economic problem, so that IMF (International Monetary Fund) came to Indonesia to give debt with some rules and regulations to Indonesia government which listed in Letter of Intent (LoI). Then, handling of LoI more large and IMF force their importance with relevance foreign debt with some issues, entire of food sectoral. Food security in Indonesia are weak because government make liberazation to market domestic rice. Because there are some negative effect which be emerged from IMF programs, entire food security, in the last of August 2003 Indonesia government decide to finish cooperation with IMF and enter in PPM (Post Program Monitoring) era. PPM era is paying by instalment of debt remains to <b>IMF</b> until <b>quota</b> boundary of 100 percent maximal 7 years. Finally in the year of 2006 Indonesia government paying the rest of debt until boundary of quota, so indirectly have finished PPM era in Indonesia. The method in this research is descriptive analytic. The study result that although Indonesia have paying debt to IMF, but after IMF Indonesia government have create new foreign debt, especially to World Bank and ADB (Asian Development Bank). The foreign debt after IMF then give influence to Indonesia food security, which there are continue food liberazation in Indonesia by moving of foreign debt in Indonesia from IMF to World Bank and ADB. Rules and regulation which be proposed by World Bank and ADB are similar with IMF before. The rules and regulation for example continue privatization target, selling to country assets, reduce of aim to public sector, and erase of impor bea to farmers...|$|R
40|$|International {{financial}} {{standard setting}} process has almost always sprung from real-politik. Now, {{the world is}} witnessing a shift of economic power and thereby political influence from traditional western ‘empires’ towards the emerging economies clustering around Asia and in Latin America. The most important variable at work in this transition is ‘capital’. The power mechanics at work during the classical and neo-classical era were military manifestations of power but now this base on economic might which has shifted to and rests with the emerging markets, led by China. This is a great paradox that liberal flows of capital, trade, currency which came {{as the result of}} western powers’ national interest choices have in fact brought this paradigm shift in economic power and political influence from west to the East. Under the system of Gold Standards and later under the Bretton Woods system, it was predominantly European powers that kept controlled movement of capital across jurisdictions. After Bretton woods especially as the cold war era ended, market capitalism and de-regulation of the international financial markets became the prevalent economic philosophy and financial liberalization {{turned out to be a}} slogan for decades to come. The gaps and lacunas in the trade and monetary policies pursued by the western capitalist countries and repercussions those policies brought, highlighted distortions that were threatening developed economies themselves. Imbalances were increasing in trade, in saving ratios, in reserves, in capital accumulations between the Asian production hubs and the western consumption cauldrons. The FSF was established as the crisis hit Russia and the US (in a limited sense as crisis hit LTCM), yet the prime causes of instability were almost conveniently bypassed. The 2008 crisis however, has established beyond doubt that market forces, market capitalism and the dominance of only G- 5 over the standard setting-and-adoption process is not sufficient to ensure stability of global financial system and thereby economic development and growth. It is true that with the beginning of the 21 st century regulatory standards-setting-bodies (SSB) - on realizing significance of emerging economies - started to enlarge their memberships. The process, however, was adopted only sparingly and at much slower pace than the speed at which emerging economies were asserting their influence in the globalised financial markets. Interestingly most of the popular literature on the 2008 crisis termed it as “Global Financial Crisis”, because the west (US and Europe) equivocates to globe in terms of its economic might and influence and therefore, the literature called it ‘global’ crisis. Secondly, the fact that it is the ‘rest of the world’ (i. e. the periphery states) which have never been made part of the decision-making process as far as the formation of global standards has been concerned. It was the first time that these emerging economies were taken into consideration, naturally, the pace of this amalgamation and absorption had to be slow and only sparing at its best. The establishment of the FSB and its enlarged membership was a mega step forward in the direction. The <b>IMF</b> governance reform, <b>quota</b> re-allocations are also part of the same move to enhance legitimacy, broader representation and accountability of the financial architecture. Tim Geithner called the ‘FSB as the fourth pillar’ of the financial standards setting process. Other regulatory bodies including IOSCO, IAIS, BCBS, Joint Forum are in expansion process albeit gradually and slowly. The theme of this paper is to analyse this transition. This article is going to highlight issues which demand special attention in the international financial standard setting process and demand accountability and legitimacy of these rule-making bodies. However, the critical factor is to identify the mechanism i. e. how to accommodate and incorporate changed priorities almost for the first time in the history of financial markets. Merely enlarging upon the membership numbers of some regulatory bodies would not mean imparting enhanced legitimacy. There are as many issues as changing and formalizing the role of the IMF, the status of US dollar as the global reserve currency, the regional initiatives and collaborations particularly that happened during the early years of the 21 st century including but not limited to European Stability Mechanism treaty, or on the Asian side, proposals for an AMF (Asian Monetary Fund), or Chiang Mai Initiative (CMIM). These regional initiatives like the AMF in fact represent a practical manifestation of the resentment against the ‘imperialistic’ IMF policies, not to forget, protests in Greece and Ireland and Spain against austerity measures followed in consequence to IMF’s recent bail-outs. This article follows a historic-cum-analytical approach and shall assess lessons from the decade of financial disruptions in Latin America and Asia during the late 1990 ’s and shall compare recent steps taken by various regulatory forums focussing particularly on the FSB. The issues include enhanced membership, more representation, and vigilant compliance under ROSCs, FSAPs, and the Peer Review initiatives under the IMF. Again the ‘key’ shall be “enhanced cooperation” and “faith on the government’s commitment to a policy” that shall derive the process of standard setting in the international financial regulatory architecture...|$|R
