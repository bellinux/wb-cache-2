5|$|As Petty gets {{further into}} his investigation, Rost's answers become more evasive.

It is not clear at the film's end whether Rost's films are actual snuff in the fictional subplot's context. However, {{it is known that}} he spies on them <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time before asking them to participate.|$|E

5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when the lung is inflamed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|Clarke {{composed}} no {{large scale}} {{works such as}} symphonies. Her total output of compositions comprises 52 songs, 11 choral works, 21 chamber pieces, the Piano Trio, and the Viola Sonata. Her work was all but forgotten <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, but interest in it was revived in 1976 following a radio broadcast in celebration of her ninetieth birthday. Over half of Clarke's compositions remain unpublished and in the personal possession of her heirs, along with most of her writings. However, in the early 2000s more of her works were printed and recorded. Examples of recent publications include two string quartets and Morpheus, published in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Gifu's {{first major}} {{industry}} was textiles. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time it rivaled Tokyo and Osaka {{as a leader}} of the Japanese fashion industry. The area just north of JR Gifu Station contains a variety of small clothing stores catering to many types of consumers. Furthermore, the city's main downtown covered shopping arcade, Yanagase, features many clothing, shoe, and accessory shops that carry both domestic and overseas goods. Over the past decade, though, as Gifu's fashion industry has declined steeply, the city has begun developing other industries to support the local economy.|$|E

5|$|Appointed vice-captain for {{the tour}} of Pakistan and New Zealand that winter, Boycott assumed the {{captaincy}} in 1978 for two Tests when Mike Brearley was injured, and brought with him his successful summer form. However, he was replaced upon Brearley's return. While {{the rest of the}} England team took part in warm-up matches, Boycott remained in Lahore and organised a special warm up match where the team would play itself. However he went on to occupy the crease <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, limiting the amount of time other players had to practice. He later stated that, as the number one batsman, he should have the most time in the middle. In the second Test match, he scored 79 and 100 not out, increasing his statistics since his return to the England team to 684 runs at 136.80. It was between this match and the third Test that Brearley broke his arm, giving Boycott the captaincy. Boycott led England to a draw in the third match, his leadership meeting mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|Cobain and Novoselic {{met while}} {{attending}} Aberdeen High, although they never connected, according to Cobain. The pair eventually became friends while frequenting the practice {{space of the}} Melvins. Cobain wanted to form a band with Novoselic, but Novoselic did not respond <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. In persuading Novoselic to form a band, Cobain gave him a demo tape of his project Fecal Matter. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that he had finally listened to the Fecal Matter demo and suggested they start a group. The pair recruited Bob McFadden on drums, but after a month the project fell apart. In early 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard. The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape but started writing new material soon after forming.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the capture}} of Sattelberg, the 2/48th {{continued}} the advance north {{along with the rest}} of the 26th Brigade, pushing on over difficult terrain to Wareo, where they arrived on 8 December. Following this, the Japanese began to fall back to Sio in retreat and the battalion's involvement in combat operations on the peninsula came to an end as troops from the 5th Division arrived to relieve them. In January, the battalion camped around the Dallman River before being withdrawn back to Finschhafen, camping around the Song River. In February 1944, the 2/48th was withdrawn back to Australia along with the 9th Division. Sailing aboard an American Liberty ship, the battalion landed in Brisbane on 20 February, and made camp at Kalinga before personnel marched out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> home leave. During its time in New Guinea, the battalion had suffered 125 casualties, of which 36 were killed, three died of wounds, eight died of illness and 77 were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Katrina {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico and was heading towards Louisiana. For precaution, Six Flags closed down the New Orleans theme park during mid-season {{to prepare for}} the storm. Due to {{substantial}} flooding, many of the park's rides were damaged beyond repair causing the park to remain closed until the floods retrieved. Many of the park rides were destroyed as the park's drainage system failed and were submerged in water <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, long after the hurricane. Anything found in the park still in good use was removed and moved to other parks in the company as Six Flags had no plans on reopening the theme park. Batman: The Ride survived, mainly because of its elevated station and corrosion-resistant support structure, which caused it to make it through Hurricane Katrina relatively unscathed.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Swiss {{physician}} René Flammer {{discovered an}} antigen within the mushroom that stimulates an autoimmune reaction causing the body's immune cells to consider its own {{red blood cells}} as foreign and attack them. Despite this, {{it was not until}} 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating P.involutus, and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998. The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of Paxillus mushrooms. Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, sometimes for many years, and has shown mild gastrointestinal symptoms on previous occasions. The Paxillus syndrome is better classed as a hypersensitivity reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is caused not by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom. The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the blood serum. In the course of subsequent meals, antigen-antibody complexes are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their breakdown.|$|E
5|$|Itte Detenamo participated on Nauru's behalf in the men's (105 kilogram) super-heavyweight weightlifting contest. He was the {{youngest}} person to represent Nauru at the London Games {{at the age of}} 25 and had participated for his country in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Detenamo qualified for the Games based on his performance at the 2012 Oceania Weightlifting Championships in Apia, Samoa. His event took place on 7 August, and included 19 athletes in total. During the event's snatch phase, Detenamo was given three attempts. He successfully attempted to lift over 90 kilograms of weight in all three of his attempts. He then attempted 205 kilograms during the clean and jerk phase of the event, successfully lifting it on his first attempt. He did not succeed in lifting 215 kilograms on his second attempt, but was successful with 225 on his third. Overall the combination of Detenamo's highest scores in snatch (175) and clean and jerk (215) yielded a score of 390 points. He finished 14th in the event, ahead of Christian López of Guatemala (387 points) and behind Japan's Kazuomi Ota (400 points). Detenamo was 65 points behind the gold medallist Behdad Salimi of Iran. After the Games his coach Paul Coffa revealed Detenamo was carrying a minor shoulder injury and had been keen to perform well because of the athlete being away from Nauru <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|E

5|$|Upfront, the No. 5 Toyota {{increased}} its lead over the No. 8 Audi to 38.778 seconds, {{while the first}} Audi moved into 12th position. The No. 1 Porsche returned to the pit lane {{for a change of}} front axel and fell down the order in LMP1 because of different tyre speeds of the vehicle's front wheels. G-Drive's No. 38 entry was issued with a two-minute stop-and-go penalty for its role in the collision with the No. 95 Aston Martin. Fässler nearly placed Davidson into the grass at Stavelot while lapping Extreme Speed Motorsports's Ligier. Fässler entered the pit lane for replacement front bodywork. Gulf's Porsche entry spun after contact with Emmanuel Collard's Ferrari at Rivage. The second full course caution was later necessitated when debris was located on three sections of the track. Davidson remained the leader at the restart, ahead of Duval, and immediately increased his advantage over the Audi driver. The No. 7 car hit the No. 36 Alpine at La Source, causing the latter to spin. The third round of pit stops commenced shortly afterwards when Audi and Toyota made their stops for fuel and driver changes. Kraihamer's No. 13 Rebellion Racing vehicle hit the LMP2 leader Tor Graves in the No. 44 Manor Oreca and his car was beached on La Source's apex <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time before rejoining the event.|$|E
