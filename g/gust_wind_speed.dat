40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a preliminary study on hazard modeling, estimation, and mapping of extreme <b>wind</b> <b>gusts</b> for consideration of buildings and infrastructure in Australia. Buildings and infrastructure provide essential {{support for the}} quality of life and are the founding blocks for social and economic development. Typically the design service life of buildings is around 50 years and that of infrastructure is 100 years or beyond; therefore, most existing building stock and infrastructure will be impacted by, and design/construction of new ones needs to consider the potential effect of, climate change. Achievement of a performance level is typically via the consideration of return period (or average recurrence interval) of the hazard under consideration. Depending on its in-service importance and functionality, a structure such as a low-rise residential construction may need to be designed to withstand a 500 -year, and a school building a 1000 -year, return period <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> to ensure an acceptable structural safety level. To quantify the hazard of extreme gust, daily maximum <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> recorded up to 2007 at 545 anemometer stations maintained by the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) were collected.

40|$|Wind {{velocity}} {{data are}} often analysed to determine gust (peak) and mean (average) statistics for design to sustain in extreme conditions and for control to monitor these extreme levels through continuous {{measurement of the}} related means {{over a period of}} time. The relationship between the gust and the mean is simply expressed as the ratio of the gust to mean wind speeds, termed as the Gust Factor, G. The shorter the averaging period for the mean, the closer of the measured mean to the <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> this becomes. The gust maximum value itself would also be higher when averaged over a shorter gust duration, t, or measured with higher turbulence intensity Iu or higher longitudinal length scale Lux. Therefore, it is important in the description of a Gust Factor to qualify the averaging duration both for gust and for mean wind speeds as well as the turbulence characteristics in the wind flow.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{most severe}} damage to forests in central Europe occurs during winter storms that {{are caused by}} Northern Hemispheric {{mid-latitude}} cyclones. These winter storms have caused several catastrophic windthrows during the past four decades. Amounts of forest storm damage {{are believed to be}} a function of both the size of the forest and the storm intensity. To test this hypothesis, the Zurich region (city and canton) was chosen because long-term climate observation data is available for the region. The relationships between forest attributes, wind speed and forest damage were explored by comparing data on forests and wind speed from 107 winters with forest damage. Storm damage was defined as the proportion of damaged forests with respect to the growing stock. The variables: daily wind run (91 years), daily maximum hourly average wind speed (107 years) and peak <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> (74 years) were homogenized with respect to high wind speed and related to levels of forest damage.

This paper {{describes}} {{a comparison between}} two new methodologies to perform the cross wind risk analysis on railway lines, developed within the European project Aerodynam-ic in Open Air (AOA, WP 2). The study consists {{in the evaluation of}} the probability of rail ve-hicle overturning when it is running on a railway line under the action of cross wind. According to both the methodologies, the cross wind risk analysis is based on a meteo study and on the determination of Characteristic Wind Curves (CWC).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} derive probabilistic predictions of local winter storm damage occurrences from a global medium-range ensemble prediction system (EPS). Predictions of storm damage occurrences are subject to large uncertainty due to meteorological forecast uncertainty (typically addressed by means of ensemble predictions) and uncertainties in modelling weather impacts. The latter uncertainty arises {{from the fact that}} local vulnerabilities are not known in sufficient detail to allow for a deterministic prediction of damages, even if the forecasted <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> contains no uncertainty. Thus, to estimate the damage model uncertainty, a statistical model based on logistic regression analysis is employed, relating meteorological analyses to historical damage records. A quantification of the two individual contributions (meteorological and damage model uncertainty) to the total forecast uncertainty is achieved by neglecting individual uncertainty sources and analysing resulting predictions. Results show an increase in forecast skill measured by means of a reduced Brier score if both meteorological and damage model uncertainties are taken into account. It is demonstrated that skilful predictions on district level (dividing the area of Germany into 439  administrative districts) are possible on lead times of several days.

40|$|Abstract. Frequency and {{intensity}} of <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> asso-ciated with severe mid-latitude winter storms are estimated by applying extreme value statistics to data sets from re-gional climate models (RCM). Maximum <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> re-lated to probability are calculated with the classical peaks over threshold method, where a statistical distribution func-tion is fitted to the reduced sample describing {{the tail of the}} distribution function. From different sensitivity studies it is found that the Generalized Pareto Distribution in combina-tion with a Maximum-Likelihood estimator provide the most reliable and robust results. For a reference period from 1971 to 2000, the ability of the RCMs to realistically simulate extreme <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> is inves-tigated. For this purpose, data from three RCM scenarios, including the REMO-UBA simulations at 10 km resolution and the so-called consortial runs performed with the CCLM at 18 km resolution (two runs), are evaluated with observa-tions and a pre-existing storm hazard map for Germany. It is found that all RCMs tend to underestimate the magnitude of the gusts in a range between 10 and 30 % for a 10 -year return period. Averaged over the investigation area, the un-derestimation is higher for CCLM compared to REMO.

In order to improve residential building performance and mitigate losses from hurricane and earthquake hazards, there is an urgent need for better understanding of building performance and improvements in design and evaluation tools. In this study, a fragility analysis methodology is developed for assessing the response of light-frame wood construction exposed to extreme hurricane winds and earthquakes. The fragility is a conditional limit state probability, presented as a function of the 3 -second <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> (hurricanes) or spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the building (earthquakes), leading to a relation between damage state probability and the hazard stipulated in ASCE Standard 7. A fully coupled probabilistic framework is proposed to assess reliability of the residential construction through convolution of the structural fragility model with hazard models. Finally, a comparative risk assessment addresses the similarities and differences in competing hurricane and earthquake hazards.

40|$|Background: In {{recent decades}} the {{frequency}} and severity of natural disturbances by e. g., strong winds and insect outbreaks has increased considerably in many forest ecosystems around the world. Future climate change is expected to further intensify disturbance regimes, which makes addressing disturbances in ecosystem management a top priority. As a prerequisite a broader understanding of disturbance impacts and ecosystem responses is needed. With regard {{to the effects of}} strong winds – the most detrimental disturbance agent in Europe – monitoring and management has focused on structural damage, i. e., tree mortality from uprooting and stem breakage. Effects on the functioning of trees surviving the storm (e. g., their productivity and allocation) have been rarely accounted for to date. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that growth reduction was significant and pervasive in a 6. 79 ?million hectare forest landscape in southern Sweden following the storm Gudrun (January 2005). Wind-related growth reduction in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests surviving the storm exceeded 10 % in the worst hit regions, and was closely related to maximum <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> (R 2 = 0. 849) and structural wind damage (R 2 = 0. 782). At the landscape scale, windrelated growth reduction amounted to 3. 0 million m 3 in the three years following Gudrun. It thus exceeds secondary damage from bark beetles after Gudrun as well as the long-term average storm damage from uprooting and stem breakage in Sweden...|$|E

Despite this there is little clear understanding of how to appropriately design for these wind events given their significant dissimilarities to boundary layer winds upon which most design is based. To enhance the understanding of wind fields associated with these storms a three-dimensional numerical model was developed to simulate a multitude of idealised downburst scenarios and to investigate their near-ground wind characteristics. Stationary and translating downdraft wind events in still and sheared environments were simulated with baseline results showing good agreement with previous numerical work and full-scale observational data. Significant differences are shown in the normalised peak wind speed velocity profiles depending on the environmental wind conditions {{in the vicinity of the}} simulated event. When integrated over the height of mid- to high rise structures, all simulated profiles are shown to produce wind loads smaller than an equivalent 10 m height matched open terrain boundary layer profile. This suggests that for these structures the current design approach is conservative from an ultimate loading standpoint. Investigating the influence of topography on the structure of the simulated near-ground downburst wind fields, it is shown that these features amplify wind speeds in a manner similar to that expected for boundary layer winds, but the extent of amplification is reduced. The level of reduction is shown to be dependent on the depth of the simulated downburst outflow. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis uses {{statistical}} modelling {{to better understand}} the relationship between insured losses and hazard footprint characteristics for European windstorms (extra- tropical cyclones). The footprint of a windstorm is defined as the maximum <b>wind</b> <b>gust</b> <b>speed</b> to occur at a set of spatial locations over the duration of the storm. A better understanding of this relationship is required because the most damaging historical windstorms have had footprints with differing characteristics. Some have a large area of relatively low <b>wind</b> <b>gust</b> <b>speeds,</b> while others have a smaller area of higher <b>wind</b> <b>gust</b> <b>speeds.</b> In addition, this insight will help to explain the surprising, sharp decline in European wind related losses in the mid 1990 ’s. This novel exploration is based on 5730 high resolution model generated historical footprints (1979 - 2012) representing the whole European domain. Functions of extreme footprint <b>wind</b> <b>gust</b> <b>speeds,</b> known as storm severity measures, are developed to represent footprint characteristics. Exploratory data analysis is used to compare which storm severity measures are most successful at classifying 23 extreme windstorms, known to have caused large insured losses. Summarising the footprint using these scalar severity measures, however, fails to capture different combinations of spatial scale and local intensity characteristics. To overcome this, a novel statistical model for windstorm footprints is developed, initially for pairs of locations using a bivariate Gaussian copula model; subsequently extended to represent the whole European domain using a geostatistical spatial model. Throughout, the distribution of <b>wind</b> <b>gust</b> <b>speeds</b> at each location is modelled using a left-truncated Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Synthetic footprints, simulated from the geostatistical model, are then used in a sensitivity study to explore whether the local intensity or spatial dependence structure of a footprint has the most influence on insured loss. This contributes a novel example of sensitivity analysis applied to a stochastic natural hazards model. The area of the footprint exceeding 25 ms− 1 over land is the most successful storm severity measure at classifying extreme loss windstorms, ranking all 23 within the top 18...|$|R
