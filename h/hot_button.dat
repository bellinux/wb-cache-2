Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on <b>hot</b> <b>button</b> social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E

30|$|Models {{are one of}} my <b>hot</b> <b>buttons,</b> but I do {{recognize}} {{that they can be}} very useful when correctly used and when the developer has the knowledge necessary to recognize what makes real-world sense and what doesn’t. I have seen way too many models that cobble various pieces of information together to produce a result that has dangerous real world consequences. Sullivan (2009 a, 2009 b, 2009 c) surveyed models published during the period 1990 to 2007. Alexander (2009 b) and Garland (1988) present good discussions on the abuse of models. Remember: Garbage In = Garbage Out; and just because a model appears logical at first blush doesn’t necessarily mean it accurately or precisely follows scientific cause and effect. Models give predictions, not facts. As atmospheric scientist Gary Achtemeier has been known to say, “Models by definition are designed to fail.” Having worked with him, I know that Achtemeier abhors failure, which is perhaps why his smoke models are some of the very few whose predictions I have come to trust. When one of his models gives an unexpected outcome, I first reconsider why I expected a different result, whereas, when, for example, BEHAVE belches out a prediction that my experience suggests is ridiculous, I just smile and include the output in the document I am preparing as required by the agency. The most important thing to remember is that when model output does not jibe with what is taking place in the field, don’t trust that model again until the reasons for failure have been identified and corrected. As long as I am on the subject of BEHAVE, Dick Rothermel often said that his rate of spread model was just a first approximation, for he knew better than anyone that he was an engineer with virtually no field experience and, although he watched many a laboratory fire, he recognized that one could not scale up directly to a wildland fire. Nonetheless, the Forest Service made use of his model mandatory, and frustrated fire managers have been dealing with the band-aids, “improvements,” and add-ons that continue to spew forth. An excellent discussion of real-world problems associated with current fire models and the underlying reasons for the discrepancies can be found in Cruz and Alexander (2010).|$|R

40|$|I {{am writing}} this column {{shortly after the}} November midterm {{national}} elections and the Florida general elections. We all endured a very long, trashy, and {{by far the most}} expensive state elective process ever. Personally, I feel like I’ve watched six months of “The Jerry Springer Show” reruns. If we, the ever suffering citizens, did not know it before, we understand now how out of state super Political Action Committees (PACs), funded mostly by wealthy individuals, have become masters of the negative campaign tactics seen so often in this election season. The sad truth is that the negative campaign tactics work because we respond to them. In the end, for good or bad, the United States Congress ended the midterm election with a Republican majority in both Houses and Florida ends this election season with essentially the same administration as before and a legislature with a stronger republican majority in the senate and a supermajority in the house. Make no mistake, with the majorities in Houses of Congress both nationally and in Florida, coupled with a large majority of governor’s in State houses, the Republicans have a golden opportunity to develop and implement a strong mandate for America. I believe that the Florida political landscape is ripe for progressive change. After first hosing-down their restless Tea Party zealots, the Grand Old Party (GOP) should formulate a moderate and progressive plan that features compromise and cooperation from congressional members across the aisle. Floridians are tired of politics as usual. I believe Governor Rick Scott is showing signs of political maturity. As governor, he has begun to moderate his positions on health care, the environment and uncontrolled urban development. I don’t believe his moderate trend during the election process was simply political. There is so much that needs an overhaul in Florida. It’s hard to know where to start—so let’s begin and end in health care.
