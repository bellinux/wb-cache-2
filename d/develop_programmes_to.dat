Participants were 320 public servants (male = 180, female = 140) randomly selected from five states in Southwestern Nigeria. Measures of trait EI, OCB, and conflict resolution strategies were administered to the respondents. Multiple regression was used to analyse the data collected. The results indicate that forcing and withdrawing strategies negatively and significantly predicted OCB. Confronting, compromising and smoothing strategies significantly predicted OCB. Trait EI moderated the relationship between OCB and forcing and withdrawing strategies.

30|$|This body of {{research}} {{has important implications for}} public policy, especially given the substantial real-world increases in skilled migrants to more developed countries. It is still hard to make precise prescriptions: instead, I set out some general pointers. The most obvious takeaways from the literature are the importance of pro-skills migration policy, and the need to <b>develop</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> actively select stars and those with high entrepreneurial potential. The literature also suggests positive affordances of skilled diasporas and cultural diversity in the skilled workforce more generally, although it is not obvious how to target these directly. It is also unclear which diasporic groups receiving countries should encourage – this may vary from case to case. Encouraging skilled migrants into urban environments may pay dividends because of the economic affordances of cities; conversely, very large inflows may lead to (short term) increases in the cost of living (Peri et al. 2013). Finally, the research also implies policymakers should be careful to avoid adverse distributional impacts on native workers or firms – although this strand of the literature is still very under-developed, and more work is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. In South Africa, Eskom generates 91 % of all {{electricity}} produced. Most of this {{electricity is}} generated by 10 coal-fired power stations, 6 of which is situated in the Eastern Highveld region of Mpumalanga. Owing to the concentration of power stations in this region, Eskom decided years ago to investigate {{the environmental impacts of}} its generation actions and <b>develop</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> minimise these impacts. After the identification of the various impacts Environmental Management Plans were developed to manage and minimise the impacts. Although all the Eskom Power Stations have Environmental Management Plans in place at present, the documents differ in format and content. The Generation Environmental Management Group thus decided that a Generic Environmental Management Plan (EMP) should be developed, to ensure that station plans are developed to the same standard. The purpose of this scription document is thus to develop such a Generic Environmental Management Plan. Literature studies revealed very little about the content of EMPs, therefore existing management plans were studied to enable the development of a general format. The format generally used is as follows: Background on the project (power station); Legislation applicable to the project (power station); Identified impacts; Impact Management Plans; Monitoring of impacts and management plans; Contingency Plans; Accountable personnel; Auditing. Most management plans include communication, training and awareness programmes, while others also address the social impacts of a project. This generic document will only concentrate on the impacts on the natural environment. Studies of the existing documentation on management plans, revealed that power generation have impacts in 4 main areas of the environment, namely: Air Pollution; Water Pollution; Waste Production; Land Degradation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. Today’s youth {{grow up in}} a world riddled by HIV/AIDS and its devastating effects. In {{order to}} prevent HIV {{infection}} in youth, there is an ongoing need to understand the influences that place them at risk in order to <b>develop</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> mediate these influences towards healthy outcomes. Sexual risk behaviors are influenced by various factors ranging from intrapersonal to social normative and contextual/environmental factors. This study focuses on the social normative contextual influences on adolescent sexual risk behaviours in an attempt to understand sexual behaviours, in a sample of school going adolescents from grades nine, ten and eleven, in the Durban Metropolitan area (N= 259). This study aimed to examine the relationship, if any, between protective peer norm influences and adolescent sexual behaviour, including sexual risk-taking behaviours, measured by the dimensions of condom use at last sexual encounter, number of sexual partners and age of sexual debut. The findings showed no significant difference in levels of protective peer norms between those who have never engaged in sexual intercourse (primary abstinence) and those that had. The findings did, however, show significantly higher levels of protective peer norm influence regarding safe sexual practices, particularly condom use, among those who reportedly used condoms at their last sexual encounter, confirming that those who practiced safer sex had higher levels of protective peer norm influence. The findings of this study suggest the need for lifeskills programmes to empower youth to challenge social norms that place youth at risk of HIV infection, and further to include interventions to facilitate the renegotiation of peer norms towards health enhancing alternatives, to protect adolescents against sexual risk behaviours...|$|E

40|$|Participating {{in higher}} {{education}} can contribute to redressing social and economic disadvantage for Indigenous Australians. Yet there are serious problems in Australia {{with respect to the}} retention and completion rates of Indigenous students in tertiary education. Wright (2005) argues that the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous participation {{in higher education}} has widened since the year 2000. Two recent national reports confirm there has been stalled progress for Indigenous students in higher education (IHEAC 2006; Krause, Hartley, Richard & McInnis 2005). Indigenous Australian students often may experience university study as foreign, alienating and irrelevant according to the IHEAC report (2006). At a local level, Yallamas (2002, p. 18) reveals that according to the Department of Education, Science and Training, 'Indigenous enrolments at James Cook University (JCU) fell almost 40 per cent between 1999 and 2001 '. James, Bexley, Devlin and Marginson (2006) report that, overall, there is an ongoing need to <b>develop</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> raise Indigenous people's participation and completion rates in higher education. In particular, IHEAC (2006) identify that there is an urgent need for ongoing specific strategies to improve the level of Indigenous student enrolments, and address attrition ofIndigenous students particularly in their first year of study. The need for improvement of the status of Indigenous culture, knowledge and studies in the curricula of Australian universities also was highlighted (IHEAC 2006, p 13). Currently, small numbers of Indigenous students are graduating· from Australian universities. The majority of Indigenous students who have graduated from the Department of Social Work and Community Welfare at JCU have been mature-aged women with experience working in the welfare field but with no previous formal qualifications. Increased numbers of qualified Indigenous social work/welfare professionals are urgently needed to redress the otherwise quite 'homogenised' profession of social work in Australia...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cervical {{cancer is}} the commonest {{malignancy}} of the female genital tract in developing countries, with a global burden of 530, 000 new cases annually. This study aims to review the current situation of this important malignancy and to assess the previous use of preventive measures in patients with cervical cancer at the Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH), Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective review of all cases of cervical cancer managed at the UPTH, Port Harcourt, Nigeria, between 1 January 2008 and 31 December, 2012. Results: The prevalence of cervical cancer was 3. 53 % of all gynaecological admissions. The peak age of incidence was 50 - 59 years, accounting for 40 % of the study population. Women with high parity contributed to 93. 3 % of the study population. Early coitarche was observed in 78. 7 % {{and a history of}} multiple sexual partners in 65. 3 %. Vaginal bleeding was the commonest clinical feature seen in all the women studied, followed by pelvic pain in 84 % of cases. Advanced-stage cervical cancer was seen in 93. 4 %. None of the women studied had been previously vaccinated against human papilloma virus (HPV), and only 1. 3 % had had any form of screening methods for early detection of cervical cancer. Conclusion: Cervical cancer remains an important cancer in our environment, and late presentation with advance disease is still the norm despite advances in screening and preventive modalities. The reason for this is buttressed on the finding that despite the availability of these preventive strategies, women in the South-South of Nigeria did not partake of these measures. There is an urgent need to <b>develop</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> re-sensitise women on the need for screening and vaccination to reduce cancer-associated morbidity and mortality in Port Harcourt, South-South Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores a {{curriculum}} paradox that may arise for teachers in postauthoritarian regimes if a radically new curriculum, designed to prepare learners for democratic citizenship, {{requires them to}} be autonomous professionals. If teachers were originally schooled and trained under the old regime to follow the orders inscribed in syllabi and textbooks authorised by the regime, then they were probably not educated for autonomous thought and practices. If so, they are caught in a double bind: either they continue {{to do what they}} have always done but then {{may not be able to}} fulfil the aims and ideals of the new curriculum, or they can wait for more detailed orders and directives that tell them exactly what to teach and how to teach. In the latter case, a dependency on external authority is maintained. The current response to this problem in South Africa is to <b>develop</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> strengthen teachers’ content and pedagogic content knowledge and to provide highly specified curricula for teachers to follow. Deepening teachers’ knowledge is one important step towards addressing the paradox, but there is a danger that teachers who are not yet sufficiently autonomous may simply treat the content and form of such programmes as yet another set of orders to be obeyed. Just over a hundred years before apartheid ended, France was in the process of transition from despotism to democracy, and was in the process of introducing radical changes to the curriculum and the school system. Durkheim’s education theory courses were explicitly designed to help teachers think about the underlying social logic of the new policies, about the significance of the changes for them, and to think about the challenges of change. Aspects of Durkheim’s lectures are explored to reframe our understanding of, and our response to, the curriculum paradox with which many South African teachers are faced.    </p...|$|E

40|$|On 25 June 1997 at the NHS Confederation Annual Conference, the Secretary of State for Health {{announced}} {{his intention to}} establish a number of Health Action Zones (HAZs). These would be pilot projects whose aim would be ‘to explore mechanisms for breaking through current organisational boundaries to tackle inequalities, and deliver better services and better health care, building upon and encouraging co-operation across the NHS’ (DH 1997 / 145). Health action zones {{are expected to be}} ‘trailblazers’; pioneering innovative approaches to improving health. They are part of a family of area-based initiatives introduced by the Labour government. The three broad strategic objectives of HAZs are: to identify and address the public health needs of the local area; to increase the effectiveness, efficiency and responsiveness of services; to develop partnerships for improving people’s health and relevant services, adding value through creating synergy between the work of different agencies. In October 1997, health authorities in England were invited in conjunction with local authorities and other agencies to submit bids to become Health Action Zones. Forty-one bids were received by the Department of Health. From these, Health Action Zone status was granted to 11 areas from April 1998. Of those areas not selected in the 1 st wave, a number were asked to submit further applications, and 15 more areas were granted HAZ status from April 1999. HAZs have a mandate to <b>develop</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> improve the health of their general populations. Within this mandate however, they have considerable flexibility concerning the areas, services or population groups they target. It is thus worth posing the question: To what extent have Health Action Zones chosen to focus on improving the health of older people? We begin to address this question in three ways, by: Detailing some of the diversity of HAZs by describing their characteristics Outlining to what extent HAZ programmes and activities focus on older people Providing two examples of HAZs who are developing programmes specifically aimed at improving the health of older people</li...|$|E

JEAN's role, therefore, is to enhance the work of existing organizations, to fill the gaps and to facilitate a flow of information to and from the grassroots. JEAN aims to provide a forum for a diversity of organizations, 'farmers' associations, NGOs, indigenous groups, researchers, intergovernmental organizations and international research institutions etc. - all organizations interested in developing, promoting or simply gaining expertise in sustainable agriculture and in mobilising the resources to achieve it. JEAN also actively seeks to involve women's organizations, aiming to achieve a gender balance in their operations, while also supporting the role of women in agriculture. JEAN have circulated a consultation paper and questionnaire to stimulate feedback. As a result JEAN have been able to get a good picture of the priority needs for the different regions.

40|$|Aims: To {{examine the}} {{lifestyle}} behaviours and psychosocial well-being of primary {{school students in}} Hong Kong. Background: The establishment of healthy lifestyle habits and maintenance of psychosocial well-being during early adolescence can prevent the morbidity and mortality caused by unhealthy practices. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: A questionnaire was used to solicit information on primary school students' lifestyle behaviours and psychosocial well-being using the Chinese version of the Adolescent Lifestyle Questionnaire (C-ALQ). Results: Out of 249 primary school students, 241 returned their questionnaires (a response rate of 96 · 8 %). Results on the lifestyle behaviours of students indicated that nearly half of them 'play sports {{at least three times}} a week' (n = 111, 46 · 1 %), 'try not to eat foods high in fats/salt' (n = 112, 46 · 5 %), 'report unusual bodily changes to nurses, parents, friends or physician' (n = 136, 56 · 4 %) and 'avoid doing drugs' (n = 186, 77 · 2 %). Results for the psychosocial well-being of students showed that nearly half 'use helpful strategies to deal with stress' (n = 104, 43 · 2 %), are 'confident about [their] own beliefs and values in life' (n = 143, 59 · 3 %) and 'enjoy spending time with friends' (n = 169, 70 · 1 %). Male students were found less likely than females to demonstrate 'health awareness' (t = 4 · 87, p = 0 · 028) and 'social support'. (t = 4 · 17, p = 0 · 042) and to have better overall psychosocial well-being (t = 5 · 43, p = 0 · 021). Conclusions: Primary school students have various health education needs related to lifestyle behavioural choices and the maintenance of psychosocial well-being. Lifestyle choices are formed in early adolescence; therefore, health education must begin as early as possible to influence healthy behaviours. Relevance to clinical practice: School nurses should assess health needs across the school-age population and <b>develop</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> address these overall needs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the strategies employed by families that adopt Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) -orphaned children (Adoptive families) for coping with and mitigating the impact of AIDS in Mbeya Rural District, Tanzania. High numbers of AIDS-orphaned children aged below 18 years in Mbeya Region have led to increasing the burden of families caring for them. Understanding the coping strategies and impact mitigation activities employed by adoptive families is important in order to <b>develop</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> help them. This study employed a qualitative method for data collection (one-on-one in-depth interviews). The respondents included 12 male and 8 female heads of families that provide essential care for AIDS-orphaned children in Mbeya Rural District in Tanzania. The framework approach was used to analyse the data that were collected from 15 July to 15 August 2010. The study findings revealed that adoptive families faced several challenges including financial constraints due to increased needs for basic essentials such as health care expenses, school fees and food. Further impacts on adoptive families included shortage of work opportunities and limited time to address these challenges. To mitigate these challenges, adoptive families employed a range of coping strategies including selling family assets and renting out parts of cultivable land for extra cash. Task reallocation which involved the AIDS-orphaned children entering the labour force was also employed as a strategy to mitigate challenges and involved de-enrolling of children from schools so they could take part in income-generating activities in order to earn supplementary family income. The creation of additional income-generating activities such as poultry farming were other coping mechanisms employed, and these received support from both non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and governmental organisations, including the Isangati Agricultural Development Organization (local NGO) and the local government respectively. The current study identified challenges that adoptive families as well as the AIDS-orphaned children themselves faced in Mbeya Rural District, Tanzania. Recognition of these issues highlights the need for targeted interventions to address the underlying social determinants of human immunodeficiency virus or HIV and AIDS in affected populations in order to prevent further imposition of social, cultural and economic disadvantages on families that provide care for AIDS-orphaned children and the children themselves. These findings may prove useful in provoking discussions that may lead to HIV/AIDS prevention and the development of broader mitigation strategies to alleviate the impact of this scourge on families and communities in rural Tanzania, and in similar settings across the world...|$|E
40|$|Current {{trends in}} global economies and rankings by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have been {{bringing}} pressure {{to bear on}} Higher Education institutions to <b>develop</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> meet the global demands for a better qualified workforce. In the United Kingdom this has pointed at work based learning as one approach to up-skilling people that are already in work. This has raised concerns that academic rigour and standards could be compromised and scepticism about the workplace as a place for learning. Many universities are now designing and delivering work based learning programmes {{but there is still}} limited evidence of empirical research into work based learners’ experiences on these programmes. The aim of this research was to contribute towards filling this perceived gap. A phenomenographic study was conducted to determine variation in the way university work based learning was conceptualised by a group of Early Years practitioners, a workforce that has been subject to various professional development initiatives by the government in an attempt to improve outcomes for children. With the emphasis on variation, the research approach facilitated the identification of the different ways in which work based learning is perceived by learners, giving insight into a deeper understanding of learning in this context. Six conceptions of work based learning were identified which were comparable to conceptions of learning identified in various traditional university contexts, suggesting that concerns about rigour and standards expressed by some critics of university work based learning could be challenged. The findings also confirmed a number of notional principles of work based learning and theory on adult learning. There was also an indication that further research could provide {{a better understanding of the}} workplace as a place for developing knowledge and that universities may not have monopoly over this. This research made a contribution to empirical evidence on how university work based learning is experienced by the learners, suggesting the possibility of work based learning playing a bigger role in providing a university education to people who would otherwise not be able to engage at this level. The Early Years practitioners have been identified as such a workforce. One of the recommendations made was that more research into work based learning could support the development of more innovative ways of delivering higher education programmes to meet the needs of the work market. The findings from this study will become part of the discourse about higher education work based learning and the increasing thinking about the workplace as a legitimate place for generating knowledge...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} {{current and}} emerging threats posed {{to children in}} the United Kingdom from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse and also threats to children abroad from UK nationals, {{with a focus on}} online activity. Introduction Aim & scope 1. Last year the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre published its first annual Threat Assessment of Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (TACSEA), which examined current and emerging threats posed to children in the United Kingdom from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. 2. The 2013 TACSEA builds on and updates last year’s document and, in line with CEOP’s founding ethos that every child matters…everywhere, also examines the threat to children abroad from UK nationals. The purpose of the assessment is to enable CEOP to set its strategic priorities for the year ahead by describing {{the nature and extent of}} the threat landscape and how we assess it will change during the year. This will ensure that in a time of austerity across the public sector, CEOP resources are deployed where the threat to children is the greatest. It also provides a picture for partners to consider in their strategies and resource deployment. 3. CEOP’s mission, as set out in its three year strategy, is to work with others to protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation. It is recognised, however, that many other agencies in the UK have responsibility for tackling the spectrum of child sexual abuse particularly where it occurs in the home or within the family. Whilst acknowledging the wider context of child sexual exploitation and abuse this assessment focuses on those areas, both online and offline, where CEOP can add value and where no other agency has an appreciable footprint. 4. The TACSEA is an intelligence product, the purpose of which is to enhance understanding of a particular threat area. As an exception reporting tool it highlights only significant changes to that threat during the reporting period and it should therefore be read in conjunction with the 2012 TACSEA. The assessment sets out what is currently known about the threats to children and highlights those areas where understanding is less well developed. 5. This assessment signals the start of the second year of a three year strategy in which CEOP undertakes to assess where and how children are most at risk from sexual exploitation and abuse, to communicate this widely and to <b>develop</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> mitigate threats. It is likely that CEOP will conduct an additional threat assessment in the autumn of 2013 to inform the setting of national priorities. 6. In October 2013, CEOP will become a command of the National Crime Agency (NCA). The NCA will be the centrepiece of the reformed policing landscape and will spearhead the national crime fighting response to serious, organised and complex crime. Within the NCA, CEOP will further develop its strategic approach to prevent child sexual exploitation and abuse, to protect children and young people who are at risk of victimisation and to pursue offenders who target children in the UK or overseas...|$|E
