40|$|Australia and New Zealand {{developed}} distinctive 'wage-earner welfare states', {{with social}} protection largely delivered through high breadwinner basic incomes and residual social policies. Market reforms then pursued {{in both countries}} during the 1980 s and 1990 s retrenched important elements of the Antipodean model. Our article offers a novel characterization of major reforms to both welfare states from the mid- 1990 s to the early 2010 s. We focus on industrial relations, as a form <b>of</b> <b>wage-earner</b> welfare, and expansions to social provision for families and retirees that {{may be viewed as}} responding to the evolving needs <b>of</b> <b>wage-earners</b> as family patterns diversify and populations age. Policy reversals complicate the picture of the long-term path of industrial relations. Voters rejected the Employment Contracts Act in New Zealand in 2000 and WorkChoices in Australia in 2007, with incoming labour governments moderating policy to favour <b>wage-earner</b> expectations <b>of</b> decent wages and fair bargaining. Alongside this, governments expanded both paternalistic social policies and private social provision. We argue these changes taken together produced a 'hollowing out' <b>of</b> <b>wage-earner</b> welfare in both countries, accompanied by increasingly stratified welfare, which marginalizes and stigmatizes many outside the workforce. But, we also note persistent differences, reflecting the more radical and 'pure' New Zealand experiment, its relatively centralized politics and stronger liberal tradition. Hence, Australia retains more progressive taxation and family support less connected with employment status, while making greater use of tax expenditures to support private welfare. 24 page(s...|$|R
