25|$|In the 1970s, India {{declared}} its long-term strategy for forestry development to compose of three major objectives: to reduce soil erosion and flooding; {{to supply the}} growing needs of the domestic wood products industries; and to supply {{the needs of the}} rural population for fuelwood, fodder, small timber, and miscellaneous forest produce. To achieve these objectives, the National Commission on Agriculture in 1976 recommended the reorganisation of state forestry departments and advocated the concept of social forestry. The commission itself worked on the first two objectives, emphasising traditional forestry and wildlife activities; in pursuit of the third objective, the commission recommended the establishment of a new kind of unit to develop community forests. Following the leads of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, a number of other states also established community-based forestry agencies that emphasized programmes on <b>farm</b> <b>forestry,</b> timber management, extension forestry, reforestation of degraded forests, and use of forests for recreational purposes.|$|E

50|$|At {{present in}} almost all the {{countries}} where social forestry programmes have been taken up, both commercial and non-commercial <b>farm</b> <b>forestry</b> is being promoted {{in one form or}} the other. Individual farmers are being encouraged to plant trees on their own farmland to meet the domestic needs of the family. In many areas, this tradition of growing trees on the farmland already exists. Non-commercial <b>farm</b> <b>forestry</b> is the main thrust of most of the social forestry projects in the country today. It is not always necessary that the farmer grows trees for fuelwood, but very often they are interested in growing trees without any economic motive. They may want it to provide shade for the agricultural crops; as wind shelters; soil conservation or to use wasteland. <b>Farm</b> <b>Forestry</b> is another name for Agroforestry; a part of Social Forestry.|$|E
