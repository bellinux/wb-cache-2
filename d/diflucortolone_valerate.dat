5000|$|<b>Diflucortolone</b> <b>valerate</b> (also Nerisone cream/oily cream/ointment, Neriderm ointment, Japanese ジフルコルトロン (Jifurucorutoron) is a {{corticosteroid}} rated Class 2 [...] "potent" [...] (100-150 times) in the New Zealand topical steroid system. It is a {{white to}} creamy white crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in dichloromethane and in dioxan, sparingly soluble in ether and slightly soluble in methyl alcohol. Chemically, it is a corticosteroid esterified with valeric acid. It is commonly used topically in dermatology. The brand name is Nerisone; its creams come in potencies of 0.1% and 0.3%.|$|E
40|$|The {{blanching}} {{activities and}} hence bioavailabilities of the cream, ointment and fatty ointment preparations of Nerisone and Temetex (<b>diflucortolone</b> <b>valerate</b> 0. 1 %) were evaluated using an occluded and unoccluded blanching assay. These products {{were compared to}} Synalar ointment and cream (fluocinolone acetonide 0. 025 %), established topical corticosteroid preparations. Statistical analysis showed {{no significant differences between}} similar formulations of <b>diflucortolone</b> <b>valerate.</b> Significant differences were noted between <b>diflucortolone</b> <b>valerate</b> and fluocinolone acetonide preparations...|$|E
40|$|Infantile digital fibromatosis (IDF) {{is a rare}} benign fibroproliferative tumor {{of early}} childhood. IDF {{preferentially}} affects the fingers and the toes. Malignant transformation or metastases habe never been reported. Surgical treatment has been advocated previously but local recurrences were frequently observed. Recent literature supports clinical surveilllance without any medical or surgical intervention as spontaneous regression usually occurs after two to three years. A six-month-old Caucasian girl with IDF on the left fourth digit is presented here. The tumor progressively increased in size after birth. Topical imiquimod cream and <b>diflucortolone</b> <b>valerate</b> cream, both displaying antifibrotic properties, {{had no effect on}} tumor growth. Currently, the lesion size remains stable without any treatment. Early recognition of IDF is important in order to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention that may prove to be potentially aggravating, unless serious functional or cosmetic concerns intervene. Parents should be rassured concerning the benign nature of IDF and be informed that spontaneous involution of IDF might be expected...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSolid lipid {{nanoparticles}} (SLNs) {{are promising}} delivery carriers {{that have been}} utilized for formulation and delivery of various drugs. For topical administration, they are usually incorporated into gel or cream to increase their residence time, which is time-consuming process and could affect their stability and characteristics. Preparation of solid lipid nanoparticles based semisolid formulations could have potential pharmaceutical applications. The {{aim of this study}} was to formulate the corticosteroidal drug, <b>diflucortolone</b> <b>valerate</b> (DFV) into topical semisolid SLN formulations using a rapid cheap one-step process. SLN formulations were developed using a high-shear homogenization combined with sonication, using different types of solid lipids (e. g., Geleol®, Precirol® ATO 5, Tristearin® and Compritol® 888 ATO) and Poloxamer® 407 as a surfactant. Selection of the lipids and using high lipid concentration were the key elements to get semisolid formulation immediately after sonication without incorporating the nanoparticles into a gel or a cream base. DFV SLN formulations possessed average particle size ranging from 203. 71 ± 5. 61 to 1421. 00 ± 16. 32 nm with a narrow size distribution and possessed shear thinning behavior. Incorporation of lipid based surfactants (Labrasol® or Labrafil®) was found to significantly increase DFV encapsulation efficiency (up to 45. 79 ± 4. 40 %). Semisolid DFV-loaded SLN with high drug encapsulation efficiency and acceptable rheological behavior for topical preparation could be prepared in a one-step process...|$|E

Drug-loaded lecithin/chitosan nanoparticles with high entrapment efficiency (86. 8 %), were successfully prepared by ionic interaction technique. Sustained release of DFV was achieved without any initial burst release. Nanoparticles were also incorporated into chitosan gel at different ratios for preparing a more suitable formulation for topical drug delivery with adequate viscosity. In ex-vivo permeation studies, nanoparticles increased the accumulation of DFV especially in the stratum corneum + epidermis of rat skin without any significant permeation. Retention of DFV from nanoparticle in chitosan gel formulation (0. 01 %) was twofold higher than commercial cream, although it contained ten times less DFV. Nanoparticles in gel formulations produced significantly higher edema inhibition in rats compared with commercial cream in in-vivo studies. Skin blanching assay using a chromameter showed vasoconstriction similar to that of the commercial product. There were no barrier function changes upon application of nanoparticles. In-vitro and in-vivo results demonstrated that lecithin/chitosan nanoparticles in chitosan gel may be a promising carrier for dermal delivery of DFV in various skin disorders.

40|$|AbstractFour simple, accurate, {{reproducible}} and non-sophisticated spectrophotometric methods manipulating ratio spectra {{were developed}} and validated for the simultaneous determination of <b>diflucortolone</b> <b>valerate</b> (DIF) and isoconazole nitrate (ISO) without preliminary separation in pure powder form {{and in their}} cream formulation. Method A, is constant center spectrophotometric method (CC), method B is a ratio difference spectrophotometric one (RD), method C is the first derivative of the ratio spectra (1 DD), while method D is the mean centering of ratio spectra (MC). Linearity correlations ranges were 5 – 60 μgmL− 1 for DIF and 65 – 850 μgmL− 1 for ISO. The mean percentage recoveries of DIF were 101. 60 ± 1. 056 for method A, 101. 33 ± 0. 702 for method B, 101. 31 ± 1. 476 for method C and 102. 69 ± 1. 009 for method D, respectively. For ISO were 100. 59 ± 0. 525 for method A, 99. 68 ± 0. 721 for method B, 99. 67 ± 0. 742 for method C and 101. 37 ± 0. 958 for method D, respectively. Assessment of the specificity was achieved by analyzing synthetic mixtures containing the cited drugs. The four methods were applied for {{the determination of the}} cited drugs in cream formulation and the statistical comparison of the obtained results was made {{with each other and with}} those of official methods. The comparison in pure powder form showed that there is no significant difference between the proposed methods and the official methods regarding both accuracy and precision...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTUsing a murine model, topical {{application}} of glucocorticoid ([GC], 50 μg <b>diflucortolone</b> <b>valerate</b> in ethanol) on a sensitized site (flank skin) for 7 times before and 2 times after sensitization on alternate days, augmented expression of contact sensitivity reactions on the challenged site (ear skin). This augmentation {{was due to}} the systemic effect of percutaneously absorbed GC, because topical GC also augmented the skin reaction in mice that had been sensitized on a separate site from that of the GC application. In contrast, {{topical application}} of GC inhibited the contact sensitivity skin reaction when applied on the challenged sites. Intraperitoneal injection of the same dose of GC also failed to augment the skin reactions. Glucocorticoid augmented the contact sensitivity skin reactions and these persisted for 96 h after the control skin reactions subsided. Early phase (1 – 6 h) skin reactions were also induced or augmented when dinitrofluorobenzene or trinitrochlorobenzene but not oxazolone were used as the sensitizer; GC also augmented the non-specific reactions to croton oil or to suboptimal concentration of hapten in normal mice. The numbers of Langerhans cells (LC) were reduced in both the GC-application and challenged sites. Haptenated LC from GC-treated skin showed a rather weak sensitizing ability, which was not statistically significant. Transfer of lymph node cells and/or spleen cells or serum from GC-pre-treated mice failed to induce a contact sensitivity reaction in normal recipient mice. These results suggest that topical GC might augment cutaneous inflammation through a possible modulation of local cytokine production, regardless of the number of LC or the presence of sensitized lymphocytes...|$|E
