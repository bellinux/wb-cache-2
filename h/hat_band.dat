A straw boater was {{introduced}} in the early 20th century, worn with a red and white <b>hat</b> <b>band</b> featuring the college crest with its burning bush woven into it in red. During this time Prefects wore red silk arm-bands embroidered with a gold crest.|$|E

25|$|Trooper uniforms {{are made}} of grey wool, with the {{exception}} of the Gore-Tex jacket. Prior to 1958, uniforms (shirts, jackets and britches) were not grey, but made of equal parts white fiber and black fiber to symbolize the impartiality of justice. The NYSP is one of only five state police forces that do not wear a badge on their uniform shirts. Like a U.S. Flag, trooper uniforms are burned when no longer serviceable. The black stripe down the leg of the trouser is worn in remembrance of fallen comrades. The purple color of the tie and <b>hat</b> <b>band</b> represents an elite unit. Troopers wear a tan felt stetson hat with a leather security strap and purple band around it.|$|E
25|$|On 1 March 1901 the Australian Army {{was formed}} {{following}} {{the transfer of}} colonial forces. Universal service dress was introduced in 1902 and was worn at all times, including in the field, except for formal occasions requiring full dress. This uniform included a peaked cap, tunic, and trousers, with officers wearing a Sam Browne belt. Officers of the mounted arm wore breeches and boots, while the rest worn puttees. The different arms and corps were distinguished by the colour of the braid trimming on the shoulder straps. A wide-brimmed slouch hat was worn with one side turned up by troops overseas. The rising sun badge was first worn at this time by battalions of the Australian Commonwealth Horse on active service in South Africa, while some Queensland units wore emu plumes in their hats. During this period it remained common to follow the British system, with the uniform subsequently adopted by the Commonwealth consisting of a General Service Dress which, {{in order to achieve}} financial savings, could be converted into Full Dress for ceremonial occasions simply by the addition of a number of lace accoutrements, including aiguillettes, as well as breast-lines and girdles. The uniform consisted of a khaki serge jacket, with slouch hat and breeches. Cloth collar patches were worn, as well as coloured piping on the jacket, with rosettes or plumes on the hat, and regimental badges. The introduction of universal service in 1912 resulted in the adoption of a number of changes due to the need to economise following the rapid expansion of the Army. The uniform provide for at this time was relatively simple, consisting of a hat, heavy woollen khaki shirt, cord breeches and boots. To distinguish between units and corps a coloured cloth <b>hat</b> <b>band</b> with a metal numeral was worn. Officers kept their jackets, and later approval was given to wear open collars with shirt and tie.|$|E
500|$|Rosas {{established}} a totalitarian regime, {{in which the}} government sought to dictate every aspect of public and private life. It was mandated that the slogan [...] "Death to the Savage Unitarians" [...] be inscribed at the head of all official documents. Anyone on the state payroll—from military officers, priests, to civil servants and teachers—was obliged to wear a red badge with the inscription [...] "Federation or Death". Every male was required to have a [...] "federal look", i.e., to sport a large moustache and sideburns, leading many to wear false moustaches. The red colour—symbol of both the Federalist Party and of Rosismo—became omnipresent in the province of Buenos Aires. Soldiers wore red chiripás (blankets worn as trousers), caps and jackets, and their horses sported red accoutrements. Civilians were also required to wear the colour. A red waistcoat, red badge and red <b>hat</b> <b>band</b> were required for men, while women wore ribbons in that colour and children donned school uniforms based upon Rosismo paradigms. Building exteriors and interiors were also decorated in red.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{case that}} {{attracted}} his attention was an incident when Assistant City Marshal Billy Breakenridge shot Billy Grounds from [...] with a shotgun, killing him. Goodfellow examined Billy {{and found that}} two buckshot grains had penetrated Billy's thick Mexican felt <b>hat</b> <b>band</b> embroidered with silver wire. These two buckshot and two others penetrated his head and flattened against the posterior wall of the skull, and others penetrated the face and chest.

But Goodfellow was fascinated to find in the folds of a Chinese silk handkerchief around Grounds' neck two shotgun pellets but no holes.

2500|$|The Nauvoo Legion {{finally made}} contact with federal troops in late September just west of South Pass. The militia {{immediately}} began to burn grass along the trail and stampede the army's cattle. In early October, Legion members burned down Fort Bridger lest it {{fall into the hands}} of the army. A few days later, three large Army supply trains that were trailing the main army detachments were burned by Mormon cavalry led by Lot Smith. Associated horses and cattle were [...] "liberated" [...] from the supply trains and taken west by the militia. Few if any shots were fired in these exchanges, and the Army's lack of cavalry left them more or less open to Mormon raids. However, prisoners were captured by both sides, and the army began to grow weary of the constant Mormon harassment throughout the fall. At one point, Colonel Alexander mounted roughly 100 men on army mules to combat the Mormon militia. In the early morning of 15 October, this [...] "jackass cavalry" [...] had a run-in with Lot Smith's command and fired over 30 bullets at the Mormons from 150yards. No one was killed, but one Mormon took a bullet through his <b>hat</b> <b>band,</b> and one horse was grazed. In addition, through October and November, between 1,200 and 2,000 militiamen were stationed in Echo Canyon and Weber Canyon. These two narrow passes lead into the Salt Lake Valley, and provided the easiest access to the populated areas of northern Utah. Dealing with a heavy snowfall and intense cold, the Mormon men built fortifications, dug rifle pits and dammed streams and rivers in preparation for a possible battle either that fall or the following spring. Several thousand more militiamen prepared their families for evacuation and underwent military training.|$|E

60|$|At all events, {{in quiet}} Campden, adventures {{obviously}} occurred to the unadventurous. They {{culminated in the}} following year, on August 16, 1660. Harrison left his house in the morning (?) and walked the two miles to Charringworth to collect his lady's rents. The autumn day closed in, and between eight and nine o'clock old Mrs. Harrison sent the servant, John Perry, to meet his master on the way home. Lights were also left burning in Harrison's window. That night neither master nor man returned, and it is odd that the younger Harrison, Edward, did not seek for his father till very early next morning: he had the convenience, for nocturnal search, of a moon which rose late. In the morning, Edward went out and met Perry, returning alone: he had not found his master. The pair walked to Ebrington, a village half way between Campden and Charringworth, and learned that Harrison had called, on the previous evening, as he moved home through Ebrington, {{at the house of}} one Daniel. The hour is not given, but Harrison certainly disappeared when just beyond Ebrington, within {{less than a mile from}} Campden. Edward and Perry next heard that a poor woman had picked up on the highway, beyond Ebrington, near some whins or furze, a <b>hat,</b> <b>band,</b> and comb, which were Harrison's; they were found within about half a mile of his own house. The band was bloody, the hat and comb were hacked and cut. Please observe the precise words of Sir Thomas Overbury, the justice who took the preliminary examinations: 'The Hat and Comb being hacked and cut, and the Band bloody, but nothing more could there be found.' Therefore the hat and comb were not on Harrison's head when they were hacked and cut: otherwise they must have been blood-stained; the band worn about the throat was bloody, but there was no trace of blood on the road. This passage contains the key to the puzzle.|$|E
