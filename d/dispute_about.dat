5|$|As the American Revolutionary War {{began in}} the East, Kentucky's {{settlers}} became involved in a <b>dispute</b> <b>about</b> the region's sovereignty. Richard Henderson, a judge and land speculator from North Carolina, had purchased much of Kentucky from the Cherokee in an illegal treaty. Henderson intended to create a proprietary colony known as Transylvania, but many Kentucky settlers did not recognize Transylvania's authority over them. In June 1776, these settlers selected Clark and John Gabriel Jones to deliver a petition to the Virginia General Assembly, asking Virginia to formally extend its boundaries to include Kentucky.|$|E

After her Grammy Award nomination for Live (1993) was announced, Selena signed with SBK Records to begin recording her crossover album, which was front-page news in Billboard magazine. In March 1994, she released Amor Prohibido; in interviews {{she said her}} English-language album was still being developed. Recording sessions for Dreaming of You began in December 1994; Selena recorded four tracks slated for the album.

5|$|Born on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard Skelton was {{the fourth}} and {{youngest}} son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; {{he had once been}} a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. During Skelton's lifetime there was some <b>dispute</b> <b>about</b> the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they thought he had no future.|$|E
5|$|After Trump {{withdrew from}} {{sponsoring}} the event, DuPont became the primary sponsor. Between 1991 and 1995, national amateur teams took part alongside professional teams. The event attracted well-known competitors, including Lance Armstrong and Greg LeMond, and {{was attended by}} high-profile European-based professional cycling teams. In 1996, the Union Cycliste Internationale upgraded it to a 2.1 ranked race, meaning that amateurs could no longer compete. This made the race the highest ranked outside of Europe and the first North American stage race to be ranked 2.1. The 1996 race {{was the subject of}} a number of legal issues, including a dispute over rights to its profits between the race owners, Billy Packer and president of the United States Cycling Federation Mike Plant, which resulted in them suing each other. DuPont itself was involved in a <b>dispute</b> <b>about</b> the anti-homosexual employment policies of the local government in Greenville, South Carolina, with the company insisting that the race organizers exclude the city from the route.

5|$|Egan's own {{research}} into the issue showed that the trustees had conveyed St. Mary's Church to the previous pastor, Robert Harding, and then to his heirs, but the trustees did not consider that property transfer to have extinguished {{their role in the}} church's leadership. By 1811, Egan's worsening health caused him to accept the assistance of two priests at St. Mary's, James Harold and his nephew, William Vincent Harold. Egan and the trustees became further embroiled in a <b>dispute</b> <b>about</b> clerical salaries, a situation possibly made worse by the decline in shipping income in the port city caused by the outbreak of the War of 1812. Egan also came to believe the Harolds were making the situation worse by taking pro-clergy positions that were more extreme than Egan's own and by the younger Harold's scheming to be named Egan's coadjutor bishop. He appealed to the trustees for compromise, and offered to bring his cousin (also a priest) over from Ireland to replace the elder Harold. By 1813, Egan and the trustees had reconciled and together resolved to remove the Harolds, who agreed to resign later that year and relocate to England.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{additional}} trams {{were built}} by Strømmen as series two. The first vehicle was delivered on 4 August 1989 {{and was taken}} into service on 11 October, while the last was put into service on 27 August 1990. These were numbered 126 through 140. From 7 September 1990 to 1 February 1991, tram 140 was used on the tramway in Chemnitz, Germany. Following this delivery, all lines of the tramway used SL79, although there were still many other trams needed to supplement the new trams. During the summer of 1995, tram no. 137 was used on the Djurgården Line of the heritage tramway in Stockholm, Sweden. Due to a labor <b>dispute</b> <b>about</b> privatizing {{the operation of the}} tramway and the Oslo Metro, the ownership of all trams and metro trains, including the SL95, were transferred to the municipally owned limited company Oslo Vognselskap in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the tests}} in Oslo, a {{delegation}} {{was sent to}} look at compatible systems outside Oslo. After it had returned, the company went into negotiations with three manufacturers: Duewag, Bautzen and Ansaldo/Firema. Oslo Sporveier {{signed a contract with}} Ansaldo/Firema for delivery of 17 units in 1997–98, with options for additional 15 units. The first 17 units cost , or NOK20million per vehicle. The option rights were later exercised, and the total order was increased to 32. This allowed Oslo Sporveier to replace all trams that were not articulated, and would give a maximum age in the tram fleet to 18 years. While Oslo Sporveier at first had planned to debt-finance the purchase, by 1999 it was decided that the trams would be leased from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. Due to a labor <b>dispute</b> <b>about</b> privatizing the operation of the tramway and the Oslo Metro, the ownership of all trams and metro trains, including the SL95, were transferred to the municipally owned limited company Oslo Vognselskap in 2007.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, Waller went to New York City to be a tutor, {{but left}} after {{three or four}} weeks. This {{was the last time}} in his life that he was paid as a teacher but he still opened and funded some schools. He opened a {{classical}} school in Bloomsburg, which was built in 1839, and he contributed $3500 to it. Shortly after arriving in Bloomsburg, he organized a singing school and also created a Bible class in 1839. The class continued until after his death. He helped to open Bloomsburg's State Normal School. He was appointed a trustee of Lafayette College in 1849 by the Synod of Philadelphia. He held that position until 1879. He was also on Lafayette College's Ways and Means committee and helped stop the college from closing in 1852. In 1856, Waller helped convert a classical school into the Bloomsburg Literary Institute and served as one of the nine initial trustees. He resigned from being a trustee in 1866 after a <b>dispute</b> <b>about</b> where to set up a new building for the institute. Despite resigning from the trustees, he helped conduct the opening ceremony of the institute's new building on April 3, 1867.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October the RPF {{suffered}} a significant reversal, when leader Fred Rwigyema {{was shot in}} the head and killed. There is a <b>dispute</b> <b>about</b> the exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death; the official line of Kagame's government, and the version mentioned by historian Gérard Prunier in his 1995 book on the subject, was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet. In his 2009 book Africa's World War, however, Prunier states that it is likely Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics. According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the need to move slowly, and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting Kigali, whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander Chris Bunyenyezi, wished to strike hard and fast, to achieve power as soon as possible; the argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead. Another senior RPF officer, Stephen Nduguta, witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother Salim Saleh to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana and Bunyenyezi's arrest and eventual execution.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Vajpayee's {{moderate}} strategy {{led to a}} shift in the ideology of the party toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism. In 1984, Advani was appointed president of the party, and under him it became the political voice of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In the early 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign {{for the construction of a}} temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama at the site of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya. The mosque had been constructed by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1527. There is a <b>dispute</b> <b>about</b> whether a temple once stood there. The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site was the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque. The BJP threw its support behind this campaign, and made it a part of their election platform. It won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made its support crucial to the National Front government of V. P. Singh.|$|E

5|$|The {{first known}} knez of Omiš, Nikola, was mentioned, {{along with his}} {{relatives}} and everyone under his lordship, in a peace treaty with Kotor from 1167. Knez Nikola's power and independence {{was strong enough to}} have Rogerije, the Archbishop of Split, executed in 1180. Family political influence at that time included Brač and Hvar, Breueco (Brenti, Brevko, Brečko)also of genus Kačićas well as the previous Šibenik iupanus (župan). Archbishop Rogerije, who also served Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos as representative governor of Croatia, had become involved in a <b>dispute</b> <b>about</b> an estate around Mosor. A conte Nicola Aprico, who was identified in two dispute settlements of Split during 1178–79, is considered to be the same knez Nikola. In 1190, Nikola established a peace treaty with Dubrovnik. Like the 1167 treaty with Kotor, the 1190 treaty granted safe and free navigation to Dubrovnik ships from Molunat to Orebić (Trstenica).|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence that the}} cerebellum plays {{an essential role in}} some types of motor learning. The tasks where the cerebellum most clearly comes into play are those in which it is necessary to make fine adjustments to the way an action is performed. There has, however, been much <b>dispute</b> <b>about</b> whether learning takes place within the cerebellum itself, or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote learning in other brain structures. Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the cerebellum are derived from the ideas of David Marr and James Albus, who postulated that climbing fibers provide a teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses. Marr assumed that climbing fiber input would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened. Most subsequent cerebellar-learning models, however, have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber activity would be an error signal, and would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be weakened. Some of these later models, such as the Adaptive Filter model of Fujita made attempts to understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal control theory.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred (died 24 March 832) was an Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury {{in medieval}} England. Nothing {{is known of}} his life prior to 803, when he {{attended}} a church council, but he was probably a nobleman from Middlesex. He was elected archbishop in 805 and spent his time in office reforming the clergy of his cathedral. He also quarrelled with two consecutive Mercian kings– Coenwulf and Ceolwulf– over whether laymen or clergy should control monasteries. At one point, Wulfred travelled to Rome to consult with the papacy and was deposed from office {{for a number of}} years over the issue. After Coenwulf's death, relations were somewhat better with the new king Ceolwulf, but improved much more after Ceolwulf's subsequent deposition. The <b>dispute</b> <b>about</b> control of the monasteries was not fully settled until 838, after Wulfred's death. Wulfred was the first archbishop to place his portrait on the coinage he struck.|$|E
