A total of 411 college students in India participated in the survey. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), this study finds that Indian consumers' need for uniqueness positively influences attitudes toward American products.

Emotional value is an important factor influencing purchase intention toward a U. <b>S.</b> <b>brand</b> and a local brand as well. Implications for both U. S. and Indian retailers are provided.

40|$|The sports {{industry}} {{is one of}} the fastest growing industries in the world. Most international sports teams have developed a brand representing the message that their team wishes to communicate to its stakeholders. Frequently, a team <b>s</b> <b>brand</b> is managed and driven by the leaders, owners and chief executive officers (CEOs) of the sport teams. Similarly, these leaders, owners or CEOs possess their own personal brand, which can be driven by the team. To date, literature has focused on the brands of teams and players, and little focus has been given to the leaders, owners or CEOs driving the brand, specifically in a South African context. This research investigates the link or relationship between the CEO and sport team brand. Qualitative interviews were conducted with CEOs of three Super Rugby franchises, and the relationship between the brand of the CEOs and the franchise was identified. Nine additional interviews were conducted with marketers, coaches and players of the franchises, and assisted in triangulating the data. The interviews provided the depth and insight to explore the participants understandings of the relationship between the CEO <b>s</b> <b>brand</b> and the sport team brand. The research confirmed that there is a link or relationship between a CEO and sport team brand. The research suggests that the relationship is established over time and is influenced by the CEO s involvement and engagement with his/her prospective teams. A dual brand transfer was identified between a CEO and a sport team brand.

40|$|Tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) {{are one of}} {{the major}} classes of {{carcinogens}} found in tobacco products. As part of collaborative efforts to reduce tobacco use and resulting disease, the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) carried out a two-phase investigation into the worldwide variation of the levels of TSNAs in cigarette tobacco. In the first phase, representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO) purchased cigarettes; scientists from the CDC subsequently measured the levels of TSNAs in tobacco from 21 different countries. Although the data collected from this initial survey suggested that globally marketed U. S. -brand cigarettes typically had higher TSNA levels than locally popular non-U. S. cigarettes in many countries, the number of samples limited the statistical power of the study. To improve statistical power and to ensure adequate sampling, the CDC conducted a second survey of 14 countries. In addition to the United States, the CDC selected the world’s 10 most populous countries and three additional countries, so that at least two countries from each of the six WHO regions were represented. For each country, the CDC compared 15 packs of Marlboro cigarettes, which is the world’s most popular brand of cigarettes, with 15 packs of a locally popular non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>brand</b> in the study country. Marlboro cigarettes purchased in 11 / 13 foreign countries had significantly higher tobacco TSNA levels than the locally popular non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>brands</b> purchased in the same country. The findings suggest that TSNA levels in tobacco can be substantially reduced in some cigarettes...|$|R

30|$|Another {{reason that}} {{commonly}} explains {{the diffusion of}} external voting is the growing claims for voting rights from migrants’ organizations, in particular in context of democratic transition (Rhodes & Harutyunyan, 2010). However, the influence of migrants’ organizations, some of which barely consist in “four guys and a fax machine” (Rowe, 2001), should not be overestimated. More importantly, external voting {{is not confined to}} democracies, as shown by several examples, including Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia in the 1970 s and 1980 <b>s</b> (<b>Brand,</b> 2010). Overall, the adoption of external voting provisions appears to be inseparable from broader domestic political processes, from competition between political parties to institutional reforms (e.g. electoral or constitutional reform, regionalization, etc.) (Lafleur, 2015).|$|R
