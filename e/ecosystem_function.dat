40|$|Trait-based {{approaches}} evaluate <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> under {{environmental change}} by relating traits predicting changes in species densities (response traits) to traits driving <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> (effect traits). Stressors can, however, affect <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> {{not only by}} altering species densities but also by directly changing species effect traits. We first identified the response traits predicting the cell density of 18 marine benthic diatom strains along gradients of two chemical stressors (a pesticide and a metal, atrazine and copper). We then tested if response traits could predict stressor-induced changes in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> i. e. changes in the effect traits driving the diatoms’ potential contribution to primary production, sediment stabilization and energy content in intertidal systems. Finally, we examined if changes in density and changes in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> were correlated, to assess whether species capable of growing under stressful conditions could maintain their contribution to <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> The relationship between response traits and stressor-induced changes in density and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> was different depending on stressor type: a set of intercorrelated morphological traits predicted changes in both density and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> under metal stress, with large cells being more stress resistant. Changes in density and changes in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> were positively related: diatoms whose density was least affected by the metal were also able to sustain functioning under metal exposure. In contrast, the capacity for mixotrophic growth predicted changes in density, but not changes in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> under pesticide stress. Pesticide effects on density and on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> were negatively related for energy content and sediment stabilization, indicating a limited capacity of pesticide-tolerant diatoms to maintain their contribution to <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> Synthesis. <b>Ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> under stress can depend on whether the response traits driving changes in species densities also predict direct stress effects on the species’ contribution to functioning.

40|$|Biodiversity is an {{essential}} determinant of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> Numerous studies described positive effects of diversity on the functioning of communities arising from complementary resource use and facilitation. However, high biodiversity may also increase competitive interactions, fostering antagonism and negatively affecting community performance. Using experimental bacterial communities we differentiated diversity effects based on genotypic richness and dissimilarity. We show that these diversity characteristics have opposite effects on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> Genotypic dissimilarity governed complementary resource use, improving <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> in complex resource environments. Contrastingly, genotypic richness drove allelopathic interactions, mostly reducing <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> The net biodiversity effect on community performance resulted from the interplay between the genetic structure {{of the community and}} resource complexity.

25|$|The {{removal of}} grass by grazing affects the woody plant {{component}} of woodland systems in two major ways. Grasses compete with woody plants for {{water in the}} topsoil and removal by grazing reduces this competitive effect, potentially boosting tree growth. In addition to this effect, the removal of fuel reduces both the intensity {{and the frequency of}} fires which may control woody plant species. Grazing animals can have a more direct effect on woody plants by the browsing of palatable woody species. There is evidence that unpalatable woody plants have increased under grazing in savannas. Grazing also promotes the spread of weeds in savannas by the removal or reduction of the plants which would normally compete with potential weeds and hinder establishment. In addition to this, cattle and horses are implicated in the spread of the seeds of weed species such as Prickly Acacia (Acacia nilotica) and Stylo (Stylosanthes spp.). Alterations in savanna species composition brought about by grazing can alter <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function,</b> and are exacerbated by overgrazing and poor land management practices.|$|E
40|$|Biodiversity {{is rapidly}} declining worldwide, {{and this may}} lead to {{subsequent}} declines in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> and stability. Here I consider whether: (i) stabilizing species interactions, such as niche partitioning and facilitation, promote biodiversity, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> and stability, and (ii) global ecosystem changes influence biodiversity, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> and stability by destabilizing species interactions. In Chapters 2 and 3, I report results from studies that used long-term data from a grassland biodiversity experiment to identify the mechanisms that promoted biodiversity, productivity, and the temporal stability of productivity. Stabilizing species interactions that favored rare species promoted productivity and temporal stability. Stabilizing species interactions that favored unproductive species promoted biodiversity and temporal stability. In Chapters 4 and 5, I report results from a new experiment that tested whether intense grazing influenced biodiversity, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> and stability by favoring common and productive species, especially in exotic species mixtures. Stabilizing species interactions maintained biodiversity and promoted <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> in ungrazed native species mixtures. However, species interactions were destabilized, and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> was decreased, in both exotic and intensely grazed mixtures. In conclusion, these results suggest that: (i) stabilizing species interactions that favor rare and unproductive species can simultaneously promote biodiversity, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> and temporal stability in grasslands; and (ii) changing from native grasslands to exotic grasslands or pastures can decrease ecosystem services by destabilizing species interactions...|$|R

We analysed eight datasets, including five animal groups, to examine how well a trait-based approach, compared with a more traditional taxonomic approach, predicts seven <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> below- and above-ground. Trait-based indices consistently provided greater explanatory power than species richness or abundance. The frequency distributions of single or multiple traits in the community were the best predictors of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> This implies that the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> we investigated were underpinned by the combination of trait identities (i. e. single-trait indices) and trait complementarity (i. e. multi-trait indices) in the communities.

25|$|All {{the recent}} {{advances}} in molecular genetics clearly permit the analysis of microbial communities at much finer and functional scales and potentially with more confidence than previous methods. The classical AM fungal identification method of spore extraction from soil and further spore morphological analysis is fraught with complicating issues due to the various strategies and forms of AM fungi, e.g., lack of sporulation in certain species, seasonality, high unculturability, possible misidentification (human error), and new evidence of multi-nucleate spores and high genetic variation within clonal AM species. Because of these various problems, in the past researchers likely misrepresented the true composition of AM fungal communities present at any {{one point in time}} or place. Additionally, by following the traditional extraction, culture and microscopic identification methods, {{there is no way to}} determine active/functioning AM fungal populations, which are likely the most important when attempting to relate plant-AM symbiotic interactions and mechanisms to ecological or <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function.</b> This is especially true in the case of root colonization analyses, which can determine percentage of roots colonized by AM fungi. The major problem with this analysis is in field soils, which contain multiple species of AM fungi in association with a target plant at the same time (see Ecology of AM). The identification of the associated fungal symbionts is impossible without the use of molecular methods. Though genetic analysis of AM fungal communities has advanced a great deal in the past decade, the methodology is not yet completely refined. Below is an overview of the methods used in molecular genetic analyses of AM fungi, along with applications to research, future directions and some of their problems.|$|E

Across both experimental venues, we found no significant effect of red-backed salamanders on any of the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions.</b> We also found no effect of salamanders on intraguild predator abundance (carabid beetles, centipedes, spiders).

40|$|Many {{animal species}} have {{developed}} specific evolutionary adaptations to survive prolonged periods of low energy availability that characterize seasonal environments. The seasonal course of primary production, a major aspect of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> {{should therefore be}} an important factor determining the habitat quality of such species. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the relationship between habitat quality and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> for brown bears (Ursus arctos), a species showing hyperphagia and hibernation as evolutionary adaptation to seasonal peaks and bottlenecks in ecosystem productivity, respectively. Our unique long-term data set comprised data from two brown bear populations in northern Spain on historical presence, current presence, and reproduction. The data were classified on a grid of 5 x 5 km pixels into five classes: frequent reproduction, sporadic reproduction, frequent presence, sporadic presence, and recent extinction. We used the long-term average of the seasonal course of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) as a proxy for <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> and investigated the relationship between habitat quality and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> with methods borrowed from statistical point-pattern analysis. We found that brown bears indeed selected habitat with specific <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> (i. e., the variance in all habitat classes was smaller than in the landscape overall) and the relationship between habitat quality and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> was ordered. First, the average distance in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> between two habitat classes was larger if the difference in habitat quality was larger. Second, habitat for which there was the greatest need (i. e., breeding habitat) occupied the narrowest niche regarding <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> and showed the most pronounced seasonality. Progressively poorer classes occupied wider niches that partly overlapped those of better classes. This indicated that nonbreeding animals are less selective. Our methodology provided new insight into the relationship between <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> and habitat quality and could be widely applied to animal species living in seasonal environments.
