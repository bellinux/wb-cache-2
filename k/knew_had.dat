5|$|Digging for Fire {{features}} an ensemble cast, the largest Swanberg {{had worked with}} at the time. He and Johnson cast the film by contacting friends and other actors who they <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> enjoyed their previous film together, Drinking Buddies. Rosemarie DeWitt and Swanberg decided to work together after her husband, Ron Livingston, starred in Drinking Buddies. Unlike the other actors, Orlando Bloom was cast through an agent. Swanberg cast his own son, Jude, as the three-year-old son of the lead characters.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{plot was}} {{inspired}} by a similar incident in which Johnson discovered a gun and a bone in his backyard. Instead of a traditional script, he and Swanberg wrote an outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue. They cast the film mainly by contacting their friends and other actors who they <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> enjoyed their previous work. It was filmed over 15 days in Los Angeles County, California. Swanberg dedicated the film to filmmaker Paul Mazursky.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Nhu {{began work}} on the ambitious Strategic Hamlet Program, an attempt to build {{fortified}} villages that would be secure zones for rural Vietnamese. The objective was to lock the Vietcong out {{so that they could}} not operate among the villagers. Thảo supervised these efforts, and when told that the peasants resented being forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and put into forts that they were forced to build, he advised Nhu and Tuyến that it was imperative to build as many hamlets as fast as possible. This pleased the Vietcong, who felt that Thảo's efforts were turning the rural populace against Saigon. Thảo specifically had villages built in areas that he <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> a strong Vietcong presence. This increased the number of communist sympathisers who were placed inside the hamlets and given identification cards. As a result, the Vietcong were able to more effectively penetrate the villages to access supplies and personnel.|$|E

5|$|Smith headed west, {{across the}} Ligurian Alps, towards {{southern}} France, which he <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> just been invaded by Allied troops, principally Americans, Free French and British. He and Bill were assisted {{along the way}} by Italian partisan groups and other locals. After 10 days on the road, three other Allied personnel—a Frenchman, an Austrian and a Pole—joined the trek, having met Smith and Bill at a partisan camp. The lingua franca of the group having changed to Italian, the five men hiked to the border, where they were taken in by an old farmer, Jean Batiste Chambrin, who gave them {{instructions on how to}} pass the German sentries guarding the border with France. The soldiers decided that because it would be too risky to try to cross all together, Smith and Bill would go first, with the Frenchman, Austrian and Pole following the next day.|$|E
25|$|However, any {{hopes that}} the 5-0 {{whitewash}} would be averted were quickly dispelled by Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga, who both launched into the bowling attack which they <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> had its confidence already battered from the previous encounters of the series.|$|E
25|$|Budisavljević granddaughter, Silvija Szabo, wrote that, as a 1980s Vjesnik {{story had}} {{described}} {{her as a}} mere Communist Party activist inside the Red Cross, which she <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> not been the truth, she decided to read Budisavljević's diary in 1983 to learn {{the full extent of}} her grandmother's deeds. In 2003, the Croatian State Archives' director Josip Kolanović edited and published Budisavljević's war-time diary, translated from German to Croatian by Silvija Szabo.|$|E

25|$|In June 1988 in Perth, Western Australia, John Asciak {{was found}} guilty of conspiring with Barlow and Chambers to import 179grams of heroin. He had been implicated by Barlow when he was interviewed in prison by the National Crime Authority of Australia in 1986. The court heard Asciak {{recruited}} Barlow, who he <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> financial problems, and offered him $6,000 to conduct the drug run. Barlow was later introduced to Chambers in Perth. Asciak, who denied the charges, {{was found guilty}} and sentenced to ten years in prison.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time it was noted that Genie took {{pleasure}} in intentionally dropping or destroying small objects, and enjoyed watching someone else do the same to something she had been playing with. Kent wrote that she did the same series of actions several times over and that it appeared to ease some internal tension for her, and therefore thought she did this to gain control of traumatic childhood experiences. She also showed deep fascination with classical piano music played in front of her, which researchers believed was because she could hear some piano music during her childhood. She did not have the same reaction to recordings, and if someone played anything other than classical music she would change the sheet music to a book which she <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> pieces she liked.|$|E
25|$|William Herschel, {{previously}} a clarinet player, of Bath discovered {{infrared radiation}} on 11 February 1800, {{and the planet}} Uranus in March 1781; he had made important improvements to the reflecting telescope by increasing the mirror diameter. Herschel then built a 20-ft reflecting telescope and invented the star count, working out that the Milky Way was a disc, which he called a grindstone, and the Milky Way was a galaxy but that {{that was all the}} universe contained; he had noticed other nebulas but did not recognise what these were; only when the Hooker telescope was built sufficiently large-enough in California in 1924, did Edwin Hubble realise that these nebulas (Andromeda Galaxy) were other galaxies. The Herschel Space Observatory was launched by ESA in March 2009 to map the Milky Way. Sir Arthur C. Clarke of Minehead invented the idea of artificial satellites; he sent a letter to Harry Wexler who then developed the first weather satellite TIROS-1. Sir Arthur Eddington of Weston-super-Mare was the first to realise that nuclear fusion powered the Sun; previously the age of Sun was thought to be only 20 million years old, which he <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> to be older than that; at the 1920 British Association meeting he said that the Sun converted hydrogen into helium, but he did not know how, and that mass was lost; nuclear fission was only considered in 1933. James Bradley was an important astronomer from Gloucestershire, who discovered the aberration of light.|$|E

500|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? {{was named}} Book of the Year by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association in 1998 {{when it was}} chosen by Christian {{retailers}} as the title they most enjoyed selling; Yancey's The Jesus I Never <b>Knew</b> <b>had</b> received the same award two years earlier. In 1998, Christianity Today compared What's So Amazing About Grace? to Joel A. Carpenter's Revive Us Again, writing that both books productively analyze Christian fundamentalism. That year, Karla Vallance's Christian Science Monitor review called the book similarly sentimental to John Newton's hymn [...] "Amazing Grace".|$|E
500|$|When Major-General Hunter won Abu Hamed {{from its}} defenders, the Mahdist {{reinforcements}} he <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> been racing towards the town since his force was spotted on August 4 {{were less than}} twenty miles away. Running low on supplies and recognizing the severe exhaustion of his men, Hunter doubted his ability to hold the town in the likely event of a counter-attack from these approaching forces. However, the small troop of Mahdist cavalry that had fled the battle met the incoming detachment and informed them of the events, whereupon they immediately changed course due southwards {{in the opposite direction}} of Abu Hamed. The commanding Mahdist officer at Berber heard of the battle on August 9, and, facing incoming Anglo-Egyptian forces as well as violent internal division, decided to evacuate the city in late August. Major-General Hunter then left Abu Hamed, where he and his column had remained since the battle, and moved south to occupy the city and further advance the campaign.|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} they {{went to work on}} the {{airstrip}} with hand tools. Trees were felled, potholes filled in and a windsock erected. Fourteen gliders were supposed to fly in three light tractors, three mowers, a wheeled rake and other engineering equipment from Dobodura. Because the lack of opposition made immediate resupply non-urgent, and because he had doubts about the proficiency of the glider pilots, whom he <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> undergone only minimal training, General Blamey decided that the glider operation was not worth the risk to the glider pilots or their passengers and cancelled it, substituting instead the afternoon supply run by specially modified B-17s. Lacking mowers, the Kunai grass was cut by hand by the pioneers, sappers, paratroops and native civilians and burned, causing the destruction of some stores and equipment that had been lost in the long grass and [...] "a swirl of black dust". By 11:00 on 6 September, the [...] strip— which had not been used for over a year— had been extended to [...]|$|E

500|$|Life Begins was {{inspired}} by Bullen's re-evaluation {{of the lives of}} people around him as they approached 40 years old. During a conversation with a friend he realised that three women he <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> had failed marriages {{by the time they reached}} 40. The series was designed as a vehicle for actress Sarah Lancashire, who had signed an exclusive [...] "golden handcuffs" [...] deal with ITV. Two months after the series was announced, Lancashire left Life Begins, feeling unable to commit to a potentially long-running series. ITV replaced Lancashire with Caroline Quentin. Life Begins concerns Maggie Mee, who believes she is in a loving relationship with her husband Phil (Alexander Armstrong). When Phil announces on a family holiday that he is leaving her, she realises that she must begin her life again. Bullen wrote the series with John Forte. The first series was broadcast in 2004. As with Cold Feet, he integrated events from his own life into the storylines; Maggie's father suffers from Alzheimer's disease as does one of Bullen's own relatives. He researched Maggie's travel agency job by spending a week at a travel agents' in Bristol.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 December 1941, [...] "secretary of Nansen International Office for Refugees {{received}} a letter from the stateless Jews Nora Lustig, Fritz Lusting and Leo Eitinger.

2500|$|In January 1917, Major Kalle {{transmitted}} radio {{messages to}} Berlin describing the helpful activities of a German spy code-named H-21, whose biography so closely matched Zelle's {{that it was}} patently obvious that Agent H-21 could only be Mata Hari. The Deuxième Bureau intercepted the messages and, from the information they contained, identified H-21 as Mata Hari. The messages were in a code [...] that German intelligence <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> already been broken by the French, suggesting that the messages were contrived to have Zelle arrested by the French.|$|E

2500|$|Suddenly, Crocco was {{betrayed by}} Giuseppe Caruso, {{one of his}} lieutenants. Caruso went to the Piedmontese {{authorities}} and revealed Crocco's location and hideouts. Under the command of General Emilio Pallavicini (known to have stopped Garibaldi's expedition against Rome in the calabrian mountains), the royal army engaged and defeated Crocco. His band suffered many casualties, {{and some of his}} lieutenants, such as Ninco Nanco and Giuseppe [...] "Sparviero" [...] Schiavone, were captured and executed by firing squad, leaving Crocco to retire toward the Ofanto zone. After losing the last battle, he was forced to flee to the Papal States, hoping for help from Pius IX, whom he <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> previously supported the southern opposition.|$|E
2500|$|Sometime in late 1981, the Replacements {{played a}} song called [...] "Kids Don't Follow". Jesperson was {{convinced}} the song sounded like a hit and pleaded with the Twin/Tone co-owners Stark and Hallman, [...] "I {{will do anything to}} get this out. I will hand-stamp jackets if I have to." [...] The partners agreed to fund the recording, but Jesperson and virtually everyone he <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> to hand-stamp ten thousand white record jackets. The band recorded eight tracks within a week, with Jesperson as producer. Their [...] "balls-to-the-wall hardcore punk attempt", their first EP Stink, containing [...] "Kids Don't Follow" [...] and seven other songs, was released in June 1982, six months after the Chicago show.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years of the Second World War she worked, {{probably}} as a secretary, [...] at Bletchley Park, the secret code breaking establishment. In 1944 she joined the Red Cross and was sent to Egypt. She is presumed to have wanted to return to Crete where some of the men she <b>knew</b> <b>had</b> worked with the Resistance, as did many academics associated with the British School at Athens. She and Eccles managed to travel from Libya to Crete in 1944 when the island was still considered dangerous. After her friend left for Athens she stayed on in Crete working for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), was awarded the bronze medal of the Greek Red Cross for her courage, and became a local heroine. Through UNRRA she met her husband who received many honours for acts of wartime bravery.|$|E
