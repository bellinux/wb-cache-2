[...] "There, John, is your flag," [...] Stanley remarked, suggesting the RMC College Flag's red-white-red as a good basis for a distinctive Canadian flag. At the centre, Stanley proposed, should be placed a single red maple leaf instead of the college emblem: a mailed fist holding a sprig of three green maple leaves.|$|E
50|$|On 5 November 2011 Archbishop Betori survived an {{apparent}} assassination attempt. An unidentified man confronted the archbishop outside his office, shot and wounded the prelate's secretary, and waved {{a gun at}} the archbishop before escaping. Fr Paolo Brogi, the archbishop's secretary, was reportedly in satisfactory condition after surgery to repair an abdominal wound. Archbishop Betori and witnesses stated that the gunman said something as he <b>gestured</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> prelate with his firearm, {{but they could not}} understand his intent.|$|E
5000|$|When sent to trial, David Birnie {{pled guilty}} to four counts of murder and one count each of {{abduction}} and rape.

[...] He was sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment. After being found sane enough to stand trial, Catherine Birnie was also sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment by the Supreme Court of Western Australia; under law at the time, both were required to serve 20 years before being eligible for parole.|$|E

5000|$|The {{story is}} told in first person, by a narrator who, it soon becomes clear, is Satan. He briefly recounts his history on Earth and tells how he {{directed}} people toward destructive activity, for instance by teaching them how to make gunpowder. Now the final war is over, and almost everyone has been killed. Satan comes across {{a man and a}} woman, the last survivors, who are inside a transparent dome that keeps out the contaminated air. The two people recognize Satan for who he is; Satan is troubled by their calm certitude, and asks about the elaborate machine that he sees inside their dome. He is told that it is a time machine, and that they are about to go [...] "back to the beginning" [...] to start over, this time without him:The woman said, [...] "You've won Armageddon, but you've lost Earth."I knew the answer to that, of course, but she was a woman and had the last word.I <b>gestured</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> purple darkness outside.

5000|$|Some years ago, {{late one}} night in the bar of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Chicago, Jay was {{performing}} magic with a deck of cards. Also present {{was a friend of}} Mamet and Mosher’s named Christ Nogulich, the director of food and beverage at the hotel. After twenty minutes of disbelief-suspending manipulations, Jay spread the deck face up on the bar counter and asked Nogulich to concentrate on a specific card but not to reveal it. Jay then assembled the deck face down, shuffled, cut it into two piles, and asked Nogulich to point to one of the piles and name his card. “Three of clubs,” Nogulich said, and he was then instructed to turn over the top card. He turned over the three of clubs. Mosher, in what could be interpreted as a passive-aggressive act, quietly announced, “Ricky, you know, I also concentrated on a card.” After an interval of silence, Jay said, “That’s interesting, Gregory, but I only do this for one person at a time.” Mosher persisted: “Well, Ricky, I really was thinking of a card.” Jay paused, frowned, stared at Mosher, and said, “This is a distinct change of procedure.” A longer pause. “All right—what was the card?” “Two of spades.” Jay nodded, and <b>gestured</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> other pile, and Mosher turned over its top card. The deuce of spades. A small riot ensued.|$|E

60|$|Yaqui sat {{his horse}} for a moment, {{motionless}} as stone, his dark face immutable and impassive.

5000|$|Described by the {{announcer}} as an [...] "Extreme Left Anti-Establishment" [...] figure, Koichi began his controversial statement by denouncing Japan as a [...] "horrible nation" [...] and rejecting any possibility for reforms.

60|$|He made a <b>gesture</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{open door}} and then {{went up to the}} table and poured himself out a final stirrup-cup.

3000|$|Happiness was an {{interesting}} case, as only one participant demonstrated prototypical [...] "jumping for joy".
