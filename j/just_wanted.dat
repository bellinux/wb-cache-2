5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E

Having found out that George has made similar calls to CSL for years, Andy {{plans to go to}} the police. Andy answers the phone, and it is George. In Chloe's voice, George says that he <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> someone to listen to him, then warns that he has told the dead woman's son where Andy works. In the background, Glen stands, and points a gun at Andy's head. He calls Andy's name, and Andy turns around to see Glen right before the credits play.|$|E
5|$|Due to lost {{communications}} with Battalion and then Regimental headquarters, and the unit's subsequent capture, its disposition and success at delaying {{the advance of}} the 6th Panzer Army that day was unknown to U.S. commanders. Lt. Lyle Bouck considered the wounding of most of his men and the capture of his entire unit a failure. When the war ended five months later, the platoon's men, who were split between two prisoner-of-war camps, <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to get home. It was only after the war that Bouck learned that his platoon had prevented the lead German infantry elements from advancing and had delayed by about 20 hours their armored units' advance. On October 26, 1981, after considerable lobbying, a Congressional hearing, and letter-writing by Bouck, {{every member of the}} unit were finally recognized for their valor that day, making the platoon most decorated American unit of its size of World War II.|$|E

5|$|Hopsin {{detailed}} the album to The Source saying, There's {{a variety of}} music on there. There's crazy, wild lyrics. There's sad, emotional lyrics and even funny lyrics. I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full me. I {{have a lot of}} people who love me, but I have a lot of haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or what I put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music that I can do. I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to show the full me.|$|E
5|$|After touring Who's Next, and needing time {{to write}} a follow-up, Townshend insisted that the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group {{activity}} until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, {{and a desire to}} party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are recounted in James D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, Lambert & Stamp. Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of Tommy with Lou Reizner.|$|E

After going to the bookstore to buy The God Delusion, Brian meets an atheist named Carolyn, {{who happens to be}} looking for the same book. Brian becomes interested in Carolyn, and the two begin to date. When she invites him to her house, Stewie apprehends Brian and tells him that his relationships fail because he has sex with his girlfriends immediately when they meet. Brian realizes that Stewie is right and decides to listen to his advice. However, he finds out that Carolyn has begun to date Cleveland, since Brian did not want to have sex for the three weeks they have dated, and assumed he <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to be friends. A heartbroken Brian tries to deal with his loss, but keeps running into Cleveland and Carolyn having sex in various locations. Blaming Stewie for his advice that cost him a relationship with Carolyn, Brian is about ready to give up on love. Apologizing for his botched attempt to help him out, Stewie suggests that he can convince Cleveland's ex-wife, Loretta, to reconcile with him.|$|E

5|$|Fox {{negotiated}} a deal which would prove extremely lucrative for Groening, {{in which he}} retained {{a large portion of}} revenue from merchandising. To animate the short segments, Brooks and company settled on Klasky Csupo, a small animation house who offered to produce the cartoons cheaply. Brooks initially <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to animate the shorts through the basic line drawings, and Klasky-Csupo offered color for the same cost. The studio only employed three young animators—CalArts graduates Bill Kopp, Wes Archer, and David Silverman—who adapted Groening's scripts for animation in one week, doing layouts, animation and inbetweening by hand in the very short amount of time. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the three, and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes. Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.|$|E
5|$|At that time, Antoine had {{a student}} named Martin Jeanfils, an {{employee}} at the Corbeau coal. A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot sprains {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe. Antoine and he were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice of the art of healing. Jeanfils explained to the court that he <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to do disappear the pain, and that he always sent his patients to doctors. For his part, Antoine told the judge that he simply {{put his hand on the}} forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs; he denied the charge, and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of Antoine, who distributed money to the poor. Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907, and the courtroom was entirely filled. Dr. Delville and the parents of a child cured by Antoine testified at the witness box, Mr. Dupret then pronounced the indictment. Adjourned, The judgment was adjourned and was finally, on 21 June 1907, President Hamoir acquitted the two men, who were absent in court then. Following an appeal by the prosecutor, Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Court again on 16 October 1907. The General Advocate Meyers made the indictment, analyzing the legislation of 1918 on the illegal art of healing, claiming that it was not what Antoine did. On 22 October of the same year, the acquittal was confirmed, and Meyers was deeply thanked by several faithful.|$|E
