The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has {{attracted}} the world’s attention {{and much of}} its wrath, primarily because of its rapid expansion in Iraq and Syria, its brutal treatment of religious minorities (e. g., Yazidis, Christians), and its beheadings of hostages from Western countries. At this point, {{it is unclear whether}} the group represents a global or a sectarian form of jihadism. Is it similar to al-Qaeda, which seeks to target the <b>far</b> <b>enemy</b> (i. e., Western countries such as the U. S. that some in the Muslim world believe exert a corrupting influence on Islamic countries), or is it more sectarian in that it focuses on targeting what it perceives to be the near enemies of Islam (i. e., “corrupt” Islamic nations) ? In this paper we address this debate by examining ISIS’s online presence on the social media platform, Twitter, which serves as a forum for supporters to post and receive messages, images, videos, and links to websites to and from a wide-audience. The speed at which users can transmit and receive information via Twitter suggests that an analysis of ISIS-related user accounts and the key themes and concepts they disseminate can contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the group’s overall narrative. We examine ISIS’s online presence by extracting from Twitter the semantic networks of its most influential users. We find that a shift may be occurring in the ISIS narrative, from one that focuses on the near enemy to one that focuses on the <b>far</b> <b>enemy.</b> Ironically, this shift may have resulted from the actions of the U. S. and its Western allies...|$|E

Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Bahrain found themselves {{at a crossroads}} between reform and chaos. The Muslim Ummah was ripe for influence from provocative voices such as Al Qaeda. Al Qaedas rhetoric failed to capitalize on this golden opportunity, however. It issued a number of statements {{to the people of}} the Muslim world that demonstrated its inability to find relevance during this time of change. Its narrative of jihad against the <b>Far</b> <b>Enemy</b> failed to resonate with Tunisians who sought greater economic opportunity, with Egyptians who wanted greater self-determination, or with Libyans who were joined by Western nations to topple Gaddafi. To Bahrainis, who underwent a struggle for change against King Khalifa and his security forces, Al Qaeda was notably silent. Al Qaeda and its affiliates missed this golden opportunity to reverse the decline in support it had experienced since September 11, 2001. Its statements reveal a lack of new ideas and older ones that are often inconsistent among its affiliates, and expose fissures within the network. As its messaging demonstrates, Al Qaeda likely will experience continued decline and marginalization in the years to come. Major, United States Arm...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedViolent Salafi jihadism, or VSJ, motivated the September 11 hijackers, {{but it is}} poorly understood by homeland security practitioners and not addressed in U. S. national strategies. This thesis argues that using precise language to define this threat is necessary to achieve a common understanding of the VSJ movement and posits that, based on the resources focused on this threat for the past 14 years, a unified national strategy is warranted. The use of the generic term terrorism {{has resulted in a}} vast array of counterterrorism experts, many of whom have little or no understanding of VSJ. An unintended consequence of conflating VSJ with motivation behind other Muslim groups using terrorist tactics is that it feeds the false narrative that VSJ represents Islam. Muslims in Asia and Africa are by far more often victimized by VSJ than is the <b>far</b> <b>enemy</b> in Europe and the United States. This thesis argues that imprecise language referencing the threat from VSJ has led to diluted and sometimes counterproductive, counterterrorism strategies. It also argues that theUnited States should disaggregate terrorist groups that do not directly threaten theUnited States and, instead, focus on VSJ with unity of effort across the federal government.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in Culture and Conflict Review (Fall 2011), v. 5 no. 3 "With the Arab world continuing to experience an unprecedented wave of people-powered revolutions that caught both the West and its Islamist opponents in the War on Terror off guard, {{we are beginning to}} see the strategic principles articulated and successfully implemented by Gandhi in his liberation struggle against the militarily more powerful British raj supersede the more bellicose but perhaps less effective efforts by both terrorist and counterterrorist, insurgent and counterinsurgent, in their deadly but inconclusive dance. Tired of this long fight, and its endless use of force and violence by both sides with the civilian populace caught in between as if in a deadly vise, the popular mass of the Arab street has risen up to set things right, using methods overlooked by combatants on both sides, alienated as equally from the nihilistic violence of the terrorists as from the unholy alliance of the West with the repressive dictatorships which stood at the West's side, using Western funds and Western arms to repress their own people. Osama Bin Laden long sought to bring his war to the <b>far</b> <b>enemy,</b> and by striking fear in the hearts of the West, to cut off the benefactors of the 'apostate regimes' he sought to overthrow. And in many ways he has succeeded, putting into a motion a dynamic and cascading series of strategic interactions that empowered the very people he sought to liberate. The irony is, however, that these newly liberated peoples reject not only the tyrannies of these apostate regimes, but the Islamist vision and the violent means employed in the global jihad. What we are seeing, in short, is the start of the post-jihad era, where the polarized bifurcation of secular and Islamist is as unnatural and unsustainable as the ideological split that defined the Cold War. ...|$|E
