We report a precise modeling of the recorded reflectivity data, which exhibit multiexponential decays and changes in sign, using a standard point defect model and taking into account the effects of the band <b>filling,</b> <b>band</b> gap renormalization, and trap absorption. We show that the valence-band hole population {{plays an important role in}} the behavior of the signals, and that it must be taken into account in order to optimize low-temperature-grown GaAs-based devices.

40|$|We present {{theoretical}} {{studies of}} the intrinsic spin orbit torque (SOT) in a single domain ferromagnetic layer with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism for a model Hamiltonian. We find that, to the first order in SOC, the intrinsic SOT has only the field-like torque symmetry and {{can be interpreted as}} the longitudinal spin current induced by the charge current and Rashba field. We analyze the results in terms of the material related parameters of the electronic structure, such as band <b>filling,</b> <b>band</b> width, exchange splitting, as well as the Rashba SOC strength. On the basis of these numerical and analytical results, we discuss the magnitude and sign of SOT. Our results show that the different sign of SOT in identical ferromagnetic layers with different supporting layers, e. g. Co/Pt and Co/Ta, could be attributed to electrostatic doping of the ferromagnetic layer by the support. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

Not only can it solve the problems existing in the traditional photoelectron streak camera such as the decrease of the dynamic range caused by space charge effect and incapability of detecting the infrared light signal for photoelectric cathode, but also it has the advantages of simple structure, systemic stability. And the theoretical temporal resolution can reach up to picosecond scale even sub picosecond scale. For the AlxGa 1 -xAs/GaAs/AlxGa 1 -x As planar waveguide light deflector, we discuss in detail the change of the refractive index of the GaAs with time under the common influences of band <b>filling,</b> <b>band</b> gap shrinkage and free carrier absorption effect; when the change of the refractive index is on the order of 0. 01 and the ratio of the signal spot size to the width of the waveguide p = 0. 5, the theoretical temporal resolution can reach 2 ps; finally, the theoretical spatial resolution is calculated to be 17 lp/mm according to the condition of static experiment, while the experimental results show that spatial resolution is 9 lp/mm...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel variational method to {{calculate}} the two-hole propagators relevant for Auger spectroscopy in transition metal oxides. This method {{can be thought of}} as an intermediary step between the full solution (which is difficult to generalize to systems with partially <b>filled</b> <b>bands)</b> and the impurity approximation. Like the former, our solution has full translational invariance, and like the latter, it can be generalized to certain types of systems with partially <b>filled</b> <b>bands.</b> Here we compare both our variational approximation and the impurity approximation against the exact solution for a simple one-dimensional model with <b>filled</b> <b>bands.</b> We show that when the energies of the eigenstates residing primarily on the transition metal ions do not overlap with those of the eigenstates residing primarily on Oxygen ions, both approximations are valid but the variational approach is superior.

25|$|In reality, {{there is}} {{interaction}} between the electrons {{with each other and}} the atomic cores of the crystal. This has several consequences: For example, the unambiguous relation between energy and momentum of an electronic state is broken and an electronic band structure is formed. Measuring the momentum of one electronic state gives a distribution of momenta which are all separated by reciprocal lattice vectors. Hence, an ACAR measurement on a solid with completely <b>filled</b> <b>bands</b> (i.e. on an insulator) gives a continuous distribution. An ACAR measurement on a metal has discontinuities where bands cross the Fermi level in all Brillouin zones in reciprocal space.

40|$|We report first {{principles}} LDA calculations {{of the electronic}} structure and thermoelectric properties of β -Zn_ 4 Sb_ 3. The material {{is found to be}} a low carrier density metal with a complex Fermi surface topology and non-trivial dependence of Hall concentration on <b>band</b> <b>filling.</b> The <b>band</b> structure is rather covalent, consistent with experimental observations of good carrier mobility. Calculations of the variation with <b>band</b> <b>filling</b> are used to extract the doping level (<b>band</b> <b>filling)</b> from the experimental Hall number. At this <b>band</b> <b>filling,</b> which actually corresponds to 0. 1 electrons per 22 atom unit cell, the calculated thermopower and its temperature dependence are in good agreement with experiment. The high Seebeck coefficient in a metallic material is remarkable, and arises in part from the strong energy dependence of the Fermiology near the experimental <b>band</b> <b>filling.</b> Improved thermoelectric performance is predicted for lower doping levels which corresponds to higher Zn concentrations.

50|$|The {{classical}} {{band structure}} of {{solid state physics}} predicts the Fermi level to lie in a band gap for insulators and in the conduction band for metals, which means metallic behavior is seen for compounds with partially <b>filled</b> <b>bands.</b> However, some compounds have been found which show insulating behavior even for partially <b>filled</b> <b>bands.</b> This {{is due to the}} electron-electron correlation, since electrons cannot be seen as noninteracting. Mott considers a lattice model with just one electron per site. Without taking the interaction into account, each site could be occupied by two electrons, one with spin up and one with spin down. Due to the interaction the electrons would then feel a strong Coulomb repulsion, which Mott argued splits the band in two: The lower band is then occupied by the first electron per site, the upper by the second. If each site is only occupied by a single electron the lower <b>band</b> is completely <b>filled</b> and the upper band completely empty, the system thus a so-called Mott insulator.|$|R

40|$|The scaling {{limit of}} the less than half filled {{attractive}} Hubbard chain is studied. This is a continuum limit in which the particle number per lattice site, n, is kept finite (0 <n< 1) while adjusting the interaction and bandwidth in a such way {{that there is a}} finite mass gap. We construct this limit both for the spectrum and the secular equations describing the excitations. We find, that similarly to the half filled case, the limiting model has a massive and a massless sector. The structure of the massive sector is closely analogous to that of the half <b>filled</b> <b>band</b> and consequently to the chiral invariant SU(2) Gross-Neveu (CGN) model. The structure of the massless sector differs from that of the half <b>filled</b> <b>band</b> case: the excitations are of particle and hole type, however they are not uniquely defined. The energy and the momentum of this sector exhibits a tower structure corresponding to a conformal field theory with c= 1 and SU(2) xSU(2) symmetry. The energy-momentum spectrum and the zero temperature free energy of the states with finite density coincides with that of the half filled case supporting the identification of the limiting model with the SU(2) symmetric CGN theory.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} fully symmetric wavefunctions for the spin-polarized fractional Chern insulators (FCI) and time-reversal-invariant fractional topological insulators (FTI) in two dimensions using the parton approach. We {{show that the}} lattice symmetry gives rise to many different FCI and FTI phases even with the same filling fraction ν (and the same quantized Hall conductance σ_xy in FCI case). They have different symmetry-protected topological orders, which are characterized by different projective symmetry groups. We mainly focus on FCI phases which are realized in a partially <b>filled</b> <b>band</b> with Chern number one. The low-energy gauge groups of a generic σ_xy= 1 /m· e^ 2 /h FCI wavefunctions can be either SU(m) or the discrete group Z_m, and {{in the latter case}} the associated low-energy physics are described by Chern-Simons-Higgs theories.

Possible non-Abelian FCI phases which may be realized in a partially <b>filled</b> <b>band</b> with Chern number two are discussed. Generic FTI wavefunctions in the absence of spin conservation are also presented whose low-energy gauge groups can be either SU(m) × SU(m) or Z_m× Z_m.
