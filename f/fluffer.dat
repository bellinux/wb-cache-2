40|$|A new garbage {{processing}} {{technology has}} been developed that sterilizes and separates inorganic and organic components of municipal solid waste. The non-composted byproduct of this process, <b>Fluff</b> ®, {{has the potential to}} be utilized as a soil amendment to improve soil conditions in highly degraded soils. A study was initiated to evaluate <b>Fluff</b> as a soil amendment for establishing native grasses on disturbed US Army training lands. The <b>Fluff</b> was incorporated into a sandy loam soil at Fort Benning Military Reservation, GA on two sites: a moderately degraded and a highly degraded soil. The <b>Fluff</b> was incorporated at rates of 0, 18, 36, 72, and 143 Mg ha− 1 to assess the effects on soil properties for two growing seasons. The addition of <b>Fluff</b> improved available plant nutrients and soil pH levels at both sites. Also, <b>Fluff</b> reduced the level of soil bulk density and increased soil concentration of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Because no adverse environmental effects were detected and <b>Fluff</b> improved soil physical and nutrient conditions as well as improving perennial grass establishment with increasing application rates, land application of <b>Fluff</b> to degraded US Army training grounds could be considered a viable and beneficial alternative to current waste management practices...|$|R
