25|$|Captain <b>Henry</b> <b>Foster</b> {{stopped at}} Fernando de Noronha during his {{scientific}} survey expedition as commander of HMS Chanticleer, which {{had set out}} in 1828. As well as surveying coasts and ocean currents, Foster used a Kater invariable pendulum to make observations on gravity. He took the island as the point of junction of his double line of longitudes setting out his survey. He was given considerable assistance by the Governor of Fernando Noronha who let Foster use part of his own house for the pendulum experiments. The longitude of Rio de Janeiro taken by Foster was among those {{on one side of}} a significant discrepancy, which meant that the charts of South America were in doubt.|$|E

She is [...] {{part of the}} 30% of {{the female}} population that are not freemartins (Sterile women). Lenina is promiscuous and popular but somewhat quirky in their society: she had a four-month relation with <b>Henry</b> <b>Foster,</b> choosing not {{to have sex with}} anyone but him for a period of time. She is basically happy and well-conditioned but will use soma to suppress unwelcome emotions, as is expected. Lenina has a date with Bernard, to whom she feels ambivalently attracted, and she goes to the Reservation with him. On returning to civilisation, she tries and fails to seduce John the Savage. John loves and desires Lenina but he is repelled by her forwardness and the prospect of pre-marital sex, rejecting her as an [...] "impudent strumpet". Lenina visits John at the lighthouse but he attacks her with a whip, unwittingly inciting onlookers to do the same. Her exact fate is left unspecified.|$|E

He explored the South Atlantic, and especially the South Shetland Islands; Port Foster on Deception Island, which is the caldera of an extinct volcano, is named after him. [...] On the expedition, the ship visited the River Plate and Staten Island of Argentina, Cape Horn of Chile at the southernmost tip of South America, New Zealand, South Georgia, and rounded the Cape of Good Hope. From there she sailed back to South America via Saint Helena, Ascension Island and Fernando de Noronha. Chanticleer reached the South American coast at Saint Louis, Maranham. From there she sailed up the Amazon river to Pará. Chanticleer next arrived at Port of Spain, Trinidad, sailing from there to La Guaira and on to Portobelo, Colón. Foster sent his first lieutenant, Horatio Thomas Austin across the Isthmus of Darien. After Austin returned, Foster set out to conduct some more scientific tests in the same area.

After Foster's death, the ship's command fell to Austin. He sailed Chanticleer across the Atlantic Ocean to Falmouth in 1831.|$|E
