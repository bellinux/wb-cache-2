40|$|Appendices {{held with}} print copy in LibraryThis {{document}} describes {{the design of}} a low-cost apparatus for the measurement of ocean wave parameters. The design is implemented using magnetometers to measure attitude of a <b>free-floating</b> <b>buoy,</b> and accelerometers to measure motion of the buoy, and a microprocessor to analyse the data. Calibration of the sensors is described, as well as the use of digital filtering in the analysis of the signals to determine attitude and motion. Testing of the system, both on land and on water, is described, including protection of the devices from the corrosive effects of salt water...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{two-dimensional}} computational flow solver for simulation of two-way in-teractions between moving rigid bodies and two-fluid flows. The fluids {{are assumed to}} be incompressible and immiscible. The two-step projection method along with Graphics Pro-cessing Unit (GPU) acceleration is employed to solve the flow equations. The fluid-solid interaction is captured by using the fictitious domain method. A consistent mass and mo-mentum scheme is implemented, which allows for simulation of multiphase flows character-ized by large density ratios. The evolution of interfaces in the three-phase system is tracked by using the volume-of-fluid method with two scalar functions, representing the solid domain and one of the fluids. A geometrical approach is employed to reconstruct the interfaces in cells containing three phases and capture the intersection of phase interfaces (triple point). The performance and accuracy of the flow solver are assessed through a set of canonical test cases. Then, it is used to simulate the interactions between a <b>free-floating</b> <b>buoy</b> and waves generated by a bottom-hinged paddle in a wave tank...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of individual gadoids to a bottom-trawling vessel {{has been observed}} in situ in the Barents Sea using a <b>free-floating</b> <b>buoy</b> and acoustic target-tracking methods. More than 20 000 tracks were analysed in terms of velocity changes in vertical, athwarthship, and alongship direction relative to the vessel, the warps, and the trawl, respectively. The fish starts diving about 15 min before vessel passing. This coincides with the time the trawl is running and not with the gradual increase in vessel noise caused by the approaching vessel. The change in horizontal movement is more gradual and is directed away from the vessel in the alongship direction, but towards the vessel in the athwarthship direction. The strongest and sharpest response {{is related to the}} trawl warps. A strong herding in front of the warps is seen. Closer to the bottom, an athwarthship herding reaction is seen away from the trawl doors or possibly the lower parts of the warps. There were only minor differences when grouping the tracks according to light level, fish size, and fish density...|$|E
40|$|Newsletter. It’s {{objective}} is to inform on the activities undertaken by the center, {{within the framework of}} ODINAFRICA 1 and related programs. The present issue presents an article emphasizing the importance of the ARGO 2 data collected in ocean environments worldwide, including those of East Africa and the Mozambique Channel. ARGO is an array of 3000 <b>free-floating</b> <b>buoys</b> making vertical profiles (temperature and salinity) of the upper 2000 m of the ocean once every 10 days (Fig 1). These data allows us to address a new range of oceano-graphic problems, including the issue of tropical cyclone induced surface cooling and intensification, as indicated in the article (page 5). The new data represent a challenge for data managers. The coastal data management systems should be modernized and integrated to promote interdisciplinary studies and provide useful information products to policy makers, fisheries and the general public. Fig. 1 Most ARGO floats drift at a depth of 1000 m for about 9 days, then they make a profile of tem-perature and salinity from 2000 m to the surface, after descending. Then they stay at the surface for about five hrs, sending the data to a satellite, after that they descend again to resting depth (1000 m) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{superpressure}} balloon {{was developed}} to provide a method of obtaining global winds at all altitudes from 5 to 30 km. If a balloon {{could be made to}} fly for several weeks at a constant altitude, and if it could be tracked accurately on its global circuits, the balloon would provide a tag for the air parcel in which it was embedded. The Lagrangian data on the atmospheric circulation would provide a superior data input to the numerical model. The Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) was initiated in large part based on the promise of this technique coupled with <b>free-floating</b> ocean <b>buoys</b> and satellite radiometers. The initial name proposed by Charney for GARP was SABABURA 'SAtellite BAlloon BUoy RAdiometric system' (Charney, 1966). However, although the superpressure balloon exceeded its designers' expectations for flight duration in the stratosphere (longest flight duration of 744 days), flight duration below 10 km was limited by icing in super-cooled clouds to a few days. The balloon was relegated to a secondary role during the GARP Special Observing Periods. The several major superpressure balloon programs for global wind measurement are described as well as those new developments which make the balloon once again an attractive vehicle for measurement of global winds as a reference and bench-mark system for future satellite systems...|$|R
40|$|Swordfish buoy gear (SBG) is a {{relatively}} new commercial fishery located off the eastern and southern coasts of Florida that began in 2002. The area targeted by this fishery, part of the Florida East Coast statistical area (FEC), has been closed to commercial pelagic longline gear (PLL) since 2001. Swordfish buoy gear has largely taken the place of PLL as a commercial fishery for swordfish (Xiphias gladius) within the FEC. Conceptually, SBG is similar to a vertical longline, with <b>free-floating</b> individual <b>buoys</b> and “high-flyers” connected to approximately 100 meters of monofilament with one or two hooks constituting one “buoy. ” Most vessels currently using this gear are fishing approximately 10 “buoys” simultaneously. Due to the way each individual “buoy” drifts independently with the current, SBG is considered to fish more like PLL than the former NMFS classification of the “handgear” gear type. This study qualitatively compares swordfish catch rates, bycatch rates, and time on hook between contemporary SBG field data and historical PLL observer data from the FEC. Initial analysis shows higher CPUE for SBG vs. PLL (92. 2 to 31. 8 per 1000 hooks), lower bycatch rates (12. 2 to 21. 6 per 1000 hooks), and lower average time on hook (2 : 15 to 6 : 59). Initial conclusions show that SBG is a cleaner and more efficient commercial fishery for swordfish in this area when compared to PLL...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a near-surface ocean profiler, {{which has been}} designed to precisely measure vertical gradients in the top 10  m of the ocean. Variations in the depth of seawater collection are minimized when using the profiler compared to conventional CTD/rosette deployments. The profiler consists of a remotely operated winch mounted on a tethered yet <b>free-floating</b> <b>buoy,</b> which is used to raise and lower a small frame housing sensors and inlet tubing. Seawater at the inlet depth is pumped back to the ship for analysis. The profiler {{can be used to make}} continuous vertical profiles or to target a series of discrete depths. The profiler has been successfully deployed during wind speeds up to 10  m s − 1 and significant wave heights up to 2  m. We demonstrate the potential of the profiler by presenting measured vertical profiles of the trace gases carbon dioxide and dimethylsulfide. Trace gas measurements use an efficient microporous membrane equilibrator to minimize the system response time. The example profiles show vertical gradients in the upper 5  m for temperature, carbon dioxide and dimethylsulfide of 0. 15  °C, 4  µatm and 0. 4  nM respectively...|$|E
40|$|Tracking of {{individual}} fish targets using a split-beam echosounder {{is a common}} method for investigating fish behavior. When mounted on a floating platform like a ship or a buoy, the transducer movement often complicates the process. This paper presents a framework for tracking single targets from such a platform. A filter based on the correlated fish movements between pings is developed to estimate the platform movement, and an extended Kalman filter is used to combine the split-beam measurements and the platform-position estimates. Different methods for gating and data association are implemented and tested with respect to data-association errors, using manually tracked data from a <b>free-floating</b> <b>buoy</b> as a reference. The data association was improved by utilizing the estimated velocity for each track to predict {{the location of the}} next observation. The data association was more robust when estimates of platform tilt/roll were used. Other techniques to estimate position and velocity, like linear regression and smoothing splines, were implemented and tested on a simulated data set. The platform-state estimation improved the estimates for methods like the Kalman filter and a smoothing spline with cross validation, but not for robust methods like linear regression and smoothing spline with a fixed degree of smoothing...|$|E

This study compared swordfish catch and bycatch rates between 56 sets of contemporary SBG field data and historical PLL observer data from the FEC. Catch was dominated by swordfish (91. 4 %), followed by sharks (6. 9 %). Analyses show higher swordfish catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for SBG vs. PLL (202. 4 to 31. 8 per 1000 hooks) and much lower bycatch rates for SBG, including no istiophorid billfish, marine mammal, or sea turtle bycatch during the 56 experimental sets. These data indicate that SBG is a cleaner and more efficient commercial fishery for swordfish in this area when compared to PLL. Additional work using small temperature-depth recorders (TDRs) indicate that the actual fishing depths (57. 3 m ± 19. 2 m) were much shallower than the predicted depths (71. 7 m ± 23. 7 m). On-going depth modeling work with TDR data is described...|$|R
