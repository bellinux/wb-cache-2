40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} my work on characterizing <b>isolated</b> <b>defects</b> in {{zinc oxide}} (ZnO). In chapter 1, I will briefly review the major strength of quantum information processing over classical computation. I will then review the basic properties of nitrogen-vacancy centers, the most-studied point defect species in diamond, {{and how they}} motivate the search for defects of similar properties in other semiconductor materials for defect-based quantum information processing. In chapter 2, I will describe our initial study on the optical properties of successfully <b>isolated</b> <b>defects</b> in ZnO: their fluorescence spectra, excited state lifetimes, and their photodynamics including blinking. In chapter 3, I will detail my work on extending the capability of an atomic force microscope to include simultaneous imaging in a confocal geometry. In chapter 4, I will discuss possible directions for our defect studies. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|E

40|$|Rotating {{bending fatigue}} tests {{were carried out}} on {{quenched}} and low temperature tempered SAE 9254 spring steels having two kinds of microstructure in which either <b>isolated</b> <b>defects</b> (retained ferrite) or connected defects (proeutectoid ferrite) are dispersed, with {{a special interest in}} the transition of surface to subsurface fracture known as "Fish-eye fracture" in high strength steel. Discussions were made {{of the relationship between the}} fatigue fracture mode transition and the surface conditions, and also of the role of the microstructure in the formation of the Fish-eye pattern. Results show that (1) the fracture mode transition occurs in the material having <b>isolated</b> <b>defects</b> in the microstructure when a surface fracture mode is prevented by strengthening the surface layer with mechanical polishing and, (2) such a fracture mode transition is associated with the change in fatigue crack initiation process from slip band cracking of surface retained ferrite to cleavage cracking of internal retained ferrite...|$|E

We describe a case of neuronal migration disorder in which the computed tomography scan showed the presence of lissencephaly, colpocephaly. and Septal agenesis.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} and interactions of edge dislocations in a nearly aligned sheared lamellar mesophase is analysed to provide {{insights into the}} relationship between disorder and rheology. First, the mesoscale permeation and momentum equations for the displacement field {{in the presence of}} external forces are derived from the model H equations for the concentration and momentum field. The secondary flow generated due to the mean shear around an <b>isolated</b> <b>defect</b> is calculated, and the excess viscosity due to the presence of the defect is determined from the excess energy dissipation due to the secondary flow. The excess viscosity for an <b>isolated</b> <b>defect</b> is found to increase with system size in the cross-stream direction as L- 3 / 2 for an <b>isolated</b> <b>defect,</b> though this divergence is cut-off due to interactions in a defect suspension. As the defects are sheared past each other due to the mean flow, the Peach-Koehler force due to elastic interaction between pairs of defects is found to cause no net displacement relative to each other as they approach from large separation to the distance of closest approach. The equivalent force due to viscous interactions is found to increase the separation for defects of opposite sign, and decrease the separation for defects of same sign. During defect interactions, we find that there is no buckling instability due to dilation of layers for systems of realistic size. However, there is another mechanism, which is the velocity difference generated across a slightly deformed bilayer due to the mean shear, which could result in the creation of new defects.

We find that, at temperatures and hydrogen partial pressures of practical interest, MgH 2 is capable of accommodating only very small concentrations of hydrogen vacancies, which consist mainly of <b>isolated</b> <b>defects</b> rather than vacancy clusters, contrary to what is expected from a simple energetic analysis.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effects of}} the coupling between the orientational order of the two monolayers in flat nematic bilayers. We show that the presence of a topological defect on one bilayer generates a nontrivial orientational texture on both monolayers. Therefore, one cannot consider <b>isolated</b> <b>defects</b> on one monolayer, but rather associated pairs of defects on either monolayer, which we call bi-defects. Bi-defects generally produce walls, such that the textures of the two monolayers are identical outside the walls, and different in their interior. We suggest some experimental conditions in which these structures could be observed. Comment: RevTeX, 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|We examine {{harmonic}} oscillator defects {{coupled to}} a photon {{field in the}} environs of an optical fiber. Using techniques borrowed or extended from the theory of two dimensional quantum fields with boundaries and defects, {{we are able to}} compute exactly a number of interesting quantities. We calculate the scattering S-matrices (i. e. the reflection and transmission amplitudes) of the photons off a single defect. We determine using techniques derived from thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) the thermodynamic potentials of the interacting photon-defect system. And we compute several correlators of physical interest. We find the photon occupancy at finite temperature, the spontaneous emission spectrum from the decay of an excited state, and the correlation functions of the defect degrees of freedom. In an extension of the single defect theory, we find the photonic band structure that arises from a periodic array of harmonic oscillators. In another extension, we examine a continuous array of defects and exactly derive its dispersion relation. With some differences, the spectrum is similar to that found for EM wave propagation in covalent crystals. We then add to this continuum theory <b>isolated</b> <b>defects,</b> so as to obtain a more realistic model of defects embedded in a frequency dependent dielectric medium. We do this both with a single isolated defect and with an array of <b>isolated</b> <b>defects,</b> and so compute how the S-matrices and the band structure change in a dynamic medium. 12 / 9...|$|E
40|$|Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is a foetal {{abnormality}} affecting diaphragm {{and lung}} development {{with a high}} mortality rate despite advances in foetal and neonatal therapy.

40|$|We {{have studied}} a broad {{photoluminescence}} band in high-mobility freestanding 200 -μm-thick GaN template prepared by hydride vapor-phase epitaxy. Variable-excitation intensity and energy experiments showed two defect-related bands: a yellow luminescence (YL) band at about 2. 15 eV {{and a green}} luminescence (GL) band at about 2. 43 eV. In contrast to epitaxial GaN samples prepared by both vapor-phase and molecular-beam epitaxy, the YL {{in the sample studied}} is weak and can be easily saturated. However, the GL is dominant. We attribute the GL to <b>isolated</b> <b>defects</b> involving galliumvacancies and the YL to the same defect, but bound to dislocations, or possibly to structuralsurface defects...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{long-range}} anisotropic elastic deformations on electronic structure in superconductors are analyzed {{within the framework}} of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. Cases of twin boundaries and <b>isolated</b> <b>defects</b> are considered as illustrations. We find that the superconducting order parameter is depressed in the regions where pronounced lattice deformation occurs. The calculated local density of states suggests that the electronic structure is strongly modulated in response to lattice deformations, and propagates to longer distances. In particular, this allows the trapping of low-lying quasiparticle states around defects. Some of our predictions can be directly tested by STM experiments.

40|$|Heterostructured (β/γ) -AgI {{exhibits}} a spontaneous lattice polarization not {{accounted for in}} standard space-charge models. This polarization field dominates the positional variation of energies of <b>isolated</b> <b>defects,</b> and Ag(+) vacancies and interstitials are stabilized at alternate [β/γ] interfaces. This suggests enhanced Frenkel pair separation, analogous to electronic charge separation in polar semiconductor heterostructures. Stoichiometric systems are, however, characterized by associated Frenkel pairs due to strong V(Ag) -Ag(i) interactions and show no enhancement of defect numbers. In nonstoichiometric systems, lattice polarization does direct {{the distribution of the}} excess defect species, and defect-defect interactions enhance local Frenkel pair concentrations at interfaces, suggesting that nonstoichiometry is critical to the extreme room-temperature ionic conductivities observed in heterostructured AgI nanoplates...|$|E

The specific role of this cluster in heart and lung development remains unclear, but the observations described above show that these miRNAs are normally highly expressed in embryonic lung and decrease with maturity. Moreover, transgenic expression of these miRNAs specifically in lung epithelium results in severe developmental defects with enhanced proliferation andinhibition of differentiation of epithelial cells.Furthermore, mouse hematopoiesis occurring in the absence of miR-17-92 leads to an <b>isolated</b> <b>defect</b> in B cell development.|$|R
