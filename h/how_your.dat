25|$|Character {{statistics}} {{alter the}} combat system {{by the individual}} qualities of a character. Statistics are split into five categories: Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Will, and Luck. Strength, Intelligence, and Dexterity all determine the base attack power of melee, magic, and ranged, respectively. Dexterity also determines damage balance during melee combat. Will affects <b>how</b> <b>your</b> character absorbs strong blows and how much damage is done to enemies. A character's luck rating may improve the chance of high hits, gathering, and increases the chance of lucky drops.|$|E

25|$|You write: „in {{order to}} avoid {{unnecessary}} bloodshed“. Who {{is the cause of}} this bloodshed? We or you? Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched <b>how</b> <b>your</b> soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Fool in Love" [...] is a rhapsodic ballad, which {{incorporates}} acoustic {{and electric}} guitars, synthesizers and drums. Lyrically, Rihanna tells {{of how she}} has met a relatively good man who her parents do not approve of, but requests that they accept her decision {{to be with him}} due to their love for each other, despite familial concerns. Rihanna insists that she is in love, singing [...] "Papa he's quite a man, he adores me/ He's my biggest fan." [...] She then claims that he has taken a hold over her, singing [...] "We're too far down the hole/ He's got a hold on my soul." [...] Rihanna's vocal performance in the song was described as the singer's [...] "biggest ornamented" [...] song by Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail, as well as noting that the singer emotes a sense of fatality in her vocals during the bass sequences in the song. [...] "Fool in Love" [...] displays Rihanna emoting a vulnerable style of singing, due to the lyrical content and mood in the song, which can be heard in the lyrics [...] "Papa, are you ashamed of <b>how</b> <b>your</b> little girl turned out?" [...] due to how the singer feels as though her parents are disappointed in her choice of man. Robert Copsey for Digital Spy commented that Rihanna appeared to be channelling Madonna on the song.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Boortz {{enrolled}} in then-unaccredited John Marshall Law School (Atlanta) going to class {{in his spare}} time, while {{he and his wife}} Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing [...] "the money to keep me in law school". After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993. During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer Evander Holyfield. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team {{in the aftermath of a}} failed Subaru dealership investment. Boortz told Atlanta Magazine [...] "It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared." [...] Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked a little about how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of interesting <b>how</b> <b>your</b> great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander .... Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an [...] "unethical son of a bitch". Boortz later remarked [...] "It's the only time I've ever been on the air that I lost control." [...] In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.|$|E
500|$|In Erlewine's opinion, Marquee Moon was {{radical and}} {{groundbreaking}} primarily as [...] "a guitar rock album unlike any other". Verlaine and Lloyd's dual {{playing on the}} record strongly influenced alternative rock {{groups such as the}} Pixies, noise rock acts such as Sonic Youth, and big arena bands like U2. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune wrote that Television [...] "created a new template for guitar rock" [...] because of how Verlaine's improvised playing was weaved together with Lloyd's precisely notated solos, particularly on the title track. As a member of U2, Irish guitarist The Edge simulated Television's guitar sound with an effects pedal. He later said he had wanted to [...] "sound like them" [...] and that Marquee Moons title track had changed his [...] "way of thinking about the guitar". Verlaine's jagged, expressive sound on the album made a great impression on American guitarist John Frusciante when he started developing as a guitarist in his early 20s, as it reminded him that [...] "none of those things that are happening in the physical dimension mean anything, whether it's what kind of guitar you play or <b>how</b> <b>your</b> amp's set up. It's just ideas, you know, emotion." [...] In Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield called Marquee Moon [...] "one of the all-time classic guitar albums" [...] whose tremulous guitar twang was an inspiration behind bands such as R.E.M. and Joy Division. Joy Division's Stephen Morris cited it as one of his favorite albums, while R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe said his love of Marquee Moon was [...] "second only to [...] Horses". English guitarist Will Sergeant said it was also one of his favorite records and that Verlaine and Lloyd's guitar playing was a major influence on his band Echo & the Bunnymen.|$|E

2500|$|Hinckley {{introduced}} the JetStick, Dual Guard composite material, {{and the use}} of fiberglass. The first experiments with fiberglas began during the 1950s and concluded with the creation of the B40 in 1959. Despite much criticism such as the comparison of fiberglass to “frozen snot,” Hinckley used the material in boatbuilding [...] Hinckley created Dual Guard technology in 1999, a composite composed of an aramid and carbon fiber, aimed at creating a stronger and more efficient hull. [...] In 2016, the company launched a remote monitoring system called OnWatch. OnWatch uses a series of sensors to track numerous data points on a boat and relay them via a cellular system to servers that update a mobile Web site (it feels like an app when you add the OnWatch icon to your smartphone homescreen). Once you log in, it gives you a homescreen with an at-a-glance understanding of <b>how</b> <b>your</b> boat is doing, from technical details such as engine status, bilge, battery, and fuel-tank levels, to the state of your shore power connectivity.|$|E
2500|$|Negotiations for the writer's return {{came to an}} end {{after the}} {{publication}} of his Memoirs (Воспоминания, 1950), full of scathing criticism of Soviet cultural life. Apparently aware of his own negativism, Bunin wrote: [...] "I was born too late. If I had been born earlier, my literary memoirs would have been different. I wouldn't have been a witness to 1905, the First World War, then 1917 and what followed: Lenin, Stalin, Hitler... How can I not be jealous of our forefather Noah. He lived through only one flood in his lifetime". Reportedly, the infamous Zhdanov decree {{was one of the reasons}} for Bunin's change of mind. On 15 September 1947, Bunin wrote to Mark Aldanov: [...] "I have a letter here from Teleshov, written on September 7; 'what a pity (he writes) that you've missed all of this: <b>how</b> <b>your</b> book was set up, how everybody was waiting for you here, in the place where you could have been... rich, feasted, and held in such high honour!'

[...] The sixth track on the mixtape is a cover of Joni Mitchell's [...] "Free Man in Paris" [...] which, serving as a tribute to Mitchell, was renamed [...] "White Girl in Paris". The mixtape's seventh track and second single from the tape [...] "Andre" [...] was also written by JoJo while {{production}} was handled by Mr. Franks. In discussion of the track, JoJo says [...] "Andre" [...] isn't necessarily a direct tribute to Outkast's André 3000; rather, the 37-year-old rapper/singer provided inspiration for the song. [...] "I absolutely admire André and both of the guys from Outkast — their incredible artistry and creativity," [...] she explains. [...] "The man that André is, I think that's super-sexy — someone who is themselves, who isn't confined and just expresses themselves. He has such a great style. I was inspired by that, for sure."
