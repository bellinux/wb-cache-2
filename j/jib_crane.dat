40|$|Abstract: The failure path {{of large}} complex steel {{structure}} systems for lattice <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> is investigated in this paper. Considering {{the lack of}} an explicit function expression in the study of reliability, a method based on a modified response surface method is proposed to quantify the reliability index and the failure probability, capitalizing on the linear- approximated iteration and the difference approach rather than the differential approach in solving nonlinear equations. The major failure path is determined through the analysis of the multiple failure probabilities. The main failure mode of lattice <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> is a failure in stability, not a failure in strength based on a comparison of the failure probabilities of both stability failures and strength failures. And the failure path is substantially a rearrangement of the hazardous components and the failure path of components with similar probabilities and close locations varies only in that these components break at distinct starting positions. Finally a proposal is put forward to heighten in engineer practices the security reserves of hazardous components to achieve high reliability of an overall system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Tower cranes {{are made}} of steel structure, which {{account for more than}} half of their weights. Therefore, steel structre {{optimization}} of tower cranes is important for the development of design technology of tower cranes. This paper develops a systemic optimization method for tower cranes based on Ansys OPT, combined with finite element analysis (FEA) and stability theory. This mathod is firstly used in the optimization of the boom of luffing <b>jib</b> tower <b>cranes.</b> New optimization model of the boom of luffing <b>jib</b> tower <b>cranes</b> is introduced and the corresponding optimization program is developed. The integration of the calibrating of overall stability and single-limb stability of luffing <b>jib</b> tower <b>cranes,</b> FEA and OPT is realized by extracting some parametes from FEA results, such as weight and axial force. Rapid optimization of the boom of luffing <b>jib</b> tower <b>cranes</b> is realized by the parametrization of non-design variables. Direct reading of optimization results is realized by the discretization of design variables. Finally, the boom of a tower crane with movable arm is optimized with the optimization program to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the optimization method...|$|R

5000|$|Camera cranes may be small, medium, or large, {{depending}} on the load capacity and length of the loading arm. Historically, the first camera crane provided for lifting the chamber together with the operator, and sometimes an assistant. The range of motion of the boom was restricted {{because of the high}} load capacity and the need to ensure operator safety. In recent years a camera crane boom tripod with a remote control has become popular. It carries on the boom only a movie or television camera without an operator and allows shooting from difficult positions as a small load capacity makes it possible to achieve a long reach of the crane boom and relative freedom of movement. The operator controls the camera from the ground through a motorized panoramic head, using remote control and video surveillance by watching the image on the monitor. A separate category consists of telescopic camera cranes. These devices allow setting an arbitrary trajectory of the camera, eliminating the characteristic <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> radial displacement that comes with traditional spanning shots.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Standardization of <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design {{procedures}} enables {{designers to}} develop their own <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> automation modules for entire <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design applications. Since main effort and time for implementation of the <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design procedures are generally spent for interpretation and explanation of the available <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design standards, a computer-automated access by using parametric modeling to the available standards may improve speed, reliability and quality of the design procedures. Starting from the fact that components of jib cranes are generally composed of similar mechanical and electrical sub-components independent of the crane type, a general component tree of jib cranes is developed for automation purpose. Design Modules of cranes are defined from the developed component tree of the cranes based on the available design procedures. Independent Design Procedures are defined as atomic design modules of the <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design procedures by considering computational approaches and rules in the "F. E. M.
