25|$|Mark was {{originally}} scripted to be a wayward delinquent and {{was due to}} feature heavily within {{the first year of}} the series. However, as soon as the regular gruelling schedule of EastEnders production established itself, it became clear that Scarboro was not <b>happy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role. The stress of the heavy workload and the sudden fame that came to all the actors became difficult for him to cope with. He became unhappy with the schedule and his scripts and refused to play Mark as a racist as was intended. Holland and Smith decided to write the character out of the show to allow the actor to come to terms with the situation better. On-screen, Mark was being implicated in the murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton) and was being tempted into heroin by Nick Cotton (John Altman). Fearing Nick and the police, Mark ran away from home in April 1985. As this had not been the original plan for the character, it meant a hectic period of re-writing early in 1985. The first fifty-odd scripts were reworked to accommodate this major change. Many of the stories intended for Mark were subsequently given to Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Mark's sister Michelle (Susan Tully) - which partially explains why her character became so prominent in the first year. It still left a gap though, because several of Mark's functions in the serial, as slightly the eldest of the youngsters, could not have been taken over by the others. A new character needed to be introduced to restore the balance to its original shape, which is why the character of Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) was introduced. This meant introducing the audience to a character and a story approximately a year before it had been originally intended.|$|E

500|$|Set {{prior to}} most of the film's action, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second proper song in The Little Mermaid, and takes place in Ariel's grotto before she meets Eric. A {{character}} song used to progress the plot, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resembles a monologue in which Ariel expresses her desire {{to become part of the}} human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts. Singing about her interest in exploring the human world and learning as much as she can about it, Ariel performs the ballad while gazing up towards the surface longingly, wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] reveals that Ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage, [...] "want to be a part of something else." [...] A wind-up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that Ariel would much rather be like her. The character also sings the line [...] "What’s a fire and why does it ... What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is much left for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is the only thing that could make her truly <b>happy.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of what is missing from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is not shy about what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E
