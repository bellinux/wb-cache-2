25|$|Reprieve, a London-based {{human rights}} group, {{said it had}} talked to two sources from the raided village, {{who said that the}} raid went wrong from the start as the Seals opened fire on a 70-year-old {{partially}} blind man, named Nasser Al-Adhal, who had come out of his house {{to see what was going}} on, possibly to greet the US soldiers after mistaking them for visitors. On hearing al-Adhal being shot, other men then emerged from their homes, and four of them were shot dead by the Seals, according to the Reprieve account. According to Reprive investigators, they were “still trying to get a really full picture of exactly what happened, but what we <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Seals landed in the village, and they appear to have been trying to target a group of possible militants but in the course of the ground raid something went wrong, and they ended up killing a number of the people from the village, including a man of about 70, Nasser al-Adhal, who suffered from very bad eyesight. The four other villagers were killed when they started to argue with the Navy Seals after the shooting of Nasser al-Adhal. Six villagers were seriously injured, including another elderly man who was around 69 years old. After that, Al-Qaida fighters gathered nearby, after were alerted by the gunshots in the village and firefight ensued in which at least two of them were killed. The Navy Seals then left with the help of air support from a helicopter.” A US central command spokesman, Maj. Josh Jacques, said that the Reprieve report would be investigated.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on 7 November 2007 that Abra would again {{be returning to}} Holby City, in spring 2008. Edmondson revealed that [...] "Abra comes back as a patient because some trauma has happened in Africa {{and he will be}} sponging off Ric." [...] Expanding on this, he explained: [...] "Abra’s in a very fragile state, as he’s suffering from post-traumatic stress. He keeps hurting himself, but no one knows why. Ric’s pretty off with Abra at first, but he agrees to let him stay at his place for a week. Abra used to be a nice guy, but he’s horrible now. Something happened to him on his travels, though even I haven’t been told what it is yet. What I <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Abra has a huge machete scar on his back... I imagine he’s been though some horror." [...] He has stated that this appearance in the show will last four or five months, and that he doesn't yet know how the character will be written out this time, beyond there being [...] "some kind of mental-health issue." [...] It emerged that Abra had borne witness to a violent attack on the hospital he was working in the Congo, eventually leading to him checking into a psychiatric unit. After being discovered being treated by his own mother, Kyla and Lola Griffin convinced him to discharge himself and return to Ghana. He returned briefly to Holby in December 2008, when he convinced Kyla to move to Ghana with him, proposing marriage to her.|$|E

I {{think that we should}} not jump to conclusions and we should wait {{to find out what the}} evidence says... What we <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Hamas often hides amongst innocents and uses innocent people, including children, as human shields." ...|$|E

There had been bliss and misery mingled in those tidings, and she {{scarcely}} knew for a moment which way they affected her.

2500|$|Conference {{attendance}} gets {{much attention}} on Gerbic's bi-weekly segments on the Skeptic Society's Skepticality podcast. She stresses {{how important it}} is for skeptics to attend, and if there aren't conferences nearby, then to create a conference, be it a SkeptiCamp or a Skeptics in the Pub event. She insists that conference attendance is the first step towards activism. [...] "What I <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the one-on-one contact recharges our batteries. People like Harriet A. Hall (Skepdoc), Lindsay Beyerstein (co-host of Point of Inquiry), and myself came from CSI’s Skeptic's Toolbox. We weren't primarily authors or lecturers, just people with a passion for the skeptical movement who decided it was our turn to step up. You can’t buy that fire, but sometimes you might have to kick the embers to keep us (and others) out there fighting what seems to be an insurmountable world of woo. Conferences are essential." ...|$|E

60|$|FRANKLYN. I know that.

What we <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> your Government <b>was</b> formed largely of men who regarded you as a robber of henroosts, and whom you regarded as enemies of the people.|$|R

6000|$|... "I didn't go {{that day}} at all. The next day was a half holiday, and that may have weighed with me. Perhaps, too, my state of {{inattention}} brought down impositions upon me and docked the margin of time necessary for the detour. I don't know.

While most of the contestants offer this seat to their senior partner, C.J., Billy, and Joel do not. In the photo shoot, Billy doesnt appear to respect his partners opinion, and is more concerned with how he himself looks on camera.|$|R
60|$|What we <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> {{if we find}} a {{large share}} of the whole stock of {{incident}} of popular tale fully developed in one single story long before India was historic, it is perfectly vain to argue that all stories were imported from historic India. It is impossible to maintain that the single centre whence the stories spread was not the India of fable, but the India of history, when we discover such abundance of story material in Egypt before, as far as is known, India \ had even become the India of fable.|$|E

Mr. Mountjoy has been as kind as usual: but he {{has not been able to}} chase away her sadness. Whether she was fretting after her husband, or whether--but this I hardly think--she was comparing the man she had lost with the man she had taken--but I do not know.
