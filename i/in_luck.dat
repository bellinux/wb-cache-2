5|$|Later {{that year}} in 1932, Dallas' sister Eve {{searches}} for Dallas, putting her {{at odds with}} the Gandor family. These stories involved the Daily Days News Information company and the Runorattas' drug plot with Begg, a drug addicted immortal alchemist acquaintance of Maiza's encroaching Gandor turf through his miracle drugs, testing it on innocent bystanders including a young man named Roy Maddock. Eventually Eve is caught up in the turf war involving drugs with the Runoratta family and Gandors, the ramifications of the turf war affecting two lovers: Gandor speakeasy waitress Edith and her boyfriend, revealed to be Roy. The climax of the conflict results <b>in</b> <b>Luck</b> secretly telling Eve where Dallas is to spare her from bloodshed, and with Claire's help, the turf war ends with bittersweet results for Edith and Roy now associated with the Gandors until they finish the debt they compiled in the story albeit in happier terms.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} is the first attempt to examine the {{association}} between the Dark Triad of personality (i. e., Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy) and corruption through a mediator – belief <b>in</b> good <b>luck.</b> Based on Ajzen’s theory of planned behavior, we assumed that individuals with Dark Triad {{would be more likely}} to engage in corruption as a result of belief <b>in</b> good <b>luck.</b> <b>In</b> Study 1, a set of hypothetical scenarios was used to assess the bribe-offering intention and the corresponding belief <b>in</b> good <b>luck.</b> Results indicated that while the Dark Triad of personality positively predicted bribe-offering intention, it was mediated by the belief <b>in</b> good <b>luck</b> <b>in</b> bribe-offering. In Study 2, we presented participants with some hypothetical scenarios of bribe-taking and the corresponding belief <b>in</b> good <b>luck.</b> Findings revealed that the Dark Triad of personality was positively related to bribe-taking intention; the relationship between narcissism and bribe-taking intention, and that between psychopathy and bribe-taking intention was mediated by the belief <b>in</b> good <b>luck</b> <b>in</b> penalty-avoidance. However, this belief <b>in</b> good <b>luck</b> did not mediate the relationship between Machiavellianism and bribe-taking intention. These results hold while controlling for demographic variables, dispositional optimism, and self-efficacy. Taken together, this study extended previous research by providing evidence that belief <b>in</b> good <b>luck</b> may be one of the reasons explaining why people with Dark Triad are more likely to engage in corruption regardless of the potential outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed...|$|R

At Treblinka, the Sonderkommando prisoners armed with stolen weapons attacked the guards on August 2, 1943. A day later, the Będzin and Sosnowiec ghetto revolts broke out. On August 16, the Białystok Ghetto uprising erupted. The revolt in Sobibór extermination camp occurred on October 14, 1943. At Auschwitz-Birkenau, the insurgents blew up one of Birkenau’s crematoria on October 7, 1944.

25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1910s, the Pennsylvania {{received}} the FF-1 but decided it was too slow for passenger trains and was relegated to heavy freight service. In the mid 1920s, they received the L5 electric which had third rail power supply at the time. When the Pennsylvania built the O1 and the P5, they chose the P5 over the O1 for its ability and power on the rails. After a grade cross accident with the P5, the cab {{was moved to the}} center and was designated P5a. Pennsylvania still searched for the ultimate electric since the P5 did not track well at high speeds and were wondering if the P5a could be improved even further. Soon enough, the Pennsylvania was <b>in</b> <b>luck</b> and found two contacts as early as 1932. The mechanical design of the GG1 was based largely on the New Haven EP3, which had been borrowed earlier from the New Haven Railroad by the PRR to compare it to its current standard electric locomotive, the P5a. In 1933, the PRR decided to replace its P5a locomotives and told General Electric and Westinghouse to design prototype locomotives with the following specifications: a lighter axle load and more power than the P5a, a top speed of at least , a streamlined body design and a single (central) control cab.|$|E

McClintock had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press and took Geisel to his office to introduce him to Vanguard's president James Henle and editor Evelyn Shrifte. Henle had been gaining a reputation for signing authors whom other, larger publishers had rejected. He soon agreed to publish the book, with only the condition that its title be changed. Geisel cited the incident for his belief <b>in</b> <b>luck</b> and later stated, [...] "If I had been walking {{down the other side}} of Madison Avenue, I'd be in the dry-cleaning business today." [...] In gratitude to McClintock, Geisel changed the name of the book's protagonist to Marco, after McClintock's son, and dedicated the book to McClintock's wife, Helene.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} whether the belief <b>in</b> good <b>luck</b> of stock traders influences their satisfaction with and {{their loyalty to}} a stock trading service. In particular, we tested whether the online stock traders who have irrational beliefs <b>in</b> good <b>luck</b> (e. g., I am a lucky person) (1) are satisfied with their online stock trading service more strongly and (2) stay with it longer than the online stock traders who have rational beliefs <b>in</b> good <b>luck</b> (e. g., luck does not exist). We have tested satisfaction, loyalty, and belief <b>in</b> good <b>luck</b> among 412 online stock traders and tested our two hypotheses. Our findings contribute to the academic research on service satisfaction and loyalty {{as well as provide}} implications to online stock trading service providers...|$|R

2500|$|The Lithuanian Karaites also {{settled in}} lands of modern Belarus and Ukraine, which {{were part of}} the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Karaite {{communities}} emerged in Halicz and Kokizow (near Lwów) in Galicia, as well as <b>in</b> <b>Łuck</b> and Derazhne in Volhynia. Jews (Rabbinites and Karaites) in Lithuanian territory were granted a measure of autonomy under Michel Ezofovich Senior's management. The Trakai Karaim refused to comply, citing differences in faith. Later all Jews, including Karaites, were submitted to Rabbinite [...] "Council of Four Lands" [...] (Vaad) and [...] "Council of the Land of Lithuania" [...] taxation (1580–1646). The Yiddish-speaking Rabbinites considered the Turkic-speaking Karaites to be apostates, and kept them in a subordinate and depressed position. The Karaites resented this treatment. In 1646 the Karaites gained expulsion of the Rabbinites from Trakai. Despite such tensions, in 1680 Rabbinite community leaders defended the Karaites of Shaty (near Trakai) against blood accusation. Representatives of both groups signed an agreement in 1714 to respect the mutual privileges and resolve disputes without involving the Gentile administration.|$|E

2500|$|The songs,all {{written by}} Davis herself, are mostly built around funk grooves, driving {{percussion}} and heavy guitars. Davis' vocal stylings are expressive and boisterous (as on [...] "If I'm <b>In</b> <b>Luck</b> I Might Get Picked Up"), but also playful and sensual (as on [...] "Anti Love Song"). On the former she boldly sings [...] "I'm wigglin' my fanny, I'm raunchy dancing, I'm-a-doing it doing it". [...] "Steppin' In Her I. Miller Shoes", {{tells the story}} of a talented young woman who comes to the 'jungle' with big dreams, only to end up a tragic victim of the entertainment industry. The up-tempo song features hard rock guitars and backing vocals by The Pointer Sisters. In a 2007 interview Davis revealed that the song was based on the life of Devon Wilson, a one-time girlfriend of Jimi Hendrix with whom Davis had been close friends. Wilson is also the subject of [...] "Angel" [...] by Hendrix.
