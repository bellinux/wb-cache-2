25|$|In {{order to}} detect carbon dioxide leaks and the {{effectiveness}} of <b>geological</b> <b>sequestration</b> sites, different monitoring techniques can be employed to verify that the sequestered carbon stays trapped below the surface in the intended reservoir. Leakage due to injection at improper locations or conditions could result in carbon dioxide being released back into the atmosphere. It is important to be able to detect leaks with enough warning {{to put a stop to}} it, and to be able to quantify the amount of carbon that has leaked for purposes such as cap and trade policies, evaluation of environmental impact of leaked carbon, as well as accounting for the total loss and cost of the process. To quantify the amount of carbon dioxide released, should a leak occur, or to closely watch stored , there are several monitoring methods that can be done at both the surface and subsurface levels.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a modification to Darcy equation by {{taking into account}} the dependence of viscosity on the pressure. We present a stabilized mixed formulation for the resulting governing equations. Equal-order interpolation for the velocity and pressure is considered, and shown to be stable (which is not the case under the classical mixed formulation). The proposed mixed formulation is tested using a wide variety of numerical examples. The proposed formulation is also implemented in a parallel setting, and the performance of the formulation for large-scale problems is illustrated using a representative problem. Two practical and technologically important problems, one each on enhanced oil recovery and <b>geological</b> carbon-dioxide <b>sequestration,</b> are solved using the proposed formulation. The numerical examples show that the predictions based on Darcy model are qualitatively and quantitatively {{different from that of the}} predictions based on the modified Darcy model, which takes into account the dependence of the viscosity on the pressure. In particular, the numerical example on the <b>geological</b> carbon-dioxide <b>sequestration</b> shows that Darcy model over-predicts the leakage into an abandoned well when compared to that of the modified Darcy model. On the other hand, the modified Darcy model predicts higher pressures and higher pressure gradients near the injection well. These predictions have dire consequences in predicting damage and fracture zones, and designing the seal, whose integrity is crucial to the safety of a <b>geological</b> carbon-dioxide <b>sequestration</b> geosystem.

The optimization results for both applications are promising in achieving the desired objectives of enhancing the storage efficiency significantly while reducing the plume migration, brine movement and pressure impact.

40|$|International audienceAssessing the {{possibility}} of CO 2 leakage {{is one of the}} major challenges for <b>geological</b> carbon <b>sequestration.</b> Injected CO 2 can react with wellbore cement, which can potentially change cement composition and transport properties. In this work, we develop a reactive transport model based on experimental observations to understand and predict the property evolution of cement in direct contact with CO 2 -saturated brine under diffusion-controlled conditions. The model reproduced the observed zones of portlandite depletion and calcite formation. Cement alteration is initially fast and slows down at later times. This work also quantified the role of initial cement properties, in particular the ratio of the initial portlandite content to porosity (defined here as φ), in determining the evolution of cement properties. Portlandite-rich cement with large φ values results in a localized “sharp” reactive diffusive front characterized by calcite precipitation, leading to significant porosity reduction, which eventually clogs the pore space and prevents further acid penetration. Severe degradation occurs at the cement–brine interface with large φ values. This alteration increases effective permeability by orders of magnitude for fluids that preferentially flow through the degraded zone. The significant porosity decrease in the calcite zone also leads to orders of magnitude decrease in effective permeability, where fluids flow through the low-permeability calcite zone. The developed reactive transport model provides a valuable tool to link cement–CO 2 reactions with the evolution of porosity and permeability. It can be used to quantify and predict long-term wellbore cement behavior and can facilitate the risk assessment associated with <b>geological</b> CO 2 <b>sequestration...</b>|$|R
