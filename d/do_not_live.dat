5|$|White tigers {{are more}} {{frequently}} bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool {{can lead to}} inbreeding. This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and strabismus (squint). Even apparently healthy white tigers generally <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>live</b> {{as long as their}} orange counterparts. Attempts have been made to cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.|$|E
5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, {{as long as they}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>live</b> in too close quarters. The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{above the}} rank of {{minister}} are allowed to fly the flag at their residence provided they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>live</b> near the capital. The tradition of flying the national flag in front of government offices had not existed in Bhutan prior to 1968 but was decreed standard practice by the Druk Gyalpo after his Secretariat was moved {{from the city of}} Taba to Tashichho Dzong in that year. The only flag day prescribed in the 1972 rules is National Day, which is held annually on December 17. National Day commemorates the crowning of Ugyen Wangchuck as the first king of Bhutan on December 17, 1907.|$|E

5|$|On Athas, {{the planet}} of the Dark Sun {{campaign}} setting, dwarves stand less than 5' tall and weigh nearly 200lbs. Each dwarf pursues a singular obsession, called a focus, that requires {{at least a week}} to complete. Athasian dwarves <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>live</b> underground, but some communities focus on unearthing long-lost dwarven strongholds. Physically, the dwarves of Athas are unique among their kind, having no hair at all. Athasian dwarves can breed with humans to produce muls, who are sterile offsprings that share the strength and resiliency of dwarves with the size of humans.|$|E
5|$|While some 700,000–1,000,000 Iraqis came to Jordan {{following}} the Iraq War in 2003, most have returned. Many Iraqi Christians (Assyrians/Chaldeans) however settled temporarily or permanently in Jordan. Immigrants also include 15,000 Lebanese who arrived {{following the}} 2006 Lebanon War. Since 2010, over 1.4 million Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan {{to escape the}} violence in Syria. The kingdom has continued to demonstrate hospitality, despite the substantial strain the flux of Syrian refugees places on the country. The effects are largely affecting Jordanian communities, as {{the vast majority of}} Syrian refugees <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>live</b> in camps. The refugee crisis effects include competition for job opportunities, water resources and other state provided services, along with the strain on the national infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|These streams have nurtured microclimates {{that allow}} for the {{development}} of ecological niches, with many endemic species (species that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>live</b> anywhere else on the planet), worthy of study and observation. In general access to them is difficult due to the rugged terrain, often inaccessible to any vehicle (including those with all-wheel drive) and thus can only be reached on foot, by mule or by horseback.|$|E
25|$|Some {{experiments}} have raised questions on whether telomerase {{can be used}} as an anti-aging therapy, namely, the fact that mice with elevated levels of telomerase have higher cancer incidence and hence <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>live</b> longer. Telomerase also favors tumorogenesis, which leads to questions about its potential as an anti-aging therapy. On the other hand, one study showed that activating telomerase in cancer-resistant mice by overexpressing its catalytic subunit extended lifespan.|$|E

25|$|Trooping fairies {{refer to}} fairies who appear in groups and might form settlements. In this definition, fairy is usually {{understood}} {{in a wider}} sense, as the term can also include various kinds of mythical creatures mainly of Celtic origin; however, the term might {{also be used for}} similar beings such as dwarves or elves from Germanic folklore. These are opposed to solitary fairies, who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>live</b> or associate with others of their kind.|$|E
25|$|Japanese Brazilians usually speak Japanese {{more often}} when they live {{along with a}} first {{generation}} relative. Those who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>live</b> with a Japanese-born relative usually speak Portuguese more often. Japanese spoken in Brazil is usually a mix of different Japanese dialects, since the Japanese community in Brazil came from all regions of Japan, influenced by the Portuguese language. The high numbers of Brazilian immigrants returning from Japan will probably produce more Japanese speakers in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The {{health of}} Irish Travellers is {{significantly}} poorer {{than that of}} the general population in Ireland. This is evidenced in a 2007 report published in Ireland, which states that over half of Travellers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>live</b> past the age of 39 years. Another government report of 1987 found:From birth to old age, they have high mortality rates, particularly from accidents, metabolic and congenital problems, but also from other major causes of death. Female Travellers have especially high mortality compared to settled women.|$|E
