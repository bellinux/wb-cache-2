5|$|Compared to his two fellow protagonists, C.T. Smith was {{considered}} more novel. Anime News Network {{said he was}} one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though even his role as an unassuming businessman who is actually an expert gunman <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it must be borrowed from somewhere else. MangaCast's reviewer, on the other hand, found his role mostly extraneous, due to being overshadowed by Gamma. Animemaniacs Magazine Online noted that Smith's physical appearance was later echoed by Bleachs central antagonist, Sōsuke Aizen.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. A critic from Billboard liked Streisand's tone and vocals, but others <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{the album was}} ultimately forgettable. Barbra Streisand...and Other Musical Instruments is Streisand's lowest selling studio album of her entire career; {{it is also one}} of four studio albums released by the singer not to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. However, it peaked in the lower positions of both Canada and the United States. The album was eventually released as a CD in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Naoi {{is a human}} {{originally}} {{thought to be a}} non-player character (non-human). After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, {{he was the son of}} a famous potter. However, it was his twin brother who had the talent in pottery and as a result, Naoi was ignored by everyone. When his brother died, he was made to replace him by his father and was given strict training in pottery. As a result, he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his own life was fake and all he wanted was to be acknowledged for his own existence. He later befriends Otonashi after he acknowledges him and joins the SSS. As acting student council president for a time and self-proclaimed God, Naoi is strict and arrogant, but this is quick to disperse when Otonashi chastises him. He is affectionate to Otonashi, much to the latter's chagrin, and always tries to earn his affection. He uses dual USP 45 handguns.|$|E

25|$|The new name, Project Blue Book, was {{selected}} {{to refer to the}} blue booklets used for testing at some colleges and universities. The name was inspired, said Ruppelt, by the close attention that high-ranking officers were giving the new project; it <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the study of UFOs was as important as a college final exam. Blue Book was also upgraded in status from Project Grudge, with the creation of the Aerial Phenomenon Branch.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007 Blanke's lab {{published}} research in Science demonstrating that conflicting visual-somatosensory input in virtual reality could disrupt the spatial unity between {{the self and}} the body. During multisensory conflict, participants <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a virtual body seen in front of them was their own body and mislocalized themselves toward the virtual body, to a position outside their bodily borders. This indicates that spatial unity and bodily self-consciousness can be studied experimentally and is based on multisensory and cognitive processing of bodily information.|$|E
25|$|Although {{already an}} {{accomplished}} practitioner, in interview Okabayashi Shōgen {{stated that he}} <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{he had come to}} a technical road block in his training through which he could not pass. He could perform the techniques effectively but not at a speed necessary for them to be employed under the demands of real fighting. His teacher Hisa had become elderly and had suffered a dehabilitating stroke and so was moving to Tokyo to be cared for by his family. Okabayashi decided that he would give up the practise of Daitō-ryū. Hearing of this Hisa encouraged him rather to go study with Sōkaku's son, the current headmaster of the art, Tokimune Takeda, and gave him a letter of recommendation.|$|E

25|$|Police {{brutality}} {{is measured}} {{based on the}} accounts {{of people who have}} experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases. This is because {{there is no way to}} quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation. Because police brutality is relative to a situation, it depends on if the suspected person(s) is(are) resisting. Out of the people who were surveyed about their account with the police brutality in 2008, only about 12% <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had been resisting. Although police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion of brutality among various races, genders, and ages can. African Americans, women, and younger people are more likely to have negative opinions about police than Caucasians, men, and middle-aged to elderly individuals.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to active duty, Hathcock helped establish the Marine Corps Scout Sniper School, at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. Due to his extreme injuries suffered in Vietnam, {{he was in}} nearly constant pain, but he continued to dedicate himself to teaching snipers. In 1975, Hathcock's health began to deteriorate, and {{he was diagnosed with}} multiple sclerosis. He stayed in the Marine Corps, but his health continued to decline. And, just 55 days short of the 20 years that would have made him eligible for regular retirement pay, he received a permanent disability separation. Being medically discharged, he received 100 percent disability pay. He would have received only 50 percent of his final pay grade had he retired after 20 years. He fell into a state of depression when he was forced out of the Marines, because he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the service had kicked him out. During this depression, his wife Jo nearly left him but decided to stay. Hathcock eventually picked up the hobby of shark fishing, which helped him overcome his depression.|$|E
25|$|The EL {{brought with}} it {{improvements}} to braking and handling. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high-speed steering. With {{the introduction of the}} new model, buyers could now purchase a Falcon with standard (optional on GLi) anti-lock brakes featuring the latest Bosch 5.3 module. Perhaps the biggest advancement with the EL was the improvements to the handling woes of the EF, with improvements established to the suspension and steering. Engineers at Tickford had discovered that by lowering the pivot point of the Watt's linkages in the rear suspension by 20millimetres (0.8in), that the roll oversteer effect which plagued the EF could finally be eliminated. Previously on EF models, during hard cornering the rear end of the car often <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it could not keep up with the front, due to the difference in roll rate between the front and rear suspension. The result of this produced unpredictable car handling at times, where the delayed weight transfer at the rear would seek to damage the integrity of the outside rear tyre grip. This was exaggerated even further in wet weather or on vehicles fitted with poor tyres. Although this problem was addressed to a degree in the EFII update, it was the EL that became the first base level Falcon to feature a rear suspension setup that would complement the precision of rack and pinion steering introduced in the EA Falcon eight years earlier. The improved suspension geometry allowed Ford to soften the spring rates on both front and rear on the EL for a more compliant ride, as the driver no longer had roll oversteer to contain.|$|E

500|$|Allison J. Waldman, {{author of}} The Barbra Streisand Scrapbook, wrote that Streisand's {{performance}} of the single was [...] "heartbreaking", while Linda Pohly, writer of The Barbra Streisand Companion, <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it revealed her [...] "slender musical frame" [...] that can both [...] "support or sustain".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were much}} less pleased with Final Fantasy IX: Uematsu's Best Selection than with the {{original}} soundtrack, finding it to have a [...] "great track listing" [...] but that it <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> [...] " [...] tried {{to get as many}} tracks on the disc as they could", with the result that many tracks were cut too short.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of PCD (2005), {{and over the}} course of two years (2005–07), Scherzinger recorded 75-100 songs for Her Name Is Nicole, her planned solo debut album. [...] Her work as lead singer furthered Scherzinger's popularity as she began work on her own music. She stated that she enjoyed collaborating with many different artists, and that although she had been writing songs for over ten years, she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she was at a different level while working with such A-list writers and producers. Following the moderate success of [...] "Baby Love", the complete lack of success of the singles such as [...] "Whatever U Like" [...] and numerous push backs, Scherzinger decided to put the release of the on hold. She then returned her focus back on the Pussycat Dolls, and recording commenced for their second studio album. Scherzinger cited that she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the songs were more suited as a Pussycat Dolls song than her own.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun envied {{him almost}} painfully. Even this {{momentary}} possession of pure isolation and fluidity {{seemed to her}} so terribly desirable that she <b>felt</b> herself <b>as</b> <b>if</b> damned, {{out there on the}} high-road.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay,' she said, in an incomprehensible monosyllable, {{that sounded}} profoundly cynical. Birkin <b>felt</b> afraid, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he dared not realise. And Mrs Crich moved away, forgetting him. But she {{returned}} on her traces.|$|R

500|$|Tom Derrick {{was widely}} mourned. His widow, Beryl, became {{prostrate}} with grief on hearing of his death; {{many members of}} the Army were affected, with one soldier lamenting it <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> [...] "the whole war stopped". By the time Derrick's death was officially announced on 30 May, most Australians on Tarakan had heard the news and rumours had spread claiming that he had been speared or shot at short range by a sub-machine gun.|$|E
500|$|Nobody {{was entirely}} {{sure that the}} work {{was going to be}} the group's last, though Harrison said [...] "it <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we were {{reaching}} the end of the line". After the album was released, the Get Back/Let It Be project was re-examined, and work on it continued into 1970. Therefore, Let It Be became the last album to be finished by the Beatles, even though its recording had begun before Abbey Road.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} create a world in which you <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you were {{watching}} very real women. Most of the women I saw on TV didn't seem like people I actually knew. They felt like ideas of what women are. They never got to be nasty or competitive or hungry or angry. They were often just the loving wife or the nice friend. But who gets to be the bitch? Who gets to be the three-dimensional woman?" ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Primus {{was free}} to leave under the Bosman ruling and {{received}} an offer from Luton Town which he accepted. Lennie Lawrence, the manager who bidded for Primus was sacked soon afterwards, however, and the deal was cancelled to the dismay of Primus who said he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> [...] " [...] whole world had collapsed". In the aftermath, Pardew put him in contact with Portsmouth manager Tony Pulis and a trial was agreed.|$|E
500|$|With a {{past as a}} musician, I {{remember}} sometimes {{feeling like}} the audience was against me while I was on stage [...] Even if that wasn't noticeable in any way, I still <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they all disliked me, or at least, misunderstood me, deep inside. That paranoia was kind of firmly rooted inside of me—the fear of being the wrong artist {{in front of the}} wrong audience. Thus, the idea for 'She's Madonna' deals with that.|$|E
500|$|Jefferies {{has since}} given {{his account of}} what happened, and {{revealed}} to the press in 2014 the mental strain the investigation had on his life for over two months. Jefferies said: [...] "At the time it <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the police were deliberately playing a game - promising the ordeal would soon be over and then finding it necessary to prolong the wait. It {{was a form of}} psychological torture. At such times the mind plays tricks, and one starts to believe that perhaps one is a criminal without knowing it and that, as in some Kafkaesque nightmare, guilt has been pre-ordained and the sentence is inescapable." ...|$|E
