5|$|The uranography of Andromeda has {{its roots}} most <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> the Greek tradition, though a female figure in Andromeda's {{location}} had appeared earlier in Babylonian astronomy.

5|$|Despite the near-debacle, the {{commitment}} of the Sa'iqa, along with the paratroopers of the 85th Battalion, had actually reinforced Egyptian defenses and helped defeat the Israeli attack. The battle continued south of Lake Timsah in see-saw fashion, raging back and forth, but by nightfall on October 20 the Israelis had made no progress, and the Egyptian paratroopers were <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> control of Touscan. According to Trevor N. Dupuy, by this time Israeli artillery fire had made the main Cairo-Ismailia road unusable.|$|E

5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing {{has been compared to}} that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division {{attacked}} {{with the}} 152nd (Highland) Infantry Brigade. The Highland infantry advanced towards {{the village of}} Sainte-Honorine-la-Chardronette before daybreak, without an artillery bombardment, surprising the German garrison. The Highlanders were counter-attacked by Kampfgruppe von Luck of the 21st Panzer Division during the morning but by midday the village was <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> British hands. German attention and resources were diverted {{by the success of}} the Highlanders as VIII Corps prepared for further attacks out of the Orne bridgehead.|$|E
25|$|As a result, White {{frequently}} championed {{nineteenth century}} evolutionists {{in a search}} for intellectual predecessors unclaimed or denounced by Boasians. This stance can be clearly seen in his views of evolution, which are <b>firmly</b> rooted <b>in</b> the writings of Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, and Lewis H. Morgan. While {{it can be argued that}} White's exposition of Morgan and Spencer's was tendentious, it can be safely said that White's concepts of science and evolution were <b>firmly</b> rooted <b>in</b> their work. Advances in population biology and evolutionary theory passed White by and, unlike Steward, his conception of evolution and progress remained <b>firmly</b> rooted <b>in</b> the nineteenth century.|$|R

5|$|She {{is placed}} <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> the imperialist {{literature}} of nineteenth-century England, and inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of South Africa and British colonialism. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary {{conceptions of the}} late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the fin de siècle. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after midnight, {{the first}} of the SS counter-attacks began and {{although}} thirteen tanks had been lost the previous day, the 10th Canadian Armoured Regiment and the mortars of the Cameron Highlanders, defeated the attack and inflicted many casualties. By dawn, almost no ground had been gained by the attackers and by noon, the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade and 10th Canadian Armoured Regiment had defeated three counter-attacks, with the assistance of artillery and Typhoon fighter-bombers. The village remained <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> Canadian occupation,although subject to frequent Nebelwerfer and mortar bombardment.|$|E

Extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of rutherfordium, hafnium, zirconium, {{as well as the}} pseudo-group 4 element thorium have proved a non-actinide behavior for rutherfordium. A comparison with its lighter homologues placed rutherfordium <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> group 4 and indicated the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions, {{in a manner similar to}} hafnium and zirconium.|$|E

The eggs were from the Triassic Period (220 to 195 million years ago) and had fossilised foetal skeletons of Massospondylus, a prosauropod dinosaur. More examples of these eggs have since been found in the park. Other fossils found in the park include those of advanced cynodontia (canine toothed animals), small thecodontia (animals with teeth set <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> the jaw), bird-like and crocodile-like dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Following General Grant's 1868 presidential victory, the Republicans were <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> {{charge in}} Washington. As a result, Hancock found himself transferred, this {{time away from}} the {{sensitive}} assignment of reconstructing the South and into the relative backwater that was the Department of Dakota. The Department covered Minnesota, Montana, and the Dakotas. As in his previous Western command, Hancock began with a conference of the Indian chiefs, but this time was more successful in establishing a peaceful intent. Relations worsened in 1870, however, as an army expedition committed a massacre against the Blackfeet. Relations with the Sioux also became contentious as a result of white encroachment into the Black Hills, in violation of the Treaty of Fort Laramie. Still, war was averted, for the time being, and most of Hancock's command was peaceful.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Olivier {{was caught}} in the middle of a {{confrontation}} between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg's The Dance of Death, the finest of all his performances other than in Shakespeare, in Gielgud's view.|$|E
5|$|In his {{new role}} Nichols clashed with the AEC {{over the issue of}} whether it or the Department of Defense should have custody of nuclear weapons.

For a time there was talk of calling off the Operation Sandstone nuclear weapons tests, but Nichols successfully argued for their continuation. In 1950, he became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of the Department of Defense, overseeing the Nike Project. He was appointed Chief of Research and Development when it was reorganized in 1952. Nichols retired from the Army on 31 October 1953. For his services from 1948 to 1953, he was belatedly awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal in 1956.|$|E
