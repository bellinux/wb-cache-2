5|$|When a Liu-family {{relative}} of an emperor—usually a princely son—was designated as his <b>heir</b> <b>apparent,</b> he was provided living quarters within the palace {{and a personal}} staff which was not disbanded until he became the next emperor. During Western Han, the staff had two divisions: one was led by educators of the <b>heir</b> <b>apparent,</b> known as the Grand Tutor of the <b>Heir</b> <b>Apparent</b> (ranked 2000–dan) and Junior Tutor of the <b>Heir</b> <b>Apparent</b> (ranked 2000–dan), the other led by a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-dan). During Eastern Han, the Grand Tutor of the <b>Heir</b> <b>Apparent</b> lost his administrative role but remained the chief educator and was promoted in rank to Fully 2,000-dan; the Junior Tutor remained an administrator with a salary-rank of 2,000-dan. The post of Supervisor of the Household was abolished. Other Western Han staff offices of the <b>heir</b> <b>apparent</b> were abolished during Eastern Han, such as the Chief of the Kitchen and the Household Prison of the <b>Heir</b> <b>Apparent.</b> If he reached adulthood, the <b>heir</b> <b>apparent</b> could be married to a principal wife who led a harem of his concubines.|$|E
5|$|The last <b>heir</b> <b>apparent</b> to the French throne to be crowned {{during his}} father's {{lifetime}} was the future Philip II, while the only crowned <b>heir</b> <b>apparent</b> to the English throne was Henry the Young King, who was first crowned alone {{and then with}} his wife, Margaret of France. The practice was eventually abandoned by all kingdoms that had adopted it, as the rules of primogeniture became stronger. The last coronation of an <b>heir</b> <b>apparent,</b> {{with the exception of}} investitures of the Prince of Wales in 1911 and 1969, was the coronation of the future Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria as junior King of Hungary in 1830.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the scholar}} István Boná, Thurisind's {{rise to power}} is a typical example of the {{conflicts}} among the leading families for the kingship that plagued Gepidia in the 6th century and {{made it difficult to}} maintain the succession within the king's family. To contain these obstacles Thurisind made Turismod, his oldest son, commander of the Gepid forces in Sirmium, an important position that made Turismod the king's <b>heir</b> <b>apparent</b> (in early Germanic custom the eldest son was not necessarily the first in line of succession). After Turismod died, his younger brother Cunimund became commander in Sirmium and thus <b>heir</b> <b>apparent.</b>|$|E
