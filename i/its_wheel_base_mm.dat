50|$|The Standard 6 shared <b>its</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> {{with the}} less {{expensive}} four cylinder Adler Favorit which appeared early in 1929.

5000|$|In 1934 a {{lengthened}} {{version of}} the car was introduced, <b>its</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> increased by 350 mm to 3050 mm. Models offered on the longer wheelbase included a six-seater “Pullman-Limousine”, a “Pullman-Laundaulet”, a longer Torpedo bodied “Tourenwagen”, a more streamlined 4-door “Limousine” (sedan/saloon) and three different longer <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> Cabriolets listed respectively as the “Cabriolet A”, the “Cabriolet B” and the “Cabriolet D”.|$|R

50|$|The Peugeot Type 177 B was a {{mid-range}} car produced between 1924 and 1929 by the French auto-maker Peugeot. With {{a fiscal}} horsepower of 10 CV, and a <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> of 2670 <b>mm,</b> it {{competed in the}} same sector as the Citroën B2 and Renault KZ.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{suspension}} system uses layered rubber, with pneumatic secondary suspension. The bogie <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> is 2200 <b>mm</b> (motor bogie) with 820 mm wheels. Braking is by tread brakes, and regenerative braking on power bogies, and by two axle-mounted disc brakes per axle on trailer bogies.|$|R
50|$|The Types VD and V4D {{featured}} a 2,500 <b>mm</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>base.</b> The 3,500 <b>mm</b> (approximately) overall length provided space for {{between two and}} five people depending on the body specified. The wide range of different body types offered followed a pattern that by now would have been familiar to many Lion-Peugeot buyers. It included a Torpedo, a Limousine, a “central steering” model and a small delivery van.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} problem of making Getz’s bicycle model {{traverse}} a strictly convex Jordan curve with bounded roll angle and bounded speed. The approach to solving this problem {{is based on the}} virtual holonomic constraint (VHC) method. Specifically, a VHC is enforced making the roll angle of the bicycle become a function of the bicycle’s position along the curve. It is shown that the VHC can be automatically generated as a periodic solution of a scalar periodic differential equation, which we call virtual constraint generator. Finally, it is shown that if the curve is sufficiently long as compared to the height of the bicycle’s centre of mass and <b>its</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>base,</b> then the enforcement of a suitable VHC makes the bicycle traverse the curve with a steady-state speed profile which is periodic and independent of initial conditions. An outcome of this work is a proof that the constrained dynamics of a Lagrangian control system subject to a VHC are generally not Lagrangian. Key words: Getz’s bicycle model; Virtual holonomic constraints; Nonlinear control systems...|$|R
50|$|The car shared <b>its</b> 2,250 <b>mm</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> {{with the}} manufacturer’s single {{cylinder}} Type VC3.

50|$|Adjustable <b>Wheel</b> <b>Base</b> on 12 <b>mm</b> Thru-Axle. This axle setup {{features}} on the DHExtreme-8, Europa DS (12 mm version), Europa FS, and Triton DH. The Wheelbase can be adjusted horizontally by 1 inch to effect {{the handling of the}} bike. The axle is tightened with a 9 m allen key and memory locked with two smaller horizontal allen bolts, creating a very stiff wheelbase. The disk-brake mount and derrailleur hanger make up either side of the moving section, and can therefore be replaced if damaged.|$|R
50|$|GAZ {{technicians}} initiated concept {{work on a}} new amoured car designated Izdeliye 64-125 on July 17, 1941, basing {{its construction}} and design on a preexisting commercial chassis. This was to ensure the manufacturing process could in be undertaken in an economical and rapid manner. After some deliberation, the GAZ-64 jeep {{was chosen as the}} base for the Izdeliye 64-125. This chassis was considered ideal due to <b>its</b> short <b>wheel</b> <b>base,</b> excellent ground clearance, and the fact that its mechanical parts were already in serial production. The original Izdeliye 64-125 bore almost no similarities with what would later become the BA-64; it resembled little more than a shorter BA-20.|$|R

[...] At the October 1953 Motor Show the standard Abeille was listed at 845,000 Frances as against 935,000 francs for the least expensive version of the Vedette.|$|R

50|$|Press {{comment in}} a country where {{technical}} innovation generates enthusiasm was very positive in respect of the car’s status as the world’s first production car to be fitted with a belt driven camshaft, but criticised the unresponsiveness of the standard drum brakes and the heavy clutch. The car’s tendency to pitch under acceleration or sharp braking which was attributed to <b>its</b> short <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> also drew criticism as did the “back to front” gear box which, as on the existing Isar, had originally been intended for a (never produced except as a prototype) front-wheel-drive small car and accordingly positioned first and third gears nearest to the driver, with second and fourth gears nearest the front of the car.|$|R

5|$|Officials {{proposed}} dockless bike sharing for the Citi Bike network, {{which would}} allow bikes to be rented without being tethered to docks. This was proposed after several bike sharing companies announced their intent to operate in New York City. In early August, the dockless bike-sharing company Spin had started a dockless operation in the Rockaways, but {{had been told to}} cease and desist operations by the NYCDOT, which had licensed Citi Bike as the only official bike-share operator in New York City. By the end of the month, Citi Bike started designing a dockless prototype that could still lock <b>its</b> own <b>wheels</b> <b>based</b> on whether the customer had paid. Meanwhile, Spin—a viable competitor to Citi Bike with lower per-half-hour pricing—was still looking to get a permit to start operations in New York City.|$|R

5000|$|The Trumpf 1.7 was {{replaced}} directly in May 1936 with the Adler Trumpf 1.7 EV. It {{came with the}} same 1,645 cc engine as before, for which [...] of maximum power was claimed. The 2920 <b>mm</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> was 220 <b>mm</b> longer than before and the body, more streamlined than before and with a longer rear overhang, was now 4540 mm (390 mm longer than before [...] ). As before, the body for the standard “Limousine” (sedan/saloon) came from the steel car body specialists Ambi-Budd of Berlin, now featuring four doors and a “six light” construction. Customers wishing for a two-door Adler “Limousine” of this class would need to await the launch in 1937 of the two-door Primus. The stylish standard cabriolet bodies for the Trumpf 1.7 EV came from Karmann of Osnabrück. [...] The claimed maximum speed was now increased to 102 km/h (63 mph).|$|R

30|$|In 2008, Kikuchi et al. [8] {{introduced}} a wheeled-based robot that climbs {{up and down}} stairs dynamically. A spring-loaded movable upper body mass allows their robot to land softly and double-hop in midair. Kikuchi robot consists of a statically stable <b>wheel</b> <b>base.</b> One of the drawbacks {{of this is that}} the robot has to land with minimum body tilt angle to ensure a successful landing. Safe landing is not guaranteed if there exists any external disturbances during airborne. Another jumping robot named iHop[9] is a transformable two wheeled robot. In hoping mode, it uses both wheels as weights and has a lockable hopping mechanism. iHop pushes <b>its</b> <b>wheels</b> upward while balancing on the central chassis. iHop exhibits hoping capability but it is not shown that the robot is capable of climbing up or down step terrains.|$|R
