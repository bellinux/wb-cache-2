40|$|A {{method of}} etching high purity zinc single {{crystals}} to reveal various etch figures on { 1010 } planes {{is presented in}} the preceding paper. The procedure involves the introduction of mercury to the crystal surface prior to a chemical polish with <b>dichromic</b> <b>acid.</b> The mercury was found to be concentrated at the etch figures. This paper presents the results of several experiments which support the conclusion that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between etch figures and dislocations. Some observations of slip on (0001) basal planes and { 1212 } pyramidal planes, and of twinning in zinc are also presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} etching high purity zinc to reveal various etch figures on 101 ¯ 0 planes is {{presented}} in this paper. Etch figures are formed by polishing in a <b>dichromic</b> <b>acid</b> solution after the introduction of mercury to the crystal surface. No measurable aging time is required to form etch figures at newly formed dislocation sites when mercury is on the surface prior to deformation. The mercury concentrates at the sites where etch figures form and may be removed by vacuum distillation and chemical polishing before it appreciably affects {{the purity of the}} bulk of the crystal...|$|E

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of {{the mobility of}} Daphnia magna (EC 50) was effectively used to estimate the toxicity value of chemical agents. However, the protocol for this method is quite complex due to the strict conditions required for the vessel and Daphnia magna using for the test. Therefore, we used a 6 - or 96 -well disposable plate instead of a glass vessel and simplified the analytical procedure. The EC 50 for potassium <b>dichromic</b> <b>acid</b> was estimated to range in concentration from 0. 5 to 2. 5 ppb. Although this EC 50 value disagrees with those (0. 9 − 2. 0 ppm) estimated by the traditional method (JIS K 0229), our simplified method could still be useful to evaluate whether or not chemical agents have toxicity...|$|E
