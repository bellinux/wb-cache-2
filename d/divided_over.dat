5|$|A {{large-scale}} {{slave trade}} with English privateers was begun. The {{life expectancy of}} slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase {{in the numbers of}} slaves. Colonial society was largely <b>divided</b> <b>over</b> the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice. But {{by the turn of the}} 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.|$|E
5|$|According to Diddy, {{the song}} is about loving someone {{so much that you}} forget about yourself.

5|$|In early 1957, Nixon {{undertook}} {{another major}} foreign trip, {{this time to}} Africa. On his return, he helped shepherd the Civil Rights Act of 1957 through Congress. The bill was weakened in the Senate, and civil rights leaders were <b>divided</b> <b>over</b> whether Eisenhower should sign it. Nixon advised the President to sign the bill, which he did. Eisenhower suffered a mild stroke in November 1957, and Nixon gave a press conference, assuring the nation that the Cabinet was functioning well as a team during Eisenhower's brief illness.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic {{party was}} badly <b>divided</b> <b>over</b> the parimutuel betting issue {{as well as}} prohibition, and a {{severance}} tax on coal. The prohibitionist and anti-gambling faction of the Democratic Party—with the help of Louisville Courier-Journal editor Robert Worth Bingham—united to make former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham the party's gubernatorial nominee. Following Beckham's nomination, many pro-gambling and anti-prohibition Democrats hurried to the support of Sampson. Sitting Democratic governor William J. Fields, who had been elected {{with help from the}} Jockey Club, was very passive in the campaign and refused to support Beckham.|$|E
