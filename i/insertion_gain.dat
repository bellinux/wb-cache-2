40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of ground-borne vibration {{levels in the}} vicinity of an underground railway are greatly sought after in modern urban centres. Yet the complexity involved in simulating the underground environment means {{that it is necessary to}} make simplifying assumptions about this system. One such commonly made assumption is to ignore the effects of neighbouring tunnels, despite the fact that many underground railway lines consist of twin-bored tunnels, one for the outbound direction and one for the inbound direction. This paper presents a unique model for two tunnels embedded in a homogeneous, elastic fullspace. Each of these tunnels is subject to both known, dynamic train forces and dynamic cavity forces. The net forces acting on the tunnels are written as the sum of those tractions acting on the invert of a single tunnel, and those tractions that represent the motion induced by the neighbouring tunnel. By apportioning the tractions in this way, the vibration response of a two-tunnel system is written as a linear combination of displacement fields produced by a single-tunnel system. Using Fourier decomposition, forces are partitioned into symmetric and antisymmetric modenumber components to minimise computation times. The significance of the interactions between two tunnels is quantified by calculating the <b>insertion</b> <b>gains,</b> in both the vertical and horizontal directions, that result from the existence of a second tunnel. The insertion-gain results are shown to be localised and highly dependent on frequency, tunnel orientation and tunnel thickness. At some locations, the magnitude of these <b>insertion</b> <b>gains</b> is greater than 20 dB. This demonstrates that a high degree of inaccuracy exists in any surface vibration prediction model that includes only one of the two tunnels. This novel two-tunnel solution represents a significant contribution to the existing body of research into vibration from underground railways, as it shows that the second tunnel has a significant influence on the accuracy of vibration predictions for underground railways...|$|R

30|$|Although cadaveric {{training}} {{provides the}} most realistic experience, cadaveric training is not the preferred method to start training elbow arthroscopy skills. First, because cadaveric training is expensive and there is limited availability (Camp et al., 2016; Stirling et al., 2014). Moreover, as was also shown in this study, the anatomic variation amongst cadaveric specimen {{as well as their}} joint status in due to time compromises similar training conditions for a certain amount of repetitions or trainees. For example, in the present study two peaks of Fabs were observed during navigation of the anterior compartment, around 23  N and 30  N (Fig. 4 a), which were attributable to the use of two cadaver elbows (Mann-Whitney U, p[*]<[*] 0.05). In addition, due to continuous water irrigation of the elbow for a long duration (five elbow arthroscopies) the soft tissues would swell, possibly making portal <b>insertion,</b> <b>gaining</b> orientation and working inside the joint more difficult. In this study, this was observed as moderate differences in the median Fabs of 8.2  N and 3.5  N between the first and last expert in the first and second cadaver elbow, respectively. Consequently, threshold levels as determined in this study should be adjusted per cadaver and training time on the cadaver (swelling due to irrigation). Therefore, we recommend starting training basic elbow arthroscopic skills on a simulator. This will provide the same standard for all trainees at any time, and allows adequate objective feedback by setting one threshold value and facilitates observation of training progress of participants compared to their peers. After obtaining proficiency in basic arthroscopic skills on a simulator, a trainee may advance to cadaveric skills training to become acquainted with the feeling and effect of the loads on human tissues along with learning to adapt to anatomic variations {{as is the case in}} live surgery.|$|R

A study was ma. de of a digital automatic gain control (d. a. g. c.) in open-loop configuration and closed-loop configuration. The former was adopted as the means for carrying out the automatic control of attenuation. It was simulated and tested, both objectively and subjectively. The final part is the assessment of the effects on telephone connections of a d. a. g. c. that introduces gains of 6 dB or 12 dB. This work used a Telephone Connection Assessment Model developed at The University of Aston in Birmingham. The subjective tests showed that the d. a. g. c. gives advantage for listeners when the speech level is very low. The benefit is not great when speech is only a little quieter than preferred. The assessment showed that, when a standard British Telecom earphone is used, <b>insertion</b> of <b>gain</b> is desirable if speech voltage across the earphone terminals is below an upper limit of - 38 dBV. People commented upon the presence of an adaptive-like effect during the tests.

40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of ground-borne vibration {{levels in the}} vicinity of an underground railway are greatly sought after in modern urban centers. Yet the complexity involved in simulating the underground environment means {{that it is necessary to}} make simplifying assumptions about this system. One such commonly made assumption is to ignore the effects of nearby embedded structures such as piled foundations and neighbouring tunnels. Through the formulation of computationally efficient mathematical models, this dissertation examines the dynamic behaviour of these two particular types of structures. The effect of the dynamic behaviour of these structures on the ground-borne vibration generated by an underground railway is considered. The modelling of piled foundations begins with consideration of a single pile embedded in a linear, viscoelastic halfspace. Two approaches are pursued: the modification of an existing plane-strain pile model; and the development of a fully three-dimensional model formulated in the wavenumber domain. Methods for adapting models of infinite structures to simulate finite systems using mirror-imaging techniques are described. The interaction between two neighbouring piles is considered using the method of joining subsystems, and these results are extended to formulate models for pile groups. The mathematical model is validated against existing numerical solutions and is found to be both accurate and efficient. A building model and a model for the pile cap are developed, and are attached to the piled foundation. A case study is used to illustrate a procedure for assessing the vibration performance of pile groups subject to vibration generated by an underground railway. The two-tunnel model uses the superposition of displacement fields to produce a fully coupled model of two infinitely long tunnels embedded in a homogeneous, viscoelastic fullspace. The significance of the interactions occurring between the two tunnels is quantified by calculating the <b>insertion</b> <b>gains</b> that result from the existence of a second tunnel. The results show that a high degree of inaccuracy exists in any underground-railway vibration prediction model that includes only one of the two tunnels present.

40|$|When {{hearing aid}} gain is {{prescribed}} by software, gain is calculated {{based on the}} average acoustics for the age of patient, gender, mold type, and so on. The acoustics of the individual’s ear often vary from the average values, so there will be a mismatch between the prescribed gain and the real-ear gain. Real-ear measurement can be used to verify the gain and adjust it to meet targets, but the quality of the match will be limited by the number of channels and the flexibility of the hearing aid. A potential way to improve this process is to generate a filter that compensates for variations in real-ear <b>insertion</b> <b>gain</b> due to individual ear acoustics.
