The average weight at maturity of Dajal cattle is 500 kg for males and 390 kg for females.The Dajal breed is an offshoot of Bhagnari breed, having almost similar points. However, Dajal cattle are comparatively smaller in size and lighter in color.|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} reports, Nguni <b>type</b> <b>cattle</b> {{have shown}} to have a lower glycolytic potential with less glycogen measured in muscles 1 h post-mortem. With the release of catecholamines in the immediate pre-slaughter period, there is potential for depletion of muscle glycogen, {{because of the fact}} that epinephrine activates muscle adenylate cyclase and thereby stimulates glycogen breakdown. Epinephrine and nor-epinephrine are secreted as a result of any “fight or flight” situation. Tyrosine is a conditionally non-essential large neutral amino acid and the precursor of the neurotransmitters dopamine, nor-epinephrine and epinephrine. Ante-mortem stress experienced by an animal may be influenced by amino acids that provide substrates for neurotransmitter synthesis. The Nguni <b>type</b> <b>cattle</b> showed 55. 8 % and 55. 1 % greater urinary nor-epinephrine values than for the Brahman- and Simmental <b>type</b> <b>cattle</b> respectively. The Nguni <b>type</b> <b>cattle</b> showed 35. 6 % and 43. 8 % greater urinary epinephrine values than the Brahman- and Simmental <b>type</b> <b>cattle</b> respectively. The higher urinary nor-epinephrine and epinephrine levels measured in Nguni <b>type</b> <b>cattle</b> could either be explained by a greater neuronal out flux immediately prior to slaughter or a slower re-uptake...|$|R
