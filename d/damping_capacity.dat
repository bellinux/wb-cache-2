40|$|This manual {{describes}} {{the use of}} the computer code ICAN/DAMP (Integrated Composite Analyzer with Damping Analysis Capabilities) for the prediction of damping in polymer-matrix composites. The code is written in FORTRAN 77 and is a version of the ICAN (Integrated Composite ANalyzer) computer program. The code incorporates a new module for synthesizing the material damping from micromechanics to laminate level. Explicit micromechanics equations based on hysteretic damping are programmed relating the on-axis <b>damping</b> <b>capacities</b> to the fiber and matrix properties and fiber volume ratio. The <b>damping</b> <b>capacities</b> of unidirectional composites subjected to off-axis loading are synthesized from on-axis damping values. The hygrothermal effect on the damping performance of unidirectional composites caused by temperature and moisture variation is modeled along with the damping contributions from interfacial friction between broken fibers and matrix. The temperature rise is continuously vibrating composite plies and composite laminates is also estimated. The ICAN/DAMP user's manual provides descriptions of the damping analysis module's functions, structure, input requirements, output interpretation, and execution requirements. It only addresses the changes required to conduct the damping analysis and is used in conjunction with the 'Second Generation Integrated Composite Analyzer (ICAN) Computer Code' user's manual (NASA TP- 3290) ...|$|R

50|$|Gray iron is {{a common}} {{engineering}} alloy because of its relatively low cost and good machinability, which results from the graphite lubricating the cut and breaking up the chips. It also has good galling and wear resistance because the graphite flakes self lubricate. The graphite also gives gray iron an excellent <b>damping</b> <b>capacity</b> because it absorbs the energy and converts it into heat. Grey iron cannot be worked (forged, extruded, rolled etc.) even at temperature.|$|E
50|$|The {{graphite}} {{takes on}} {{the shape of a}} three-dimensional flake. In two dimensions, as a polished surface, the graphite flakes appear as fine lines. The graphite has no appreciable strength, so they can be treated as voids. The tips of the flakes act as preexisting notches at which stresses concentrate and it therefore behaves in a brittle manner. The presence of graphite flakes makes the Grey Iron easily machinable as they tend to crack easily across the graphite flakes. Grey iron also has very good <b>damping</b> <b>capacity</b> and hence it is often used as the base for machine tool mountings.|$|E

A model for mechanical damping in porous materials is suggested for the "microplastic" range of deformation on the basis of statistical mechanics of micro-heterogeneous materials. Two types of heterogeneity are discussed: one-level porosity (direct by sintered powder steels) and two-level porosity (larger pores in carcass with smaller pores). (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{differences}} between structural metal and fiber-reinforced composites. For example, metals in general exhibit yielding and plastic deformation, whereas most fiber-reinforced composites are elastic in their tensile stress-strain characteristics. However, the dissimilar nature of these materials provides mechanisms for high-energy absorption on a microscopic scale comparable to the yielding process. Depending on the type and severity of external loads, a composite laminate may exhibit gradual deterioration in properties but usually does not fail in a catastrophic manner. Mechanisms of damage development and growth in metal and composite structure are also quite different. Other important characteristics of many fiber-reinforced composites are their non-corroding behavior, high <b>damping</b> <b>capacity</b> and low coefficients of thermal expansion.|$|E

The <b>damping</b> <b>capacity</b> of austempered ductile cast iron was rapidly increased by the austempering treatment, although it was not affected by the austempering temperature or time. After subjecting the austempered ductile cast iron to subzero treatment, the austenite was transformed into martensite, and the volume fraction of the martensite increased as the subzero treatment temperature decreased. The subzero treatment sharply increased the <b>damping</b> <b>capacity</b> of the austempered ductile cast iron.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} constitutive {{theory is}} proposed {{to describe and}} characterize the hysteretic elastoplastic response of nanocomposite materials caused by the inelastic shear stick–slip between carbon nanotubes and the surrounding matrix. The theory combines the mean-field homogenization method based on the Eshelby equivalent inclusion theory, the Mori–Tanaka homogenization approach, {{and the concept of}} inhomogeneous inclusions affected by inelastic eigenstrains. The shear stick–slip is accounted for as an incremental plastic eigenstrain in the inclusions. The evolution of the introduced plastic eigenstrain is regulated by a constitutive law based on a micromechanical adjustment of the von Mises function based on the interfacial stress discontinuity. Parametric studies show that the investigated carbon nanotube composites can exhibit superior <b>damping</b> <b>capacities</b> by determining optimal nano/micro-scale constitutive parameters to maximize the nanofrictional energy dissipation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The <b>damping</b> <b>capacities</b> {{of a few}} Al and Zn based foams are {{studied and}} {{compared}} with those of dense Al and some well known low and high damping materials measured under the same conditions. The damping in metallic foams is rather high and in a certain range of amplitude of bending vibrations comparable with pure Mg. Density, pore size, chemical composition, pre-deformation, and time of vibration influence the amplitude dependent damping of the foams. Whereas the damping increases significantly with the number of vibration cycles, the lifetime of the foam material is rather short due to fatigue. The changes in resonance frequency and logarithmic decrement () pd are used to describe damping and fatigue kinetics. The dislocation damping in foams is enhanced by highly localised stresses in comparison to the corresponding dense materials. An additional damping mechanism arises at high number of alternating loading or high local stresses by the formation, growth and movement of cracks...|$|R

40|$|It is {{desirable}} to obtain materials that have high vibration damping while maintaining other structural properties. Aerospace quality composite materials typically have greater strength and stiffness to weight ratios than most metals, while providing increased damping. However, their passive <b>damping</b> <b>capacities</b> {{are not enough}} for some applications. Fiber reinforced elastomers (FRE) or elastomer composites are receiving attention because {{of the ability to}} tailor their vibration damping, strength, fracture toughness, and elongation to the range needed. The current work considers a series of aluminum panels that are laminated with “skins ” of graphite cloth, fiberglass cloth, and with chopped fiberglass mat. The reinforcements are impregnated with a series of polyurethane elastomers that range from flexible to rigid in hardness. For a given type of fiberglass, the lower durometer elastomer produced the highest loss factor. For a given elastomer stiffness, the stiffest reinforcement produced the highest damping. In general the skin loss factors are inversely proportional to the equivalent axial in-plane stiffness of the composite. Skin loss factors range from 1. 5 % to approximately 20 %.
