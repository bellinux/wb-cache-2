25|$|Direct skyglow {{is reduced}} by {{selecting}} lighting fixtures which {{limit the amount of}} light emitted above the horizontal (90° above the nadir). Indirect skyglow produced by reflections from illuminated surfaces is harder to manage; effective methods for limiting it include the use of low-impact lamp types (e.g. amber sources, see above), minimizing over-illumination and inefficient designs or fixtures that spread light where it is not needed. But it has {{to be taken into account}} that, according to late 2010 publications, Italian regions using <b>full</b> <b>cut</b> off lighting only does not increase skyglow. Anyway, light reflected upwards by dark surfaces such as roads or buildings can be considered as minor, so debate about the contribution of indirect skyglow will continue.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{using the}} {{definition}} of [...] "light pollution" [...] from some Italian regional bills (i.e., [...] "every irradiance of artificial light outside competence areas and particularly upward the sky") only full cutoff design prevents light pollution. The Italian Lombardy region, where only full cutoff design is allowed (Lombardy act no. 17/2000, promoted by Cielobuio-coordination {{for the protection of}} the night sky), in 2007 had the lowest per capita energy consumption for public lighting in Italy. The same legislation also imposes a minimum distance between street lamps of about four times their height, so <b>full</b> <b>cut</b> off street lamps are the best solution to reduce both light pollution and electrical power usage.|$|E

A hundred or more, averaging {{at least a hundred}} feet in height, stood motionless in the <b>full</b> <b>cut</b> of the strong trade- wind. One would have expected them, when the wood round was felled, to feel the sudden nakedness. One would have expected the inrush of salt air and foam to have injured their foliage. But, seemingly, it was not so. They stood utterly unharmed; save some half-dozen who had had their tops snapped off by a gale--there are no hurricanes in Trinidad--and remained as enormous unmeaning pikes, or posts, fifty to eighty feet high, transformed, by that one blast, from one of the loveliest to one of the ugliest natural objects.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was on the}} {{shortest}} day of the year--St. Thomas's Day--at {{seven in the morning}} (half-past eleven of English time, just as the old women at Eversley would have been going round the parish for their 'goodying'), that we became aware of the blue mountains of North Trinidad ahead of us; to the west of them the island of the Dragon's Mouth; and westward again, a cloud among the clouds, the last spur of the Cordilleras of the Spanish Main. There was South America at last; and as a witness that this, too, was no dream, the blue water of the Windward Islands changed suddenly into foul bottle-green. [...] The waters of the Orinoco, waters from the peaks of the Andes far away, were staining the sea around us. With thoughts full of three great names, connected, as long as civilised man shall remain, with those waters--Columbus, Raleigh, Humboldt--we steamed on, to see hills, not standing out, like those of the isles which we had passed, in intense clearness of green and yellow, purple and blue, but all shrouded in haze, like those of the Hebrides or the West of Ireland. Onward through a narrow channel in the mountain-wall, not a rifle-shot across, which goes by the name of the Ape's Mouth, banked by high cliffs of dark Silurian rock--not bare, though, as in Britain, but furred with timber, festooned with lianes, down to the very spray of the gnawing surf. One little stack of rocks, not thirty feet high, and as many broad, stood almost {{in the midst of the}} channel, and in the very northern mouth of it, exposed to the <b>full</b> <b>cut</b> of surf and trade-wind. But the plants on it, even seen through the glasses, told us where we were. One huge low tree covered the top with shining foliage, like that of a Portugal laurel; all around it upright Cerei reared their gray candelabra, and below them, hanging down the rock to the very surf, deep green night-blowing Cereus twined and waved, looking just like a curtain of gigantic stag's-horn moss. We ran through the channel; then amid more low wooded islands, it may be for a mile, before a strong back current rushing in from the sea; and then saw before us a vast plain of muddy water. No shore was visible to the westward; to the eastward the northern hills of Trinidad, forest clad, sank to the water; to the south lay a long line of coast, generally level with the water's edge, and green with mangroves, or dotted with coco- palms. That was the Gulf of Paria, and Trinidad beyond.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAim To {{optimise}} interfaces of endothelial buttons {{created with}} femtosecond (FS) lasers. Setting Department of Ophthalmology, Hôtel-Dieu Hospital, Paris, France. Methods Forty-two corneas {{were divided into}} five groups of various cutting patterns and a control group of 100  μm laser in situ keratomileusis flap creation. A single path <b>full</b> lamellar <b>cut</b> (500  μm) was applied to groups 1 and 2. The same <b>full</b> lamellar <b>cut</b> was applied twice to groups 3 and 4. Two successive lamellar cuts were performed in group 5 (350 and 150  μm). 60  kHz and 150  kHz were used respectively in groups 1, 3, 5, 6 and 2, 4. In each group, different laser settings were tested to obtain the best interface quality while delivering minimal energy to the stroma. The quality of stromal interfaces from created endothelial lenticules was observed using a scanning electron microscope. Results Stromal adherences persisted after both the single- and double-path procedure, creating central irregularities on the endothelial lenticule. Among all groups and settings tested, the double-layer pattern (group 5) with FS <b>full</b> lamellar <b>cut</b> parameters set for diameter (mm), depth (μm), energy (μJ) and spot size/step (μm) respectively on 9. 0  mm, 350  μm, 2. 1  μJ, 4 : 4  μm and 8. 3  mm, 150  μm, 0. 9  μJ, 4 : 4  μm created the smoothest interfaces with the best reproducibility.
