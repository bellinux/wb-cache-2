5|$|Female {{cockroaches}} {{are sometimes}} seen carrying egg cases {{on the end}} of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The <b>egg</b> <b>capsule</b> may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

500|$|T. fluviatilis {{eggs are}} usually laid in from mid-April to October, in {{temperatures}} above 10°C. Eggs are laid in egg capsules deposited on stones and sometimes on shells of conspecific individuals. Females usually lay a cluster containing 4–5 capsules. A single female will usually lay about 40 capsules during summer, and about 20 capsules during autumn. Fresh capsules are white, but older capsules become yellow or brown and [...] may bear an epiphytic outer layer. The capsules are around 1mm in diameter (0.9–1.1mm), but in brackish water {{they are usually}} smaller (about 0.8mm). Empty (sterile) small capsules (0.5–0.8mm in diameter) can also be laid. The number of eggs per <b>egg</b> <b>capsule</b> changes depending on [...] the environment. There are 100–200 eggs in each capsule in freshwater, as opposed to 55–80 eggs in each capsule in brackish water. Usually, only one egg develops, with the remaining eggs serving as nutrition for the embryo, which results in a single juvenile snail hatching from each capsule.|$|E
40|$|Many organisms {{naturally}} {{defend themselves}} against microbial attachment and biofouling in the marine environment. In this study, we investigated microbial fouling on 2 molluscan <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) with bacterial viability staining and bacterial attachment experiments with the biofilm-forming Pseudoalteromonas sp. S 91 in flow chambers. Results indicated that early stage <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> of Dicathais orbita (Neogastropoda) are relatively free of surface microorganisms. <b>Egg</b> <b>capsules</b> during the trocophore stage had a regularly ridged microtexture, but as capsules matured, shedding of the outer wall was observed, followed by the extrusion of unidentified droplets, which then accumulated on the capsule surface in association with bacteria. By comparison, the <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> of Sepioteuthis australis (Cephalopoda) {{were found to have}} an irregular surface with many hills and valleys that accommodate colonization by a variety of microorganisms. At the later stages of development these squid <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> become heavily colonized by algal spores. Cross sections of <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> revealed that S. australis capsule walls were about 12 times thicker than D. orbita <b>egg</b> <b>capsules.</b> Staining the <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> with BacLight™ also revealed a significantly thicker biofilm, with more live and dead bacteria on S. australis capsules than on those of D. orbita (p < 0. 05). Flow chamber experiments indicated that the surface of S. australis capsules provided a suitable substrate for colonization by Pseudoalteromonas sp. S 91, whereas colonization was significantly less on D. orbita <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> after 24 and 72 h (p < 0. 01). These experiments indicated that D. orbita <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> are better defended against fouling microbes than are the eggs of S. australis. D. orbita appears to use a combination of physical, mechanical and possibly chemical defense mechanisms to reduce fouling on their <b>egg</b> <b>capsules...</b>|$|R

40|$|The endosymbiotic umagillid Anoplodium parasita Schneider, 1858 (Platyhelminthes, Rhabdocoela) {{lives in}} the perivisceral coelom of the sea {{cucumber}} Holothuria tubulosa Gmelin, 1788 (Echinodermata, Holothuroida). The flatworms release their <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> in the coelomic cavity of their host, where they are embedded in brown bodies concentrated in the posterior part of the body, near the cloaca. The infestation of the holothurians by turbellarian <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> was very high: 128 out of the 202 holothurians inspected from January 1999 to July 2000 at Banyuls-sur-mer (France) contained at least 6 and up to 10, 000 <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> (mean 1433). Quite uniform throughout the year, the number of holothuroids infested {{as well as the}} number of <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> found per individual drastically fall in July, the period when the gonads of holothurians are highly developed. We suggest that the release of <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> might be an indirect result of the spawning of the hosts. To discharge their gametes, holothurians raise their body and adhere on the substratum by their posterior end. This behaviour would cause a surpressure in the peri-cloacal coelomic area of the holothurians and consequently the expulsion of the coelomic fluids through their coelo-cloacal ducts, carrying brown bodies and <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> to the outside...|$|R
500|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the {{porbeagle}} is aplacental viviparous with oophagy, i.e. {{the main source of}} embryonic nutrition are unfertilized eggs. During the first half of pregnancy, the mother ovulates enormous numbers of tiny ova, packed into capsules up to [...] long, into her uteruses. A newly conceived embryo is sustained by a yolk sac and emerges from its <b>egg</b> <b>capsule</b> at [...] long. At this time, the embryo has well-developed external gills and a spiral valve intestine. When the embryo is [...] long, it has resorbed its external gills and most of its yolk sac, but cannot yet feed as it lacks the means to open egg capsules. At a length of , the embryo grows two massive, recurved [...] "fangs" [...] in the lower jaw for tearing open capsules, as well as two much smaller teeth in the upper jaw. It begins to feed voraciously on yolk, acquiring an enormously distended stomach; to accommodate this, the muscles on the belly split down the middle and the skin on the abdomen stretches greatly.|$|E
500|$|Larvae hatch {{after two}} to five weeks, {{depending}} largely on temperature. In the first days after hatching, they live on their remaining embryonic yolk supply and {{are not able to}} swim, but attach to plants or the <b>egg</b> <b>capsule</b> with two balancers, adhesive organs on their head. After this period, they begin to ingest small invertebrates, and actively forage about ten days after hatching. As in all salamanders and newts, forelimbs—already present as stumps at hatching—develop first, followed later by the backlegs. Unlike smaller newts, Triturus larvae are mostly nektonic, swimming freely in the water column. Just before the transition to land, the larvae [...] their external gills; they can at this stage reach a size of [...] in the larger species. Metamorphosis takes place two to four months after hatching, but the duration of all stages of larval development varies with temperature. Survival of larvae from hatching to metamorphosis has been estimated at a mean of roughly 4% for the northern crested newt, which is comparable to other newts. In unfavourable conditions, larvae may delay their development and overwinter in water, although this seems to be less common than in the small-bodied newts. Paedomophic adults, retaining their gills and staying aquatic, have occasionally been observed in several crested newt species.|$|E
500|$|The {{mating season}} in {{temperate}} climates typically {{takes place in}} autumn, while in tropical areas, mating can occur {{at any time of}} the year. To mate following courtship, the male usually leaps onto the female's back, clasping her thorax and wing bases with his forelegs. He then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near the tip of the female's abdomen. The female lays between 10 and 400 eggs, depending on the species. Eggs are typically deposited in a froth mass-produced by glands in the abdomen. This froth hardens, creating a protective capsule, which together with the egg mass is called an ootheca. Depending on the species, the ootheca can be attached to a flat surface, wrapped around a plant, or even deposited in the ground. Despite the versatility and durability of the eggs, they are often preyed on, especially by several species of parasitoid wasps. In a few species, mostly ground and bark mantises in the family Tarachodidae, the mother guards the eggs. The cryptic Tarachodes maurus positions herself on bark with her abdomen covering her <b>egg</b> <b>capsule,</b> ambushing passing prey and moving very little until the eggs hatch. An unusual reproductive strategy is adopted by Brunner's stick mantis from the southern United States; no males have ever been found in this species, and the females breed parthenogenetically. The ability to reproduce by parthenogenesis has been recorded in at least two other species, Sphodromantis viridis and Miomantis sp., although these species usually reproduce sexually. [...] In temperate climates, adults do not survive the winter and the eggs undergo a diapause, hatching in the spring.|$|E

In laboratory conditions, females {{have been observed}} depositing over 90 <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> in 4 days, and 173 in 17 days. Each capsule contains hundreds of 0.2mm eggs. Veliger larvae hatch from the capsule after ~24 days, depending on temperature.|$|R
2500|$|Marine animals, and {{particularly}} bony fish, commonly reproduce by broadcast spawning. This is an external {{method of reproduction}} where the female releases many unfertilised eggs into the water. At the same time, a male or many males release a lot of sperm into the water which fertilises some of these eggs. The eggs contain a drop of nutrient oil to sustain the [...] embryo as it develops inside the egg case. The oil also provides buoyancy, so the eggs float and drift with the current. The strategy for survival of broadcast spawning is to disperse the fertilised eggs, preferably away from the coast into the relative safety of the open ocean. [...] There the larvae develop as they consume their fat stores, and eventually hatch from the <b>egg</b> <b>capsule</b> into miniature versions of their parents.|$|E

Moreover, it is unknown whether egg masses across the geographic range of A. maculatum, or other amphibians, associate with one or multiple algal taxa. To address these questions, we conducted a phylogeographic study of algae sampled from <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> of A. maculatum, its allopatric congener A. gracile, and two frogs: Lithobates sylvatica and L. aurora. All of these North American amphibians form associations with algae in their <b>egg</b> <b>capsules.</b> We sampled algae from <b>egg</b> <b>capsules</b> of these four amphibians from localities across North America, established representative algal cultures, and amplified and sequenced a region of 18 S rDNA for phylogenetic analysis.
