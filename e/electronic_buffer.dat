40|$|Abstract—The rapid {{increase}} in Internet traffic is forcing packet routers to grow in capacity to meet the demand. Optical packet routers with less buffering and {{a greater degree of}} optical transparency are actively being researched as a way to improve energy efficiency and capacity scaling over traditional electronic routers. Since it is difficult to buffer packets in the optical domain, in this paper we analyze the performance of a hybrid optoelectronic packet router. The router architecture has multiple optical switch planes and a shared <b>electronic</b> <b>buffer</b> to resolve output-port contention. By using multiple ports on the switch planes for each input and output fiber, and by using some switch-plane ports to inter-connect the planes, we can achieve a relatively low packet loss ratio in a router with no buffer. In this case, most traffic can be switched using only the through optical paths of the router without entering the shared buffer. The shared <b>electronic</b> <b>buffer</b> is primarily used to reduce the packet drop ratio under periods of heavy loads and occasionally for optical regeneration of a packet. We run extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the router with varying number of switch plane ports, number of connections to the <b>electronic</b> <b>buffer,</b> and number of interconnections between the switch planes. We show that the router can provide good throughput, with realistic on-off bursty traffic and asynchronous packet arrivals. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} optical and electronic technologies in future high-capacity routers. In particular, optical and electronic technologies {{for use in the}} key router functions of buffering and switching are compared. The comparison is based on aggressive but plausible estimates of buffer and switch performance projected out to around 2020. The analysis of buffer technologies uses a new model of power dissipation in optical-delay-line buffers using optical fiber and planar waveguides, in-cluding slow-light waveguides. Using this model together with models of storage capacity in ideal and nonideal slow-light delay lines, the power dissipation and scaling characteristics of optical and <b>electronic</b> <b>buffers</b> are compared. The author concludes that planar integrated optical buffers occupy larger chip area than <b>electronic</b> <b>buffers,</b> dissipate more power than <b>electronic</b> <b>buffers,</b> and are limited in capacity to, at most, a few IP packets. Optical fiber-based buffers have lower power dissipation but are bulky. The author also concludes that electronic buffering will remain the technology of choice in future high-capacity routers. The power dissipation of high-capacity optical and electronic cross connects for a number of cross connect architectures is compared. The author shows that optical and electronic cross connects dissipate similar power and require a similar chip area. Optical technologies show a potential for inclusion in high-capacity routers, especially as the basis for arrayed-waveguide-grating-based cross connects and as components in E/O/E interconnects. A major challenge in large cross connects, both optical and electronic, will be to efficiently manage the very large number of interconnects between chips and boards. The general conclusion is that electronic tech-nologies are likely to remain as integral components in the signal transmission path of future high-capacity routers. There {{does not appear to be}} a compelling case for replacing electronic routers with optically transparent optical packet switches.

The system under development can be scaled up to a very large ports count, in the thousand order, enabling interconnection of {{a great number of}} servers. An important feature of this optical packet switch is the few nanoseconds reconfiguration time, regardless of the port count. This characteristic is essential to minimize the end-to-end latency. Flow control is employed to regulate packets transmission between the <b>electronic</b> <b>buffers</b> of the ingress and egress ports. The limited contention resolution capability of the optical packet switch is compensated by these <b>electronic</b> <b>buffers</b> and a retransmissions algorithm.

40|$|Going beyond {{wavelength}} switching, {{researchers have}} proposed several packet-based optical switching schemes. These schemes allow the bandwidth {{of an individual}} wavelength channel to be further sub-divided in a dynamic way, as optical network users may not always require the full capacity of a wavelength channel. These packet-based optical switching schemes include Optical Burst Switching (OBS) and Optical Packet Switching (OPS). One of {{the challenges of the}} OBS and OPS schemes is the implementation of the optical buffer. The only optical technology that appears feasible for providing optical buffer in the near future is Fiber Delay Line (FDL). Compared with Random Access Memory (RAM) <b>electronic</b> <b>buffer,</b> FDL is basically a first-in-first-out fixed delay line. Implementation of optical buffer by FDL is complicated and relatively expensive. We believe that optical buffering must be used sparingly and effectively in optical networks. The second challenge of the OBS and OPS schemes is the complexity in header processing. We introduce the concept of Photonic Circuit Switching (PCS) as a method for sub-division of the capacity of a wavelength channel in optical networks. The advantage of PCS is that header processing is not required, and that with proper designs, optical buffer requirement can also be minimized. PCS is completely analogous to TDM circuit switching, except that it operates in the optical domain while the latter operates in the electronic domain. Hence, in PCS, signal transmission on a link is partitioned into fix-sized time-slots and these time slots are organized into repetitive frames of a fixed number of slots. The focus in this thesis is to consider ways to route and select time slots for photonic circuits so that buffering requirement in the network can be minimized. We refer to this as the Time-slot Assignment (RTA) problem. Some heuristic algorithms for RTA are investigated, and comparisons are made between coupled schemes and uncoupled schemes - in the former routing and time-slot assignment are solved together as one problem, and in the latter the routing problem is solved first. A shortest path algorithm is devised such that by expanding the network into a set of virtual nodes, we can flexibly solve the RTA problem under various bandwidth/buffer cost. In our quantitative results, measurements of bandwidth blocking and buffer blocking probabilities are presented which should serve as an important guidance to designers of PCS networks...|$|E
40|$|Optical buffers are {{essential}} components of future optical switches for resolving contentions among arriving packets. Currently, optical buffers {{are composed of}} Fiber Delay Lines (FDL). Unlike the conventional <b>electronic</b> <b>buffer,</b> optical buffer only has finite time resolution, which introduces a void period between two successive buffered packets. The void period leads to service interruptions and deteriorates the buffer performance. We develop a queueing system with exceptional service for the first packet in each busy period to model the buffer behavior. For the first time, the closed-form expressions of packet blocking probability and mean delay of optical buffer are derived. We show that the packet blocking probability can be minimized by finding the optimal FDL time granularity. This optimal granularity is neither sensitive to packet length distribution, nor sensitive to the buffer length, it is mainly determined by the traffic load. Service interruption is a special case of varying service rate. A current trend in wireless communication is to enable devices to operate using many different transmission rates. This motivates us to develop the queueing models with varying service rate. We apply the continuous time Markov chain to characterize the service rate varying process, and develop a queueing system with Markov-modulated service rate. In this kind of problem, due to the complex interaction between the rate varying process and packet arrival process, {{it is hard to}} characterize the server state evolvement; this makes it difficult to get an analytical solution, even the server only has two service rates. To escape the trap, first, we develop a discrete time Markov chain to model the server state transition process, which makes our problem to be easily manipulated. Second, apart from the previous methods, we concentrate on the moments of the packet number in system. We find the recursive relationship between the moments of packet number, this fundamental relationship widely exists in the birth-death queue systems. Our results provide a new methodology to the design of communication systems with varying service rate. This thesis is aimed to study the interaction between service interruption and the operation of communication systems, and develop analytical methods to help the design and optimization of communication systems with interrupted services. Our work are focused on two systems: optical buffer and wireless sensor network. The common ground of these two problems is they both present the features of service interruption. Wireless sensor network is an ad hoc network consisting of hundreds of sensor nodes equipped with limited power sources, transmission range and functionality. A simple and effective way to save energy and prolong the network lifetime is to let the nodes interrupt their sensing and data transmission process, enter sleep mode randomly. However, sleep mode corresponds to low power consumption as well as to reduced network capacity, increased latency and slowed system response. We develop a queueing model with server shutting down in a varying neighborhood to model the behavior of sensor nodes, Combining the node queueing model and the network flow balance model, we construct an analytical framework to model the network performance, derive the network capacity, packet delivery delay and node responsive property. We also develop a node power consumption model, which takes the node sleep to active transition frequency into consideration. Our results demonstrate that the sleep/active dynamics produces the predominant impact on the average power consumption and packet delay, and properly choosing the time scale of sleep/active cycle is vital to design a power-efficient sensor network.

40|$|For {{the future}} {{development}} of residential broadband telecommunication services the present access infrastructure must be upgraded. Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) optical networks, though still expensive today, {{appear to be}} a future-proof solution. FTTH networks based on passive optical Remote Nodes (RN) and supporting ATM switching (ATM-PONs) have been demonstrated and are going to be standardized. In these networks the optical hardware in the RN is very simple, but a multiple access protocol is needed for upstream traffic control. In most protocols proposed in literature the control is performed electronically in a centralized wayby the Central Office (CO). In this paper we study multiple access schemes for FTTH networks which perform upstream traffic control in a distributed way with the intervention of the user Optical Network Terminations (ONTs) and of the RN only. We will also consider the case, based on recent research in photonic packet switching, in which the RN is able to perform alloptical ATM-multiplexing. We will employ ONT-RN signalling to make the relatively expensive RN optical buffer co-operate with the <b>electronic</b> <b>buffers</b> located in the ONTs. The different solutions presented will be compared by simulating the network behavior under various traffic conditions. In conclusion, in this work we evaluate performance advantages achievable in FTTH networks by increasing the optical complexity of the RN and by introducing control schemes which allow a distributed upstream traffic management and, {{in the case of an}} RN able to perform all-optical ATM-multiplexing, the co-operation of the RN buffer with the ONT buffers...|$|R
40|$|The {{advance in}} wavelength-division {{multiplexing}} (WDM) technology, which propagates {{closer to the}} network edge, enables the proliferation of applications with very high bandwidth and stringent performance requirements. However, today’s core networks, which mainly employ electronics for bulk processing and switching, eventually will become strained in both capacity and flexibility. The introduction of optical technologies in switching functions is a major evolution of core network. To relieve electronics switching, optical concepts like wavelength, waveband, and even fiber switching were developed and are currently introduced, e. g. by reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (i. e. ROADM) and all-optical cross-connects (i. e. OXC). Optical switching methods have many distinct advantages compared with electrical switches: removing the expensive Optical-Electronic-Optical (OEO) conversion; providing high switching speed; benefiting environment with reduced power consumption; being independent with protocol and bit rates of the network. However, the clear and concrete solution of the switching architecture {{for the next generation}} optical networks has not been decided. In this thesis, a switching architecture named 3 - Level-Integrated-Hybrid-Optical-Network (i. e. 3 LIHON) is introduced as a potential candidate for the next-generation optical networks. Its virtue is related to the combination of merits of three different switching paradigms, which have different switching granularities. Accordingly three different traffic transport types (i. e., service classes) are transmitted on the same wavelength in a time-interleaved way. Thus, 3 LIHON network can utilize the network resources efficiently while supporting a wide range of service classes with different service demands. 3 LIHON concept is first proposed in proceedings of international conference IEEE GLOBECOM in 2011. Its novel concept opens wide variable research scenarios, ranging from the architecture realization and implementation (e. g. the detailed switching subsystem architectures definition and the respective working principles), to performance and availability evaluation (e. g. the performance metrics of each service class under the employed working principles and the architecture), as well as overall network architecture cost and power consumption analysis. The 3 LIHON concept is the starting point of this PhD thesis. This thesis focuses on three research directions based on 3 LIHON concept: first is the 3 LIHON subsystem architecture design; second is the performance evaluation of the considered architecture; third is the performance modelling of employed working principles inside 3 LIHON network (e. g. the preemptive scheduling which is widely used inside 3 LIHON network-queue scheduling and part of output contention resolution mechanism). The ten included papers respond to these three directions and form the main contributions of this thesis. Among these contributions three concrete topics are treated in this thesis, i. e. the architecture design of 3 LIHON edge node, OPS subsystem definition and improvement, the scheduling algorithm inside 3 LIHON network and the respective performance modelling. The 3 LIHON concept defines three service classes which are served by different switch subsystems: Guaranteed Service Type (i. e. GST); Statistically Multiplexing/Real-Time service type (i. e. SM/RT); Statistically Multiplexing/Best- Effort service type (i. e. SM/BE). GST service, which covers high real-time and bandwidth demands applications, is handled by OXC. OXC is the best choice for large scale high performance demands applications, due to its resource reservation and monopoly. By being handled by OXC, the strict performance of GST service can be guaranteed. SM/RT service, corresponding to very low bandwidth but very high real time demands applications, is switched by OPS equipped with limited or no buffer, due to its high switching speed and extremely short delay time. SM/BE service, which covers low real time demands applications, is served by EPS (i. e. electronic packet switching) which employs <b>electronic</b> <b>buffers</b> to reduce the respective packet loss as much as possible. However, how to map the incoming traffic into the three predefined service classes, which is operated by 3 LIHON edge node, is not given by 3 LIHON concept. Thus the first research topic of this PhD thesis is to design the 3 LIHON edge node. The respective architecture (e. g. how to add up the traffic into 3 LIHON network) and detailed working principles (e. g. the assembly algorithm of the GST traffic, the queueing scheduling for each buffer subsystem and the output contention resolution mechanism) are given in this thesis. The proposed architecture employs multiple <b>electronic</b> <b>buffers</b> to add up the local traffic into 3 LIHON network whereas whether the cross traffic go through the <b>electronic</b> <b>buffers</b> depends on the service type. For GST, which is transmitted in circuit switched mode, no contention exists between local and transit GST traffic. Thus only the local GST traffic goes through the <b>electronic</b> <b>buffers.</b> We introduce the MBMAP (e. g. Max-Burstlength-Max-Assembly-Period) assembly algorithm to produce the GST burst. For SM/RT, which is very sensitive to packet delay and packet loss, we give the high priority to transit SM/RT traffic which is not buffered. The local SM/RT traffic goes through very limited <b>electronic</b> <b>buffers</b> in the 3 LIHON edge node to reduce the packet loss introduced in the switch input. For SM/BE, which has high tolerance toward delay time, the sufficient size <b>electronic</b> <b>buffers</b> are employed in edge node to reduce its packet loss. For the switch output, where three service classes compete for the same wavelengths, the hierarchical contention resolution mechanism is applied. The GST service has the non-preemptive priority over SM/RT service, whereas both GST and SM/RT have preemptive priority over SM/BE service. For the performance evaluation of this proposed edge node architecture, six source types and two traffic types are applied to model the traffic inside the network as realistic as possible. This thesis mainly applies Demos/Simula to execute the simulations. The results showed that the proposed 3 LIHON edge node architecture provides desirable performance for each service class. The detailed architecture and parameters’ design guidelines are given according to the results. The second topic in this thesis is the OPS subsystem definition. For 3 LIHON network, the OPS subsystem is mainly used for switching very high real-time and low bandwidth demand SM/RT traffic. Thus the potential OPS candidate should have no/limited buffers to reduce the introduced delay. And the economic cost of OPS (e. g. the small physic size and the mature optical components) should be made as cheap as possible due to its extremely low requirement of throughput. Till now a lot of OPS architectures have been proposed. However, most of them focus on the packet contention resolution, fast packet switching and QoS. Not much attention is paid regarding the maturity of optical components and the corresponding economic cost, which are also major issues for the OPS subsystem of 3 LIHON network. In order to achieve the best OPS candidate, we first evaluate the existing OPS architectures. Among them, the well-known OPS architecture equipped with limited range wavelength converters (i. e. OPS-LRWC) attracts research efforts. Compared with the general OPS with full wavelength converters (i. e. OPS-FWC), it is more promising due to its smaller physical size, less economic cost and easier implementation. To evaluate its performance, two separate Markov models are built to evaluate the packet loss of OPSLRWC under different network scenarios. The upper and lower packet loss values are derived directly by these two models. The results show that these two models provide desirable packet loss bounds for OPS-LRWC, independent of the employed conversion policies. Furthermore, the applicability of the proposed models depends on the normalized system load, the conversion range of the LRWCs, and the employed conversion policy. In addition, the results show that the packet loss decreases as the conversion range increases. However, different from the synchronous OPS networks, which have a threshold of the conversion range for limiting the performance improvement, no choice of the best wavelength conversion range exists in the asynchronous OPS networks. In order to find the best candidate, we also propose a novel OPS architecture equipped with input concentrators before the switch fabric. Multiple cascaded fiber delay lines are used to build the input concentrators, the main function of which is to aggregate the incoming traffic from same wavelength into only one input link of switch fabric. Accordingly, the physical size and the respective economic cost of OPS are reduced significantly, whereas the link utilization increases dramatically. This architecture is designed special for very low incoming traffic scenario, e. g. 3 LIHON network scenario. However, the employment of input concentrators would introduce the additional delay time in the switch input. In order to evaluate its performance, we build a one-dimensional Markov model according to the packet departure process from the input concentrator. The packet loss and mean packet delay introduced by input concentrators can be given by Markov model directly. The results show that the additional delay time is far less than the tolerant delay time. Meanwhile a learning curve model is introduced to analyze its economic cost, which is expressed as a function of time. The proposed OPS architecture is firstly compared with OPS without input concentrators based on AWG, and then compared with the OPSLRWC architectures based on B&S switch fabric (i. e. broadcast and select). Both results show that the proposed OPS architecture is much cheaper while providing same performance as these architectures. Some more works has been done to improve the proposed OPS architecture, in which the input concentrators dominate the performance of whole OPS node. We generalize the input concentrators as multiple input single output delay-line optical buffers. A novel modeling approach is developed to denote the delay time evolution of each new arrival to the buffer. Both fixed (all packets’ length is constant) and variable length (the packet length follows n. e. d. distribution) incoming traffic are considered. This approach is validated by simulations under different network scenarios. The results show that the basic FDL length is a very important parameter for the buffer performance. The optimal FDL length value is dominated by incoming traffic load and the packet length (mean packet length for case-n. e. d. incoming packets), and independent of the buffer size offered by buffer. These results validate that setting the FDL length same as the packet length is not the best choice for delay-line buffers. Meanwhile, this approach gives the guidelines for designing the optical buffer with the best performance under different scenarios. By adjusting the basic FDL length value, the performance of the whole OPS node can be improved significantly. It is noticeable that all results achieved from this topic can not only be used in 3 LIHON network, but also very useful for general optical network scenarios, e. g. the proposed OPS architecture can widely be employed in the access networks with low entrance traffic; the evaluation results from the proposed input concentrators can generally be used for improving the general optical networks with such delay-line buffers. The third topic of this thesis is the evaluation of preemptive scheduling, which is widely used in optical networks as service differentiation. In 3 LIHON network, the hierarchical contention resolution mechanism is employed at the switch output, in which both of GST and SM/RT classes have the preemptive priority over SM/BE. Meanwhile, the preemptive scheduling is generally used as contention resolution in pure OPS/OBS networks. Thus in this thesis we pay special attention to study the preemptive scheduling. Its performance and operations are evaluated in both optical networks and the general multi-service systems. Three included papers (i. e. P 6, P 7 and P 8) contribute to this topic. For performance modeling, a novel approximation model-hierarchical Markov model is proposed. According to the priority of each class, the model is built as multiple levels. Each level presents all the transmission states of the respective service class. When calculating the blocking probabilities, conditional probability principles are used to weigh and sum contributions from each one-dimensional Markov chain in each level. This model only needs {{to increase the number of}} levels when modeling the larger system with more classes, thus it shows excellent extensibility. Compared with the general analytical modeling, which use the multi-dimensional Markov model to analyze the small system with less classes and resources, the proposed model has several major advantages: applicability of analyzing the general multi-service systems, closed-form expressions of the blocking probabilities and the significantly decreased computational complexity. Furthermore, this thesis validates the accuracy of the proposed hierarchical model. For the service class with highest priority, this model always provides the accurate packet loss. However for other services, this model provides the satisfactory approximate results. The respective discrepancy decreases as the relative load allocation of all higher service classes (compared with the studied service class) decreases. In addition, it is noticeable that, all results obtained from the proposed hierarchical Markov model are applicable for the general multi-service systems with preemptive schedulin...|$|R
