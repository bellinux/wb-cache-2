500|$|Como {{competed with}} Jackie Gleason {{in what was}} billed as the [...] "Battle of the Giants" [...] and won. This is now rarely mentioned, in part because Como {{commonly}} downplayed his own achievements, and also because {{the two men were}} friends. The weekly ratings winner would phone the loser for some mock gloating. At the height of this television competition, Como asked Gleason a favor: to visit his home when his mother-in-law, a big Gleason fan, was there. Though Mrs. Belline spoke no English and Gleason no Italian, Roselle's mother was thrilled. Como's words to Gleason after the visit, [...] "Anything you want, you <b>got</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> fact, I'll even do one of your shows so the ratings will be better." [...] Como was among those who filled in for Gleason on The Jackie Gleason Show in 1954 when the entertainer suffered a broken ankle and leg in an on-air fall.|$|E

A writer for MTV News found the video to be [...] "dark and cinematic, it's {{almost as if}} you swallowed an entire feature length film in 3 minutes."

500|$|Chandler and Phoebe had {{originally}} been written as more secondary characters who were just there to provide humor around the other four; Matthew Perry described Chandler in the pilot script as [...] "an observer of other people's lives". They had {{become part of the}} core group by the time casting concluded. Crane believed that the part of Chandler, described in the character breakdown as [...] "a droll, dry guy", would be the easiest to cast, though it proved more difficult than he initially hoped. Perry had previously worked with Kauffman and Crane on an episode of Dream On, and requested an audition when he identified with the character. He was turned down due to his involvement as a cast member in LAX 2194, a television pilot about airport baggage handlers in the future. After the producers of Friends saw LAX 2194, it became clear to them {{that it would not be}} picked up for a series, and Perry was granted an audition. He read for the role near the end of the casting period and <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> under a week. Before Perry was cast, Craig Bierko was first choice for the role. Bierko was a friend of Perry's, and Perry coached him for his audition to help him get to know what the Chandler character was like. Jon Cryer had also auditioned for the part. He was doing a play in London and read for a British casting director, though his audition tape did not arrive at Warner Bros. in time for him to be considered.|$|E
