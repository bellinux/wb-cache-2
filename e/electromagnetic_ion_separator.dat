30|$|The {{possible}} {{cause of the}} precipitation of energetic electrons is discussed as follows. The possible pitch angle scattering of energetic electrons >[*] 100  keV from the inner magnetosphere is generally attributed to either <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron waves or chorus waves (e.g., Miyoshi et al. 2008, 2015). However, the Arase satellite did not observe <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron waves or chorus waves. In general, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron waves should {{be found in the}} equatorial region. By contrast, the resonance energy of chorus waves depends on the off-equatorial magnetic latitude in the magnetosphere, and even MeV electrons can precipitate into the atmosphere when the chorus waves propagate at higher latitudes (Horne and Thorne 2003; Miyoshi et al. 2015). It is also possible that during this particular event the Arase satellite was not in the correct position to observe the chorus wave activity. Meredith et al. (2012) conducted a statistical survey of chorus waves using multiple satellites and found that between magnetic latitudes of 15 °– 30 ° on the nightside, chorus intensities drop off significantly compared to those in the equatorial region. Chorus waves that reach higher latitudes were found to be restricted to dayside. Thus, {{it is possible that the}} Arase satellite was outside of the region where one would expect to see the chorus waves or <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron waves.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have suggested}} that flickering aurora is produced by a modulation of the field-aligned component of the electron flux within an auroral arc. It is proposed that {{a portion of the}} field-aligned electrons are of ionospheric origin and that these electrons are accelerated and their flux modulated by <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron waves that occur below the main acceleration region on auroral arc field lines. A model of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron wave shows that the parallel phase velocity of the wave increase as the wave propagates toward the ionosphere. A test particle calculation shows that ionospheric electrons trapped or reflected by the wave are accelerated to energies of several keV and that their flux is modulated at the wave frequency. The relative amplitudes of the model wave electric fields are consistent with the observations of small-scale low-frequency ionospheric and magnetospheric electric fields near auroral arcs of approximately 10 mV/m and 100 mV/m, respectively. The large-amplitude ion cyclotron waves also produce a ponderomotive force and a self-consistent ambipolar electric field. Energy considerations show that the downward energy flux in the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron wave can be several percent of the total downward auroral electron energy flux...|$|R
40|$|Complete {{description}} of a self-consistent model for magnetospheric ring current interacting with <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron waves is presented. The model {{is based on the}} system of two kinetic equations; one equation describes the ring current ion dynamics, and another equation describes the wave evolution. The effects on ring current <b>ions</b> interacting with <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron waves, and back on waves, are considered self-consistently by solving both equations on a global magnetospheric scale under non steady-state conditions. In the paper by Khazanov et al. [2002] this self-consistent model has only been shortly outlined, and discussions of many the model related details have been omitted. For example, in present study {{for the first time a}} new algorithm for numerical finding of the resonant numbers for quasilinear wave-particle interaction is described, or it is demonstrated that in order to describe quasilinear interaction in a multi-ion thermal plasma correctly, both e and He(+) modes of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron waves should be employed. The developed model is used to simulate the entire May 2 - 7, 1998 storm period. Trapped number fluxes of the ring current protons are calculated and presented along with their comparison with the data measured by the 3 D hot plasma instrument Polar/HYDRA. Examining of the wave (MLT, L shell) distributions produced during the storm progress reveals an essential intensification of the wave emissions in about two days after main phase of storm. This result is well consistent with the earlier ground-based observations. Also the theoretical shapes and the occurrence rates for power spectral densities of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron waves are studied. It is found that in about 2 days after the storm main phase on May 4, mainly non Gaussian shapes of power spectral densities are produced...|$|R

In this model, separate heating and acceleration mechanisms for either He- 3 or Fe are not required, and Fe acceleration is quite efficient since it {{does not need to}} occur by second harmonic gyroresonance.

Thisdestruction results in a diffusive escape of electrons from the trapped regime of motion and thuscan lead to a significant reduction of the efficiency of electron acceleration. We demonstrate thatwhen energetic electrons are trapped by intense parallel or very oblique whistler-mode waves,non-resonant magnetic field fluctuations in the whistler-mode frequency range with moderateamplitudes around 3 15 pT (much less intense than the primary waves) can totally disrupt thetrapped motion.

The source velocities match calculated propagation of shear Alfvén waves within the auroral cavity.

40|$|Effect of {{the ring}} current ions in the real part of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> Cyclotron wave {{dispersion}} relation is studied on global scale. Recent Cluster observations by Engebretson et al. showed that although the temperature anisotropy of is energetic (> 10 keV) ring current protons was high during the entire 22 November 2003 perigee pass, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron waves were observed only in conjunction with intensification of the ion fluxes below 1 keV by over an order of magnitude. To study the effect {{of the ring}} current ions on the wave dispersive properties and the corresponding global wave redistribution, we use a self-consistent model of interacting ring current and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>ion</b> cyclotron waves, and simulate the May 1998 storm. The main findings of our simulation can be summarized as follows: First, the plasma density enhancement in the night MLT sector during the main and recovery storm phases is mostly caused by injection of suprathermal plasma sheet H + (approximately 4. 75. This "new" wave activity is well organized by outward edges of dense suprathermal ring current spots, and the waves are not observed if the ring current ions are not included in the real part of dispersion relation. Third, the most intense wave-induced ring current precipitation is located in the night MLT sector and caused by modification of the wave dispersion relation. The strongest precipitating fluxes of about 8 X 10 (exp 6) / (cm(exp 2) - s X st) are found near L= 5. 75, MLT= 2 during the early recovery phase on 4 May. Finally, the nightside precipitation is more intense than the dayside fluxes, even if there are less intense waves, because the convection field moves ring current ions into the loss cone on the nightside, but drives them out of the loss cone on the dayside. So convection and wave scattering reinforce each other in the nightside, but interfere in the dayside sector...|$|R
