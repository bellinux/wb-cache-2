5000|$|The Griffith Institute is an {{institution}} {{based in the}} <b>Griffith</b> <b>Wing</b> of the Sackler Library and {{is part of the}} Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford, England. It was founded for the advancement of Egyptology and Ancient Near Eastern Studies by the first Professor of Egyptology at the University of Oxford, Francis Llewellyn Griffith. Griffith bequeathed funds in his will for the foundation of the Institute and it opened on 21 January 1939, with its own independent committee of management. Rosalind Moss operated the Griffith Institute from its opening until the mid 1960s.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} phase diagram of {{electronic}} nematic {{instability in the}} presence of xy anisotropy. While a second order transition cannot occur in this case, mean-field theory predicts that a first order transition occurs near van Hove filling and its phase boundary forms a wing structure, which we term a <b>Griffiths</b> <b>wing,</b> referring to his original work of He 3 -He 4 mixtures. When crossing the wing, the anisotropy of the electronic system exhibits a discontinuous change, leading to a meta-nematic transition, i. e., the analog to a meta-magnetic transition in a magnetic system. The upper edge of the wing corresponds to a critical end line, which shows a non-monotonic temperature dependence {{as a function of the}} external anisotropy and vanishes at a quantum critical end point for a strong anisotropy. The mean-field phase diagram is, however, very sensitive to fluctuations of the nematic order parameter, yielding a topologically different phase diagram. The <b>Griffiths</b> <b>wing</b> is broken into two pieces. A tiny wing appears close to zero anisotropy and the other is realized for a strong anisotropy. Consequently three quantum critical end points are realized. We discuss that these results can be related to various materials including a cold atom system. Comment: 19 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
5000|$|Jack Lester Griffiths [...] (8 April 1912 - 13 November 2001) was a New Zealand rugby union player. A utility back {{who played}} in every backline {{position}} except on the <b>wing,</b> <b>Griffiths</b> represented [...] at a provincial level, {{and was a member}} of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, from 1934 to 1938. He played 30 matches for the All Blacks—three of which were as captain—including seven internationals. In all he scored 50 points for the All Blacks, but none in Test matches.|$|R
5000|$|Cardiff {{repeated}} their unofficial championship victory {{two years}} later in 1955, and had three Lions in the 1955 touring side, notable for not including any of the five that toured in 1950. The three this time were fly-half Morgan, centre Gareth <b>Griffiths</b> and <b>wing</b> Haydn Morris. Morgan, {{in front of a}} then-world record crowd of 100,000, helped defeat the South Africans 23-22 with a brilliant try despite an injury to Reg Higgins reducing the Lions to 14 men (no replacements were allowed at this time). After the South Africans squared the series in the second Test, Morgan was made captain for the third Test and inspired the team with a combination a stirring team talk and a great kicking game to a 9-6 victory, ensuring the series could not be lost, after which he was dubbed [...] "Morgan the Magnificent" [...] by the South African press. After his Lions heroics Morgan was made captain of Wales, and helped them win the title (although not the Grand Slam) in 1956.|$|R
