MYOACTIN C is composed of ATP, L-cystine and L-tyrosine, as <b>fix</b> <b>combination</b> <b>drugs.</b> Results of experiments. The author observed that ATP increased {{the tone of the}} smooth muscle at a low concentration and decreased it at a high concentration. The effect by L-tyrcsine or L-cystine was faint on the smooth muscle, but L-tyrosine+L-cystine made to fall the tone.

40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} different {{tactics of}} initial antihypertensive therapy. Material and Methods. 120 patients with mild-to-moderate arterial hypertension were included and randomized into three groups: “A”, “B”, and “C”. 5 drugs {{from the main}} antihypertensive classes were used: indapamide, bisoprolol, amlodipine, fosinopril, and rilmenidine as well as <b>fixed</b> <b>drug</b> <b>combination</b> of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Patients included in group “A” received initial therapy according to individual leading pathogenic variant of hypertension. Patients from group “B” received standard stepped antihypertensive therapy with gradual dose increase and further addition of second (third) drug. Patients in group “C” were immediately administrated <b>fixed</b> <b>drug</b> <b>combination</b> and later added other drugs.

DesignMulticenter, randomized, evaluator-masked (Study 1) /double-masked (Study 2), parallel-group studies. MethodsSetting: Twenty-eight clinical sites (Study 1) and 19 clinical sites (Study 2) in Japan. Study Population: Outpatients with bilateral POAG or OH whose predose IOP was 18 to < 35  mm Hg in the study eye after 4  weeks' treatment with latanoprost (Study 1) or carteolol (Study 2) (defined as baseline). Intervention: In Study 1, 237 patients applied OPC- 1085 EL (n = 118) or latanoprost (n = 119) for 8 weeks. In Study 2, 193 patients applied OPC- 1085 EL (n = 78), carteolol (n = 78), or carteolol/latanoprost concomitant therapy (n = 37) for 8  weeks. Main Outcome Measure: Adjusted mean IOP reduction at predose from baseline to week 8. ResultsIn Study 1, the adjusted mean IOP reductions (95 % confidence interval [CI]) were 2. 9 (2. 5 - 3. 3) mm Hg and 1. 6 (1. 2 - 2. 0) mm Hg in the OPC- 1085 EL and latanoprost groups, respectively (P <. 0001).

After a 4 -week run-in period off treatment, 180 patients will be randomized to once daily bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide 5 / 6. 25 mg or amlodipine/valsartan 5 / 160 mg. To attain and maintain blood pressure below 140 / 90 mmHg during 6 months of follow-up, the doses of bisoprolol and amlodipine in the combination tablets will be increased to 10 mg/day with the possible addition of α-methyldopa or hydralazine. NOAAH is powered to demonstrate a 5 -mmHg between-group difference in sitting systolic pressure with a two-sided p-value of 0. 01 and 90 % power. NOAAH is investigator-led and complies with the Helsinki declaration. Results. Six centers in four sub-Saharan countries started patient recruitment on September 1, 2010. On December 1, 195 patients were screened, 171 were enrolled, and 51 were randomized and followed up. The trial will be completed {{in the third quarter}} of 2011. Conclusions. NOAAH (NCT 01030458) is the first randomized multicenter trial of antihypertensive medications in hypertensive patients born and living in sub-Saharan Africa. status: publishe...|$|R

The morbidity, mortality and reduced productivity associated with obesity and its complications result in a major burden to health care costs. Obesity is a complex chronic medical syndrome often with multiple different etiologic factors in individual patients. The long term successful management of obesity remains particularly challenging and invariably requires a multifaceted approach including lifestyle and behavioral modification, increased physical activity, and adjunctive pharmacotherapy. Bariatric surgery remains a last resort though at present it has the best results for achieving sustained robust weight loss. Obesity pharmacotherapy has been very limited in its role for long term obesity management because of the past history of several failed agents as well as the fact that presently available agents are few, and generally utilized as monotherapy. The recent FDA approval of the <b>fixed</b> <b>drug</b> <b>combination</b> of phentermine and extended release topiramate (topiramate-ER) (trade name Qsymia™) marks the first FDA approved combination pharmacotherapeutic agent for obesity since the Phen-Fen combination of the 1990 s. This review details the history and clinical trial basis for the use of both phentermine and topiramate in obesity therapeutics as well as the results of clinical trials of their combination for obesity treatment in humans. The initial clinical approval trials offer evidence that this <b>fixed</b> <b>drug</b> <b>combination</b> offers synergistic potential for effective, robust and sustained weight loss with mean weight loss of at least 10 % of baseline achieved and sustained for up to 2 years in over 50 % of subjects treated. It is anticipated that this agent will be the first in a new trend of multi-agent combination therapy for the chronic adjunctive management of obesity.
