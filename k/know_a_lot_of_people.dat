500|$|Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said he {{believed}} although the show initially needed improvement, that it had arrived at a [...] "settled and focused" [...] series with [...] "The Banquet". He praised the episode as a whole, {{as well as individual}} small moments, like Leslie's haircut, April calling her [...] "sir", Ron's affinity for bacon-wrapped shrimp, Tom's coining of the phrase [...] "peacockin" [...] to mean standing out in bars. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "The Banquet" [...] was funnier than other recent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the Leslie character continues to too closely resemble a female Michael Scott, the protagonist of The Office. Sepinwall said of the show, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> have already given up, but I really feel like the show is a summer's worth of tweaking away from being good. It's not there yet, but I see glimmers." ...|$|E

I don't like being called 'bonkers' and I think to some extent it demeans people who use phrases like that.

[...] Mr Rennie added: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> are {{concerned}} by their visit, but I am quite relaxed about it. [...] "At the very least, it is a good reminder to us all of the dangers of fundamentalism, and the absurdity of where it can lead you. They happen to shout a lot, whereas others hold their hateful views more secretly." [...] He continued: [...] "Most Christians are neither homophobic nor extremist, but are moderate people who seek to share the love of God in the community in which they live." ...|$|E
2500|$|U.S. sources told The Washington Post in 1985 {{that the}} LaRouche {{organization}} had assembled a worldwide network {{of government and}} military contacts, and that his researchers sometimes supplied information to government officials. Bobby Ray Inman, the CIA's deputy director in 1981 and 1982, said LaRouche {{and his wife had}} visited him offering information about the West German Green Party, and a CIA spokesman said LaRouche met Deputy Director John McMahon in 1983 to discuss one of LaRouche's trips overseas. An aide to William Clark said when LaRouche's associates discussed technology or economics, they made good sense and seemed to be qualified. Norman Bailey, formerly with the National Security Council, said in 1984 that LaRouche's staff comprised [...] "one of the best private intelligence services in the world[...] [...] [...] They do <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> around the world.

The young man's {{treatment}} of the question was humorous, and it was with Delia that the discussion mainly went forward. When he maintained that the Dossons had shamelessly [...] "shed" [...] him Mr. Dosson returned [...] "Well, I guess you'll grow again!" [...] And Francie made the point that it was no use for him to pose as a martyr, since he knew perfectly well that with all the celebrated people he saw and the way he flew round he had the most enchanting time. She was aware of being a good deal less accessible than the previous spring, for Mesdames de Brecourt and de Cliche--the former indeed more than the latter--occupied many of her hours. In spite of her having held off, to Gaston, from a premature intimacy with his sisters, she spent whole days in their company--they had so much to tell her of how her new life would shape, and it seemed mostly very pleasant--and she thought nothing could be nicer than that in these intervals he should give himself to her father, and even to Delia, as had been his wont.|$|E
