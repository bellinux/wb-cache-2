50|$|Alignment is {{performed}} by small movements to the prisms, by adjusting an internal support cell or by turning external set screws, or {{by adjusting the}} position of the objective via eccentric rings built into the objective cell. Alignment is usually done by a professional, although the <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> adjustment <b>features</b> can be accessed by the end user.|$|R

50|$|The 582 {{features}} liquid-cooled {{cylinder heads}} and cylinders with a Rotary Intake Valve. Cooling is via an <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> radiator. Lubrication is either {{by use of}} pre-mixed fuel and oil or oil injection from an <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> oil tank. The 582 has dual independent breakerless, magneto capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) systems and is equipped with two piston-type carburetors. It uses a manifold-driven pneumatic fuel pump to provide fuel pressure. An optional High Altitude Compensation kit is available.|$|R

50|$|Instead of {{a tunnel}} thruster, boats from 30 to 80 ft in length {{may have an}} <b>{{external}}ly</b> <b>mounted</b> bow thruster. As its name suggests, an external bow thruster {{is attached to the}} bow, making it suitable for boats where it is impossible or undesirable to install a tunnel thruster, due to hull shape or outfitting. <b>Externally</b> <b>mounted</b> bow thrusters have one or more propellers driven by a small reversible electric motor which provides thrust in either direction. The added control provided by a bow thruster helps the captain to avoid accidents while docking.|$|R
50|$|The tank is also {{equipped}} with a 7.62 mm-coaxial machine gun, a 12.7 mm <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> air-defence machine gun that can be aimed and fired from within the tank, and smoke grenade launchers.|$|R
50|$|Various {{bottom bracket}} {{wrenches}} for newer bottom bracket styles such as internally splined by ISIS, Shimano, FSA, and RaceFace; externally notched by Campagnolo Veloce, Xenon, Mirage, Daytona and Avanti; and <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> by Shimano.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to its 'over-square' cylinder dimensions, a further unusual feature of the Kent engine at its introduction was an <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> combined oil filter/pump unit designed to facilitate efficient low-cost production and easy maintenance.|$|R
50|$|The 167.6 m High Roller, world's tallest since March 2014, has <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> {{motorised}} capsules of {{a transparent}} spherical design, and {{is described as}} both a Ferris wheel and an observation wheel by the media.|$|R
50|$|The self-launching {{version is}} powered by a 30 kW (40 hp) Rotax 447 engine <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> on a {{retractable}} mast which drives a two-bladed wooden propeller. Engine extension and retraction is performed by an electric motor.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, for {{a single}} year, the radio antenna became <b>externally</b> <b>mounted,</b> to the rear fender. After years of declining popularity, chrome wire wheel covers are {{available}} as an option from the factory for the last time.|$|R
2500|$|The Biber (German for [...] "beaver") was a German midget {{submarine}} of the Second World War. Armed with two <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> 21-inch (53cm) torpedoes or mines, {{they were intended}} to attack coastal shipping. They were the smallest submarines in the Kriegsmarine.|$|R
5000|$|The 165 m Singapore Flyer has {{cylindrical}} <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> motorised capsules and {{is described}} as an observation wheel by its operators, but was also credited as [...] "world's largest Ferris wheel" [...] by the media {{when it opened in}} 2008.|$|R
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} use proprietary spread-spectrum techniques, enabling typical operational {{ranges of}} up to 80 metres in-building. By also employing <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> antennas, operational ranges in excess 2000 metres (clear line-of-sight) have been achieved and several such models are sold under the Digi-Sender brand.|$|R
5000|$|The 120 m Melbourne Star (previously the Southern Star) in Australia has ovoidal <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> {{motorised}} capsules and {{is described}} by its operators as [...] "the only observation wheel in the southern hemisphere", {{but also as a}} Ferris wheel by the media.|$|R
50|$|One {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of}} the Tiger Moth design is its differential aileron control setup. The ailerons (on the lower wing only) on a Tiger Moth are operated by an <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> circular bellcrank, which lies flush with the lower wing's fabric undersurface covering. This circular bellcrank is rotated by metal cables and chains from the cockpit's control columns, and has the <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> aileron pushrod attached at a point 45° outboard and forward of the bellcrank's centre, when the ailerons are both at their neutral position. This results in an aileron control system operating, with barely any travel down {{at all on the}} wing {{on the outside of the}} turn, while the aileron on the inside travels a large amount upwards to counteract adverse yaw.|$|R
5000|$|The FGB {{provides}} [...] "functional" [...] {{support in}} the form of electrical power, propulsion, guidance and docking; The support for [...] "cargo" [...] operations is supplied {{in the form of}} a pressurized habitable cargo storage section (accessible by the crew) and the <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> fuel tanks.|$|R
5|$|He 111 P-4: Fitted {{with extra}} armour, three extra MG 15s, and {{provisions}} for two <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> bomber racks. Powerplants consisted of DB601A-1s. The internal bomb bay {{was replaced with}} an 835 L fuel tank and a 120 L oil tank. Some H-4s were also fitted with Jumo 211H-1s.|$|R
50|$|Original {{propulsion}} {{was stated}} in the patent to be four <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> propellers {{on the top of}} the body, with engine nacelles. In the 1991 patent, a glass cockpit can be seen at the front. However, the Aereon corporation state that the design can be either manned or un-manned.|$|R

50|$|Another {{application}} was the Gießkanne (Watering can), an <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> pod with three gun pairs, making {{a total of}} six guns and their ammunition. Able to fire 9000 rounds per minute, this was attached to Junkers Ju 87 or Ju 88 in an underwing mount and used to strafe ground targets.|$|R
50|$|W.G. Bagnall {{claimed that}} Bagnall-Price valve gear {{eliminated}} {{some of the}} complexity of Walschaerts gear, specifically the combination lever and return gear; this in turn meant the <b>externally</b> <b>mounted</b> gear had greater ground clearance which was an advantage in industrial locations where lineside obstructions could damage the gear of passing locomotives.|$|R
