50|$|With {{implicit}} certificates {{there is}} no explicit validation of the certificate authority's (CA’s) signature on a certificate. Instead, a user computes a public key from the implicit certificate and simply uses it in the intended ECC operation, e.g. key agreement protocols such as ECDH and ECMQV, or signing such as ECDSA. The operation will fail if the certificate is invalid. Thus ECQV is regarded as an implicit validation scheme.

50|$|The Germans {{responded to}} the pleas for {{reinforcements}} by dispatching several units towards the area. One armored unit, the second company of Panzer Abteilung 211, was sent from Rovaniemi towards Kemi over railroad with unit arriving already on morning of 2 October.

Meanwhile, the Finns chose to further reinforce the landing instead of pushing hard from the south towards Kemi and started to ship more troops and equipment from Oulu to Tornio, the first of these to arrive was the 53rd Infantry Regiment (JR 53).

5000|$|Established in 1991, Georgia SoftWorks [...] {{started as}} a custom {{software}} development company specializing in data communications and telecommunications applications. The company needed reliable Telnet connectivity on Windows NT with features such as: correctly displayed characters, proper function <b>key</b> <b>operation</b> and alt-key operation. At the time, Telnet was widely available on Unix but not frequently utilized on Windows in commercial environments. Georgia SoftWorks developed the GSW Telnet Server for Windows, and it named its foundation product the [...] "Universal Terminal Server". It was designed so that different protocols could be installed as requirements determined. GSW added features to its telnet server such as mouse operation and file transfer over a telnet connection. After successful in-house use, the UTS was commercialized. Georgia SoftWorks developed major features for its UTS such as Logon Scripts; this feature eventually evolved into global, per user, per IP Address and Certificate Based Logon Scripts. Other features included client device failure detection, Graceful Termination, Session Saver, Automatic Logon, Session Monitoring, Shadowing and Team Services technology.|$|E

The investigation broke an international alien smuggling and money-laundering ring that brought in an estimated 10,000 illegal aliens to the United States at a cost of $20,000 per alien, generating more than $200 million in proceeds over a 3-year period. [...] The organization smuggled aliens who were nationals of India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria. The operation most often started in India and went to Moscow, where connecting flights allowed aliens to travel to Latin American or the Caribbean. Aliens would then either fly or take a boat ride into the Miami, area or walk across the Mexican border.

40|$|Adaptive {{security}} is a strong security notion that captures additional security threats that are not addressed by static corruptions. For instance, it captures real-world scenarios where ``hackers'' actively break into computers, possibly while they are executing secure protocols. Studying this setting is interesting from both theoretical and practical points of view. A primary building block in designing adaptively secure protocols is a non-committing encryption (NCE) that implements secure communication channels {{in the presence of}} adaptive corruptions. Current constructions require a number of public <b>key</b> <b>operations</b> that grow linearly with the length of the message. Furthermore, general two-party protocols require a number of NCE calls that dependent both on the circuit size and on the security parameter. In this paper, we study the two-party setting in which at most one of the parties is adaptively corrupted, and demonstrate the feasibility of (1) NCE with constant number of public <b>key</b> <b>operations</b> for large message spaces, (2) oblivious transfer with constant number of public <b>key</b> <b>operations</b> for large sender's input spaces, and (3) constant round secure computation protocols with an overall number of public <b>key</b> <b>operations</b> that is linear in the circuit size. Our study demonstrates that such primitives indeed exist in the presence of single corruptions without erasures, while this is not known for fully adaptive security under standard assumptions (where both parties may get corrupted). Our results are shown in the UC setting with a CRS setup...|$|R
