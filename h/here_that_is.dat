500|$|The {{position}} of the South African government towards mixed-race teams was well established by 1967. It was stated explicitly after the visit of Griffith when, in February 1967, the Interior Minister P.K. Le Roux said in a speech: [...] "We will not allow mixed teams to play against our white teams <b>here.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> our policy. It is well known here and overseas." [...] These comments caused a public row in Britain, and some commentators wanted the tour to be called off; the MCC informed the British government that players would be selected on ability alone and that any attempts from within South Africa to interfere would cause the tour to be cancelled. Denis Howell, the Minister for Sport, informed the House of Commons of the MCC position and stated that the government expected that the MCC would cancel the tour if any player were to be rejected. Privately, the MCC committee were unhappy to have been forced into so unequivocal a position.|$|E

Rivas found the lyrics to convey a [...] "nice" [...] and [...] "positive" [...] message, adding that the single [...] "shows some similarities with his other singles but not to much detriment". The Boston Globe critic Ken Capobianco exalted Mars's vocals on the recording as [...] "one of his best" [...] on the album. MTV UK Joanne Dorken and Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine said that the recording's sound was [...] "reminiscent" [...] of [...] "Over The Rainbow" [...] by Israel Kamakawiwoʻole. While reviewing Mars' debut EP, It's Better If You Don't Understand, Bill Lamb of About.com stated that [...] "there is a dreamy wistfulness <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> irresistible, regarding [...] "Count On Me". He added, that the song is [...] "perfect for summer days". However, while reviewing the parent album, Tim Sendra from AllMusic found that the song lack deepness and [...] "it’s not poetry".

In fact the first [...] equations derived {{can be interpreted as}} determining the quotient [...] of the Euclidean division of the polynomial [...] on the left by the monic polynomial , while the final equation expresses the fact that the remainder is zero. This division is performed in the ring of polynomials with matrix coefficients. Indeed, even over a non-commutative ring, Euclidean division by a monic polynomial [...] is defined, and always produces a unique quotient and remainder with the same degree condition as in the commutative case, provided it is specified at which side one wishes [...] to be a factor (<b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to the left).|$|E
2500|$|On {{pulling the}} trigger of a wheellock firearm, the sear effects a slight {{rotation}} as described above. The end of the sear arm (that has hitherto locked the wheel and prevented it from turning) is disengaged, leaving the wheel free to turn under the tension of the mainspring. There is a subtlety <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> of vital importance: the [...] "hole" [...] {{in the side of}} the wheel into which the sear engages, is not a parallel-sided shaft. If it were, then under the tremendous tension of the mainspring, it would require a huge force on the trigger to disengage the sear. Nor is the tip of the sear arm cylindrical, which would have a similar effect. Rather, the [...] "hole" [...] is a depression in the wheel (like a small crater), and the sear has a rounded end: the wheel is locked by reason of lateral force on the shaft of the wheel rather than vertical force on the sear.|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza's {{break with}} the {{prevailing}} dogmas of Judaism, and particularly the insistence on non-Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, was not sudden; rather, {{it appears to have}} been the result of a lengthy internal struggle: [...] "If anyone thinks my criticism [...] is of too sweeping a nature and lacking sufficient foundation, I would ask him to undertake to show us in these narratives a definite plan such as might legitimately be imitated by historians in their chronicles... If he succeeds, I shall at once admit defeat, and he will be my mighty Apollo. For I confess that all my efforts over a long period have resulted in no such discovery. Indeed, I may add that I write nothing <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not the fruit of lengthy reflection; and although I have been educated from boyhood in the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture, I have felt bound in the end to embrace the views I here express." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{is called}} the Arroyo Group because two streams {{surround}} it on three sides. [...] This area {{is one of the}} oldest sections of the city, and is more than [...] It is flanked by four high buildings, named Buildings 16, 18, 19 and 20, which were topped by temples. Stairways lead from the plaza floor to the temples above. [...] Unlike the rest of the city, these four buildings are uniform in height and nearly symmetrical. [...] The pyramids here are primitive in comparison to the rest of the site, with niches that are not as finely formed. The east and west pyramids of the arroyo group each held three temples at the top. Another unusual feature is that this plaza has no smaller structures such as buildings or altars to break up the space. It has been determined that this was the city marketplace because of the large plaza space for stalls and for a deity found <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> related to commerce. [...] The merchant deity found here has features more in common with this kind of deity in the central highlands of Mexico than of Tajín. The market that filled this plaza consisted of stalls made with sticks and cloth offering regional products such as vanilla as well as products from other parts of Mesoamerica such as jaguar skins, exotic birds such as the parrot [...] and the macaw and quetzal feathers. Slaves for service and sacrifice were also sold here. [...] West of the building on the south side is a large ball court with sloped sides and sculpted friezes depicting the god Quetzalcoatl. [...] When the city fell, most of the sculptures in this area were smashed or defaced with some being reused as building stone.|$|E
