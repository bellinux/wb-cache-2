5|$|At room temperature, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bromide</b> is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} the hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bromide</b> at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bromide</b> is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E

40|$|The {{competitive}} adsorption of <b>hydrogen</b> and <b>bromide</b> on Pt(1 0 0) {{has been}} studied by modeling the experimental data {{by means of the}} mean-field approximation (Frumkin isotherm) and Monte Carlo simulations. This system is characterized by two kinds of species that adsorb at the same surface sites but whose saturation coverages are different (?H,max = 1, ?Br,max = 0. 5), as a result of different short range interactions. In a first step, hydrogen adsorption on Pt(1 0 0) has been modeled and it is found that the Frumkin isotherm and Monte Carlo simulations agree satisfactorily. The parameters obtained from fitting hydrogen adsorption on Pt(1 0 0) are then used to model the competitive adsorption of <b>hydrogen</b> and <b>bromide.</b> The competitive adsorption of H and Br causes a surface that is completely covered in the whole potential range. This leads to the existence of an extra degree of freedom in the fitting process that was checked by choosing two limiting values for the Br–Br interaction parameter.

Both the approximate mean-field approach and the exact Monte Carlo simulations are able to give good fits of the experimental curve. However, comparison of the results given by the Frumkin isotherm and the Monte Carlo simulations demonstrates that the former is not adequate to model this system.

It was explained as an increasing tendency to form non‐extractable complexes of multiple negative charges. Further experiments in 1992 confirmed the stability of the +5 state: Db(V) was shown to be extractable from cation‐exchange columns with α‐hydroxyisobutyrate, similarly to other group 5 elements and protactinium; Db(III) and Db(IV) were not.
