5|$|Like {{all other}} lemurs, Hadropithecus was endemic to Madagascar. Because it died out only {{recently}} {{and is only}} known from subfossil remains, it {{is considered to be}} a modern form of Malagasy lemur. It once ranged across the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions of Madagascar. Within its original range, there were few other lemurs to overlap <b>its</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>niche,</b> and it has been shown to be the only subfossil lemur to consume both C3 and C4 (or CAM) plants, an indication that it lived in more open habitats and had a varied diet. Its physiology and dentition suggest that it may have been much like the Gelada Baboon in locomotion and diet, acting as a manual grazer (picking grass with the hands) since its teeth were well-adapted for grinding either grass or seeds. Microwear patterns on its teeth, as well as its overly large molars, indicate it processed hard objects like nuts or seeds, making it a seed predator. More recent microwear analysis suggests differences between Gelada Baboons and Hadropithecus, indicating that this extinct lemur may not have been a grazer, but strictly a hard object processor.|$|E

25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis {{has been}} {{isolated}} {{around the world}} in low abundance from a variety of environmental sources, including soil, decaying timber, and wasp nests. The thermophilicity and acid tolerance of E. dermatitidis suggests passage through warm-blooded animals, and it is hypothesized that <b>its</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>niche</b> might be associated with tropical, frugivorous bird and bat species. An ability to utilize nutrients in diverse environments, to adhere to fruit surfaces, and progress through different morphological phases are considered to provide further evidence for this theory. Clinical isolates tend to harbor strains that are found only rarely in nature. It may be the case that traits linked to halotolerance have predisposed these strains towards infecting humans.|$|E

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the natural history}} of the colonization of our hospital's potable water by culturing water approximately biweekly from 20 sites throughout the hospital for 4 years. Overall, 545 (24. 7 %) of the 2200 samples grew Legionella pneumophila. During hyperchlorination, 11. 7 % of the samples were positive while 41. 6 % were positive in the absence of chlorination. There was no seasonal trend towards positivity, but there was marked inter-site variation in the semi-quantitative culture results. However, a single strain of legionella (as defined by plasmid profiling) tended to persist at a site. Such a site was a unique <b>ecological</b> <b>niche</b> in that different sites in the same wing were populated by distinct strains. The two wings of our hospital had a significantly different distribution of strains of legionella-plasmid profile type III predominated in the Victoria Wing while types II and VI predominated in Centennial Wing. Twenty-four of our 28 cases of nosocomial Legionnaires' disease occurred in the Centennial Wing. Three of the four cases in the Victoria Wing were caused by plasmid profile type III while 18 of the 24 isolates from patients who acquired their infection in the Centennial Wing were type II. We conclude that each water outlet serves as <b>its</b> own <b>ecological</b> <b>niche</b> of L. pneumophila...|$|R

50|$|Over{{population}} {{occurs when}} a species' population exceeds the carrying capacity of <b>its</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>niche.</b> It can result from an increase in births (fertility rate), {{a decline in the}} mortality rate, an increase in immigration, or an unsustainable biome and depletion of resources.

40|$|Here {{we report}} the genome {{sequence}} of Acinetobacter venetianus VE-C 3, a strain {{isolated from the}} Venice Lagoon and known {{to be able to}} degrade n-alkanes. Post sequencing analyses revealed that this strain is relatively distantly related to the other Acinetobacter strains completely sequenced so far as shown by phylogenetic analysis and pangenome analysis (1285 genes shared with all the other Acinetobacter genomes sequenced so far). A. venetianus VE-C 3 possesses a wide range of determinants whose molecular functions are probably related to the survival in a strongly impacted <b>ecological</b> <b>niche.</b> Among them, genes probably involved in the metabolism of long-chain n-alkanes and in the resistance to toxic metals (e. g. arsenic, cadmium, cobalt and zinc) were found. Genes belonging to these processes were found both on the chromosome and on plasmids. Also, our analysis documented one of the possible genetic bases underlying the strategy adopted by A. venetianus VE-C 3 for the adhesion to oil fuel droplets, which could account for the differences existing in this process with other A. venetianus strains. Finally, the presence of a number of DNA mobilization-related genes (i. e. transposases, integrases, resolvases) strongly suggests an important role played by horizontal gene transfer in shaping the genome of A. venetianus VE-C 3 and in its adaptation to <b>its</b> special <b>ecological</b> <b>niche...</b>|$|R
40|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{have the}} ability to produce outer membrane-derived vesicles (OMVs) that are released into the extracellular milieu. Even though this intriguing phenomenon is well-known since many years, various aspects of bacterial OMVs are not fully described and are {{still in the process of}} being characterized in detail. One major reason for this is that depending on the bacterial species and <b>its</b> respective <b>ecological</b> <b>niche,</b> OMVs exhibit an enormous functional diversity. Research of the past years has clearly shown that OMVs of many pathogenic bacteria contribute to the virulence potential by enriching virulence factors and delivering them over long distances, superseding direct bacterial contact with their host. The subsequent interaction of OMVs with the host can occur at different levels regarding the type of immune response or the target cell type and may lead to different outcomes ranging from non-immunogenic activation or a pro-inflammatory response to cytotoxicity. In contrast to being virulence factors, OMVs are used for vaccination purposes in the combat against bacterial pathogens, and recent research thus is focused on to indirectly aim these versatile bacterial weapons against themselves...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{concept of}} {{horizontal}} gene transfer (HGT) as a potent evolutionary force has prompted the re-evaluation of prokaryotic genome shaping and speciation. Horizontal gene transfer enables prokaryotes to rearrange their genomes dynamically, facilitating responses to changing environmental conditions and invasions of new ecological niches. Here {{we report that}} the genome of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa contains a genomic island encoding proteins with extensive amino-acid sequence identity to two components of the eukaryotic actin cytoskeleton: actin itself; and profilin, an actin binding protein hitherto only known in eukaryotes. Our data indicate that a rare eukaryote-to-prokaryote HGT has introduced both sequences into the Microcystis lineage. We found both genes to be actively expressed and propose a unique role in Microcystis cell stabilization for actin, differing substantially from what is observed for bacterial actin homologs. Because we detected both eukaryote-like genes only in one strain in culture and in recent samples collected from its original habitat we suggest that both proteins {{may contribute to the}} adaptation of this strain to <b>its</b> specific <b>ecological</b> <b>niche...</b>|$|R

50|$|The subfossil {{remains of}} the wren have only been found on New Zealand's South Island, {{and it seems to}} have formed a species pair with the closely related P. jagmi, which was only found on North Island.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is a {{bacterium}} that colonizes humans worldwide. The anterior nares are <b>its</b> main <b>ecological</b> <b>niche.</b> Carriers of S. aureus {{are at a}} higher risk of developing invasive infections. Few reports indicated a different clonal structure and profile of virulence factors in S. aureus isolates from Sub-Saharan Africa. As there are no data about isolates from remote indigenous African populations, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of S. aureus nasal carriage in Gabonese Babongo Pygmies. The isolates were characterized regarding their susceptibility to antibiotic agents, possession of virulence factors and clonal lineage. While similar carriage rates were found in populations of industrialized countries, isolates that encode the genes for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) were clearly more prevalent than in European countries. Of interest, many methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates from Babongo Pygmies showed the same genetic background as pandemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) clones. We advocate a surveillance of S. aureus in neglected African populations to control the development of resistance to antibiotic drugs with particular respect to MRSA and {{to assess the impact of}} the high prevalence of PVL-positive isolates...|$|R
40|$|Being {{faced with}} unknown environments is a {{concomitant}} challenge of species' range expansions. Strategies {{to cope with}} this challenge include the adaptation to local conditions and a flexibility in resource exploitation. The gulls of the Larus argentatus-fuscus-cachinnans group form a system in which ecological flexibility might have enabled them to expand their range considerably, and to colonize urban environments. However, on a population level both flexibility and local adaptation lead to signatures of differential habitat use in different environments, and these processes are not easily distinguished. Using the lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus) as a system, we put both flexibility and local adaptation to a test. We compare habitat use between two spatially separated populations, and use a translocation experiment during which individuals were released into novel environment. The experiment revealed that on a population-level flexibility best explains the differences in habitat use between the two populations. We think that our results suggest that the range expansion and huge success of this species complex could be a result of <b>its</b> broad <b>ecological</b> <b>niche</b> and flexibility in the exploitation of resources. However, this also advises caution when using species distribution models to extrapolate habitat use across space...|$|R
50|$|The {{black caiman}} {{is the largest}} {{predator}} in the Amazon ecosystem, preying {{on a variety of}} fish, reptiles, birds and mammals. They are generalists and apex predators, potentially capable of taking any animal within its range, including other predators. Few ecological studies have been carried out on the species but it can be noted that the black caiman has <b>its</b> own <b>ecological</b> <b>niche</b> that enables coexistence without too much competition. As the largest predator in the ecosystem, it may also be a keystone species, playing an important role of maintaining the structure of the ecosystem. Reproduction takes place in the dry season. Females build a nest mound with an egg chamber, protecting the eggs from predators. Hatchlings form groups called pods, guarded by the presence of the female. These pods may contain individuals from other nests. Once common, it was hunted to near extinction primarily for its commercially valuable hide. It is now making a comeback, listed as Conservation Dependent. Overall a little-known species, it was not researched in any detail until the 1980s, when the leather-trade had already taken its toll. It is a dangerous species to humans and attacks have occurred in the past.|$|R

The species seems to have suddenly died out when horns reached approximately the body length of the animal itself, possibly because it could no longer run or evade predators—thus ecological selection seems to have ultimately trumped sexual.|$|E

40|$|Indian {{society is}} an {{agglomeration}} {{of several thousand}} endogamous groups or castes each with a restricted geographical range and a hereditarily determine mode of subsistence. These reproductively isolated castes may be compared to biological species, and the society {{thought of as a}} biological community with each caste having <b>its</b> specific <b>ecological</b> <b>niche.</b> In this paper we examine the ecological-niche relationships of castes which are directly dependent on natural resources. Evidence is presented to show that castes living together in the same region had so organized their pattern of resource use as to avoid excessive intercaste competition for limiting resources. Furthermore, territorial division of the total range of the caste regulated intra-caste competition. Hence, a particular plant or animal resource in a given locality was used almost exclusively by a given lineage within a caste generation after generation. This favoured the cultural evolution of traditions ensuring sustainable use of natural resources. This must have contributed significantly to the stability of Indian caste society over several thousand years. The collapse of the base of natural resources and increasing monetarization of the economy has, however, destroyed the earlier complementarity between the different castes and led to increasing conflicts between them in recent years...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} species Staphylococcus aureus, {{including its}} methicillin-resistant variant (MRSA), finds <b>its</b> primary <b>ecological</b> <b>niche</b> {{in the human}} nose, but is also able to colonize the intestines and the perineal region. Intestinal carriage has not been widely investigated despite its potential clinical impact. This review summarizes literature on the topic and sketches {{the current state of}} affairs from a microbiological and infectious diseases' perspective. Major findings are that the average reported detection rate of intestinal carriage in healthy individuals and patients is 20 % for S. aureus and 9 % for MRSA, which is approximately half of that for nasal carriage. Nasal carriage seems to predispose to intestinal carriage, but sole intestinal carriage occurs relatively frequently and is observed in 1 out of 3 intestinal carriers, which provides a rationale to include intestinal screening for surveillance or in outbreak settings. Colonization of the intestinal tract with S. aureus at a young age occurs at a high frequency and may affect the host's immune system. The frequency of intestinal carriage is generally underestimated and may significantly contribute to bacterial dissemination and subsequent risk of infections. Whether intestinal rather than nasal S. aureus carriage is a primary predictor for infections is still ill-defined...|$|R
40|$|Stress is a {{powerful}} modulator of brain structure and function. While stress is beneficial for survival, inappropriate stress dramatically {{increases the risk of}} physical and mental health problems, particularly when experienced during early developmental periods. Here we focus on the neurobiology of the infant rat’s odor learning system that enables neonates to learn and approach the maternal odor and describe the unique role of the stress hormone corticosterone in modulating this odor approach learning across development. During the first nine postnatal days, this odor approach learning of infant rats is supported by a wide range of sensory stimuli and ensures attachment to the mother’s odor, even when interactions with her are occasionally associated with pain. With maturation and the emergence of a stress- or pain-induced corticosterone response, this odor approach learning terminates and a more adult-like amygdala-dependent fear/avoidance learning emerges. Strikingly, the odor approach and attenuated fear learning of older pups can be re-established by the presence of the mother, due to her ability to suppress her pups’ corticosterone release and amygdala activity. This suggests that developmental changes in stress responsiveness and the stimuli that produce a stress response might be critically involved in optimally adapting the pup’s attachment system to <b>its</b> respective <b>ecological</b> <b>niche...</b>|$|R
