5000|$|Under English law and Australian law, <b>equitable</b> <b>waste</b> is {{waste that}} a life tenant {{has a right}} to commit at common law but is {{restrained}} by a court of equity. This doctrine fits under the broader framework of equity, in which a legal right to do something is not so unrestrained {{that it is impossible to}} abuse that right. A life tenant who is granted an estate [...] "without impeachment of waste" [...] (may not be sued for waste) may not commit acts of flagrant destruction inconsistent with the fruitful use of the land. For example, a mansion may not be stripped of its glass, timber or pipes (Vane v Lord barnard), nor may trees of an ornamental value be cut down by the life tenant (Turner v Wright).! ...|$|E
40|$|This brief delineates {{two broad}} {{categories}} for bioenergy development — {{the exploitation of}} existing agricultural wastes {{and the establishment of}} energy plantations—and suggests high-priority steps for developing bioenergy in ways that benefit the poor [...] . Once developing countries have optimized the use of existing agricultural wastes for energy generation and put in place adequate revenue-sharing, regulatory, and policy frameworks, they can consider the option of dedicated energy plantations, while carefully balancing any associated trade-offs between food security and energy generation. Fortunately, the technical, regulatory, and policy expertise needed to promote an <b>equitable</b> agricultural <b>waste</b> energy industry also provides, in many cases, the skills needed to develop and nurture a sustainable dedicated energy plantation sector that does not adversely affect the poor or decrease food security.

Most city residents use wood-based charcoal derived from mostly informal supply chains, which are linked to unsustainable forest logging, low efficiency production methods and long transportation routes, all factors that contribute to environmental degradation. At the same time, the provision of adequate and <b>equitable</b> solid <b>waste</b> management (SWM) services remains a major urban challenge, with municipal solid waste mainly consisting of organics. Sales of briquettes made from carbonized biowaste can potentially foster waste collection and enhance cost-recovery of SWM systems, while contributing to a sustainable energy supply. This article provides essential information for understanding the potential for and limitations of char production from urban solid biowaste to tackle both SWM and cooking fuel challenges simultaneously. It reviews the current state of charcoal consumption, provides an overview of the SWM situation and explores the potential of converting biowaste streams into char in LAMICs. Existing carbonization technologies are presented and their advantages and disadvantages examined by means of a weighted assessment matrix (Pugh method) using technical, financial and environmental/health criteria. For financially viable carbonization the feedstock should be continuously available at no cost and have physical and chemical properties suitable for pyrolysis: dry, unmixed and homogeneous. Thus, separated waste obtained near the source of generation is important. The existing bulk of mixed, wet household and market wastes, however, require carbonization technologies that are associated with high capital investment. Overall, {{it has been shown that}} low-tech retorts have the highest suitability for biowaste carbonization in LAMICs. Further research is required to improve energy efficiency, reduce air pollution, guarantee safe operation and assess financial viability. Beyond the technical aspects, policy measures to support sustainable char production from biowaste are necessary to nurture government support...|$|R
