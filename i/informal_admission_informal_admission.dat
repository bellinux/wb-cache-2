50|$|Below are the {{requirements}} for the admissibility of <b>informal</b> <b>admissions.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Informal</b> <b>{{admission}}s</b> in South African law {{are part}} of the South African law of evidence. Briefly, an admission is a statement made by a party, in civil or criminal proceedings, which is adverse to that party’s case. <b>Informal</b> <b>admissions,</b> which are usually made out of court, must be distinguished from formal admissions, made in the pleadings or in court. Formal admissions are binding on the maker, and are generally made {{in order to reduce the}} number of issues before the court; an <b>informal</b> <b>admission</b> is merely an item of evidence that can be contradicted or explained away.|$|R
50|$|The {{weight to}} be accorded to an <b>informal</b> <b>admission</b> {{depends on the}} circumstances. Formal admissions cannot be {{withdrawn}} or contradicted without compliance with certain formalities.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Informal</b> <b>admissions</b> are extra-curial {{statements}} by a party {{which can be}} used against that party during legal proceedings. They do not constitute conclusive proof of the facts they cover, but they can constitute an item of proof. They are put in the scale and assessed {{at the end of the}} case. Sometimes <b>informal</b> <b>admissions</b> can be made in very formal circumstances, as when a suspect appears before a magistrate out of court in order to make a statement about his alleged involvement in an offence.|$|R
50|$|Even after withdrawal, {{a formal}} {{admission}} {{may still be}} taken into account as an item of evidence; it may still constitute an <b>informal</b> <b>admission,</b> in other words.|$|R
50|$|Even if {{the accused}} does not so agree, the admissions remain evidential material, and {{are similar to}} {{informal}} admissions; indeed, they {{have the effect of}} an <b>informal</b> <b>admission.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Informal</b> <b>admissions</b> {{constitute}} {{merely an}} item of evidence helping to prove the other party’s case, whereas a formal admission, once made, is conclusive proof of the fact admitted.|$|R
50|$|An <b>informal</b> <b>admission,</b> {{which is}} made extrajudicially, must also be {{distinguished}} from a statement made against a party’s interest {{during the course of}} a trial. The latter is treated as ordinary evidence.|$|R
50|$|A {{confession}} is {{a special}} type of <b>informal</b> <b>admission</b> in a criminal trial. It {{has been defined as}} an unequivocal admission of guilt, equivalent to plea of guilty in a court of law.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{understand}} how different admission statuses of varying degrees of restrictiveness (<b>informal,</b> voluntary, emergency <b>admission,</b> and involuntary admission on medical certification) are used in the psychiatric emergency room. The study included 656 consecutively admitted patients from a psychiatric emergency room over 28 months. Data were analyzed univariately and using two discriminant function models. Only six (0. 9 %) patients were <b>informal</b> <b>admissions.</b> Voluntary admissions (24. 9 %, n = 163) tended to be for patients with affective disorders, those who were self-referred, suicidal risks, those who had a marital or family problem, and those who were over age 60. Nonvoluntary admis-sions (74. 2 %) tended to be for patients with schizophreniform symptoms and those referred by police or court. Involuntary admission on medical certification (53. 2 %, n = 349) tended to be for patients who were family referred, younger than 20 years old, had social interpersonal nonfamily stressors, were suicidal risks, were or had been married, had organic psychotic disorder, history of violence, and manic episode or schizophrenia. Emergency admission patients (21 %, n = 138...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} HL v UK (45508/99) the European Court of Human Rights {{found that the}} <b>informal</b> <b>admission</b> to a {{psychiatric}} hospital of a compliant but incapacitated adult was in contravention of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court found that the distinction between actual and potential detention relied upon by the UK House of Lords in their ruling that HL had not been detained in R v Bournewood Community and Mental Health NHS Trust was not of central importance under Article 5. The European Court also held {{that the practice of}} <b>informal</b> <b>admission</b> of compliant but incapacitated adults who were de facto detained was not 'in accordance with a procedure described by law' and thus was not lawful under the Convention.|$|R
50|$|<b>Informal</b> <b>admissions,</b> {{on the one}} hand, {{are usually}} made out of court, {{although}} they {{can be made in}} formal settings (even to a magistrate, for example); that, however, does not make them formal. Formal admissions, on the other hand, are usually made as part of the pleadings, or in the court itself.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, <b>informal</b> <b>admissions</b> in many {{instances}} will be hearsay in nature. Section 3(4) of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act defines hearsay evidence as “evidence, whether oral or in writing, the probative value of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving such evidence.” When the probative value of an <b>informal</b> <b>admission</b> depends primarily on its maker (which will almost invariably be the case), {{it will be a}} hearsay statement. As, however, section 3 of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act is “subject to the provisions of any other law,” existing statutory provisions will remain the primary route to admission, and the common law will remain “any other factor” {{to be taken into account}} by the court in the exercise of its discretion to admit hearsay in the interests of justice.|$|R
40|$|Aims and method: To compare an {{existing}} crisis resolution service {{with a new}} crisis resolution team (CRT) in Wales. The impact of the new team was measured by changes in bed days and admissions. A random sample of patients from each service was assessed for service satisfaction, social functioning {{and quality of life}} after first presentation. Results: The total number of bed days was reduced following the introduction of the new CRT (27. 3 %). The frequency and duration of compulsory admissions increased by 31 % in the CRT {{between the first and second}} years and by 7 % in the control service, offset by a greater reduction in <b>informal</b> <b>admissions</b> in the CRT (23. 5 %) compared with the control group (13. 3 %); overall bed usage was unchanged. Service satisfaction, social functioning and quality of life showed no important differences between the services. Clinical implications: Crisis resolution teams may reduce <b>informal</b> <b>admissions</b> in the short term but at the cost of more compulsory admissions later...|$|R
40|$|Since the Cheshire West judgement, yearly {{applications}} for the Mental Health Act (MHA) and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) have increased, though many patients are still admitted informally. To ensure lawfulness, <b>informal</b> <b>admissions</b> must be capacitous, informed, and without coercion. If fully capacitous consent is not obtained, {{then there is a}} risk of “de facto” detention and deprivation of liberty. Deprivation of liberty is only lawful through appropriate legal frameworks (DoLS for incapacitous, non-objecting hospital inpatients, or MHA otherwise). Use of such legal frameworks might be hampered by the perceived stigma associated with them, though this may not be {{in the best interests of}} the patient. We aimed to examine the assessment of capacity and provision of adequate information required for an informed voluntary psychiatric admission, and any evidence of possible coercion into <b>informal</b> <b>admission.</b> We postulate variable use of legal frameworks designed to empower patients and prevent illegal deprivation of liberty...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Informal</b> <b>admissions</b> may be {{admitted}} to prove the truth of their contents. The rationale for admitting such evidence {{would appear to be}} that a person is unlikely to make an admission adverse to his interests if the contents of that admission are not true.

40|$|On 16 April 2014, the Supreme Court of Appeal {{handed down}} {{judgment}} {{in the matter}} of S v Litako 2014 2 SACR 431 (SCA) ("Litako"). The judgment reconsiders the landmark decision of the same court, S v Ndhlovu 2002 2 SACR 325 (SCA) ("Ndhlovu") in which the court held that an <b>informal</b> <b>admission</b> made by one accused could be admitted against a co-accused even if the accused in court denies making the statement and the statement itself is therefore considered to be hearsay. The court in Ndhlovu applied section 3 of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act 45 of 1988 and found that the hearsay extra curial admission could be admitted in the interests of justice. In Litako the court found that section 3 did not overrule an existing common law rule, which is that the extra curial statement of an accused (whether an <b>informal</b> <b>admission</b> or a confession) cannot be tendered against a co-accused. This is because section 3 does not expressly overrule this common law rule. Rather, the provision itself requests that its application be subject to the common law. The judgment is important for various reasons. Firstly, it is generally in keeping with the existing rule on the cautionary treatment of accomplice evidence. Secondly, the judgment highlights the current confusion in the relationship between statute and common law with regards to <b>informal</b> <b>admissions</b> and confessions. Thirdly, the court employs methods of statutory interpretation to re-examine the principle from Ndhlovu and finds that the court in that case did not apply its mind correctly in disregarding the common law rule. The court undertook a teleological approach to interpretation by infusing the meaning of the words with the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights and found that the statute had not overruled the common law rule...|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court of Appeal {{dealt with}} the {{withdrawal}} of an admission in civil proceedings in Saayman v Road Accident Fund 2011 (1) SA 106 (SCA). The court (para [12]) held that a concession made {{during the course of}} counsel’s address did not amount to a formal admission. Consequently, it was not necessary for an application for a formal withdrawal of the statement to be made. It was possible for the concession be withdrawn {{at any time during the}} trial in the absence of prejudice to the opposing party. Heher JA (Leach JA and Majiedt AJA concurring), agreeing with the majority judgment of Bosielo JA, gave a separate judgment providing additional grounds and it is in this judgment that the court expands on the characteristics of an admission. The first hurdle to overcome in following this aspect of the judgment is to determine whether the court views the arguments presented as pertaining to <b>informal</b> or formal <b>admissions.</b> The court explicitly characterizes the relevant statements as <b>informal</b> <b>admissions</b> as they were not recorded as admissions by the court. In doing so the judges refer to section 5 of the Civil Proceedings Evidence Act 25 of 1965, which is somewhat confusing, as section 5 has nothing to say on the matter. (This is perhaps due to the fact that DT Zeffertt, AP Paizes and A St Q Skeen (The South African Law of Evidence (2003) 784) mistakenly refer to section 5 when they actually mean section 15. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{small number}} of patient-level {{variables}} have replicated associations with the length of stay (LOS) of psychiatric inpatients. Although need for housing has often {{been identified as a}} cause of delayed discharge, there has been little research into the associations between LOS and homelessness and residential mobility (moving to a new home), or the magnitude of these associations compared to other exposures. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 4885 acute psychiatric admissions to a mental health NHS Trust serving four South London boroughs. Data were taken from a comprehensive repository of anonymised electronic patient records. Analysis was performed using log-linear regression. Results: Residential mobility was associated with a 99 % increase in LOS and homelessness with a 45 % increase. Schizophrenia, other psychosis, the longest recent admission, residential mobility, and some items on the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS), especially ADL impairment, were also associated with increased LOS. <b>Informal</b> <b>admission,</b> drug and alcohol or other non-psychotic diagnosis and a high HoNOS self-harm score reduced LOS. Including residential mobility in the regression model produced the same increase in the variance explained as including diagnosis; only legal status was a stronger predictor. Conclusions: Homelessness and, especially, residential mobility account for a significant part of variation in LOS despite affecting a minority of psychiatric inpatients; for these people, the effect on LOS is marked. Appropriate policy responses may include attempts to avert the loss of housing in association with admission, efforts to increase housing supply and the speed at which it is made available, and reforms of payment systems to encourage this...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to map the terrain {{concerning}} early admission to tertiary education for gifted learners in Australian universities. The statistics on Australian universities offering early admission options were collected. In general, 13 universities offer formal or <b>informal</b> early <b>admission</b> to gifted students, while 33 universities provide dual enrolment options. No minimum age requirements are in place for the majority of Australian universities. Nonetheless, enrolment of students, younger than 17 years, is more often used as a recruiting tool than as an accommodation for extraordinary academic talent. Information about available opportunities is often difficult to find and procedures for early admission or dual enrolment vary greatly from institution to institution. Streamlined access would facilitate gifted secondary students to find appropriate tertiary options across the country...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyse whether the {{parallel}} life situation between stroke patients and their informal caregivers (dyads) shown in cross-sectional studies prevails also in a longitudinal perspective. Methods. A total of 377 Swedish stroke patients, aged ‡ 65 years, and their 268 informal caregivers were followed from hospital admission and one year on. Analyses were based on patient interviews, functional ability (MMSE) score, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) score, Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) score, self-rated health score, and the Gothenburg Quality of Life (GQL) activity score. Similar information was obtained by postal questionnaires from informal caregivers, also including information on the nature and amount of assistance provided and on Caregiver Burden (CB) score. Results. Before index <b>admission</b> <b>informal</b> caregivers provided care on average 5 h per week and after discharge 11 h per week (P < 0. 0001). Support volume was associated with patient sex (more for men), low patient’s functional ability, low received municipal social service support, closeness of patient–caregiver relation, and short distance to patient’s home. Significant positive associations within the dyads were found for HAD anxiety score (P < 0. 0001), total NHP score (P < 0. 0001), and GQL activity score (P < 0. 0001) after adjustment for patient’s age, sex, functional ability, and patient–caregiver relationship. CB score increased with amount of informal caregiver support, patient’s age, and with low functional ability and low amount of municipal social service support. All these associations were constant across time. Conclusions. There was an association within the dyads regarding anxiety score, NHP score, and activity score. CB score was generally high...|$|R

40|$|AimTo {{investigate}} agreement between: (1) expected {{reasons and}} actual reasons for admission {{of people with}} dementia according to informal caregivers; (2) scores on measurement instruments prior to admission and the actual reasons for <b>admission</b> according to <b>informal</b> caregivers. BackgroundTimely <b>admission</b> of people with dementia is a crucial issue. Information is highly warranted on whether informal caregivers are capable of prior identification of causes of admission and, can thus be considered a reliable prospective source on causes of <b>admission.</b> DesignA cohort study among <b>informal</b> caregivers of people with dementia who made a transition to institutional long-term care. MethodsQualitative data on the expected and actual reasons for admission were collected via open-ended questions at baseline and follow-up. Furthermore, at baseline, data were collected using measurement instruments to measure pre-admission characteristics. Interviews took place between November 2010 -April 2012. After categorizing the answers, the agreement between the expected and actual reasons was calculated. Furthermore, bivariate associations were calculated between the actual reasons for admission and scores on corresponding measurement instruments. Results/FindingsFor most informal caregivers, there was agreement between their statements on the expected reason and the actual reason for admission. A third of the caregivers showed no conformity. Bivariate associations showed that there is also agreement between the actual reasons for admission and scores on corresponding measurement instruments. ConclusionInformal caregivers can be considered reliable sources of information regarding what causes the admission of a person with dementia. Professional care should anticipate informal caregivers' statements and collaborate with them to strive for timely and appropriate admission...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and aim Because of the {{expected}} increase of dementia patients in the next decades and the growing demand for formal care, an important question appears: how to predict and influence the caring possibilities of informal carers. We introduce the concept perseverance time, describedas {{the period of time}} that informal carers expect to be able to continue performing their care tasks for their relative with dementia; the length of that period of time is influenced by a combination of factors. The overall aim of our studies was to explore the feasibility, validity, and added value of perseverance time within the context of decision making in dementia care. Methods Data were collected from 223 informal carers of dementia patients. Perseverance time was measured by asking informal carers: ‘If the informal care situation stays as it is now, how long {{will you be able to}} cope with the care?’Convergent validity was assessed by looking at associations of perseverance time with validated instruments for measuring subjective burden (CSI, CarerQol- 7 D and SRB) and happiness (CarerQol-VAS). Content validity was evaluated by performing multivariate correlations between perseverance time and characteristics of dementia patients, informal carers and the care situation. To trace profiles of informal carers related to perseverance time we used the Q-methodology. Grounded theory was used to evaluate the nursing home placement by informal carers. Finally we investigated how the timing of admission to a nursing home was related to perseverance time of the informal carer. Results The convergent validity of perseverance time based on its associations with subjective burden appeared to be good. The association with happiness was also significant. The content validity appeared fair to good for perseverance time of more than half a year and more than one year and declined for a perseverance time of more than two years. Informal carers with a limited perseverance time made a reliable prediction of the end of their perseverance time. The predictive value of informal carers who indicated an unlimited perseverance time varied. Five distinct profiles of caregiving were identified that differed significantly from each other, and were associated with perseverance time. The decision by <b>informal</b> carers to the <b>admission</b> of their relative with dementia often had to be taken under time pressure in order to avoid a place in the nursing home being left empty. However, after the <b>admission</b> <b>informal</b> carers reported that they could have continue their care task for another six months on average if the admission had not taken place. Conclusion Results of our study suggest that both feasibility and validity of perseverance time is favourable within the context of informal care for persons with dementia. To ask for perseverance time is a direct way to investigate how long informal carers can continue their current informal care tasks. In addition to its relevance for research in the field of informal care, the information about perseverance time may also prove useful in practice in providing timely support to informal carers to prevent overburdening and crisis admissions...|$|R

50|$|Section 5(2) is a doctor’s holding power. It {{can only}} be used to detain in {{hospital}} {{a person who has}} consented to <b>admission</b> on an <b>informal</b> basis (i.e. not detained under the Act) but then changed their mind and wishes to leave. It can be implemented following a (usually brief) assessment by the RC or his deputy, which, in effect, means any hospital doctor, including psychiatrists but also those based on medical or surgical wards. It lasts up to 72 hours, during which time a further assessment may result in either discharge from the section or detention under section 2 for assessment or section 3 for treatment.|$|R

40|$|Background: Coercion is not {{uncommon}} phenomenon among mental health service users during their admission into psychiatric hospital. Research on perceived coercion of psychiatric patients is limited from India. Aim: To investigate perceived coercion of psychiatric patients during admission into a tertiary care psychiatric hospital. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive survey carried out among randomly selected psychiatric patients (n = 205) at a tertiary care center. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using structured questionnaire. Results: Our findings revealed that participants experienced low levels of coercion during their admission process. However, {{a majority of the}} participants were threatened with commitment (71. 7 %) as well as they were sad (67. 8 %), unpleased (69. 7 %), confused (73. 2 %), and frightened (71. 2 %) with regard to hospitalization into a psychiatric hospital. In addition, the participants expressed higher levels of negative pressures (mean ± standard deviation, 3. 76 ± 2. 12). Participants those were admitted involuntarily (P > 0. 001), diagnosed to be having psychotic disorders (P > 0. 003), and unmarried (P > 0. 04) perceived higher levels of coercion. Conclusion: The present study showed that more formal coercion was experienced by the patients those got admitted involuntarily. On the contrary, participants with voluntary <b>admission</b> encountered <b>informal</b> coercion (negative pressures). There is an urgent need to modify the Mental Health Care (MHC) Bill so that treatment of persons with mental illness is facilitated.

40|$|Abstract Background Elderly persons {{admitted}} to the hospital are at risk for hospital related functional loss. This evaluation aims to compare the effects of different levels of (integrated) health intervention care programs on preventing hospital related functional loss among elderly patients by comparing a new intervention program to two usual care programs. Methods/Design This study will include an effect, process and cost evaluation using a mixed methods design of quantitative and qualitative methods. Three hospitals in the Netherlands with different levels of integrated geriatric health care will be evaluated using a quasi-experimental study design. Data collection on outcomes will take place through a prospective cohort study, which will incorporate a nested randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a stay at the centre for prevention and reactivation for patients with complex problems. The study population will consist of elderly persons (65 years or older) at risk for functional loss who are {{admitted to}} one of the three hospitals. Data is prospectively collected at time of hospital admission (T 0), three months (T 1), and twelve months (T 2) after hospital <b>admission.</b> Patient and <b>informal</b> caregiver outcomes (e. g. health related quality of life, activities of daily living, burden of care, (re-) admission in hospital or nursing homes, mortality) as well as process measures (e. g. the cooperation and collaboration of multidisciplinary teams, patient and informal caregiver satisfaction with care) will be measured. A qualitative analysis will determine the fidelity of intervention implementation as well as provide further context and explanation for quantitative outcomes. Finally, costs will be determined from a societal viewpoint to allow for cost effectiveness calculations. Discussion It is anticipated that higher levels of integrated hospital health care for at risk elderly will result in prevention of loss of functioning and loss of quality of life after hospital discharge as well as in lower burden of care and higher quality of life for informal caregivers. Ultimately, {{the results of this study}} may contribute to the implementation of a national integrated health care program to prevent hospital related functional loss among elderly patients.
