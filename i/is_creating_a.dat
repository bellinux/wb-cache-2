He has them watch an episode of an anime called Pichu Bros. and then introduces the game's basic features before leaving them alone.

5|$|The {{second part}} of the book {{presents}} evidence that globalization <b>is</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> new class divide: those who are able to move to a different community to take advantage of opportunity and those who are rooted. This mobile class of people are differentiating urban areas in terms of values, culture, economic specialization, and other factors, and businesses are following the most talented people to these cities despite high land prices and labor costs. Florida also insists that a disproportionate amount of wealth is being generated in those cities which have been successful in attracting the creative class. Finally, globalization has reduced the importance of resource extraction and manufacturing in the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate.|$|E

25|$|The Gutenberg Bible {{is printed}} in the blackletter type styles that would become known as Textualis (Textura) and Schwabacher. The name texture refers to {{the texture of the}} printed page: {{straight}} vertical strokes combined with horizontal lines, giving the impression of a woven structure. Gutenberg already used the technique of justification, that <b>is,</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> vertical, not indented, alignment at the left and right-hand sides of the column. To do this, he used various methods, including using characters of narrower widths, adding extra spaces around punctuation, and varying the widths of spaces around words. He also let the punctuation marks go beyond the vertical line using hanging punctuation, which was used to make the justification of the massive black characters stronger to the eye.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the book}} Yes to Human Cloning, {{the first stage of}} this {{extended}} cloning process <b>is</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> human embryo through human cloning.

500|$|The {{essence of}} metal {{drumming}} <b>is</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> loud, constant beat {{for the band}} using the [...] "trifecta of speed, power, and precision". Metal drumming [...] "requires an exceptional amount of endurance", and drummers have to develop [...] "considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity... to play the intricate patterns" [...] used in metal. A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it {{with the other hand}} (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music. Black metal, death metal and some [...] "mainstream metal" [...] bands [...] "all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats".|$|E
500|$|For {{an express}} trust to be valid, the trust {{instrument}} must show certainty of intention, {{subject matter and}} object. Certainty of intention means {{that it must be}} clear that the settlor or testator wishes to create a trust; this is not dependent on any particular language used, and a trust can be created without the word [...] "trust" [...] being used, or even the settlor knowing he <b>is</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> trust. Since the 1950s, the courts have been more willing to conclude that there was intention to create a trust, rather than hold that the trust is void. Certainty of subject matter means that it must be clear what property is part of the trust. Historically the property must have been segregated from non-trust property; more recently, the courts have drawn a line between tangible and intangible assets, holding that with intangible assets there is not always a need for segregation. Certainty of objects means that it must be clear who the beneficiaries, or objects, are. The test for determining this differs {{depending on the type of}} trust; it can be that all beneficiaries must be individually identified, or that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, if a claimant comes before them, whether he is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E

500|$|The {{three certainties}} {{refer to a}} rule within English trusts law on the {{creation}} of express trusts that, to be valid, the trust instrument must show certainty of intention, subject matter and object.
