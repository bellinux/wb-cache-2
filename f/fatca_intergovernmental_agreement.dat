40|$|<b>Intergovernmental</b> <b>agreements</b> are an {{important}} part of the intergovernmental framework of a federal country. They allow for the creation of new institutions beyond those defined by the constitution. They can serve many purposes, including the entrenchment of cooperation, the initiation of new government programs, the regulation of government funds and even constitutional change (Painter 1996, 118). Despite the potential importance to federal systems, <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>agreements</b> remain understudied. Research has been done on the issue, but much of it pertains to domestic studies, often concerning the legality of agreements (see: Saunders 1995, Poirier 2003 and Ridgeway 1971). Further comparative research is needed to investigate the factors that may help or hinder the formation of agreements. This study attempts to fulfill this task by asking the question: how does the constitutional framework of a federal country influence the creation of <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>agreements?</b> 1 It is expected that the constitution will have a noticeable effect on the formation of intergovernmenta...|$|R
