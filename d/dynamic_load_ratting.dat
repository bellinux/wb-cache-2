PM aluminium foams cylinders with closed outer skins 45 mm diameter and 60 mm length were tested in both the standard SHPB configuration specimen between two nylon bars, and the block bar configuration specimen in front of input bar to obtain a higher loading rate. Despite unavoidable scatter for this kind of materials, the slight rate sensitivity could be observed.
