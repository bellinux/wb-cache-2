The transition rate is determined using Fermi's golden rule from a two-body screened Coulomb interaction assuming energy and momentum conservation. The transition rate is calculated {{for the first two}} conduction bands of silicon by numerically integrating over the full Brillouin zone. The overlap integrals in the expression for the transition rate are determined numerically using a 15 band k-p calculation.

40|$|Semiconducting diamond is a {{candidate}} wide-band gap material for applications in vacuum microelectronic devices. Its potential use in components that are operated at high frequencies, handle high powers or are subjected to extremes of temperature and radiation {{have yet to be}} commercially realised. The work presented below sets out to determine whether semiconducting diamond is a suitable material for such active electronic devices by examining the most efficient means of <b>initiating</b> <b>electron</b> emission from Chemical Vapour Deposited (CVD), semiconducting diamond. Novel methods are reported for the incorporation of impurity atoms of Nitrogen and Phosphorus into CVD diamond that employ ion-implantation techniques. Demonstration of the efficient incorporation of these impurities to form donor states with low activation energies into polycrystalline diamond would facilitate efficient room temperature operation of pn junctions devices. The effectiveness of boron as a p-type dopant in CVD diamond films has enabled the investigation of potential field emitter structures using different boron concentrations in order to identify their respective conduction mechanisms and to make a comparison of their relative electron emission performance. It has been concluded that efficient electron emission is observed to originate from the interface of n"+-p, silicon/diamond heterojunctions that employ thin p-type regions which are less than 5 #mu#m thick. The emission current may be controlled by the application of a low voltage forward bias of less than 1 volt. Only the np junction containing 400 ppm of boron in the p-diamond layer demonstrated forward biased electron emission. It is proposed that carrier conduction across the junction interface involves recombination and tunnelling steps between interface trap states. Furthermore it is believed that due to the junction interface being in direct contact with vacuum, within this region of the emitter structure, a surface conduction emission mechanism may operate that facilitates the field emission of electrons from the p-diamond side of the interface into free space. A number of aspects relating to the junction structure could be considered to improve its performance as a cold cathode emitter: a p-diamond layer exhibiting a higher carrier mobility; a controlled number, distribution and type of defect residing at the interface; an emission surface conditioned to exhibit a stable Negative Electron Affinity (NEA). To more clearly define the operation of a diamond cold cathode emitter based upon this junction structure further exploratory effort would be required to be undertaken in the future.

40|$|Proteins are key {{actors in}} all {{cellular}} processes and pathways {{and almost all}} diseases are linked to perturbations of proteins, their modification state or interaction networks. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has matured to a high-throughput quantitative technology, aiming to provide sensitive, accurate and complete information on protein abundance, interactions and networks. In the current workflow in MS-based proteomics, proteins are cleaved into peptides by proteolytic digestion followed by MS analysis. Peptide sequencing is key to any MS-based proteomic experiment and provides the foundation for structural analysis. Collision induced dissociation (CID) is the most established dissociation technique and is nowadays routinely used for peptide sequencing. Over the last years, electron-driven approaches such as electron transfer dissociation (ETD) have evolved as valuable alternative fragmentation techniques. In this thesis the development of novel tandem mass spectrometry technologies based on electron-transfer dissociation is described. First, a new method that combines CID and ETD with either ion trap or Orbitrap detection in a data-dependent decision tree approach is introduced. This method enables selection of the most appropriate combination of fragmentation technique and mass analyzer ‘on-the-fly’, in turn leading to more confident peptide identification. Next, a novel fragmentation method combining higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) and ETD in a single MS/MS event is described. This method, coined EThcD, provides extensive peptide backbone fragmentation and substantially increases the overall peptide sequence coverage. Furthermore, the higher quality in EThcD spectra facilitates the analysis of post-translational modifications, e. g. phosphorylation or glycosylation. Localization of post-translational modifications is challenging because it requires observation of site-determining fragment ions. This is exemplified {{for the analysis of}} phosphorylated peptides, which revealed superior phosphorylation site assignment using EThcD compared to current fragmentation methods. Another part of this thesis describes a novel instrumental setup to perform ETD reactions in the HCD collision cell on an Orbitrap Velos instrument by applying a static DC gradient axially to the rods. This gradient enables simultaneous three dimensional, charge sign independent, trapping of cations and anions, <b>initiating</b> <b>electron</b> transfer reactions {{in the center of the}} HCD cell where oppositely charged ions clouds overlap. The data shows that performing ETD in the HCD cell provides similar fragmentation as ion trap-ETD but will require further optimization to match performance of ion trap-ETD. The benefits of ETD are further highlighted in a study of endogenous neuropeptides derived from rat brain. Neuropeptides are key players in food intake regulation. Here, we analyze brain extract from two different brain areas. Based on the results from chapter 2, we utilized HCD and ETD fragmentation to increase the overall peptide identification rate. Overall we identified more than 1700 unique endogenous peptides, including virtually all neuropeptides that are known to be involved in food intake regulation.

The attention of researchers has been attracted for several decades, but the mechanism of bacterial BL is still largely unknown due {{to the complexity of}} the multistep reaction process. Debates mainly focus on three key questions: How is the bioluminophore produced? What is the exact chemical form of the bioluminophore? How does the protein environment affect the light emission? Using quantum mechanics (QM), combined QM and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and molecular dynamic (MD) calculations in gas-phase, solvent and protein environments, the entire process of bacterial BL was investigated, from flavin reduction to light emission.

AhpC, the peroxide-reducing (peroxiredoxin) component of this alkyl hydroperoxidase system, is an important scavenger of endogenous hydrogen peroxide in bacteria and acts through a reactive, peroxidatic cysteine, Cys 46, and a second cysteine, Cys 165, that forms an active site disulfide bond. AhpF, a separate disulfide reductase protein, regenerates AhpC every catalytic cycle via electrons from NADH which are transferred to AhpC through a tightly bound flavin and two disulfide centers, Cys 345 -Cys 348 and Cys 129 -Cys 132, through putative large domain movements. In order to assess cysteine reactivity and interdomain interactions in both proteins, a comprehensive set of single and double cysteine mutants (replacing cysteine with serine) of both proteins were prepared.
