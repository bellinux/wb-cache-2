40|$|The use {{of camera}} traps {{as a tool}} for {{studying}} wildlife populations is commonplace. However, few have considered how the number of detections of wildlife differ depending upon the number of camera traps placed at cameras-sites, and how this impacts estimates of occupancy and community composition. During December 2015 -February 2016, we deployed four camera traps per camera-site, separated into treatment groups of one, two, and four camera traps, in southern Illinois to compare whether estimates of wildlife community metrics and occupancy probabilities differed among <b>survey</b> <b>methods.</b> The overall number of species detected per camera-site was greatest with the four-camera <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> (P< 0. 0184). The four-camera <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> detected 1. 25 additional species per camera-site than the one-camera <b>survey</b> <b>method,</b> and was the only <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> to completely detect the ground-dwelling silvicolous community. The four-camera <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> recorded individual species at 3. 57 additional camera-sites (P = 0. 003) and nearly doubled the number of camera-sites where white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were detected compared to one- and two-camera <b>survey</b> <b>methods.</b> We also compared occupancy rates estimated by survey methods; as the number of cameras deployed per camera-site increased, occupancy estimates were closer to na√Øve estimates, detection probabilities increased, and standard errors of detection probabilities decreased. Additionally, each <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> resulted in differing top-ranked, species-specific occupancy models when habitat covariates were included. Underestimates of occurrence and misrepresented community metrics can have significant impacts on species of conservation concern, particularly in areas where habitat manipulation is likely. Having multiple camera traps per site revealed significant shortcomings with the common one-camera trap <b>survey</b> <b>method.</b> While we realize survey design is often constrained logistically, we suggest increasing effort to at least two camera traps facing opposite directions per camera-site in habitat association studies, and to utilize camera-trap arrays when restricted by equipment availability...|$|R

Although negative survey, which is inspired by Artificial Immune System (AIS), can protect users' privacy data with high efficiency and degree of privacy protection, its accuracy {{is influenced by the}} number of client terminals, and insufficient client terminals may lead to large errors. This study focuses on a multiple-negative <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> of remedying this weakness. Compared with the traditional negative <b>survey</b> <b>method,</b> the multiple-negative <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> collects each user's multiple different negative categories rather than only one negative category.

The findings show that the pretest method does have an effect on the error detection rate of respondents; however, the hypothesised interaction between method and knowledge was not unequivocally supported. The detailed results illustrate which error types are affected by the method used during pretesting. Implications for future research are considered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Health {{surveys are}} a very {{important}} component of the epidemiology toolbox, and {{play a critical role in}} gauging population health, especially in developing countries. Research on health <b>survey</b> <b>methods,</b> however, is sparse. In particular, current sampling methods are not well adapted for certain 'difficult' settings, such as emergencies, remote regions without easily available sampling frames, hidden and vulnerable population groups, urban slums and populations living under strong political pressure. This special issue of Emerging Themes in Epidemiology is entirely devoted to <b>survey</b> <b>methods</b> in such settings, and builds upon a successful conference in London highlighting problems with current approaches and possible ways forward. Greater investment in research on health <b>survey</b> <b>methods</b> is needed and will have beneficial effects for populations in need. </p...|$|R

Transect methods sample a representative portion of the total study area, thus allowing for statistical extrapolation to the total area. Other advantages of transect methods are less flight time and less cost than total coverage, ease of navigation, and reduced likelihood of double-counting.

40|$|Drought-sensitive bryophytes are {{especially}} vulnerable to edge effects caused by forest fragmentation. Because of increased forest fragmentation, these bryophyte species are declining and {{are in need of}} conservation. Considering that a field survey including all bryophyte species is very time consuming, methods that make identification less difficult should be tested for their usefulness in conservation. This paper describes an alternative <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> that utilizes the correlation between bryophyte life-forms and microclimates for evaluating drought-sensitive bryophytes. This <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> was examined using epiphytic bryophyte flora on tree trunks in 27 fragmented forests of Kyoto city, {{in the western part of}} Japan. The usefulness of life-forms for this evaluation was discussed based on the correlation of life-forms with species richness and microclimates. The results indicated that, while life-from richness was considered to reflect the heterogeneity of moisture availability and light intensity in bryophyte habitats, a certain life-form category (for example, fans and dendroids) seemed to correlate with drought sensitivity of bryophytes. Considering this correlation, an alternative <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> was proposed that utilizes the richness of hygrophilous life-forms. This <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> seems to be more cost-effective than a traditional all-species survey, and provides an important step toward the conservation of drought-sensitive species...|$|R
