Others are more involved, such as being a student tour guide or being a student computer technician. The job program is an integral part of the school's history and character even if many of the jobs are different than when they were originally created.|$|E

25|$|The {{source of}} many of the rumors {{surrounding}} Caligula and Drusilla may be derived from formal Roman dining habits. It was customary in patrician households for the host and hostess of a <b>dinner</b> (<b>or</b> in other words, the husband and the wife in charge of the household) to hold the positions of honor at banquets in their residence. In the case of a young bachelor being the head of the household, the female position of honor traditionally was to be held by his sisters, in rotation. If that were Caligula, it would have been Agrippina the Younger, Drusilla, and Julia Livilla taking turns sitting in the place of honor. Apparently, Caligula broke with this tradition in that rather than having his sisters take turns at the place of honor, the place was reserved exclusively for Drusilla. Furthermore, although he was married to Lollia Paulina, through this deviation from traditional practices Caligula publicly proclaimed that Drusilla was his wife and the female head of his household.|$|E
