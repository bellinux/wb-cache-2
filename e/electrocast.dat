40|$|To a glass scientist, {{the name}} Fulcher conjures images of {{viscosity}} vs. temperature diagrams for glass-forming liquids. Indeed, Gordon Fulcher’s seminal 1925 publication, {{in which he}} proposed his three-parameter model of viscosity, {{is one of the}} most significant and influential papers ever published in the field of glass science. Fulcher developed this equation during the early part of his 14 -year career at Corning Glass Works (1920 - 1934). However, Fulcher’s work in viscosity represents a small fraction of his highly diverse and accomplished career, which included pioneering the field of <b>electrocast</b> ceramics and developing the modern system of scientific abstracting that it still in use today. Fulcher also had a keen interest in social and economic problems, and his latter research focused heavily on the field of metacognition, i. e., the process of thinking...|$|E
