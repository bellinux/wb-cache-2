During a stay of over two years in Oxford in the early 1960 s, working towards his {{habilitation}} thesis, Christoph Scriba prepared a personal card catalogue of all the letters of John Wallis (1616 – 1703) he had unearthed in, amongst other places, the Bodleian and various college libraries, in the Royal Society and the British Museum. On each card he noted details of date, manuscript and printed sources, and any other relevant bibliographic information. This was not all. He also produced two further catalogues: one of all manuscripts containing Wallis’s papers and letters, listing systematically the content {{of each of the}} folio sheets, and one of all the books formerly in the Library of the Savilian professors, now part of the Bodleian, giving precise details of when he had ordered each of the books and when they had been returned to the stacks, after inspection for underlining, marginalia, and so on. Nor did he buy neat new cards specifically for this purpose, as they would have been available from Oxford stationers at the time. Instead, he re-cycled the insides of envelopes used for sending him letters, some white, some brown, some <b>grey,</b> <b>cutting</b> them down to a uniform size. And these cards, carefully inscribed, were not housed in a varnished wooden box such as could then be found in libraries or offices up and down the country, but rather in re-used cartons, one for coffee filters here, one for a presentation table lighter there. The appearance does not diminish the content or the value in any way. These painstakingly produced catalogues and records of scholarly practice were not only accurate and reliable, but also contained a wealth of information which has only very rarely been superseded. Historical research instruments born of the shortages of post-war Europe and prepared by a careful mind averse to wastefulness, they are still in use today...|$|E

50|$|Pi and Planck Two gray spies for the Resistance, {{named because}} of their numbers. Pi seems more serious and cynical, while Planck is more easy-going. Pi fears Persephone, and has {{attempted}} to destroy her. However, he failed, and Persephone apparently made him forget the incident. The explosion in the cell block has collapsed a holding cell, killing most of the hibernating <b>Greys</b> and <b>cutting</b> Pi, Planck {{and the rest of}} the survivors off from the resistance base. While typically under the control of the drugged Nega-Skaboola, the control has somehow weakened, and Planck rallied the aliens, first against the Emperor's troops and then against the aliens themselves.|$|R
60|$|In {{that state}} of mind I joined Bertha in her private sitting-room. She was seated in a leaning posture on a settee, with her back towards the door; the great rich coils of her pale blond hair surmounting her small neck, visible above {{the back of the}} settee. I remember, as I closed the door behind me, a cold tremulousness seizing me, and a vague sense of being hated and lonely--vague and strong, like a presentiment. I know how I looked at that moment, for I saw myself in Bertha's thought as she lifted her <b>cutting</b> <b>grey</b> eyes, and looked at me: a miserable ghost-seer, {{surrounded}} by phantoms in the noonday, trembling under a breeze when the leaves were still, without appetite for the common objects of human desires, but pining after the moon-beams. We were front to front with each other, and judged each other. The terrible moment of complete illumination had come to me, and I saw that the darkness had hidden no landscape from me, but only a blank prosaic wall: from that evening forth, through the sickening years which followed, I saw all round the narrow room of this woman's soul--saw petty artifice and mere negation where I had delighted to believe in coy sensibilities and in wit at war with latent feeling--saw the light floating vanities of the girl defining themselves into the systematic coquetry, the scheming selfishness, of the woman--saw repulsion and antipathy harden into cruel hatred, giving pain only for the sake of wreaking itself.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Grey alder stands {{currently}} take up 10. 2 % or 329 700 ha of {{the total}} forest area, and the area of these stands is continuing to increase mainly in non-managed agricultural lands of private owners (Central Statistical Bureau, 2007). The reforestation of cutting areas harvested in the wintertime by grey alder root and stump coppices reaches 35 - 150 thousand per hectare in the first year. The amount of coppices decreases to 16 - 47 % in the following 3 years. The first thinning of young alder stands can be recommended at an age of 3 - 5 years by decreasing the number of trees to 4000 - 5000 per ha. The research showed that the resurgence with root and stump offspring in grey alder clearings was intense, and no expenses were required for forest restoration. By artificially making grey alder grow in agricultural lands, the planting and maintenance costs {{are similar to those}} of other species. The research shows the possibilities of increasing the amounts of wood obtained per unit of area when freely choosing the rotation age and the purpose of growing grey alder. It is shown that by <b>cutting</b> <b>grey</b> alder at an age of 15 - 20 years, 1. 90 - 2. 28 times more wood per ha can be obtained than by cutting aspen, birch and black alder at the age determined by the law. The results of this research allow recommending grey alder as a prospective tree species with rotation age of 15 - 20 years for production of energy wood and with rotation age of 25 - 30 years for production of energy wood and small timber.

40|$|Research was {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} nature of the coexistence between kahikatea and grey willow in the Waikato Ecological Region. Three main questions were investigated. Is grey willow inhibiting recruitment of kahikatea? If this is occurring, which mechanisms (of interference) are involved? And does anthropogenic disturbance influence this interaction? The first and third were addressed by measuring kahikatea and grey willow populations for age, stem frequency and diameter at six sites, to assess how populations were structured, to reconstruct the population histories at each site and to determine whether kahikatea is successfully regenerating and what possible factors influence regeneration. Results indicated grey willow was establishing after kahikatea populations at all but the Totara Park site, and that once grey willow had reached the canopy, no further recruitment of kahikatea into the canopy occurred. No kahikatea saplings were present in grey willow densities above two per 10 m 2 and sapling presence did not always result in canopy emergence. Sites containing the highest sapling frequencies were those most recently exposed to moderate to large-scale disturbance, and those closest to a large seed source, rather than those with long established kahikatea populations. This suggests anthropogenic disturbance of certain scale and frequency can promote the regeneration of both species. The second question was investigated using a range of methods. Dendrochronology was employed to compare diameter growth rates between the species at each site and found grey willow only performed marginally better than kahikatea and its competitive advantage in reaching the canopy faster is likely exerted via more rapid height growth rates. Experimental methods involved measuring annual height and diameter growth rates of forty introduced and twenty naturally established seedlings in various grey willow canopy treatments and water table heights in Totara Park, Hamilton city. Hemispherical photography and water table measurements were used to quantify seedling microhabitats. The greatest seedling diameter and height growth rates were recorded in the open canopy introduced treatment and the lowest in the closed canopy naturally established treatment irrespective of water table height. The reduction in summer light levels from a grey willow canopy regularly caused apical stem death or reduced growth rates of kahikatea seedlings. Interference effects from allelopathy were investigated as previous research indicated kahikatea litter is toxic to its own seedlings. A trial was set up using potted <b>grey</b> willow <b>cuttings</b> and Sinapus alba seedlings and regularly sprayed with kahikatea litter extract. Results were inconclusive and the natural concentrations of kahikatea litter found at Totara Park did not appear to affect the growth of either species. Overall this research suggests grey willow is inhibiting kahikatea regeneration via overtaking kahikatea growth to the canopy, shading out further recruitment, and maintaining dominance through efficient vegetative reproduction. Active management is required to ensure the return to dominance of kahikatea in Waikato swamp forests and highly disturbed sites, close to abundant seed source may provide novel opportunities for restoration...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Horticulture, Forestry, and Recreation ResourcesCharles BardenCheryl BoyerRed elm (Ulmus rubra), {{grey alder}} (Alnus incana and A. incana spp. tenuifolia) and buffaloberry (Shepherdia canadensis) are {{considered}} important plants for many Native American tribes in the United States. Native Americans have used these three species {{for a variety}} of medicinal uses and ceremonial purposes. Currently, Kansas tribal leaders would like to plant more of these species on tribal land, but the plants have been difficult to propagate. While red elm is valued as a ceremonial tree, it is susceptible to Dutch Elm Disease caused by the fungus (Ophiostoma ulmi) and is not grown in many ornamental nurseries. This has led to declining tree populations. The objective of these studies were to evaluate methods to propagate red elm, grey alder and buffaloberry in order to find techniques that can lead to an increase in the production of these species commercially and enable tribes and landowners to increase the presence of these native plants on their lands. In the first study, the use of gibberellic acid (GA 3) was investigated to determine the optimum concentration needed for maximum seed germination. Studies were conducted with stratified (cold, moist storage) and non-stratified red elm, grey alder, and buffaloberry seeds soaked in one of four treatments: 0, 250, 500 or 1000 ppm of GA 3 in 2010, and 0, 500, 1000, 2000 ppm of GA 3 in 2011. Results indicate the use of GA 3 in high concentrations promoted germination of unstratified seeds of red elm, though low seed viability in grey alder and buffaloberry resulted in poor germination. In a second study, vegetative cuttings were treated with potassium indole- 3 -butyric acid (K-IBA) and Dip ‘N GrowTM containing indole- 3 -butyric acid and naphthalene acetic acid (IBA + NAA). Softwood cuttings for the three species were treated with K-IBA and Dip ‘N GrowTM (plant rooting hormones) : K-IBA at 5, 000 and 10, 000 ppm and Dip ‘N GrowTM at 1 : 10 ratio solutions. Results of this study showed that only <b>grey</b> alder softwood <b>cuttings</b> had callus formation, root growth, and shoot growth while red elm and buffaloberry did not respond to cutting propagation treatments...|$|R
