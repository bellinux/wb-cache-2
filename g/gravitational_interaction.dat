40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to the {{discussion}} of an idea that <b>gravitational</b> <b>interactions</b> might be residual interactions of strong and electromagnetic interactions. Then, absence of the carriers of the <b>gravitational</b> <b>interactions</b> finds a natural explanation in the framework this idea. Besides, since masses (charges of the <b>gravitational</b> <b>interactions)</b> of particles are generated in strong, electromagnetic (and possibly, in other) interactions and if masses of the particles will be not generated in these interactions (i. e. m ≡ 0), then the <b>gravitational</b> <b>interactions</b> do not appear. That is also indirect confirmation of the considered idea. Connections between charge of the <b>gravitational</b> and other <b>interactions</b> are considered. ...|$|R

5|$|In 2003 it was {{hypothesized}} that these clumps could be caused by a roughly Neptune-mass planet having migrated from 40 to 65AU over 56millionyears, an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller rocky planets closer to Vega. The migration of this planet would likely require <b>gravitational</b> <b>interaction</b> with a second, higher-mass planet in a smaller orbit.|$|E
5|$|Janus and Epimetheus {{are called}} co-orbital moons. They are of roughly equal size, with Janus being {{slightly}} larger than Epimetheus. Janus and Epimetheus have orbits {{with only a few}} kilometers difference in semi-major axis, close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other. Instead of colliding, however, their <b>gravitational</b> <b>interaction</b> causes them to swap orbits every four years.|$|E
5|$|Most short-period comets {{belong to}} the Jupiter family—defined as comets with semi-major axes smaller than Jupiter's. Jupiter family comets are thought to form in the Kuiper belt outside the orbit of Neptune.

50|$|The {{collision}} of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 proved that <b>gravitational</b> <b>interactions</b> can fragment a comet, {{giving rise to}} many impacts {{over a period of}} a few days if the comet fragments should collide with a planet.

5|$|Such a shell {{would have}} no net <b>gravitational</b> <b>interaction</b> with its englobed star (see shell theorem), and could drift in {{relation}} to the central star. If such movements went uncorrected, they could eventually result in a collision between the sphere and the star—most likely with disastrous results. Such structures would need either some form of propulsion to counteract any drift, or some way to repel the surface of the sphere away from the star.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through <b>gravitational</b> <b>interaction.</b> However the bulges can be {{slightly}} misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gravitational</b> <b>interaction</b> with nearby {{stars and}} galactic tides {{modified}} cometary orbits {{to make them}} more circular. This explains the nearly spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud. On the other hand, the Hills cloud, which is bound more strongly to the Sun, has not acquired a spherical shape. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200–400 stars. These early stars likely played a role in the cloud's formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.|$|E

5|$|In 1821, Alexis Bouvard {{published}} astronomical {{tables of}} {{the orbit of}} Neptune's neighbour Uranus. Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through <b>gravitational</b> <b>interaction.</b> In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. Via Cambridge Observatory director James Challis, he requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–46 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{galaxy is}} {{inclined}} an estimated 77° {{relative to the}} Earth (where an angle of 90° would be viewed directly from the side). Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk. A possible cause of such a warp could be <b>gravitational</b> <b>interaction</b> with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy M33 could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.|$|E
5|$|If Sedna {{formed in}} its current location, the Sun's {{original}} protoplanetary disc must have extended as far as 75AU into space. Also, Sedna's initial orbit must have been approximately circular, otherwise its formation by the accretion of smaller bodies into a whole {{would not have been}} possible, because the large relative velocities between planetesimals would have been too disruptive. Therefore, it must have been tugged into its current eccentric orbit by a <b>gravitational</b> <b>interaction</b> with another body. In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested three possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt, a single passing star, or one of the young stars embedded with the Sun in the stellar cluster in which it formed.|$|E

5|$|Second, all {{solutions}} {{suggest that}} there was a gravitational singularity in the past, when R went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because {{it is based on the}} questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the <b>gravitational</b> <b>interaction</b> is significant. However, the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, R grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when R had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the Big Bang model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a quantum theory of gravity, which has not yet been formulated.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{simulations}} of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani {{suggest that the}} shape of the disk may be explained by the presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridanic. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridanic would orbit at a distance of 40AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years. The inner cavity of the disk may be explained by the presence of additional planets. Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10AU, then migrated outward because of <b>gravitational</b> <b>interaction</b> with the disc or with other planets in the system.|$|E
5|$|The Oort cloud {{is thought}} to be a remnant of the {{original}} protoplanetary disc that formed around the Sun approximately 4.6billion years ago. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that the Oort cloud's objects initially coalesced much closer to the Sun as part of the same process that formed the planets and minor planets, but that <b>gravitational</b> <b>interaction</b> with young gas giants such as Jupiter ejected the objects into extremely long elliptic or parabolic orbits. Recent research has been cited by NASA hypothesizing {{that a large number of}} Oort cloud objects are the product of an exchange of materials between the Sun and its sibling stars as they formed and drifted apart, and it is suggested that many—possibly the majority of—Oort cloud objects did not form in close proximity to the Sun. Simulations of the evolution of the Oort cloud from the beginnings of the Solar System to the present suggest that the cloud's mass peaked around 800million years after formation, as the pace of accretion and collision slowed and depletion began to overtake supply.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{investigations}} of <b>gravitational</b> <b>interactions</b> has {{led us to}} discover new facets of the fundamental force.

In this work, we present axioms of a novel theory that describes spacetime as a relativistic viscoelastic continuum; retaining the properties of the natural ^+Λ-CDM vacuum. With these axioms, we provide a foundation for a tensor field theory of Gravitational Strain; introduced as an advanced formulation of an elastic interpretation of <b>gravitational</b> <b>interactions.</b> This viscoelastic definition of gravity is a natural advancement of general relativity to an observable measure of a proper relativistic gravitational field.
