On the other hand, most of detached houses have slanted roofs, and the <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> various heights are mixed in the actual residential houses in Japan. Two experiments were performed in this paper to examine the validity of applying the formula to real residential area. In the first experiment, the model <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> gable roofs were used, and in the second one the <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> various height were mixed in the residential area.

Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E
