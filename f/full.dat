5|$|A {{member of}} the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a {{member of the}} nomenklatura, the country's de facto ruling class. Nikita Khrushchev chaired the Presidium from 1955 to 1964; Leonid Brezhnev succeeded him that year and chaired until 1982. In {{contrast}} to <b>full</b> members, candidate members of the Presidium could not vote during Presidium sessions. It was normal that a <b>full</b> member of the Presidium had previously served as a candidate member, but this was not always the case. During the term 23 people held seats in the Presidium: 14 <b>full</b> members and 9 candidate members. One candidate member was promoted to <b>full</b> membership in the Presidium during the term. Not a single Presidium member died during this period while retaining office.|$|E

5|$|Each {{member of}} a {{respective}} nation's jury was required to rank every song, except that of their own country.

The combination of the jury's <b>full</b> ranking and the televote's <b>full</b> ranking produced an overall ranking of all competing entries. The song which scored the highest overall rank received 12 points, while the tenth-best ranked song received 1-point. In the event of a televoting(insufficient amount of votes/technical issues) or jury failure(technical issue/breach of rules), only a jury/televoting was used by each country.|$|E

50|$|The <b>fuller</b> is used {{mainly to}} spread the metal. The <b>fuller</b> is placed against the metal stock, and then either the <b>fuller</b> (for an upper <b>fuller)</b> or the stock (for a lower <b>fuller)</b> is struck with a hammer. The rounded nose of the <b>fuller</b> spreads the metal more {{efficiently}} than the flat face of the hammer. The process leaves ridges in the stock, which may then be flattened out later with the hammer or other tools.|$|R
50|$|Another {{factor that}} affects its {{weight and balance}} is the {{construction}} of the blade. To reduce weight while keeping strength the blade might be hollow forged, or a <b>fuller</b> is created.
