Never again can a show get away with talking down to children or writing sloppily for them. Press Gang, possibly the best show in the world.|$|E
500|$|Tonelli {{returned}} to Alabama after the Olympics and intensified his training regimen, He recalled that [...] "The coach really supplied {{me with the}} environment to improve. I got used to pressure. You had {{to stand up and}} race in dual meets almost every other weekend, no matter <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt.</b> In Australia you are lucky if you get two top meets a year." [...] In 1977, he won the 100m backstroke at the US Open Championships at Mission Viejo, becoming one of the few Australians to win a US title.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{from each}} other. I don't know <b>how</b> <b>you</b> have <b>felt,</b> but I have not felt free. It {{has seemed to}} me that I promised you something. If I did, I want to take my promise back and be free." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Jee-rusalem!" [...] he said, [...] "that {{was a close}} call. I don't know <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt,</b> boys, but {{it seemed}} as if all the sand had gone out of me, and I {{weakened}} so that my knees have not done shaking yet." ...|$|E

I will be the mistress of Bleak House when you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] {{returned}} Atherton. [...] "I remember <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt.</b> I couldn't {{share your}} feeling, but I respected it. However, I doubt if your loan was {{a benefit to}} either of them. It probably tempted him to count upon money that he hadn't earned, and that's always corrupting." ...|$|E

'I {{gave you}} that {{patchwork}} {{to see what}} you would make of it, and it is as good as a diary to me, for I can tell by the different squares <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> when you made them,' continued Aunt Pen, with a twinkle in her eye as she glanced at the many-coloured bits on the carpet.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, mother, <b>how</b> be <b>you?</b> I <b>felt</b> {{like a boy}} again, {{waking up}} in the old chamber. Where's my back and breast-piece? Have you a cup of ale, while I rub it up?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] I urged. [...] "It {{would not}} be for her; it would not {{certainly}} be for yourself.

But, now, in regard to your coming here, of course I shall consult your aunt, although I imagine she will have no objection. I only wanted to know <b>how</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>felt</b> about it."

6000|$|... "Elma," [...] she said, {{leaning over}} her, [...] "do {{you know what}} that was? That was the Naga Snake Dance. It gave you an almost irresistible longing to rise, and hold the snake in your own hands, and coil his great folds around you.

He had got in trouble himself an' couldn't fetch much with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] she admitted, [...] "but, you see, the {{principal}} things between us {{have always been}} unspoken. I knew just <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> about it. What I want to know is, now that the times have changed around you as well as around me, whether you would feel just the same if I, to take an example, were to lunch or dine with Mr. Borden, now and then, or with Morris Hyde, the explorer. I met him at an Authors' Club conversazione and he was immensely interesting. It struck me then that perhaps I was interpreting your wishes a little too literally." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will; I will; {{it looks}} {{brighter}} and better already, and I won't lose my one comfort by any fault of my own. Thank you so much, Mother Bhaer, {{for taking my}} side.

No one said anything, but I knew <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt,</b> and that Mr Laurie sent me off partly {{to get me out}} of the way. Oh dear, life is pretty tough sometimes, isn't it?'

6000|$|... (M30) In the December of 1861 {{died the}} Prince Consort. His last {{communication}} to Mr. Gladstone {{was a letter}} (Nov. 19) proposing to recommend him as an elder brother of the Trinity House in place of Graham. Of Mr. Gladstone’s first interview with the Queen after her bereavement, Dean Wellesley wrote to {{him that she was}} greatly touched by his evidence of sympathy. “She saw <b>how</b> much <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> for her, and the mind of a person in such deep affliction is keenly sensitive and observant. Of all her ministers, she seemed to me to think that you had most entered into her sorrows, and she dwelt especially upon the manner in which you had parted from her.” To the Duchess of Sutherland Mr. Gladstone writes:— ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I {{know all}} I {{want to know}} about it, Marcia. I accept the facts. I told <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I <b>felt.</b> What you've done hasn't changed me toward you. I {{understand}} you better than you understand yourself; and I can't say that I'm surprised. Now I want you should make the best of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then just {{remember}} <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> {{when you first}} tried to ride a wheel and when you first tried to swim. You got excited, didn't you? And when you thought the wheel was going over you gave it a wild twist that did send you over, and when {{you thought you were}} going to drown you thrashed around in a way that only made matters worse. Well, that's a lesson to remember in running a flying machine. Don't get excited and lose your presence of mind, or it may cost you your life. Keep cool, act quickly, but don't overdo a thing. If the machine is tipping a little to one side, don't get excited and throw it clean over the other way. And don't try to make any sharp turns until you know your machine thoroughly." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Major and Mrs. Hunter {{both laughed}} at her earnestness, but the Doctor said gravely, [...] "Is that really <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> about {{him when he was}} talking to you, Miss Hannay? I am sorry to hear you say that. I own that my opinion has been that of {{everyone}} here, that the Rajah is a good fellow and a firm friend of the Europeans, and my only doubt has arisen {{from the fact that it}} was unnatural he should like us when he has considerable grounds for grievance against us. We have always relied upon his influence, which is great among his countrymen, being thrown entirely into the scale on our side if any trouble should ever arise; but I own that what you say makes me doubt him. I would always take the opinion of a dog or a child about anyone in preference to my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|A week of ominous silence {{regarding}} the festival succeeded in Santa Ana. The local paper gave the fullest particulars {{of the opening}} of the hotel, but contented itself with saying: [...] "The entertainment concluded with a dance." [...] Mr. Brooks, who felt himself compelled to call upon his late charming partner twice during the week, characteristically soothed her anxieties as to the result. [...] "The fact of it is, Mrs. Wade, there's really nobody in particular to blame--and that's what gets them. They're all mixed up in it, deacons and Sunday-school teachers; and when old Johnson tried to be nasty the other evening and hoped you hadn't suffered from your exertions that night, I told him you hadn't quite recovered yet from the physical shock of having been run into by him and Mrs. Stubbs, but that, you being a lady, you didn't tell just <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> at the exhibition he and she made of themselves. That shut him up." ...|$|E
