The role was named [...] "Paris" [...] in an early script and alludes to Paris Hilton (London spoofing Paris, and Tipton {{is the name of the}} hotel her father owns in the show). She got the role without an audition and was surprised to find her friend Ashley Tisdale working in the show. Song says, [...] "London is my fantasy person, I wish I could be her.

500|$|Contemporary critics {{often found}} the work scandalous {{due to its}} sexual themes. A few years earlier Fuseli had fallen for a woman named Anna Landholdt in Zürich, while {{travelling}} from Rome to London. Landholdt was the niece of his friend, the Swiss physiognomist Johann Kaspar Lavater. Fuseli wrote of his fantasies to Lavater in 1779; [...] "Last night <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> in bed with me—tossed my bedclothes hugger-mugger—wound my hot and tight-clasped hands about her—fused her body and soul together with my own—poured into her my spirit, breath and strength. Anyone who touches her now commits adultery and incest! She is mine, and I am hers. And have her I will.…" ...|$|E

Through the kindness of correspondents I possess myself some fifty to a hundred girls, or {{perhaps it would be}} more correct to say one girl in fifty to a hundred different hats. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> in big hats, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> in small hats, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> in no hat at all. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> smiling, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> looking as if she <b>had</b> lost <b>her</b> last sixpence. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> overdressed, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> decidedly underdressed, but she is much the same girl.

500|$|Gabrielle Christian first {{auditioned for}} the role of Spencer (then called [...] "Zooey") in July 2004, though Lynch also had her read for Ashley's part. Mandy Musgrave also auditioned {{for the role}} of Spencer, but Lynch liked her {{chemistry}} with Christian, so he paired the two up with Musgrave as Ashley. The pilot was first shot in October 2004 and directed by Rose Troche, but after the series was picked up by The N in January 2005, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters. He said that [...] "I didn't pick [...] up right away, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> keep re-auditioning. ... I [...] {{to make sure that this}} combination [...] perfect." [...] Her contract was finally picked up in May 2005 and the pilot was re-filmed with the new cast in July. Filming took place in Los Angeles, with a correctional facility used largely as the high school set. Donna Deitch, who directed the second version of the pilot but no subsequent South of Nowhere episodes said that the pilot is [...] "something I'm really, really proud of, because I think that show has a look, a style to it that really helps". She felt that the style she set suited the material and was [...] "fairly inventive" [...] for a low-budget series.|$|E

2500|$|John McNamara, Esq., gave {{evidence}} {{that on the}} evening of 7 April, he believed at some time after eleven o'clock, {{he came out of the}} playhouse with Martha Ray, and having seen her [...] "in some difficulties at the playhouse", offered his help in handing her to her carriage. She took his arm. As they came out of the passage into the Covent Garden playhouse and were two steps from the carriage, he heard the report of a pistol, while Miss Ray was still holding his right arm with her left hand. She fell instantly. He thought the pistol had been [...] "fired out of wantonness" [...] and that Miss Ray had fainted. He knelt to help her, but found blood on his hands, and got her into the Shakspeare tavern. He did not see Hackman at the time, but after he had been arrested, asked him what had possessed him, and he answered [...] "that it was not a proper place to ask that question, or something to that effect... I asked him his name, and I understood from him that his name was Hackman; I think he pronounced his name with an H. I asked him if he knew anybody. He said, he knew a Mr. Booth, in Craven-street in the Strand, and desired he might be sent for. He desired to see the lady. I did not tell him she was dead; somebody else did. I objected to his seeing her at that time. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> removed into another room. From the great quantity of blood I had about me I got sick, and was obliged to go home. I know no more about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{letters from}} Violet Keppel from Paris assuring her she only had feelings for her, Sackville-West had almost fainted {{when she read}} an announcement in a newspaper of Violet's engagement to Major Denys Trefusis. Sackville-West's response was to travel to Paris to see Keppel, taking her to the Hotel Roosevelt where she wrote in her diary: [...] "I treated savagely, I made love to her, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>her,</b> I didn't care, I only wanted to hurt Denys". Keppel had used the engagement {{as a way of}} eliciting the response from Sackville-West she had wanted, and the next day Major Trefusis [...] "almost turned white" [...] when he discovered his fiancee and Sackville-West together in bed, a discovery that came as a great shock as he believed the two were just friends, and had apparently believed that women were incapable of falling in love with one another. That night, Sackville-West had dinner alone at the Ritz while Keppel watched her lovingly from the window in her room at an adjoining hotel while Denys Trefusis laid on the bed crying. Under strong pressure from her mother Alice Keppel, a deeply depressed and suicidal Keppel did marry Major Trefusis, though she made it clear that she did not love him. Sackville-West called the marriage her greatest failure as she made a plan for Keppel to escape with her to avoid marrying Trefusis, but was too cowardly to carry it out, later writing [...] "I sat quite dazed in my room holding my watch in my hand and watching the hands tick past the hour of Violet's wedding. All the time, I knew, she was expecting a prearranged message from me, which I never sent".|$|E
