25|$|Secular Franciscans should {{consider}} {{their own family}} {{to be the first}} place in which to live their Christian commitment and Franciscan vocation. They should make space within it for prayer, for the Word of God, and for Christian catechesis. They should concern themselves with respect for all life in every situation from conception until death. Married couples find in the Rule of the OFS an effective aid in their own journey of Christian life, aware that in the sacrament of matrimony their love shares in the love that Christ has for his Church. The beauty and the strength of the human love of the spouses <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> witness for their own family, the Church, and the world.|$|E
25|$|Glia {{retain the}} ability to undergo cell {{division}} in adulthood, whereas most neurons cannot. The view {{is based on the}} general deficiency of the mature nervous system in replacing neurons after an injury, such as a stroke or trauma, while very often there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> proliferation of glia, or gliosis near or at the site of damage. However, detailed studies found no evidence that 'mature' glia, such as astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, retain the ability of mitosis. Only the resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells seem to keep this ability after the nervous system matures. On the other hand, there are a few regions in the mature nervous system, such as the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone, where generation of new neurons can be observed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{traditional}} {{interpretation of}} [...] "Cubism", formulated post facto {{as a means}} of understanding the works of Braque and Picasso, has affected our appreciation of other twentieth-century artists.

According to Daniel Robbins, [...] "To suggest that merely because these artists developed differently or varied from the traditional pattern they deserved to be relegated to a secondary or satellite role in Cubism <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> mistake." ...|$|E

In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church— for we are members of his body.
