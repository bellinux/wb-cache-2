The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 allowed people to have and use cannabis but only when prescribed by a doctor/physician. Cannabis was prescribed to people who had trouble with cancer, AIDS, and other medical inflictions such as glaucoma. It was implemented {{as a way to}} try and <b>help</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> needed cannabis for their medical illnesses to find a source and safe way to use the drug. However, this did not protect patients with medical cards to redistribute any of the cannabis they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E

25|$|Drinking in {{moderation}} {{has been found}} to <b>help</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have suffered a heart attack survive it. However, excessive alcohol consumption leads to an increased risk of heart failure. A review of the literature found that half a drink of alcohol offered the best level of protection. However, they noted that at present there have been no randomised trials to confirm the evidence which suggests a protective role of low doses of alcohol against heart attacks. However, moderate alcohol consumption is associated with hypertension. There is an increased risk of hypertriglyceridemia, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and stroke if 3 or more standard drinks of alcohol are taken per day.|$|E

The speaker mentioned that police officers informed him on Thursday that he will be held responsible for any atrocities committed in the city by the demonstrators; because of this he organized a committee of five people who will protect the demonstrators from provocators, remove the demonstrators who try to stir up trouble, and will try to prevent attacks against police officers.|$|E
25|$|Gan Eng Seng School {{was founded}} in some shophouses in Telok Ayer Street in 1885 by the philanthropist, Gan Eng Seng and was known as Anglo Chinese Free School. Born in 1844 into a poor family in Melaka, Gan came to Singapore {{at a young age}} to seek his fortune. Since he was unable to have much of an {{education}} in his youth, it was his ambition in life to build a school and <b>help</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> are poor as he prospered and became wealthy. Gan was far-sighted in placing emphasis on bilingualism in English and Chinese from the start. The school proved to be a success - the enrolment figure reached a record of 167 by 1890, and rose to an all-time high of 94% in 1892.|$|E
25|$|The CBO {{projected}} that raising {{the age of}} Medicare eligibility would save $113 billion over 10 years after accounting for the necessary expansion of Medicaid and state health insurance exchange subsidies under health care reform, which are needed to <b>help</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> could not afford insurance purchase it. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that raising the age of eligibility would save the federal government $5.7 billion a year, while raising costs for other payers. According to Kaiser, raising the age would cost $3.7 billion to 65- and 66-year-olds, $2.8 billion to other consumers whose premiums would rise as insurance pools absorbed more risk, $4.5 billion to employers offering insurance, and $0.7 billion to states expanding their Medicaid rolls. Ultimately Kaiser found that the plan would raise total social costs by {{more than twice the}} savings to the federal government.|$|E

25|$|In 1921, the bylaws of De Dageraad (article 2) stated for {{the first}} time that freethinkers, 'from the {{perspective}} of reason', placed themselves 'on an atheistic standpoint'. The Interior Minister Heemskerk (Anti-Revolutionary Party) refused to grant royal permission to this bylaws amendment in 1924, because atheism would go against morality and the public order, and lead to anarchy. After fierce debates in the House of Representatives, the Christian confessionalist majority rallied in support of the minister. De Vrijdenker freethought magazine mocked that Christianity had no monopoly on morality, and De Dageraad called for people to leave the church via the ComitÃ© Kerkafscheiding ("Committee for Apostasy"), and offered to <b>help</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> wished to terminate their membership (to which 3250 people responded in 1925). Eventually, the association decided that royal permission was important after all, and appointed special professor in philosophy of law, Leo Polak, to rewrite the bylaws. The emphasis on fighting religious dogmas and unquestionable authority was maintained, but the word 'atheistic' omitted; these bylaws were accepted by the government in 1927.|$|E
