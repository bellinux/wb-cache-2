25|$|Chrissie Wellington {{has said}} she has two passions in life: sport and development. In her victory speech at the 2007 Hawaii Ironman, she {{referred}} to her experience teaching at Beaver Country Day School near Boston, where she first noticed the difference that sport can make to children's lives. She also noted, from her experience in Nepal, how sport can bring conflict-affected communities together. In an interview, her coach Brett Sutton said: She has kicked around for years through South East Asia, working for underprivileged people. That's why she was in Nepal. Already this year she has done clinics in Thailand and the Philippines and now sponsors a young Filipino athlete to attend our group for the coach to work some magic. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>her</b> win could be the catalyst for the sport in South East Asia.|$|E

She said her initial reaction was surprise and [...] "a certain air of disbelief" [...] because during her 44-minute interview for the story, Erdely never brought up Jackie or asked about any of the allegations made in the article. Sullivan said: [...] "I was plainly not prepared for what the story looked like. Nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>her</b> characterization of my interview was fair." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for HitQuarters, Hutson said of Scott's approach to The Light of the Sun, [...] "She's {{now in charge of}} {{a lot of different things}} and with it comes a lot of trials and tribulations, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>her</b> goal is to just give people a very realistic glimpse of where she is in her life right now." [...] Scott has noted songs such as [...] "Hear My Call" [...] and [...] "Quick" [...] as reflective of the [...] "darkest moments" [...] in her life and has said that much of the album's music developed from studio jams and freestyle sessions. In {{an interview}} for Metro, she said of the [...] "largely improvised" [...] recording process: ...|$|E

500|$|When the Kilmers' {{daughter}} Rose (1912–1917) was {{stricken with}} poliomyelitis (also known as infantile paralysis) shortly after birth, {{they turned to}} their religious faith for comfort. A series of correspondence between Kilmer and Father James J. Daly led the Kilmers to convert to Roman Catholicism, and they were received in the church in 1913. In one of these letters Kilmer writes that he [...] "believed in the Catholic position, the Catholic view of ethics and aesthetics, for a long time," [...] and he [...] "wanted something not intellectual, some conviction not mental – in fact I wanted Faith." [...] Kilmer would stop [...] "every morning for months" [...] on his way [...] "to the office and prayed for faith," [...] claiming that when [...] "faith did come, it came, I think, by way of my little paralyzed daughter. Her lifeless hands led me; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>her</b> tiny feet know beautiful paths. You understand this and {{it gives me a}} selfish pleasure to write it down." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>her</b> dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vanessa was {{introduced}} {{as an old}} friend of established character Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), who helped her win the CEO position at Holby City Hospital in return for her helping him to deal with his rival Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing). Ash commented: [...] "Together <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>her</b> and Michael are going to whip the hospital up into a frenzy." [...] She denied that Vanessa and Michael would be romantically involved, instead characterising their relationship as a case of [...] "If you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours", explaining: [...] " [...] gets his own way rather more easily with Vanessa around, and in return he helps her." [...] With regards to Vanessa's personal life, Ash divulged that she lives with a man who is unemployed, making Vanessa the main source of income in their relationship.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her early}} essays on Anne Brontë's novels and poetry Muriel Spark praised her proficiency. She {{believed}} that Charlotte was a [...] "harsh sister to Anne" [...] and [...] "had she taken an impartial view of Wildfell Hall, {{she must have}} discovered its merits". Despite notion that Charlotte and Emily were [...] "more gifted", Spark stated that [...] " [...] writings none the less take no mean place in nineteenth-century literature". However, some forty years later, in introduction to The Essence of the Brontës, Spark radically changed her views on Anne: [...] "I do not now agree with my former opinion on Anne Brontë's value as a writer. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>her</b> works are {{not good enough to}} be considered in any serious context of the nineteenth century novel or that there exists any literary basis for comparison with the brilliant creative works of Charlotte and Emily... She was a writer who could 'pen' a story well enough; she was a literary equivalent of a decent water-colourist".|$|E
2500|$|Love's stage attire also {{garnered}} notoriety, influenced {{in part by}} Carroll Baker's wardrobe in {{the film}} Baby Doll (1956). The style was later dubbed [...] "kinderwhore" [...] by the media, and consisted of babydoll dresses, slips and nightgowns, and smeared makeup. Kurt Loder likened her onstage attire to a [...] "debauched ragdoll", and John Peel noted in his review of the band's 1994 Reading Festival performance, that [...] ", swaying wildly and with lipstick smeared on her face, hands and, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>her</b> back, {{as well as on}} the collar of her dress, [...] would have drawn whistles of astonishment in Bedlam. The band teetered on the edge of chaos, generating a tension which I cannot remember having felt before from any stage." [...] Rolling Stone referred to the style as [...] "a slightly more politically charged version of grunge; apathy turned into ruinous angst, which soon became high fashion's favorite pose." ...|$|E

2500|$|For scenes where Peyton {{is drawing}} or painting, Ward stated, [...] "...there {{would likely be}} very light lines for her to follow. Often I would give a {{finished}} version and an unfinished for this purpose. If I remember correctly, it was usually the words that I left undone." [...] Regarding the evolution of Peyton's artwork over the years, she said, [...] "I {{look back at the}} first season and think the drawings are awful! I certainly became more comfortable working in her style, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>her</b> style also evolved to fit mine. Does that make sense?" [...] Ward clarified, [...] "Initially I was trying to do something that just didn’t flow well from me. The drawings were too clean. A little forced and not at all the way I liked to work." [...] Ward said that as the show progressed, she began to put more of my own style in them, and became more comfortable and the work got better. In Season 3, the artwork was promoted through the album Friends with Benefit. In Season 6, it is seen in color instead of in black and white, to reflect the character's happiness.|$|E
