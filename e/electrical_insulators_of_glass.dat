Muscovite has a basic layered structure containing a flat monatomic sheet of potassium sandwiched between mirror silicate layers.

Due to low output current up to 1 mA it is possible to use a cascade voltage multiplier as suitable solution. The voltage multiplier is powered by switching-mode power supply with high voltage pulse transformer. The inverter uses single-acting innovative topology that enables a supply of alternating current to the voltage multiplier. This solution is simple, but an analysis of operation is difficult, as will be described in details in this thesis.

The coil diameter provides {{a compromise between}} mechanical stability and allowing expansion of the wire to minimize strain and consequential drift. The sensing wire is wrapped around an insulating mandrel or core. The winding core can be round or flat, but must be an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulator.</b> The coefficient <b>of</b> thermal expansion of the winding core material is matched to the sensing wire to minimize any mechanical strain. This strain on the element wire {{will result in a}} thermal measurement error. The sensing wire is connected to a larger wire, usually referred to as the element lead or wire.

Acceptable insulator resistance values are typically 1 to 10 megohms, depending on the standards referenced.|$|R

The results obtained provide an input to the behaviour of the leakage current under atmospheric conditions that are particular to the Caribbean coast of Colombia. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and principal component analysis are utilised to determine the significant relationships among the different variables under consideration. The necessary information for the study was obtained via historical databases of both atmospheric variables and the leakage current measured in over a period of one year in a 220 -kV potential transformer insulator.
