5|$|The Second World War {{that broke}} out in 1939 {{consumed}} {{the attention of a}} new generation. Across most of the theatres of conflict, the participants attempted to respect the memorials to World War I. After the Second World War there was no <b>equivalent</b> <b>mass</b> construction of memorials to the war dead; instead, often local World War I memorials were adapted for use instead: additional names might be inscribed to the existing lists. In some cases, this resulted in memorials losing their exclusive focus on World War I. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Washington, for example, was expanded in 1950s to include corpses from the Second World War and Korea War, broadening the memorial's remit to commemorate most modern wars. In other cases, such as the Australian War Memorial, begun in the inter-war years but only opened in 1941, an essentially new memorial was formed to honour the multiple conflicts.|$|E

40|$|A shaking force {{balanced}} mechanism is a mechanism {{that does not}} exert dynamic re-action forces to its base and to its surrounding for any motion. For mobile mechanisms such as exoskeletons, humanoid robots, drones, and anthropomorphic hands force balance is an important property for, among others, their dynamic behavior, stability, safety, control, and low energy consumption. For the design of {{force balanced}} mechanisms with multiple closed loops {{it can be a}} significant challenge to obtain the balance conditions, especially when the mechanism consists of closed loops that depend on other closed loops. In this paper it is shown how with <b>mass</b> <b>equivalent</b> modeling the force balance conditions can be derived of a complex multi-degree-of-freedom parallel mechanism with multiple closed loops of which one or more depend on other closed loops. It is shown how such a mechanism can be divided in <b>mass</b> <b>equivalent</b> linkages such as <b>mass</b> <b>equivalent</b> dyads and <b>mass</b> <b>equivalent</b> triads for which each can be analyzed individually with principal vectors and linear momentum equations...|$|R
500|$|Paraceratherium {{is one of}} {{the largest}} known land mammals that have ever existed, but its exact size is unclear because of the lack of {{complete}} specimens. Early estimates of [...] are now considered exaggerated; it may have been in the range of [...] at maximum, and as low as [...] on average. Calculations have mainly been based on fossils of P. transouralicum because this species is known from the most complete remains. Estimates have been based on skull, teeth, and limb bone measurements, but the known bone elements are represented by individuals of different sizes, so all skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations, resulting in several weight ranges. Its total body length was estimated as [...] from front to back by Granger and Gregory in 1936, and [...] by Vera Gromova in 1959, but the former estimate is now considered exaggerated. The weight of Paraceratherium was similar to that of some extinct proboscideans, with the largest complete skeleton known belonging to the steppe mammoth (Mammuthus trogontherii). In spite of the roughly <b>equivalent</b> <b>mass,</b> Paraceratherium may have been taller than any proboscidean. Its shoulder height was estimated as [...] at the shoulders by Granger and Gregory, but [...] by Gregory S. Paul in 1997. The neck was estimated at [...] long by Michael P. Taylor and Mathew J.

2500|$|The blueshift of {{a falling}} photon {{can be found}} by {{assuming}} it has an <b>equivalent</b> <b>mass</b> based on its frequency [...] (where h is Planck's constant) along with , a result of special relativity. Such simple derivations {{ignore the fact that}} in general relativity the experiment compares clock rates, rather than energies. In other words, the [...] "higher energy" [...] of the photon after it falls can be equivalently ascribed to the slower running of clocks deeper in the gravitational potential well. To fully validate general relativity, it is important to also show that the rate of arrival of the photons is greater than the rate at which they are emitted. A very accurate gravitational redshift experiment, which deals with this issue, was performed in 1976, where a hydrogen maser clock on a rocket was launched to a height of 10,000km, and its rate compared with an identical clock on the ground. It tested the gravitational redshift to 0.007%.|$|E
