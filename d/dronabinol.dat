25|$|Cannabis use {{disorder}} {{is defined in}} the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a condition requiring treatment. Several drugs have been investigated {{in an attempt to}} ameliorate the symptoms of stopping cannabis use. Such drugs include bupropion, divalproex, nefazodone, lofexidine, and <b>dronabinol.</b> Of these, <b>dronabinol</b> has proven the most effective.|$|E
2500|$|An {{overdose}} of <b>dronabinol</b> usually presents with [...] lethargy, decreased motor coordination, slurred speech, and postural hypotension. [...] Non-fatal overdoses have occurred.|$|E
2500|$|Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) {{refers to}} a psychotropic {{cannabinoid}} (<b>dronabinol,</b> trade name Marinol is a synthetic form of THC, approved by the FDA) and is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis. [...] Its chemical name is [...] (−)-trans-Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol and the term THC is {{used to refer to}} isomers as well. The pharmaceutical formulation <b>dronabinol</b> is available by prescription in the U.S, Canada, Germany and New Zealand. The prescriptions Marinol and Sativex also include THC or its isomers as active ingredients.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dronabinol</b> is {{marketed as}} Marinol, a {{registered}} trademark of Solvay Pharmaceuticals. <b>Dronabinol</b> is also marketed, sold, and distributed by PAR Pharmaceutical Companies {{under the terms}} of a license and distribution agreement with SVC pharma LP, an affiliate of Rhodes Technologies. [...] <b>Dronabinol</b> is available as a prescription drug (under Marinol) in several countries including the United States, Germany, South Africa and Australia. In the United States, Marinol is a Schedule III drug, available by prescription, considered to be non-narcotic and to have a low risk of physical or mental dependence. Efforts to get cannabis rescheduled as analogous to Marinol have not succeeded thus far, though a 2002 petition has been accepted by the DEA. As a result of the rescheduling of Marinol from Schedule II to Schedule III, refills are now permitted for this substance. Marinol's U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for medical use has raised much controversy as to why natural THC is considered a schedule I drug.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dronabinol</b> is the INN for a pure isomer of THC, (−)-trans-Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol, {{which is}} the main isomer found in cannabis. [...] It is used to treat {{anorexia}} in people with HIV/AIDS {{as well as for}} refractory nausea and vomiting in people undergoing chemotherapy. [...] It is safe and effective for these uses.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Marinol was rescheduled from Schedule II to III of the Controlled Substances Act, {{reflecting}} {{a finding that}} THC had a potential for abuse {{less than that of}} cocaine and heroin. This rescheduling constituted part of the argument for a 2002 petition for removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, in which petitioner Jon Gettman noted, [...] "Cannabis is a natural source of <b>dronabinol</b> (THC), the ingredient of Marinol, a Schedule III drug. There are no grounds to schedule cannabis in a more restrictive schedule than Marinol".|$|E
2500|$|On October 18, 1985, the DEA {{issued a}} Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to {{transfer}} [...] "Synthetic <b>Dronabinol</b> in Sesame Oil and Encapsulated in Soft Gelatin Capsules" [...] — a pill form of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive component of cannabis, sold under {{the brand name}} Marinol — from Schedule I to Schedule II (DEA 50 FR 42186-87). The government issued its final rule rescheduling the drug on July 13, 1986 (DEA 51 FR 17476-78). The disparate treatment of cannabis and the expensive, patentable Marinol prompted reformers to question the DEA's consistency.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the main}} psychoactive {{constituent}} of Cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), {{the plant is}} known to contain more than 500 compounds, among them at least 113 cannabinoids; however, most of these [...] "minor" [...] cannabinoids are only produced in trace amounts. Besides THC, another cannabinoid produced in high concentrations by some plants is cannabidiol (CBD), which is not psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effect of THC in the nervous system. Differences in the chemical composition of Cannabis varieties may produce different effects in humans. Synthetic THC, called <b>dronabinol,</b> does not contain CBD, CBN, or other cannabinoids, {{which is one reason}} why its pharmacological effects may differ significantly from those of natural Cannabis preparations.|$|E
2500|$|On May 13, 1986, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) {{issued a}} Final Rule and Statement of Policy authorizing the [...] "Rescheduling of Synthetic <b>Dronabinol</b> in Sesame Oil and Encapsulated in Soft Gelatin Capsules From Schedule I to Schedule II" [...] (DEA 51 FR 17476-78). This {{permitted}} medical use of Marinol, albeit with the severe restrictions associated with Schedule II status. For instance, refills of Marinol prescriptions were not permitted. At its 10th meeting, on April 29, 1991, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, {{in accordance with}} article 2, paragraphs 5 and 6, of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, decided that Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (also referred to as Δ⁹-THC) and its stereochemical variants should be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of that Convention. This released Marinol from the restrictions imposed by Article 7 of the Convention (See also United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances).|$|E
2500|$|It {{takes over}} one hour for Marinol to reach full {{systemic}} effect, compared to seconds or minutes for smoked or vaporized cannabis. Some people accustomed to inhaling just enough cannabis smoke to manage symptoms have complained of too-intense intoxication from Marinol's predetermined dosages. Many people using Marinol {{have said that}} Marinol produces a more acute psychedelic effect than cannabis, {{and it has been}} speculated that this disparity {{can be explained by the}} moderating effect of the many non-THC cannabinoids present in cannabis. For that reason, alternative THC-containing medications based on botanical extracts of the cannabis plant such as nabiximols are being developed. Mark Kleiman, director of the Drug Policy Analysis Program at UCLA's School of Public Affairs said of Marinol, [...] "It wasn't any fun and made the user feel bad, so it could be approved without any fear that it would penetrate the recreational market, and then used as a club with which to beat back the advocates of whole cannabis as a medicine." [...] Mr. Kleiman's opinion notwithstanding, clinical trials comparing the use of cannabis extracts with Marinol in the treatment of cancer cachexia have demonstrated equal efficacy and well-being among subjects in the two treatment arms. United States federal law currently registers <b>dronabinol</b> as a Schedule III controlled substance, but all other cannabinoids remain Schedule I, except synthetics like nabilone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dronabinol</b> was rescheduled in 1994 from annex I to annex II of the Narcotics Law (Betäubungsmittelgesetz) {{in order}} to ease research; in 1998 <b>dronabinol</b> was rescheduled from annex II to annex III and since then has been {{available}} by prescription. whereas Δ9-THC is still listed in annex I. Manufacturing instructions for <b>dronabinol</b> containing compendial formulations are described in the Neues Rezeptur-Formularium.|$|E
50|$|The abuse {{liability}} of <b>dronabinol</b> (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) {{is expected to}} remain very low so long as cannabis continues to be readily available. The Committee considered that the abuse {{liability of}} <b>dronabinol</b> does not constitute a substantial risk to public health and society. In accordance with the established scheduling criteria, the Committee considered that <b>dronabinol</b> should be rescheduled to schedule IV of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.|$|E

50|$|In the U.S., the FDA has {{approved}} two oral cannabinoids {{for use as}} medicine: <b>dronabinol</b> and nabilone. <b>Dronabinol,</b> synthetic THC, is listed as Schedule III, meaning it has some potential for dependence. Nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, is Schedule II, indicating high potential for side effects and addiction. Both received approval {{for sale in the}} U.S. in 1985. Nabiximols, an oromucosal spray derived from two strains of Cannabis sativa and containing THC and CBD, is not approved in the U.S., but is approved in several European countries, Canada, and New Zealand as of 2013.|$|E
50|$|Nabilone {{entered the}} clinic in 1981 as an {{antiemetic}}. Synthetic THC (marinol, <b>dronabinol)</b> entered the clinic in 1985 as an antiemetic {{and again in}} 1991 as an appetite stimulant.|$|E

50|$|Nabitan (Nabutam, Benzopyranoperidine, SP-106, Abbott 40656) is a {{synthetic}} cannabinoid analog of <b>dronabinol</b> (Marinol). It exhibits antiemetic and analgesic effects, most likely by binding to and activating the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, and reduced intraocular pressure in animal tests, making it potentially {{useful in the}} treatment of glaucoma.|$|E
5000|$|Schedule III {{includes}} barbiturate {{products with}} fast or average effects, {{which have been}} the object of serious abuse even though useful therapeutically, strongly sedative benzodiazepines like flunitrazepam and some analgesics like buprenorphine. The only ATS in this category is cathine. <b>Dronabinol,</b> which is a THC isomer, is also included.|$|E
50|$|Cannabis {{preparations}} {{have been}} known as therapeutic agents against various diseases for millennia. The psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) {{was found to be}} the principal mediator of the effects of cannabis. Synthetic THC is prescribed today, under the INN <b>dronabinol</b> or the brand name Marinol, to treat vomiting and for enhancement of appetite, mainly in AIDS patients.|$|E
5000|$|Cannabinoid {{medicines}} {{are available}} in pill form (<b>dronabinol</b> and nabilone) and liquid extracts formulated into an oromucosal spray (nabiximols). Oral preparations are [...] "problematic due to the uptake of cannabinoids into fatty tissue, from which they are released slowly, and the significant first-pass liver metabolism, which breaks down Δ9THC and contributes further to the variability of plasma concentrations".|$|E
5000|$|Since 2003, the country's {{pharmacies}} distribute medicinal cannabis (pharmaceutical form of {{the natural}} plant) by prescription, {{in addition to other}} drugs containing cannabinoids (<b>dronabinol,</b> Sativex). Since 2003 it is a legal prescription drug known as [...] "", available at the pharmacy. There are five different types of medical cannabis in the Netherlands; the fifth contains Cannabidiol and almost no Tetrahydrocannabinol.|$|E
5000|$|Nabitan has the {{advantage}} of being water-soluble, unlike most cannabinoid derivatives, and was researched for potential use as an analgesic or sedative, although it was never developed for clinical use and is not currently used in medicine, as <b>dronabinol</b> or nabilone were felt to be more useful. However it is sometimes used in research into the potential therapeutic applications of cannabinoids.|$|E
5000|$|A 2007 {{review of}} the history of medical {{cannabis}} said cannabinoids showed potential therapeutic value in treating Tourette syndrome (TS). A 2005 review said that controlled research on treating TS with <b>dronabinol</b> showed the patients taking the pill had a beneficial response without serious adverse effects; a 2000 review said other studies had shown that cannabis [...] "has no effects on tics and increases the individuals inner tension".|$|E
50|$|Columbia University, in {{collaboration}} with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), is undertaking a clinical trial that looks at the effects of combined medication on cannabis dependency, to see if lofexidine in combination with <b>dronabinol</b> is superior to placebo in achieving abstinence, reducing cannabis use and reducing withdrawal in cannabis-dependent patients seeking treatment for their marijuana use. Men and {{women between the ages of}} 18-60 who met DSM-IV criteria for current marijuana dependence were enrolled in a 12-week trial that started in January 2010.|$|E
5000|$|According to Medical Uses of Marijuana (Cannabis sativa), {{patients}} with HIV {{reported that the}} drug reduced mixed neuropathic pain more significantly in comparison to other placebo drugs. They addressed {{that there was a}} minimum of 30% pain reduction when they were under smoked medical marijuana treatment. Furthermore, under the same type of treatment, most of the {{patients with}} multiple sclerosis showed dramatic improvements on their symptoms. [...] After the treatment, their handwriting was much clearer and head tremor pain was less than the samples taken before the treatment. In addition, many patients that associated with chronic pain, multiple sclerosis were also under marijuana oral preparation treatment. Patients treated with <b>dronabinol,</b> a synthetic THC, reported that there was a 50% pain reduction compared to 30% that was experienced when given the placebo. Furthermore, cancer treatment involving chemotherapy also agreed that <b>dronabinol</b> had significant benefits on delaying nausea and vomiting for patients. [...] However, medical marijuana treatments are not for everyone and it may cause adverse side effects for others. Overall, the potential long-term side effects of medical marijuana are not yet fully classified. As a result, further studies must carry out to fully understand the benefits as well as adverse psychiatric and medical side effects of the drug.|$|E
