5000|$|Feline {{panleukopenia}} virus (FPV), {{also known}} as <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>enteritis,</b> feline parvoviral enteritis, feline distemper, feline ataxia, or cat plague, [...] is a viral infection affecting cats, both domesticated and wild feline species. It is caused by feline parvovirus, a close relative of both type 2 canine parvovirus and mink enteritis. Once contracted, it is highly contagious and can be fatal to the affected cat. The name panleukopenia comes from the low {{white blood cell count}} (leucocytes) exhibited by affected animals.|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{developing}} a living attenuated <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>enteritis</b> (panleucopaenia) vaccine, {{it was found that}} respiratory disease-infected cats newly inoculated with this vaccine spread vaccine virus to respiratory disease-infected in-contact controls. These in-contact controls were able to infect other cats with which they were placed in contact so that after five natural transmissions in this way and two oral administrations and subsequent re-isolations, reversion to virulence became evident. It is clear that before general release of a new living <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>enteritis</b> vaccine, there must be satisfactory evidence that concurrent infection will not affect the safety of the modified antigen...|$|E

40|$|<b>Feline</b> <b>infectious</b> {{peritonitis}} is {{a lethal}} disease of felids caused by systemic infection with a feline coronavirus. Here, we report identification {{and analysis of}} the feline homologue to the human lectin DC-SIGN and show that it is a coreceptor for virulent strains of serotype 1 and serotype 2 <b>feline</b> coronaviruses. <b>Feline</b> <b>infectious</b> peritonitis (FIP) is a disease of felids that has a spectrum of pathological outcomes, all of which are lethal (18). The causative agent of FIP is a feline coronavirus (FCoV) designated <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> peritonitis virus (FIPV) which infects immune cells, leading to a systemic infection (25, 28). FCoVs are classified as group 1 a coronaviruses and circu-late as two distinct serotypes (FCoV- 1 and FCoV- 2) based on the sequences of their S genes (22). FCoV- 1 is the more prev-alent serotype currently in circulation and therefore represents the dominant cause of clinical FIP (80 % to 90 %).

40|$|This {{cumulative}} {{doctoral thesis}} contains 4 publications. Aim {{of the first}} study was to evaluate the influence of feline interferon-ω on the survival time {{and quality of life}} of cats with <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> peritonitis. In this placebo-controlled doubleblind study, 37 cats suffering from <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> peritonitis were included. Inclusion criterion was a confirmed diagnosis of FIP. Cats were included from August 2004 to April 2006. They were treated randomly with either feline interferon-ω or placebo. Additionally, glucocorticoids, antibiotics, passive immunization, and symptomatic treatment were given. There was no statistically significant difference in survival time, quality of life, or any other clinical or laboratory parameter (including complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile) in cats treated with feline interferon-ω versus cats treated with placebo besides number of lymphocytes. The number of lymphocytes was significantly lower in cats treated with feline interferon-ω. The cats survived between 3 and 200 days. One cat treated with feline interferon-ω lived for 200 days. This cat showed no symptoms for approximately 6 months, but had to be euthanized after 200 days due to a recurrence of FIP following secondary upper respiratory tract infection. The aim of the second prospective study was to evaluate if clinical symptoms or laboratory parameters correlate with the survival time and to evaluate median survival time after diagnosis. In this study, 43 cats with confirmed <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> peritonitis were included between August 2004 and April 2006. Median survival time was 8 days and mean survival time was 15 days after diagnosis. Karnofsky´s score, number of thrombocytes, number of lymphocytes, concentration of bilirubin in serum, and the amount of effusion significantly correlated with survival time. A low Karnofsky´s score, low numbers of thrombocytes and lymphocytes, a high concentration of bilirubin, and a high amount of effusion were associated with a poor rognosis. The third publication is a review about treatment of cats with <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> peritonitis summarizing all published reports and studies in the literature.

40|$|Abstract: A male ferret, {{which was}} {{purchased}} from abroad at 9 months of age, had shown significant weight loss starting at 13 months of age. The ferret subsequently showed decreasing motor activity and recumbency and was euthanized at 14 months of age. At necropsy, a white, quail egg-sized mass {{was found in}} the mesentery. Histopathologically, multifocal granulomas consisting of necrotic foci, macrophages, fibroblasts and plentiful fibrous connective tissues were observed in the mesenteric mass. Surrounding the granulomas, inflammatory cell infiltration consisting of neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasmacytes was observed diffusely and significantly. Immunohistochemistry revealed small numbers of macrophages around necrotic foci that were positively stained for antimouse feline coronavirus. Electron microscopically, the cytoplasm of the macrophages contained viral particles, which were identified as coronavirus. The histopathological features in this ferret were similar to those in cats with <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> peritonitis (FIP). This was the first case in ferrets in Japan.

40|$|Abstract. Platelet {{function}} was evaluated in six specific-pathogen-free cats {{prior to and}} following intraperito-neal inoculation with <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> peritonitis virus (FIPV). By 4 days post-inoculation, platelet samples from five of six cats responded with irreversible platelet aggregation to threshold concentrations of adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This was accompanied by enhanced platelet 14 C-~er~tonin release (> 10 %) in two cats. Compared to one of six baseline samples, five of five post-inoculation samples exhibited microaggregate for-mation in response to 20 pM epinephrine. Enhanced platelet 14 C-serotonin release did not accompany these responses. Enhanced platelet responses to ADP and epinephrine were also observed on day 1 1 post-inoculation and day 16 (when one cat died) or 2 1 (the end of the study). Platelet 14 C-~er~tonin release in response to 20 pM epinephrine increased markedly in three of five cats on day 2 1. Enhanced collagen-induced platelet responses were not demonstrated. Although the mechanism for the enhanced platelet responses observed on day 4 was unknown, a direct effect of the virus on platelets, mononuclear inflammatory cells, and endothelial cells must be considered.

40|$|Antibody-dependent {{enhancement}} of virus infection {{is a process}} whereby virus-antibody complexes initiate infection of cells via Fc receptor-mediated endocytosis. We sought to investigate antibody-dependent enhance-ment of <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> peritonitis virus infection of primary feline peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Enhancement of infection was assessed, after indirect immunofluorescent-antibody labelling of infected cells, by determining the ratio {{between the number of}} cells infected in the presence and absence of virus-specific antibody. Infection enhancement was initially demonstrated by using heat-inactivated, virus-specific feline antiserum. Functional compatibility between murine immunoglobulin molecules and feline Fc receptors was demonstrated by using murine anti-sheep erythrocyte serum and an antibody-coated sheep erythrocyte phagocytosis assay. Thirty-seven murine monoclonal antibodies specific for the nucleocapsid, membrane, or spike proteins of <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> peritonitis virus or transmissible gastroenteritis virus were assayed for their ability to enhance the infectivity of <b>feline</b> <b>infectious</b> peritonitis virus.
