A second piece of CFRP sheet with the same dimensions as the first was placed immediately to the right of the first sheet without overlapping; this was followed by placement of a smaller piece of CFRP sheet to the right of the previously placed sheet. Similarly, fabric pieces of the same dimensions were positioned on the opposite face of the beam to complete the strengthening process. The strengthening patterns <b>for</b> <b>test</b> 2 (Figure  1 b) and test 3 (Figure  1 c) were similar to that <b>for</b> <b>test</b> 1, with the exception that the fiber orientation of the CFRP sheets <b>for</b> <b>test</b> 2 was opposite to that <b>for</b> <b>test</b> 1 (i.e., − 45 ° <b>for</b> <b>test</b> 2 and 45 ° <b>for</b> <b>test</b> 1).|$|R

The real-time simulation capability of the hardware emulator significantly improves time required <b>for</b> <b>test</b> generation time. The VLSI hardware emulator implements a parallel algorithm <b>for</b> <b>test</b> pattern generation based on neural networks. Test generation is achieved by mapping a circuit into its equivalent VLSI array test generation model emulating this test generation algorithm.

Combining our VLSI programmable cells with shift register cells for register modeling and scan insertion, a complete digital system can be modeled <b>for</b> <b>test</b> generation in a VLSI emulator.
