40|$|The {{implementation}} of In-Vehicle Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) {{is becoming a}} common occurrence in modern vehicles. Automobile manufacturers are releasing vehicles with many forms of sophisticated technologies that remove much of the responsibility of controlling an automobile from the driver. These In-Vehicle Intelligent Transport Systems have stemmed from a genuine need in regards to road safety, however there are advantages and disadvantages associated with ITS. Each different form of technology has its own inherent compromises in relation to road safety, driver behaviour and driver comfort. This thesis outlines the benefits and detrimental effects associated with current In-Vehicle Intelligent Transport Systems and details the development and user interface testing of an adaptive <b>brake</b> <b>light.</b> The adaptive brakelight concept aims to provide drivers with the advantages of an In-Vehicle ITS whilst removing the disadvantages. The technology will help drivers judge the braking pattern of the car in front, thus allowing them to react appropriately and potentially reducing the occurrence of rear-end crashes. The adaptive <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> concept was tested in comparison to a standard <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> and BMW inspired <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> {{in a series of}} user interface tests. The adaptive <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> was shown overall to be an improved method of displaying the varying levels of deceleration of a lead vehicle. Whilst different age and gender groups responded differently to the adaptive <b>brake</b> <b>light,</b> it was shown to be of benefit to the majority and the most at risk groups responded positively to the adaptive <b>brake</b> <b>light.</b> This research shows that an adaptive <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> can provide a benefit in regards to road safety when compared to a standard <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> interface. It is hoped that further development of variable <b>brake</b> <b>lights</b> will result from this research and possibly lead to the {{implementation of}} the technology to automobiles and other forms of transport...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the very}} {{powerful}} regenerative braking is active the <b>brake</b> <b>lights</b> are not illuminated. This can be disconcerting for other drivers {{who may not}} notice the van slowing significant {{without the help of}} the <b>brake</b> <b>lights.</b> The manual states that with a full blown PSA service terminal, <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> operation during regenerative braking can be set to [...] "on" [...] though, while it is set to [...] "off" [...] by default.|$|R
40|$|Rear-end {{collisions}} {{comprise a}} large proportion of all vehicle crashes. A variant of the standard centre high mounted stop light (CHMSL) that flashes under conditions of heavy braking was developed to reduce the incidence and severity of rear-end collisions. The developer of the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light</b> commissioned MUARC to conduct a driving simulator evaluation of the effectiveness of the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light.</b> Forty-two participants completed a series of simulator drives that were designed to examine whether participants’ braking performance under certain conditions was more effective in response to a heavily braking vehicle fitted with the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light</b> compared with a heavily braking vehicle fitted with a standard CHMSL. Among other things, it was found that, relative to the CHMSL condition, participants reacted by braking in a shorter time at an intermediate headway to the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light,</b> and <b>braked</b> harder in response to the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light</b> at both a near and intermediate headway. The results suggest that the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light</b> is a device that, through widespread use, may contribute to a reduction in the incidence and severity of rear-end collisions...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} review is presented {{of the effects}} of one or two extra <b>brake</b> <b>lights</b> in or on cars {{at the height of the}} rear window. The greatest care should be exercised in the evaluation of the estimated effect. There are some indications that the effect can be marginal or even negative. There are no real arguments to forbid the use of such <b>brake</b> <b>lights,</b> but also no real arguments to promote the use of them. In the united states one high mounted <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> is mandatory from 1986. In the federal republic of germany two <b>brake</b> <b>lights</b> are permitted. Further research is recommended...|$|R

Sergeant Darisse then began following Vasquez. Vasquez eventually slowed his car when approaching a slower-moving vehicle, and Sergeant Darisse observed the car's right rear <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> hadn't turned on. Sergeant Darisse {{believed that it was}} a violation of North Carolina traffic law to drive a vehicle with a broken <b>brake</b> <b>light,</b> so he activated his blue lights and stopped Vasquez (observing that as he did so, the right <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> [...] "flickered on"). Sergeant Darisse informed Vasquez and Heien that he had stopped them for a broken <b>brake</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the distributions of driver eye fixations when follow-ing other vehicles. The {{aim was to}} describe {{the areas of the}} forward field of view that are most frequently fixated. Such information is important for select-ing optimal locations for automobile <b>brake</b> lights: <b>Brake</b> <b>lights</b> that are closer to eye fixations are likely to result in shorter driver reaction times than <b>brake</b> <b>lights</b> farther away from the fixations. A head-mounted, corneal-reflection device was used to monitor eye fixations. The data were collected during daylight hours in slow-moving urban traffic. A total of 3, 600 eye fixations were ana-lyzed for three different lead cars. The results indicate that, under the condi-tions of this study, the eye fixations tended to concentrate on the rear-window of the lead car and not in the neighborhood of the standard low-mounted <b>brake</b> <b>lights.</b> The results provide a possible behavioral explanation for the accident reductions found with high-mounted <b>brake</b> <b>lights</b> in previous field studies. Furthermore, high-mounted <b>brake</b> <b>lights</b> located {{at the edges of the}} vehicle might be even closer to eye fixations than a center-high-mounted <b>brake</b> <b>light.</b> Three recent accident studies have found that the frequency of certain types of rear-end collisions is reduced by about one half by using a single, center-high-mounted brake-light repeater (Malone, Kirkpatrick, Kohl, &...|$|R
40|$|Early in 1996, the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research first {{performed}} {{an inventory of}} the presence of a third <b>brake</b> <b>light.</b> This so-called zero measurement is necessary to enable an evaluation of the potential effect of the third <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> with future analyses of rear-end collisions. In recent years, there has been question of an extremely marked rise in this collision type. In combination with an inventory conducted for another study, the number of third <b>brake</b> <b>lights</b> fitted to passenger cars were counted at ten locations spread throughout the Netherlands. Three location types are distinguished here: (1) roads inside built-up areas; (2) 80 km/hour roads; and (3) the exit and entry ramps of motorways. All locations represented intersections controlled by traffic lights. The result of the measurements was that 10 % of passenger cars registered in traffic overall were equipped with a third <b>brake</b> <b>light.</b> This percentage increased if the vehicles' year of manufacture was 1994 or above (1994 : 14 %, 1995 : 28 %). Only 5 % of those cars manufactured before 1994 were registered as having a third <b>brake</b> <b>light.</b> In over half the cases, the third <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> was fitted to the lower edge of the rear window, and over 50 % of these lights were longitudinal in shape...|$|R
