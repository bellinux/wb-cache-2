5|$|After leaving school, Mühe was {{employed}} as a construction worker and a border <b>guard</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Berlin Wall. He then turned to acting, and from the late 1970s into the 1980s appeared in numerous plays, becoming a star of the Deutsches Theater in East Berlin. He was active in politics and denounced Communist rule in East Germany in a memorable address at the Alexanderplatz demonstration on 4 November 1989 shortly before {{the fall of the}} Berlin Wall. After German reunification he continued to appear in a large number of films, television programmes and theatre productions. In Germany he was particularly known for playing the lead role of Dr. Robert Kolmaar in the long-running forensic crime series Der letzte Zeuge (The Last Witness, 1998–2007).|$|E
5|$|Edwards {{was born}} in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of local {{merchant}} William Edwards, and Lucia Ransom. He graduated last in his class from the United States Military Academy in 1883. Upon his graduation from West Point, Edwards was appointed a second lieutenant in the Infantry Branch, serving with the 23rd Infantry Regiment. For {{the next several years}} Edwards served at various posts, including Fort Union, Fort Porter, Cleveland, Ohio (commanding the <b>guard</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tomb of President Garfield), and Fort Davis. While stationed at Fort Porter he met Bessie Rochester Porter, {{a member of the family}} that included Peter Buell Porter, for whom the fort was named, and they were married in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth grew camellias {{in every}} one of her gardens, and before her flag-draped coffin was taken from Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an {{arrangement}} of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top. An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as she lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood <b>guard</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respect—an honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.|$|E

5|$|In the 21stcentury, {{tourism is}} the Tower's primary role, the {{remaining}} routine military activities, under the Royal Logistic Corps, having wound {{down in the}} latter half of the 20th century and moved out of the castle. However, the Tower is still home to the ceremonial regimental headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, and the museum dedicated to it and its predecessor, the Royal Fusiliers. Also, a detachment of the unit providing the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace still mounts a <b>guard</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tower, and with the Yeomen Warders, takes part in the Ceremony of the Keys each day. On several occasions through the year gun salutes are fired from the Tower by the Honourable Artillery Company, these consist of 62 rounds for royal occasions, and 41 on other occasions.|$|E
5|$|Initially part of {{the house}} <b>guard</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> royal residences for Louis XVI, Klein left the {{military}} in 1787. During the French Revolution, he enlisted and rose rapidly from a lieutenant to a brigadier general; he participated in the French invasion of southwestern Germany in 1796, and was {{part of the}} Army of the Danube in 1799. His cavalry played critical roles in the battles of Austerlitz and Jena and Auerstadt. Following the Prussian campaign, he retired from active service, entered politics, and performed administrative duties in Paris.|$|E

Initially signed up at the Centre for Instruction of Special Troops (CITE) in Cochabamba, he was sent into the Fourth Ingavi Cavalry Regiment and stationed at the army headquarters in the Bolivian capital La Paz. These two years were one of Bolivia's politically most unstable periods, with five presidents and two military coups, led by General Juan Pereda and General David Padilla respectively; under the latter's regime, Morales was stationed as a <b>guard</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Palacio Quemado (Presidential Palace).|$|E

5|$|Rosenberg {{was granted}} {{a room in the}} palace to use for fortune telling, which the king made sure was stocked with alcohol, as they enjoyed {{drinking}} together. In late January, the king appointed Rosenberg as a customs appraiser in Honolulu, although the appointment was controversial; by mid-February he was fired by the head of customs. One month later, Rosenberg was reappointed by order of the king and the following month the head of customs resigned. Archibald Scott Cleghorn, the king's brother-in-law, was appointed as the new head of customs. Between March and May 1887, Rosenberg was paid $300, ostensibly for working as a <b>guard</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Customs Office, although it was alleged that Rosenberg's position was a sinecure.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} furrier, Mühe {{was born}} on 20 June 1953 in Grimma, Saxony, in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). After leaving school he trained as a {{construction}} worker, then did compulsory military service in the Nationale Volksarmee (National People's Army) as a border <b>guard</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Berlin Wall. He was relieved of duty after contracting stomach ulcers; a number of commentators have {{said that this was}} due to stress, and also suggested that it marked the beginnings of the stomach cancer that would eventually lead to his death.|$|E

In a television channel, Mr. A challenges the police that he will steal an ancient warrior sword. In response, Dixit, Bose, and Khan enforce a strict <b>guard</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> location of the sword. At night, Mr. A meets a doppelgänger {{in the room that}} holds the sword.

5|$|Haynes' father {{attended}} the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 {{where he learned}} of a school that would fit his son's interests. Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and enrolled in the Worcester Technical Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in September 1878. The school was revolutionary for its time, combining technical training with a classical liberal arts education. Although he easily passed the difficult entrance exam, he {{found that he was}} ill-prepared for some of his college courses, and he struggled with mathematics. To earn an income while away from home, he worked as a custodian and night <b>guard</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> local public library. He cleaned the building overnight and used his spare time to read books and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with no other option, he lived in the library for several months. He could not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in New England.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to see the}} Shooter, despite Spender's objections. Mulder {{wants to}} give the Shooter {{immunity}} in exchange for testimony, which the Shooter refuses. Gibson proves his abilities {{to a group of}} clinicians while Scully and Fowley watch. The <b>guard</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> prison hands the Shooter a flattened Morley cigarette box that says he's a dead man. Scully visits the Lone Gunmen, wanting them to analyze the data from Gibson. She asks them who Diana is, and they tell her she worked closely with Mulder when he discovered the X-Files. The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots them talking. Scully and Mulder present to Skinner on Gibson, who displays extraordinary brain activities. Mulder believes that Gibson is the key to everything in the X-Files, and wants to make a deal with the Shooter. Diana and Skinner think this may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed down if things go wrong, but Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E
