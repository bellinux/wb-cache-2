5|$|In the hippocampus, ApoER2 <b>is</b> <b>complexed</b> <b>with</b> NMDA receptors {{through the}} PSD-95 adapter protein. When reelin binds ApoER2, it initiates {{tyrosine}} phosphorylation of NMDA receptors. This occurs through Dab-1 activation of Src family kinases, {{which have been}} shown {{to play a role in}} regulating synaptic plasticity. VLDLR also acts as a receptor coupled to ApoER2 as it does during development, but its role is not well understood. ApoER2 plays a more important role in this process, most likely due to its ability to bind the PSD-95 adapter protein through the 59 amino acid insert on its cytoplasmic tail. Studies with mice have shown that knocking out ApoER2 or just the alternatively spliced exon 19 causes a much greater impairment of LTP than knocking out VLDLR.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{structure}} in subdomain 2 {{that is called}} the “D-loop” because it binds with DNase I, it is located between the His40 and Gly48 residues. It has {{the appearance of a}} disorderly element in the majority of crystals, but it looks like a β-sheet when it <b>is</b> <b>complexed</b> <b>with</b> DNase I. Domínguez “et al.” suggest that the key event in polymerization is probably the propagation of a conformational change from the centre of the bond with the nucleotide to this domain, which changes from a loop to a spiral. [...] However, this hypothesis has been refuted by other studies.|$|E

2500|$|Caffeine {{in plants}} {{acts as a}} natural pesticide: it can paralyze and kill {{predator}} insects feeding on the plant. High caffeine levels are found in coffee seedlings when they are developing foliage and lack mechanical protection. In addition, high caffeine levels {{are found in the}} surrounding soil of coffee seedlings, which inhibits seed germination of nearby coffee seedlings, thus giving seedlings with the highest caffeine levels fewer competitors for existing resources for survival. [...] Caffeine is stored in tea leaves in two places. Firstly, in the cell vacuoles where it <b>is</b> <b>complexed</b> <b>with</b> polyphenols. This caffeine probably is released into the mouth parts of insects, to discourage herbivory. Secondly, around the vascular bundles, where it probably inhibits pathogenic fungi from entering and colonizing the vascular bundles. Caffeine in nectar may improve the reproductive success of the pollen producing plants by enhancing the reward memory of pollinators such as honeybees.|$|E

As a consequence, three intracellular signaling pathways are initiated, the MAP kinase pathway, the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and the JAK-STAT pathway.|$|E

Binding of hormone to GR causes a conformational change in the complex, which results in exchange of FKBP51 for FKBP52 (52). FKBP52 in turn binds the dynein (dyn) motor protein that attaches to the cytoskeleton and transports the GR complex into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the complex disassembles releasing GR, which dimerizes and binds to DNA where it facilitates transcription of DNA into mRNA.|$|E
