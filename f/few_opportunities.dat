5|$|Bradman rotated the two glovemen {{during the}} tour, and Saggers played in 17 of the 31 {{first-class}} matches, taking 23 catches and 20 stumpings.

New South Wales went on to claim a hat-trick of Sheffield Shield titles.|$|E

The poor quality of officer training in the US Navy became visible after the Somers Affair, an alleged mutiny aboard the training ship USS Somers in 1842, and the subsequent execution of midshipman Philip Spencer. Spencer had gained his post aboard the Somers via the influence of his father, United States Secretary of War John C. Spencer.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study clarifies opinion of 32 European volunteer youth leaders on concepts of competence, <b>fewer</b> <b>opportunities</b> and enlargement strategies on competence of <b>fewer</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Leaders underline main competencies as follows: tongue, languages, mathematical, digital, learning, social, entrepreneurship, cultural. Key competences are those which all individuals need for personal fulfillment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment (Figel, 2007). The key competences are all considered equally important, because {{each of them}} can contribute to a successful life in a knowledge society. According to leader, <b>fewer</b> <b>opportunities</b> mean; obstacles can prevent such young people from having access to education, to mobility, to participation. All leaders agree with the non-formal education which is base for development of competence of <b>fewer</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Non-formal education {{may be one of}} them, especially – but not solely – for young people with <b>fewer</b> <b>opportunities</b> (Strenner, 2006). Leaders have lack of knowledge on dimension of non-formal learning for <b>fewer</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Future studies should be conduct on approved techniques and strategies of development of competence of <b>fewer</b> <b>opportunities</b> young people.

5|$|During the tour, Saggers had <b>few</b> <b>opportunities</b> {{with the}} bat, {{generally}} batting between No. 8 and No. 10,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included {{the likes of}} Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, who were all capable batsmen. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level. As a result, many of the bowlers batted before he did. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions, Saggers only had 12 innings in his 17 first-class fixtures and was not out three times after his remaining partners had been dismissed.|$|E

Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, including one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level. As Australia often won by an innings, and often declared in the first innings, Tallon only had 13 innings in his 14 first-class fixtures and was not out two times as {{he ran out of}} partners.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{graduated}} from Harvard Law School in 1896 {{at the age}} of 24. He returned to Albany to live with his mother and aunt, and started work for the law firm in which an uncle, Matthew Hale, was a partner. Hale's unexpected death a few months later obliged Hand to move to a new firm, but by 1899, he had become a partner. He had difficulty attracting his own clients, however, and found the work trivial and dull. Much of his time was spent researching and writing briefs, with <b>few</b> <b>opportunities</b> for the appellate work he preferred. His early courtroom appearances, when they came, were frequently difficult, sapping his fragile self-confidence. He began to fear that he lacked the ability to think on his feet in court.|$|E

The open vaulted ceiling design of stations {{and the limited}} obstructions on platforms allow <b>few</b> <b>opportunities</b> to conceal criminal activity. Station platforms are built away from station walls to limit vandalism and provide for diffused lighting of the station from recessed lights. Metro's attempts to reduce crime, combined with how the station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind, has contributed to Metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the United States. There are nearly 6,000 video surveillance cameras used across the system to enhance security.|$|E
5|$|Pas de Calais, {{the closest}} point in {{continental}} Europe to Britain, was {{the location of}} launch sites for V-1 and V-2 rockets, then still under development. The Germans regarded it as the most likely initial landing zone, and accordingly made it the most heavily fortified region. It offered the Allies <b>few</b> <b>opportunities</b> for expansion, however, as the area is bounded by numerous rivers and canals, whereas landings on a broad front in Normandy would permit simultaneous threats against the port of Cherbourg, coastal ports further west in Brittany, and an overland attack towards Paris and eventually into Germany. Normandy was therefore chosen as the landing site. The most serious drawback of the Normandy coast—the lack of port facilities—would be overcome {{through the development of}} artificial harbours.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} gold fields, most took the route through the ports of Dyea and Skagway in Southeast Alaska. Here, the Klondikers could follow either the Chilkoot or the White Pass trails to the Yukon River and sail {{down to the}} Klondike. Each of them was {{required}} to bring a year's supply of food by the Canadian authorities {{in order to prevent}} starvation. In all, their equipment weighed close to a ton, which for most had to be carried in stages by themselves. Together with mountainous terrain and cold climate, this meant that those who persisted did not arrive until summer 1898. Once there, they found <b>few</b> <b>opportunities,</b> and many left disappointed.|$|E

5|$|When Chapman {{returned}} to England, {{he began to}} work for the Mackeson brewery based in Hythe, Kent, then owned by H & G Simonds; his residence in that county allowed him to qualify for Kent County Cricket Club. There were <b>few</b> <b>opportunities</b> for Chapman to appear in first-class cricket until he qualified. His cricket was mainly restricted to club level in 1923, with some further games for Berkshire. In addition, he played 12 first-class games for a variety of teams; he was selected for the Gentlemen v Players matches at Lord's and The Oval, scoring 83 in the latter game, and played in two trial matches for players on the verge of England selection, although no Tests were played that year. In total, he scored 615 first-class runs at 29.28.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Hamence earned {{selection}} for the match against Northamptonshire, batting at No. 4 and scoring 34; he partnered acting captain Hassett in {{a stand of}} 104 for the third wicket. He took 1/11 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings. In the second match before the Second Test, which was against Yorkshire, Hamence made 48 and six not out, and took a total of 1/17 as the game ended in a draw. He batted slowly and cautiously; Bradman gave him <b>few</b> <b>opportunities,</b> {{so he had to}} make the most of them. The first innings 48 was a determined performance on a sticky wicket that helped Australia to 249; Bradman felt that Hamence's grit was a notable factor in Australia managing to pass 200. Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener. This was enough for Brown to retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Australia went on to a crushing win by 409 runs but Brown made only 24 and 32.|$|E
5|$|Bradman rotated the two glovemen {{during the}} tour, and Tallon played in 14 of the 31 {{first-class}} matches, taking 29 catches and 14 stumpings. Tallon's catch of Len Hutton in the Fifth Test at The Oval {{was described as}} Wisden as {{the best of the}} year. He also took a difficult catch to remove George Emmett in the Third Test at Old Trafford, catching a ball that flew to his feet at yorker length. However, Tallon also had some mishaps, with finger injuries inflicted by failing to catch the ball correctly. Tallon had <b>few</b> <b>opportunities</b> with the bat, scoring 283 runs at a batting average of 25.72 in 13 first-class innings, including two fifties. During the Test, Tallon scored 112 runs at 28.00, including a 53 in the Second Test that saw Australia recover to a first innings of 350 after a middle-order slump had seen England take the upper hand. He took 12 catches in the Tests.|$|E

5|$|During the tour, Johnston had <b>few</b> <b>opportunities</b> {{with the}} bat, {{invariably}} batting at either No. 10 and No. 11 alongside Toshack, another tail-ender with little batting ability.N- Neither player ever passed 30 in their first-class career, {{and they were}} the only two Australians who failed to pass 50 during the tour. As Australia's other frontline bowlers were Miller, Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all of whom scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, Toshack and Johnston were rooted {{at the bottom of the}} batting order. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings many time due to their batting strength, Johnston only had 18 innings in his 21 first-class fixtures and scored 188 runs at 18.80, the third lowest average and aggregate. He scored 62 runs in the Tests at 20.66, including his highest first-class score of 29 in the Second Test at Lord’s.|$|E
5|$|Four {{sites were}} {{considered}} for the landings: Brittany, the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, and the Pas de Calais. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, {{it would have been}} possible for the Germans to cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected. With the Pas de Calais being the closest point in continental Europe to Britain, the Germans considered it to be the most likely initial landing zone, so it was the most heavily fortified region. But it offered <b>few</b> <b>opportunities</b> for expansion, as the area is bounded by numerous rivers and canals, whereas landings on a broad front in Normandy would permit simultaneous threats against the port of Cherbourg, coastal ports further west in Brittany, and an overland attack towards Paris and eventually into Germany. Normandy was hence chosen as the landing site. The most serious drawback of the Normandy coast—the lack of port facilities—would be overcome through the development of artificial Mulberry harbours. A series of specialised tanks, nicknamed Hobart's Funnies, were created to deal with conditions expected during the Normandy Campaign, such as scaling sea walls and providing close support on the beach.|$|E
5|$|Orbetello {{was erected}} in a spit between two inner bays {{of a big}} lagoon. Various {{fortified}} positions made it a strong defensive position: Porto Ercole at the east, San Stefano at the west, and the fort San Filippo on the Monte Argentario island, linked to the mainland by a narrow isthmus. In the end, the French army landed at Talamone, where Brézé left to the Prince a half-dozen of vessels and galleys to bombard the forts of the town. Meanwhile, he went to Porto San Stefano with 5 sailing ships and 4 galleys and bombarded the fort until it surrendered. After the loss of those positions, Don Carlo de la Gatta, the castillan of Orbetello, retreated to the hermitage of Cristo. The isthmus was occupied thanks to a battery mounted aboard the French galleys, and soon the lagoon was filled with armed boats gathered by Jean-Paul de Saumeur, Chevalier Paul. Don Carlo de la Gatta, supported by just 200 Spanish and Italian soldiers, had very <b>few</b> <b>opportunities</b> to resist without help. An early relief force of 35 boats and 5 escort galleys sent from Naples with munitions and supplies was beaten, so a major fleet action was expected.|$|E

30|$|It is {{critical}} {{to note that the}} declines in employment dynamics are concentrated in recessions. During recessions, lower demand leads to <b>fewer</b> <b>opportunities</b> that are more productive than the existing match. Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2013) show that a wage posting model can produce procyclical gross worker flows and job-to-job flows. However, it is less obvious why there would be a dramatic long-run downward trend in these measures. What is more plausible is the idea that in recessions, there may be <b>fewer</b> <b>opportunities</b> for productivity growth through reallocation across sectors of the economy. We think recent search and matching models that include on-the-job search, such as Michau (2013) and Miyamoto and Takahashi (2011), could be helpful frameworks for further understanding the declines we document.|$|R

5|$|The mounted {{police were}} {{established}} to be an armed force, primarily due to the perceived threat from the First Nations on the prairies. The police were initially equipped with the Snider-Enfield Carbine Mark III and the Snider-Enfield Short Rifle, but these were single-shot breechloaders, and inferior to the repeating weapons already being used by Indian groups in the United States. These were replaced with the Winchester Model 1876 repeating rifle from 1878 onwards, but the new guns proved quite delicate and did not perform effectively during the 1885 rebellion. In 1895, the force began to replace the ageing Winchesters with the Lee-Metford Magazine Carbine, but these weapons did not perform as well as hoped. The program was halted and instead the Lee-Enfield Magazine Rifle Mark I was introduced in 1902 as the standard police small arm. The very limited supplies of ammunition held by the force meant {{that the police had}} <b>few</b> <b>opportunities</b> to practice with their weapons, and as a result their marksmanship was typically quite poor.|$|E
5|$|Worthington's first {{match in}} charge was a 3–2 defeat away to AFC Wimbledon, in which Chris Smith scored twice, before Harry Pell scored the home team's {{winner in the}} 79th minute. York picked up their first point under Worthington after a 0–0 home draw with Rochdale, with both teams having <b>few</b> <b>opportunities</b> to score. Ipswich Town midfielder Josh Carson was signed on a one-month loan, while Bullock was loaned to Stockport County of the Conference Premier {{for the rest of}} the season. Carson made his debut in York's 2–0 home defeat to Port Vale, who scored in each half through Jennison Myrie-Williams and Lee Hughes. Former York striker Richard Cresswell, who became the club's record sale in 1999, was signed from Sheffield United on a one-month loan. He scored a penalty in the team's 2–1 defeat away to Torquay, a result that saw York drop into the second relegation spot. Sunderland midfielder Adam Reed was signed on a one-month loan, while Ible was released. Adam Reed made his debut as York drew 0–0 away to Bristol Rovers, in which the home team's goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall made a number of saves.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} {{section of the}} fort, similar actions were taking place, as the airborne troops raced to destroy or otherwise disable the fortifications housing artillery pieces. Objective No. 13 was a casemate housing multiple machine-guns whose arcs of fire covered {{the western side of}} the Fort; to destroy the casemate, the airborne troops used a flamethrower to force the Belgian soldiers manning the weapons to retreat, and then detonated shaped charges against the fortification to disable it. Another observation cupola fitted with machine-guns, Objective No. 19, was destroyed, but two further objectives, Nos. 15 and 16 were found to be dummy installations. Unexpected complications came from Objective No. 23, a retractable cupola housing two 75mm artillery pieces. It had been assumed that the weapons in this fortification could not stop the airborne assault, but this assumption was found to be false when the weapons opened fire, forcing the airborne troops in the area to go to cover. The rapid fire of the weapons led to air support being summoned, and a Stuka squadron bombed the cupola. Although the bombs did not destroy the cupola, the explosions did force the Belgians to retract it {{throughout the rest of the}} fighting. Any exterior entrances and exits located by the airborne troops were destroyed with explosives to seal the garrison inside the Fort, giving the garrison <b>few</b> <b>opportunities</b> to attempt a counter-attack. The airborne troops had achieved their initial objective of destroying or disabling the artillery pieces that the fort could have used to bombard the captured bridges, but they still faced a number of small cupolas and emplacements that had to be disabled. A number of these included anti-aircraft weapons and machine-guns.|$|E
