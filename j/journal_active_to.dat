25|$|Although he {{made use}} of his {{interests}} in natural history while teaching, {{it was not until}} 1894 that Huard had the chance to truly apply them, when he returned the Naturaliste Canadien, Provancher's monthly <b>journal,</b> <b>to</b> <b>active</b> publication. Although Provancher had hoped the new government would be willing to offer grants, Huard had to maintain the magazine alone until 1919 when the governments of Lomer Gouin and Louis-Alexandre Taschereau began to offer financial assistance. Under Huard, the magazine was more popular and less technical than Provancher's version, although it maintained an anti-evolution stance. The Naturaliste was printed practically without interruption until Huard's death. Huard also acquired part of Provancher's papers and his herbarium. Part of Provancher's last works would be published posthumously in the Naturaliste.|$|R

40|$|The {{large number}} of {{journals}} and the constant changes which are {{happening in the world}} of scholarly publishing make it difficult to identify a group of journals relevant to a specific scientific field, particularly when dealing with a sub-field such as mapping sciences, which is inter-linked with many other disciplines. In this research, we form the corpus of <b>active</b> <b>journals</b> relevant <b>to</b> the mapping sciences and present their distribution by country, language of publication and level of accessibility. A systematic review of different subject-specific and multidisciplinary databases (GEOPHOKA, Bibliographia Cartographica, VINITI, GeoRef, Scopus and Web of Science), library catalogues, publishers’ web sites, professional associations’ web sites and other web resources was carried out. By applying set of criteria, a corpus of <b>active</b> <b>journals</b> in the field of mapping sciences was defined: it consists of 105 selected journals. The corpus of mapping sciences journals is described in detail, and the ISSN for each printed and online journal, the publisher, country, URL, language of publication and data on free accessibility are given. The largest numbers of mapping sciences journals are published in Germany, the United States of America and Poland. There are 53 journals in English language, while 44 are in open access. The limitations related to a lack of transparency of data on mapping sciences journals are discussed, as are questions of terminology...|$|R

50|$|Widespread {{public access}} to the World Wide Web in the late 1990s and early 2000s fueled the open access movement, and {{prompted}} both the green open access way (self-archiving of non-open access journal articles) {{and the creation of}} open access journals (gold way). Conventional non-open access journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view charges. Some non-open access journals provide open access after an embargo period of 6-12 months or longer (see delayed open access <b>journals).</b> <b>Active</b> debate over the economics and reliability of various ways of providing open access continues among researchers, academics, librarians, university administrators, funding agencies, government officials, commercial publishers, editorial staff and society publishers, as open access gradually gains in acceptance.|$|R

30|$|As we have shown, the {{theoretical}} distribution of IAIs {{can be calculated}} by assessing periods of consecutive <b>active</b> <b>to</b> quiescent transitions and single quiescent <b>to</b> <b>active</b> transitions. It is also possible to derive the distribution of consecutive quiescent <b>to</b> <b>active</b> transitions. However, if a period of <b>active</b> <b>to</b> quiescent transitions (a period without firing) has a duration less than the average time difference between two spikes then this interval does not separate an avalanche into two. Therefore, the distributions of number and length of consecutive quiescent <b>to</b> <b>active</b> transitions does not describe the distributions of avalanche size and duration—these distributions can also contain periods of <b>active</b> <b>to</b> quiescent transitions within two or more periods of quiescent <b>to</b> <b>active</b> transitions. Note that a period of <b>active</b> <b>to</b> quiescent transitions having a length less than the average difference between consecutive spikes is not dependent {{on the number of}} <b>active</b> <b>to</b> quiescent transitions within the interval, as the length of each transition is drawn at random from an exponential distribution. It was therefore not possible for us to determine a theoretical distribution of avalanche size and duration using this approach.|$|R

METHODS. Human orbital adipose samples {{were obtained from}} individuals with <b>active</b> <b>TO</b> (n ¼ 12), inactive TO (n ¼ 21), and normal controls (n ¼ 21). Gene expression profiles were examined using microarray analysis and were compared between <b>active</b> and inactive <b>TO,</b> and between <b>active</b> <b>TO</b> and normal controls. Top ranked differentially expressed genes were validated by real-time RT-PCR in an additional eight <b>active</b> <b>TO,</b> 13 inactive TO, and 11 normal controls and correlated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and molecular pathways analysis. RESULTS. Seven hundred twenty-one probes (683 genes) and 806 probes (735 genes) were significantly differentially expressed in comparing <b>active</b> <b>to</b> inactive TO and in comparing <b>active</b> <b>TO</b> to healthy controls, respectively. All selected genes were confirmed to be differentially expressed by real-time RT-PCR. Multiple top ranked genes in <b>active</b> versus inactive <b>TO</b> comparison are overrepresented by immune and inflammatory response genes. They include defensins (DEFA 1, DEFA 1 B, DEFA 3), which were overexpressed by 3. 05 - to 4. 14 -fold and TIMD 4 by 4. 20 -fold. Markers for adipogenesis were overexpressed including SCD, FADS 1, and SCDP 1.

The definitive version is available at: [URL]. This article details the findings of research into the academic teaching staff experience of peer observation of their teaching practice. Peer observation is commonly used {{as a tool to}} enhance a teacher's continuing professional development. Research participants acknowledged its ability to help develop their teaching practice, but they also reported that it could operate superficially as a tick box exercise, that its outcomes were frequently decoupled from formal staff development processes, and that its purpose and usefulness therefore seemed unclear. This article argues that the presence of decoupling reinforces the need to account for structural factors that can interact with peer observation of teaching to ensure it is a meaningful exercise for all teaching staff. It concludes that the published academic literature is perhaps guilty of overplaying the role of personal choice and individual tutor characteristics when addressing the complex issue that is staff disengagement with peer observation of teaching. © The Author(s) 2011...|$|R
