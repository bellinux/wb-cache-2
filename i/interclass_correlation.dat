40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} {{pulmonary}} arterial hypertension on brain function are not understood, despite patients' frequent complaints of cognitive difficulties. Using clinical instruments normally administered during standard in-person assessment of neurocognitive function in adults, we assembled a battery of tests designed for administration over the telephone. The purpose was to improve patient participation, facilitate repeated test administration, and {{reduce the cost of}} research on the neuropsychological consequences of acute and chronic cardiorespiratory diseases. We undertook this study to validate telephone administration of the tests. Methods 23 adults with {{pulmonary arterial hypertension}} underwent neurocognitive assessment using both standard in-person and telephone test administration, and the results of the two methods compared using <b>interclass</b> <b>correlations.</b> Results For most of the tests in the battery, scores from the telephone assessment correlated strongly with those obtained by in-person administration of the same tests. <b>Interclass</b> <b>correlations</b> between 0. 5 and 0. 8 were observed for tests that assessed attention, memory, concentration/working memory, reasoning, and language/crystallized intelligence (p ≤ 0. 05 for each). <b>Interclass</b> <b>correlations</b> for the Hayling Sentence Completion test of executive function approached significance (p = 0. 09). All telephone tests were completed within one hour. Conclusion Administration of this neurocognitive test battery by telephone should facilitate assessment of neuropsychological deficits among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension living across broad geographical areas, and may be useful for monitoring changes in neurocognitive function in response to PAH-specific therapy or disease progression. </p...|$|R

Heart rate (beats·min- 1), respiratory rate (breaths·min- 1), step count, and energy expenditure results were collected for the Hexoskin. Step count and energy expenditure were collected for the Fitbit Flex. 49 adolescent participants performed a walking treadmill protocol at 1. 5 mph, 2. 5 mph, and 3. 5 mph for 3 minutes at each speed. 46 subjects returned to perform the same protocol a second time. 31 of the participants were used to determine reliability. Each trial required the participants to walk while wearing a Hexoskin shirt, a Fitbit Flex on their right wrist, a Polar T- 31 heart rate monitor, and to be monitored by an Applied Electrochemistry Moxus Metabolic System. Hexoskin heart rate correlation was inconsistent between the two protocols with some minutes/stages being highly related in one protocol and not in the other. A number of stages showed significant differences in the mean values. <b>Interclass</b> <b>correlation</b> was acceptable for half of the measurements compared Hexoskin respiration rate values were highly correlated for the every minute of the first two stages (1. 5 mph and 2. 5 mph) but showed variations between protocols in the final (3. 5 mph).

40|$|Introduction Whiplash-associated {{disorders}} (WAD) are {{a burden}} for both individuals and society. It is recommended to evaluate patients with WAD {{at risk of}} chronification to enhance rehabilitation and promote an early return to work. In patients with low back pain (LBP), functional capacity evaluation (FCE) contributes to clinical decisions regarding fitness-for-work. FCE should have demonstrated sufficient clinimetric properties. Reliability and safety of FCE for patients with WAD is unknown. Methods Thirty-two participants (11 females and 21 males; mean age 39. 6 years) with WAD (Grade I or II) were included. The FCE consisted of 12 tests, including material handling, hand grip strength, repetitive arm movements, static arm activities, walking speed, and a 3 min step test. Overall the FCE duration was 60 min. The test-retest interval was 7 days. <b>Interclass</b> <b>correlations</b> (model 1) (ICCs) and limits of agreement (LoA) were calculated. Safety was assessed by a Pain Response Questionnaire, observation criteria and heart rate monitoring. Results ICCs ranged between 0. 57 (3 min step test) and 0. 96 (short two-handed carry). LoA relative to mean performance ranged between 15 % (50 m walking test) and 57 % (lifting waist to overhead). Pain reactions after WAD FCE decreased within days. Observations and heart rate measurements fell within the safety criteria. Conclusions The reliability of the WAD FCE was moderate in two tests, good in five tests and excellent in five tests. Safety-criteria were fulfilled. Interpretation at the patient level should be performed with care because LoA were substantial. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: In our {{retrospective}} study, we {{aimed to}} investigate {{the differences between the}} adductor ratio (AR) in knees with and without osteoarthritis, and its validity in determining the articular level. Methods: Data from 80 knees of 80 patients were retrospectively evaluated. Anteroposterior weight-bearing knee radiographs of the patients with and without osteoarthritis (40 knees in each group) were obtained. The adductor ratio was determined using the following formula: ATJL/FW (adductor tubercle-joint line distance/femoral width). All radiographs were evaluated at the baseline and at one-month intervals afterwards. Intraobserver reliability of the two measurements was assessed using <b>interclass</b> <b>correlations</b> (ICC). Pearson's correlation test was used to evaluate the correlation between the ATJL and the FW. The differences between the adductor ratios of the two groups were evaluated by the independent samples two-tailed t-test. Results: Most of the ICC values were well above 0. 95, indicating a very high intraobserver reliability. The adductor ratio was significantly greater in Group 2 in comparison to Group 1 (Mean AR in Group 2 : 0. 522  ±  0. 031 and Mean AR in Group 1 : 0. 502  ±  0. 032; p =  0. 005). There was a significant correlation between the ATJL and FW in the groups when assessed both separately and combined. Conclusion: In conclusion, we can assert that if the AR is used to determine the articular level in revision arthroplasty cases, it may be sensible to measure the FW intraoperatively rather than measuring it on primary or contralateral radiographs of arthritic patients.

40|$|PURPOSE: This paper {{focuses on}} the {{construct}} validity of instruments measuring impairments in body structures and function in rheumatic disorders. The objective is: 1) to make an inventory of constructs, based on the domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disabilities and Health problems (ICF), against which instruments measuring impairments in body structures and function were validated; 2) to analyse whether validation against a similar construct resulted in higher correlation coefficients than validation against a dissimilar construct. METHODS: In a systematic review papers were identified in which instruments measuring impairments in body structures and function for patients with rheumatic disorders were validated. The instruments identified were assessed on their methodological properties and the constructs against which they were validated. Subsequently, pooled (<b>interclass)</b> <b>correlations</b> of similar constructs and dissimilar constructs against which was validated were compared. An instrument was decided to have good construct validity, if the correlation coefficient was 0. 50 or higher, and the measurement instrument in question is validated against similar constructs. RESULTS: In total 216 papers were identified analysing the validity of 42 different instruments. Only 16 % of these instruments were validated against instruments that represent the most similar construct. In general, estimates of construct validity were lower when validated against dissimilar constructs, except for instruments measuring impairments in mental functions. CONCLUSION: There is a trend that validation against a similar construct yields higher correlation coefficients than validation against a dissimilar construct.

Multivariable regression models specified relationships between patient variables and each HU and the FT. Results The ICCs were 0. 245 for FT/SF- 6 D, 0. 313 for HUI 3 /SF- 6 D, 0. 437 for HUI 2 /SF- 6 D, 0. 338 for FT/HUI 2, 0. 337 for FT/HUI 3 and 0. 751 for HUI 2 /HUI 3 (P [*] P [*] P [*] Conclusions The agreements between the different HUs were poor except for the two HUI measures; therefore HU values derived different measures may not be comparable. The FT had low agreement with HUs. The relationships between HUs and demographic and clinical measures demonstrate how severity of diabetes and other clinical and demographic factors are associated with HUs and FT measures.

40|$|Incremental {{exercise}} {{consists of}} three domains of exercise intensity demarcated by two thresholds. The first of these thresholds, derived from gas exchange measurements, {{is defined as the}} metabolic threshold (V̇O 2 θ) above which lactate accumulates. Correctly and reliably identified, V̇O 2 θ is a non-invasive, sub-maximal marker of aerobic function with practical value. This investigation compared variability in selection of V̇O 2 θ among interpreters with different levels of experience as well as from auto-detection algorithms employed by a commercially available metabolic cart (MC). Ten healthy young men performed three replicates of incremental cycle exercise during which gas exchange measurements were collected breath-by-breath. Two experienced interpreters (E) and four novice interpreters (N) determined V̇O 2 θ from plots of specific response variables. Interpreters noted methods used and confidence in their selections. V̇O 2 θ was automatically determined by the MC. <b>Interclass</b> <b>correlations</b> indicated that E agreed with each other (mean difference, 21 mL·min- 1) and with the MC (23 mL·min- 1), but not with N (- 664 to 364 mL·min- 1); N did not agree among themselves. Despite good overall agreement between E and MC, differences > 500 mL·min- 1 were seen in 50 % of individual cases. N expressed unduly higher confidence and used different V̇O 2 θ selection strategies compared with E. Experience and use of a systematic approach is essential for correctly identifying V̇O 2 θ. Current guidelines for exercise testing and interpretation do not include recommendations for such an approach. Data from this study suggests that this may be a serious shortcoming. Until an alternative schema for V̇O 2 θ detection is developed prospectively, strategies based on the present study will give practitioners a systematic and consistent approach to threshold detection...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Few {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} existing articular cartilage damage and sex on joint space measurements after isolated degenerative medial meniscus tears. PURPOSE: To determine what factors affected joint space width and narrowing in patients after removal of isolated degenerative medial meniscus tears. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 62 patients (15 women and 47 men) with all ligaments intact, no previous surgery to either knee, and an isolated degenerative medial meniscus tear removed in 1 knee were examined. The mean age at examination was 58. 2 years at a mean follow-up of 9. 4 years (range, 4 - 20 years). Subjective results were obtained with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee survey. Radiographs were taken using 45 ° weightbearing posteroanterior views. Midpoint and perceived minimum joint space width of the medial and lateral compartments of both knees were measured to the nearest 0. 1 mm by 2 observers at different times, and they were blinded as to the previous measurements (Pearson intra- and <b>interclass</b> <b>correlations,</b> > 0. 93). Joint space narrowing was found by calculating the difference in joint space width between knees. Percentage of normal joint space loss was calculated by dividing joint space narrowing by the joint space width in the contralateral knee. Other factors considered were patient sex and Outerbridge grading of articular cartilage. RESULTS: Women had a mean 1. 5 mm less normal joint space width than men in the involved and noninvolved knees (P 50 % of the normal joint space as measured in the noninjured knee (P =. 016). The mean IKDC total score was 66. 1 points for women, which was statistically {{significantly lower than the}} mean of 82. 7 points for men (P 50 % joint space narrowing after surgery...|$|R
