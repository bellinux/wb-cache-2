40|$|As causas mal definidas de morte refletem problemas de acesso aos serviços de saúde e de qualidade da assistência médica, e indicam precariedade no registro de dados no Sistema de Informações sobre Mortalidade (SIM). Selecionou-se uma amostra de municípios na Macrorregião Nordeste de Minas Gerais, Brasil, com o objetivo de {{investigar}} as mortes por causas mal definidas e os óbitos não notificados ao SIM em 2007, por meio do método da autópsia verbal. Esse método possibilitou esclarecer 87 % das causas dos óbitos investigados, das quais 17 % (n = 37) eram por causas violentas. Ao final do estudo, dentre os 779 investigados, 9, 5 % (n = 74) eram óbitos por causa externa encontrados fora do SIM. A distribuição por causas foi semelhante entre os óbitos notificados e não notificados ao SIM para as causas naturais, mas diferente quando incluídas as causas externas. Conclui-se que a investigação de óbitos com a metodologia da autópsia verbal pode ser um instrumento de grande valia para o aprimoramento do SIM no estado possibilitando o esclarecimento das causas de morte e também quanto à cobertura dos eventos. Ill-defined {{causes of}} death {{can be related to}} problems in access to health services or poor quality of medical care and are indicators of data quality in the Mortality Information System (MIS). A sample of municipalities (counties) was selected from the Northeastern Macro-Region of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, with the aim of investigating deaths from ill-defined causes and <b>deaths</b> <b>not</b> <b>reported</b> to the Mortality Information System in 2007, using the verbal autopsy technique. The method allowed identifying 87 % of the causes of investigated deaths, of which 17 % (n = 37) were due to violent causes. At the end of the study, of the 779 investigated deaths, 9. 5 % (n = 74) were due to external causes found outside the MIS. The distribution of causes was similar when comparing deaths reported (versus not reported) to the MIS for natural causes, but different when external causes were included. The article concludes that the verbal autopsy method can be a valuable tool for improving the MIS, allowing the identification of {{causes of death}} and improving data completeness...|$|E
