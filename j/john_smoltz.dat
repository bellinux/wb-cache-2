5|$|When the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks met in Major League Baseball's season opening {{series at}} the Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney on 22 and 23 March 2014, Chappell, who had {{represented}} South Australia as a {{catcher in the}} Claxton Shield before embarking on his successful cricket career, was a commentator for the broadcasts, carried on Australia's Channel Nine and in the United States by MLB Network. He worked with Matt Vasgersian and former Cy Young Award winner <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} surrounding Roy Oswalt's nomination because {{he only had}} a 7–5 record {{at the time of}} nominations making him the only pitcher without eight wins nominated. However, he is {{considered by many to be}} the victim of lack of run support, questionable relief pitching and an average defense. This respect was shown by the players who had voted him to sixth place among National League starting pitchers making him the first alternate in case of injury to any of the five elected All-star starting pitchers. On the final day of All-Star Final Vote voting, it was announced that Oswalt (who was running third in the All-Star Final Vote) would replace <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz</b> who withdrew from All-Star game participation due to injury.|$|E

Smoltz retired with a career record of 213-155 with a 3.33 ERA and 3,084 strikeouts. He also added 154 saves and was 15-4 in the post-season.|$|R
50|$|The 2008 season {{would also}} be <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz's</b> last season with the Braves as he would sign with the Boston Red Sox for the 2009 season. He would spend half of that season with the Red Sox, {{and the other half}} of that season with the Cardinals, after which, he would retire from baseball.|$|R
5|$|Winners of the Branch Rickey Award have {{undertaken}} different causes. Many winners, including Todd Stottlemyre, Jamie Moyer, <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz,</b> Torii Hunter, Vernon Wells, and Shane Victorino, worked {{with children in}} need. Stottlemyre visited and raised money for a nine-year-old girl who suffered from aplastic anemia and required a bone marrow transplant, while Moyer's foundation raised US$6million to support underprivileged children. Other winners devoted their work to aiding individuals who had a specific illness, such as Curt Schilling, who raised money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Trevor Hoffman, who lost a kidney as an infant and devoted himself to working with individuals with nephropathy. Also, some winners devoted themselves to work with major disasters and tragedies. Bobby Valentine donated money to charities benefiting victims of the September 11 attacks, while Luis Gonzalez worked with survivors of Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|Garvey, Leonard, and Albert Pujols hit four {{home runs}} in their winning series—Garvey in his first win. Adam Kennedy won the 2002 ALCS MVP for hitting 3 {{home runs in}} 5 games; he had hit 7 {{during the regular season}} and hit 80 in his 14-year career. David Ortiz had 11 runs batted in (RBI) during the 2004 ALCS and Iván Rodríguez had 10 during the 2003 NLCS—the only two players to reach double-digit RBI in the series {{in the history of the}} award. From the pitcher's mound, Steve Avery threw 16 innings without giving up a run in the 1991 NLCS, and <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz</b> amassed 19 strikeouts the {{following}} year. Liván Hernández won the 1997 NLCS MVP after winning his only start and earning a win out of the bullpen in relief; he struck out 16 in 10 innings. Daniel Murphy won the 2015 NLCS MVP after hitting home runs in six consecutive games, setting a major league record.|$|E

25|$|The Braves {{have retired}} eleven {{numbers in the}} history of the franchise, {{including}} most recently Chipper Jones' number 10 in 2013, <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz's</b> number 29 in 2012, Bobby Cox's number 6 in 2011, Tom Glavine's number 47 in 2010, and Greg Maddux's number 31 in 2009. Additionally, Hank Aaron's 44, Dale Murphy's 3, Phil Niekro's 35, Eddie Mathews' 41, Warren Spahn's 21 and Jackie Robinson's 42, which is retired for all of baseball with the exception of Jackie Robinson Day, have also been retired. The color and design of the retired numbers reflect the uniform design at the time the person was on the team, excluding Robinson.|$|R
50|$|On February 16, 2014, Kimbrel {{agreed to}} a four-year, $42 million {{extension}} with the Braves that runs through 2017, with an option for 2018. On April 2, Kimbrel tied Gene Garber's 141 saves with the Braves, good for second in franchise history. Two days later, April 4, Kimbrel recorded his 142nd career save, to move into sole possession of second place. On April 25, 2014, Kimbrel became the fastest pitcher ever to reach 400 strikeouts—reaching the mark in 236 innings' worth of work. On June 6, 2014, Kimbrel recorded his 155th save {{in a game against}} the Arizona Diamondbacks, surpassing <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz's</b> previous record of 154 saves. On August 29, 2014, Kimbrel recorded his 40th save of the season. He became the third pitcher to reach that single-season milestone in four straight seasons.|$|R
50|$|With {{the series}} {{shifting}} south to Miami, Game 3 {{began as a}} close game. In {{the top of the}} fourth inning the Braves loaded the bases with nobody out, but could only score one run on Fred McGriff's sac-fly which scored Kenny Lofton. Gary Sheffield responded with a homerun {{in the bottom of the}} fourth. In the sixth, Javy López hit a sac-fly which scored Jeff Blauser. However, the Marlins pulled away in the bottom half of the sixth, when they scored four runs to finish <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz's</b> night. With two on, two out, and with a 1-2 count, Darren Daulton hit a clutch, game-tying double, scoring Édgar Rentería. The big blow came when light-hitting catcher Charles Johnson smacked a 2-2 pitch to left-center, clearing the bases and giving the Marlins a 5-2 lead. Florida starter Tony Saunders did his best to hold the Braves, allowing just two earned runs before Liván Hernández took over. Hernández would get the win as the Marlins took the game 5-2.|$|R

25|$|With the Mets, on April 10, 2005, at Turner Field, Martínez outdueled <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz,</b> {{pitching}} a two-hit, one-run, complete game {{en route to}} his first Mets victory. On August 14, 2005, against the Dodgers, he pitched 7 hitless innings, but ended up losing the no-hitter and the game.|$|E
2500|$|The Braves {{made their}} first moves by re-signing Bob Wickman to a one-year deal {{and picking up}} <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz's</b> option in September 2006. Then they traded {{starting}} pitcher Horacio Ramírez to the Seattle Mariners for pitcher Rafael Soriano, an American League reliever with a solid 2.20 ERA in 2006. They also denied arbitration to pitcher Chris Reitsma and second baseman Marcus Giles. Then the Braves signed utility-man Chris Woodward to fill {{a spot on the}} bench. The biggest trade in the offseason involved first baseman Adam LaRoche and a minor league player for Pittsburgh Pirates closer Mike González and a minor league infielder, Brent Lillibridge. Gonzalez, who converted 24 of 24 save opportunities in 2006, joined Soriano as a set-up man for Wickman in the bullpen. The team then signed first baseman Craig Wilson to a one-year deal to platoon with Scott Thorman. The Braves also had solid relievers in Macay McBride, Blaine Boyer, and Tyler Yates. In addition, the majority of the Braves' offense, which was second in the NL in runs scored in 2006, returned in 2007. [...] However, Mike Hampton was sidelined for the entire 2007 season with yet another surgery. Mike González was later sidelined for the season while recovering from Tommy John surgery.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, Wisler {{was again}} invited to spring training. On April 5, 2015, he {{was traded to}} the Atlanta Braves, along with Carlos Quentin, Cameron Maybin, Jordan Paroubeck, and a draft pick, in {{exchange}} for Craig Kimbrel and Melvin Upton, Jr. He was then sent to Triple-A Gwinnett. On June 19, 2015, Wisler was called up to the major leagues, and that night he made his major league debut as the starting pitcher against New York Mets, a game in which he earned the win. He pitched eight innings to pick up the win, the first time a Braves pitcher had accomplished that in his debut since <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz's</b> debut performance. Wisler recorded a 9.49 ERA from August 1 to September 3, and was demoted to the bullpen. Fellow rookie pitchers Manny Banuelos and Mike Foltynewicz suffered injuries later that month, and Wisler was reinserted into the starting rotation. He started another five games to finish the season, and compiled a 2.33 ERA during that period. In Wisler's final start of the year, he pitched [...] innings of a 2-0 win against the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2015, he was 8-8 with a 4.71 ERA in 20 games (19 starts).|$|R
5000|$|A Hall of Fame pitcher {{famous for}} his slider was lefty Steve Carlton. Right-handed pitcher David Cone was {{famous for his}} slider, which {{he was able to}} use many {{different}} ways, as was Bob Gibson of the Cardinals. To right-handed batters, Cone would throw it to hook sharply outside the strike zone, getting hitters to chase and miss it. He threw the pitch from various arm angles to further confuse the hitter. Cone's slider was also a strikeout pitch to left-handed hitters, throwing it to curve back over the outside corner and catch the hitter looking. Cone used the slider effectively during his perfect game on July 18, 1999—the final out was recorded via a slider resembling a wiffle ball. In {{the first game of the}} 1988 World Series, Dennis Eckersley tried to strike out Kirk Gibson with a backdoor slider, but Gibson was sitting on that exact pitch and hit a game-winning home run. Joe Carter ended the 1993 World Series with a home run on a slider thrown by Mitch Williams. A notable slider was <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz's,</b> which would come in looking like a strike and then break out of the strike zone. Brad Lidge featured a slider in his perfect season as a closer in 2008, and used the pitch to strike out the final batter of the 2008 World Series for the Philadelphia Phillies. Closer Francisco Cordero also throws a slider. Other notable pitchers who throw a slider include Hall of Famer Rollie Fingers, who used the pitch to win a Cy Young Award in 1981,and Seattle Mariners and Arizona Diamondbacks starter Randy Johnson, whose slider's lateral movement eventually spawned its own nickname, [...] "Mr. Snappy". At times, Johnson's slider was faster than most pitchers' fastballs. Mike Jackson, who tied Paul Assenmacher with the most games pitched in the 1990s (644), also threw a slider. Ron Guidry threw a slider, which he was taught by Sparky Lyle.|$|R
25|$|As of {{his second}} {{placement}} on the DL in the 2009 series, Matsuzaka held a 1–5 record with an 8.23 ERA. With Matsuzaka's placement on the DL, it left a spot open in the starting rotation for <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz</b> to pitch in after being activated off the DL.|$|E
25|$|Fox {{broadcast}} the {{series in the}} United States, with Joe Buck serving as the play-by-play announcer, along with <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz</b> as color commentator and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters.

25|$|After {{losing to}} the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALCS, the Red Sox debuted new road uniforms similar to their old 1986 road uniforms. The {{following}} offseason had the Red Sox sign Rocco Baldelli, <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz,</b> and Brad Penny. The Red Sox saw a postseason berth via the winning of the AL Wild Card, only to be swept away {{in the first round}} by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.|$|E
5000|$|<b>John</b> Andrew <b>Smoltz</b> (born May 15, 1967), nicknamed [...] "Smoltzie" [...] and [...] "Marmaduke," [...] is an American former {{baseball}} {{pitcher who}} played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball from 1988 to 2009, {{all but the}} {{last year with the}} Atlanta Braves. An eight-time All-Star, Smoltz was part of a celebrated trio of starting pitchers, along with Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, who propelled Atlanta to perennial pennant contention in the 1990s, highlighted by a championship in the 1995 World Series. He won the National League (NL) Cy Young Award in 1996 after posting a record of 24 - 8, equaling the most victories by an NL pitcher since 1972. Though predominantly known as a starter, Smoltz was converted to a reliever in 2001 after his recovery from Tommy John surgery, and spent four years as the team's closer before returning to a starting role. In 2002, he set the NL record with 55 saves and became only the second pitcher in history (joining Dennis Eckersley) to record both a 20-win season and a 50-save season. He is the only pitcher in major league history to record both 200 wins and 150 saves.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the game, the Braves {{unveiled}} their All-Turner Field Team, as chosen on the team's website by fans: catcher Javy López, {{first baseman}} Freddie Freeman, second baseman Marcus Giles, shortstop Rafael Furcal, third baseman Chipper Jones, left fielder Ryan Klesko, center fielder Andruw Jones, right fielder Brian Jordan, utility player Martin Prado, pitchers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz,</b> Tim Hudson, and Julio Teheran, and relief pitcher Craig Kimbrel.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, as a closer, Gagné {{was called}} upon 55 times {{to save a}} {{baseball}} game and converted {{every one of them}} en route to becoming both the first pitcher to record 50 saves in more than one season and also the fastest pitcher to ever reach the 100-save plateau. His 55 saves in 2003 also equalled the National League record set the previous season by <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz.</b> Between August 26, 2002 and July 5, 2004, he converted 84 consecutive save chances, a major league record. More than half (55%) of the batters he retired during the 2003 season came by strikeout.|$|E
25|$|The Red Sox {{pitching}} staff floundered {{in the second}} half of the year. Wakefield, Beckett and Lester were the only dependable starters in the first half (<b>John</b> <b>Smoltz,</b> Daisuke Matsuzaka and Brad Penny all had losing records). While Lester remained effective {{in the second half}}, Beckett began to struggle, and when All-Star Tim Wakefield was placed on the disabled list, Buchholz replaced him in the rotation. Buchholz' pitching down the stretch played a large role in helping the Red Sox make it into the playoffs (along with a strong return from Matsuzaka). He finished the season 7–4 with a 4.21 ERA and 68 strikeouts in 16 starts.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} debut with the Braves as their opening day starter against the Cubs at Wrigley Field, beating his former {{teammates}} 10. It {{was a good}} start to another strong season. He led the NL in ERA {{for the first time}} while posting a 2010 record. Maddux won his second straight Cy Young Award, and the Braves took their rotation of Maddux, 22-game winner Tom Glavine, 18-game winner Steve Avery, and 15-game winner <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz</b> to the postseason. Maddux won against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game Two of the NLCS, but with Atlanta trailing 3 games to 2, lost the decisive Game Six.|$|E
25|$|Cox {{returned}} to the dugout as manager {{in the middle of}} the 1990 season, replacing Russ Nixon. The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65–97. They traded Dale Murphy to the Philadelphia Phillies after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. Pitching coach Leo Mazzone began developing young pitchers Tom Glavine, Steve Avery, and <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz</b> into future stars. That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the 1990 MLB draft to select Chipper Jones, who became one of the best hitters in team history. Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, John Schuerholz was hired away from the Kansas City Royals as general manager.|$|E
25|$|Thursday Night Baseball (formally {{known as}} MLB Network Showcase) {{is the title}} of a {{presentation}} of Major League Baseball on cable and satellite channel MLB Network (self-produced by MLB Network), that premiered on April 9, 2009.

25|$|The Yankees {{took control}} of the best record in baseball, {{highlighted}} by a four-game sweep of their archrivals the Boston Red Sox from August 6–9. Entering the series, the Yankees had lost all 8 games in which they had faced the Red Sox in 2009. During Game 1 of the series, the Yankees pounded Red Sox starter <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz</b> for nine hits, four walks, and eight earned runs in 3.1 IP. Jorge Posada finished a triple shy of the cycle as the Yankees recorded 18 hits total and went on to win 13-6. On Friday night, the second game of the series, it took 15 innings for a run to be recorded {{in the form of a}} walk-off two-run home run by Alex Rodriguez. Josh Beckett and AJ Burnett had started the pitchers' duel and each pitched at least seven shutout innings. The Yankees also won the third game of the series on Saturday 5-0 behind CC Sabathia's 7.2 shutout innings. In the series finale on Sunday Night Baseball, Johnny Damon and Mark Teixeira hit back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning to propel the Yankees to a victory. The sweep also gave the Yankees a stranglehold over the American League East and for the rest of the season, no other team would come within five games of first place.|$|E
25|$|After {{a pair of}} third-place {{finishes}} in 1985 and 1986, the 1987 Tigers faced lowered expectations – {{which seemed to be}} confirmed by an 11–19 start to the season. However, the team hit its stride thereafter and gradually gained ground on its AL East rivals, eventually finishing with {{the best record in the}} Majors. This charge was fueled in part by the acquisition of pitcher Doyle Alexander from the Atlanta Braves in exchange for minor league pitcher <b>John</b> <b>Smoltz.</b> Alexander started 11 games for the Tigers, posting 9–0 record and a 1.53 ERA. Smoltz, a Lansing, Michigan, native, went on to have a long and productive career, mostly with the Braves, winning the Cy Young Award in 1996. The Tigers won the division this year but possibly gave up some of their future. The Tigers had a great season but despite their improvement, they entered September neck-and-neck with the Toronto Blue Jays. The two teams would square off in seven hard-fought games during the final two weeks of the season. All seven games were decided by one run, and in the first six of the seven games, the winning run was scored in the final inning of play. At Exhibition Stadium, the Tigers dropped three in a row to the Blue Jays before winning a dramatic extra-inning showdown.|$|E
