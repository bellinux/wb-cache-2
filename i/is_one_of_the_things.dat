He has stated that his passion for Scouting <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that got him through his 6.5years as a POW in North Vietnam, {{to the point that}} at times all he could {{remember}} was the Scout Oath, but not the names of his family members.|$|E
25|$|Cosplaying {{may also}} involve cross-dressing, for some females {{may wish to}} dress as a male, and vice versa (see Crossplay). Breast binding (for females) is not {{uncommon}} and <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> likely needed to cosplay a male character.|$|E
25|$|His {{singular}} {{and often}} exhausting modus operandi involves taking the work through from conception to creation, entirely unassisted in his purpose-built bronze casting foundry at Clonlea, in Blackrock.

25|$|Public service {{broadcasting}} <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{that distinguishes}} {{this country and}} {{makes me want to}} live here. I have spent all my life in it. I would be very distressed if public service broadcasting was weakened. I have been at the BBC since 1952, and know the BBC is constantly being battered. It is today.|$|E
500|$|Chosen to play female lead Sadie Hermann, Dorothy Mackaill {{opined that}} the film would appeal to [...] "every girl in America". She {{believed}} that [...] "there is not a situation in this picture which could not happen to any girl. That <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I like about it. There is nothing in it {{that could not be}} true." [...] The rest of the cast includes Charles Murray as a driver, Peggy Shaw as Ethel, Gaston Glass as Fred Perry, and Bernard Randall portraying Brown.|$|E

500|$|The {{score was}} {{positively}} received by critics. [...] Judge Harold Jervais of DVD Verdict wrote how [...] " [...] Walker's wonderfully creepy and effective score are mixed {{together to form}} a very pleasing, almost organic-like whole". Mike Long of DVD Review said that [...] "Shirley Walker’s eerie score comes across powerfully with a wide spatial integration". Derek Germano of The Cinema Laser wrote that [...] "Walker's creepy musical score is really a winner, and <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that will help to make Final Destination a minor genre classic a few years down the road".|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Kiefer Sutherland {{revealed}} that Redemption {{was inspired by}} the Rwandan Genocide and the U.S. Government's response to it. [...] "The truth <b>is,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that was said in the prequel, which I think has been a massive problem with how the Western world has dealt with Africa, no one can justify going there, because they have no viable reason– meaning oil or money. Here [...] response is a human one. We can stop a genocide. I think that that's something that Bill Clinton apologized for not doing with Rwanda and we centered a show around that." ...|$|E
500|$|Concerning inspirations on the season, Loeb {{revealed}} that [...] "Chinatown... <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that influenced Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos when they created the character. So {{those kind of}} beautiful, long, wide expansive shots, where people sort of come into frame and go back out of frame and someone’s in the foreground and then someone is way {{in the background and}} they’re having a conversation, that’s the stuff that makes it interesting." [...] Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director S. J. Clarkson took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of Wong Kar-wai as reference to create [...] "unconventional" [...] compositions, with Billeter explaining, [...] "There were a lot of foreground elements [...] headroom as well, and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted {{to create a sense of}} claustrophobia." [...] Billeter shot the season with a Red Epic Dragon camera in 4K resolution, with 5K used for some visual effects shots, and with Panavision PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and [...] "good composition", but did occasionally employ a camera dolly or steadicam. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from sodium-vapor lamps to LEDs, so he tried to recreate the [...] "warm, dirty color of sodium vapor" [...] for night exterior scenes.|$|E

500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Jordan {{spoke out}} against a bill to repeal the Louisiana laws against sodomy. [...] "Intolerance is not {{necessarily}} a bad thing. ... This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we should be intolerant of," [...] Jordan told colleagues on the Senate floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Y is almighty" [...] {{means that}} Y {{is not just}} more {{powerful}} than any creature; no creature can compete with Y in power, even unsuccessfully. In this account nothing like the omnipotence paradox arises, but perhaps that is because God is not taken to be in any sense omnipotent. On the other hand, Anselm of Canterbury {{seems to think that}} almightiness <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that make God count as omnipotent.|$|E

2500|$|Arya is not {{the only}} {{character}} to change her name or have her name changed for her. Her sister Sansa Stark assumes the identity of Alayne Stone. Tyrion Lannister travels under the names Yollo and Hugor Hill. Catelyn Stark becomes Lady Stoneheart. And Theon Greyjoy's chapters in A Dance with Dragons are titled: Reek, The Prince of Winterfell, The Turncloak, A Ghost in Winterfell, and finally, Theon again. Martin says: [...] "Identity <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that I'm playing with in this series as a whole, and in this particular book — what is it that makes us who we are? Is it our birth, our blood, our position in the world? Or something more integral to us? Our values, our memories, et cetera." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Yorke, [...] "Creep" [...] {{tells the}} tale of an inebriated man who tries to get the {{attention}} of a woman to whom he is attracted by following her around. In the end, he lacks the self-confidence to face her and feels he subconsciously is her. When asked about [...] "Creep" [...] in 1993, Yorke said: [...] "I have a real problem being a man in the '90s... Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you're in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do... It comes back to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it's not brutal in its arrogance. It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I'm always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it." [...] Jonny Greenwood said the song was in fact a happy song about [...] "recognizing what you are".|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Erik Brudvig {{praised the}} humor of Eets. [...] He stated [...] "a nice {{sense of humor}} has been infused {{throughout}} the game." [...] He also gave high marks for the game's art style and stated that it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> [...] "Eets does several things exceptionally well." [...] Brudvig further praised the game's achievements. [...] He noted that even after completion of the game, the remaining achievements encourage the players to keep playing and try different methods of completing levels. [...] Charles Herold of The New York Times called it [...] "an adorable puzzle game". [...] Bryon Lloyd of Game Vortex also praised the visuals and said the game is [...] "a beautiful game to look at with its cel-shaded cast and crew." [...] GameSpot's Ryan Davis also enjoyed the game's visuals and noted they [...] "have an inspired look and feel." [...] Eric Bratcher of GamesRadar also noted it has a [...] "splashy, fun art style." [...] Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell was more critical of the art style. [...] He felt that the bright, colorful graphics {{made it difficult to}} distinguish where the character was and what was happening.|$|E

2500|$|Kasey Kahne {{took the}} lead on the second Green-White-Checker attempt and held off Matt Kenseth to score his first win of the season. [...] "Yeah, man, it took a lot," [...] said Kahne. [...] "We {{were all over the}} place during the race but the guys stayed with me and worked hard. On those restarts– I didn't know what would happen because I had great restarts all night and I {{struggle}} with restarts a lot. That's big, because that <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> you have to be good at and it worked really well tonight. Yeah, we are locked in and I hate it comes down to this Atlanta or Richmond just about every year for me," [...] said Kahne. [...] "Sometimes we are in, sometimes we are out. But thankful that now at HMS I have been in all three years now." [...] "Those last two laps were really intense," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Things are looking up. I'm looking forward to the next 11." [...] "I couldn't capitalize, couldn't get the restarts and couldn't accelerate," [...] Denny Hamlin said. [...] "We just came up short. Third is about the place car we had tonight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Hirst {{gave the}} book a {{positive}} review, {{in a piece}} for The Independent, though he cautioned British readers as to the difference from the style of journalism they are used to, writing, [...] "For anyone accustomed to the brevity of British journalism, these 20 features may seem grandiose in scale." [...] He wrote favorably of the article on the Beslan terrorism siege, commenting, [...] "Running to 56 pages, CJ Chivers's investigation of the 2004 Chechen school siege is hypnotic, like a slow-motion horror film." [...] Hirst concluded his review, [...] "Magazine journalism <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that America does very well indeed." [...] In a review for The Daily Yomiuri, Cristoph Mark praised the writing style, readability, and organization of the book, commenting, [...] "Despite being nearly 500 pages, the collection is an incredibly quick read that leaves you both sad to finish the story you've just ended and yet happy to start anew, a feeling largely aided by the editors' innate ability to pace {{the order of the}} articles effectively, lightening the mood or going in for the punch as needed." [...] Kurt Rabin of The Free Lance–Star stated the publication was one of his three favorites of the year, including other compilations The Best American Crime Reporting and The Best American Sports Writing. Xujun Eberlain, writing for New America Media, wrote positively of William Langewiesche's Vanity Fair article, noting it [...] "has a great description" [...] of an incident involving a U.S. soldier operating in Iraq in a location under power of insurgents.|$|E
