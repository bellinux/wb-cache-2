5000|$|From {{the design}} angle the new D12A engine {{was one of}} the largest engine {{projects}} from Volvo Trucks since the 1950s at the time. The basic design was still based on direct injection in-line six diesel engine around 12 litres displacement but with entirely different fuel and valve systems when compared with previous Volvo engines. Built at the purpose-built facility at Skövde on a fully automated line where the bulk of the engine assembly is done by robots and the final engine dressing is carried out manually. The D12A was designed as a [...] "world engine" [...] to be able to meet the latest demands in high power output, low fuel consumption and lower emissions with its single OHC (overhead camshaft) design, four valves per cylinder and one centrally located electronic unit injector, integrated <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> and two-piece, steel and aluminium pistons. The engine design left the door open for future upgrades in both power output and emission technologies.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005 Volvo {{introduced}} {{new design}} 13 litre unit D13A [...] incorporating the same design features as its 9 and 16 litre engines and available in various power output variants from , 400 hp, 440 hp, [...] to [...] Initially available to meet Euro III emissions requirements, further improvements {{will enable the}} engine to meet or exceed Euro IV and possibly Euro V emissions targets. D13A featured closed-crankcase ventilation and also included {{a new type of}} unit injector (UI) E3 from Delphi. As a part of makeover Volvo has also removed its naming scheme and decided to drop engine size in the model name so the models are known from now as FH only. Volvo had also introduced on D13A engine with Selective Catalytic Reduction an improved version of its <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> the [...] "VEB+" [...] featuring additional helper rocker arm and a fourth cam lobe per cylinder. Power outputs available from 360 hp, 400 hp, [...] and [...]|$|E
50|$|One-way sprag {{clutches}} {{have also}} been used for the same purpose, but are generally not adjustable for disengagement force. Early Honda Shadow models used a design wherein a sprag clutch is connected to just half of the clutch friction plates, allowing the clutch to slip during heavy backloading sufficiently to prevent rear-wheel lockup, while still allowing moderate <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> <b>braking</b> with the remaining friction plates.|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} the unit to work without gear clashing, it {{contained}} a freewheeling device (in Underdrive, Low and High), and the Owner’s manual cautioned drivers not to use “1st or 3rd” gear when descending hills, {{because there was no}} <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> <b>braking</b> in those free-wheeling ranges. Generally, most drivers started an M6 car in High and accomplished the shift to direct drive somewhere between 13 and 25 MPH by releasing the accelerator pedal and waiting for the “clunk” that signaled the disengagement of the underdrive. An M6 car would automatically shift from High down to underdrive high when car speed dropped below approximately 11 MPH.|$|R
5000|$|Powered {{by either}} an 16VDZC or 12VDZC engine by Belgian engine {{manufacturer}} Anglo-Belgian Corporation, rated at respectively 3,600 kW or 2,750 kW, the locomotive can reach {{a top speed}} of 120 km/h (160 km/h optionally) and has a maximal tractive effort of 519 kN. The normal tractive effort is 408 kN. The LS 640 reU2 [...] "Turbosplit" [...] transmission allows for a separated traction and wheelslip control of each bogie. This is the first locomotive series equipped with this new technology. Brake equipment consists of electro-pneumatic and <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> <b>brakes.</b> The smallest drivable curve radius is 80m. The locomotive can take up to 9,000 or 10,000 l of fuel, depending on the configuration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{evolution}} of Volvo FM series continued in 2005 [...] {{with the release}} {{of a new generation of}} FM trucks powered by an all-new 13-litre D13A engine and improved 9-litre D9B unit and the second-generation I-Shift transmission. The naming of the series had also changed: engine size in litres is no longer used in the FM name. The new engines were available in Euro IV emissions standard in both Selective Catalytic Reduction. Volvo had also introduced on D13A engine with SCR an improved version of its <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> the [...] "VEB+" [...] featuring additional helper rocker arm and fourth cam lobe per cylinder. Power outputs available from , , [...] and [...] In 2007 Volvo introduced D13B [...] with Exhaust Gas Recirculation configuration and VGT turbocharger but without exhaust particle filter and is the only manufacturer to offer this solution thus far. The engines are available in slightly reduced power output ranging from , , [...] and [...] however [...] option is only available for FH series.|$|E
40|$|A {{diesel engine}} model, {{designed}} for studying events during automated gear shifting {{in a heavy}} duty truck is presented. It {{will be used for}} developing and evaluating powertrain control strategies. The deceleration in engine speed to the new synchronous speed, during an upshift, is of special intereset. The straightforward approach is to cut fuel and wait for the engine to slow down due to friction and pumping losses. In many cases, this approach is too slow, and the <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> needs to be activated. The engine model, assuming quasi-steady, bidirectional thermodynamic flow with constant specific heat capacities, is implemented using Modelica. A simple model of the hydraulic circuit that governs the activation of the compression brake mode is incorporated in the model. Problems related to the simulation of the engine brake systems are discussed. They are handled by empirical correction factors. Measurements from rapid engine speed decelerations are used for verification...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{development}} of sophisticated integrated powertrain control systems for heavy duty trucks, including handling of driveline oscillations and automated gear shifting systems, requires detailed simulation models {{during the development}} process. These models need to balance the demands for accuracy, ease of parameterization and simulation efficiency. The application in focus in this work is the transient engine speed control during an automated gear shift sequence of a heavy duty truck. In {{the case of an}} upshift, the engine must rapidly be decelerated to the new synchronous speed. Since the normal engine friction is small, the <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> is activated. A dedicated engine simulation model is needed {{in order to be able}} to develop a controller for this sequence. This report presents a crank angle based diesel engine model, especially well suited for simulation and development of control strategies for the transients during automated gear shifts in a heavy duty truck. It includes compression brake capabilities. The model can be characterized as a “filling and emptying”-model, using the ideal gas law and standard equations for flow restrictions connecting lumped control volumes. An empirical combustion model is used, assuming adiabatic conditions in the cylinder. During no-load or when the compression brake is active, cylinder wall heat exchange is taken into account. A tuning procedure is outlined and pursued for a 12 litre turbocharged Volvo diesel engine. The simulations agree well with measurements. An example to show the usefulness of the model is given where the rapid engine speed deceleration during an upshift is studied...|$|E
5000|$|Yamaha {{introduced}} the YZ400F in production in 1998 after a successful AMA season in 1997. It was [...] "the first modern production four-stroke motocrosser that was directly competitive against two-strokes." [...] Initially, Yamaha targeted a dry weight of 233 pounds (106 kg) (on {{par with the}} 250 two-strokes of the time), but by production, the bike weighed 250 pounds. The bike had an 11,600 rpm redline power and torque close to its 250 cc two-stroke rivals. It benefited from <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> <b>braking,</b> which allowed the engine to slow the bike down during deceleration, giving the brakes a rest. [...] The 1998 YZ400F was the first bike to come stock with a Keihin FCR carburetor.|$|R
5000|$|Brake fade {{typically}} {{occurs during}} heavy or sustained braking. Many high-speed vehicles use disc brakes, and many European heavy vehicles use disc brakes. Many U.S. and third-world heavy vehicles use drum brakes {{due to their}} lower purchase price. On heavy vehicles, air drag is often small compared to the weight, so the brakes dissipate proportionally more energy than on a typical car or motorcycle. Thus, heavy vehicles often need to use <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> <b>braking,</b> and slow down so braking energy is dissipated over a longer interval. Recent studies have been performed in the United States to test the stopping distances of both drum brakes and disc brakes using a North American Standard called FMVSS-121. The results showed that when newer compounding of friction materials typically used in disc brakes is applied to drum brakes that {{there is virtually no}} difference in stopping distance or brake fade. As the United States changed its FMVSS-121 rules for Class Eight trucks built in 2012 to reduce stopping distances by about 1/3rd there was no recommendation to use either drum or disc brakes in the current law.|$|R
50|$|The carbon brakes in {{combination}} with tyre technology and the car's aerodynamics produce truly remarkable braking forces. The deceleration force under braking is usually 4 g (39 m/s2), and can {{be as high as}} 5-6 g when braking from extreme speeds, for instance at the Gilles Villeneuve circuit or at Indianapolis. In 2007, Martin Brundle, a former Grand Prix driver, tested the Williams Toyota FW29 Formula 1 car, and stated that under heavy braking he felt like his lungs were hitting the inside of his ribcage, forcing him to exhale involuntarily. Here the aerodynamic drag actually helps, and can contribute as much as 1.0 g of braking force, which is the equivalent of the brakes on most road sports cars. In other words, if the throttle is let go, the F1 car will slow down under drag {{at the same rate as}} most sports cars do with braking, at least at speeds above 250 km/h. The drivers do not utilise <b>engine</b> (<b>compression)</b> <b>braking,</b> although it may seem this way. The only reason they change down gears prior to entering the corner is to be in the correct gear for maximum acceleration on the exit of the corner.|$|R
50|$|A “Jake Brake” is an <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> release <b>brake</b> used {{especially}} for steep hill downgrades. The Jake Brake opens the exhaust valves when the piston is near {{top dead center}} (where ignition normally occurs). On the upstroke, the piston compresses {{the air in the}} cylinder to 1/15th its original volume, which creates drag on the engine. The Jacobs Engine Brake then releases the compressed air and the energy stored in it before it can push back on the piston during the down stroke. The Jake Brake turns a power producing engine into a power absorbing air compressor and in turn, causes the truck to slow down.Inside of the truck, the driver can choose how many cylinders to activate; the more cylinders activated, the more slowing of the truck.|$|R
5000|$|In normal driving, {{the clutch}} {{was used to}} select low, high or reverse. Attached to the {{transmission}} was an [...] "underdrive" [...] with a reduction gear of 1.75/1. The shift lever was column-mounted and had three positions: Low (in the [...] "2nd" [...] position of a conventional 3-speed manual unit), High (in the [...] "3rd" [...] position), and Reverse (same as the 3-speed). The clutch had to be depressed every time the gear shift lever was moved. When the lever was put in Low, the car started in [...] "underdrive" [...] low; when the vehicle reached a minimum speed of 6 mph (9.7 km/h), the driver lifted his foot off the accelerator, the underdrive unit would kick out and the car would be in Low. Similarly, with the lever in High position, the car would start in underdrive high, and at any speed above 13 mph (21 km/h), the driver would lift his foot and the car would [...] "shift" [...] into direct drive.This configuration {{had the effect of}} providing 4 gear ratios:Underdrive Low, 3.57/1,Low 2.04/1,Underdrive High, 1.75/1,High, 1/1.In order for the unit to work without gear clashing, it contained a freewheeling device (in Underdrive, Low and High), and the Owner’s manual cautioned drivers not to use [...] "1st or 3rd" [...] gear when descending hills, because there was no <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> <b>braking</b> in those free-wheeling ranges.

5000|$|From {{the mid-1960s}} to the late-1970s, engine compression-releases {{were also used}} to {{supplement}} rear-wheel braking on many two-stroke engine powered motorcycles, primarily those used off-road or for various types of dirt-track racing, such as motocross and flat-tracking. Since two-stroke engines normally lack the <b>compression</b> <b>braking</b> effect of four-stroke engines when the throttle is shut off, {{the addition of a}} <b>compression</b> release <b>brake</b> on two-strokes essentially mimicked the four-stroke <b>compression</b> <b>braking</b> effect. Using throttle-off <b>engine</b> <b>compression</b> for at least some braking on both two-stroke and four stroke motorcycles was especially important during that era, since most motorcycles used drum-brakes, which would wear-out much more quickly than modern disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>brakes,</b> a form {{of engine}} brakes, produce greater noise {{pollution}} than exhaust brakes. For this reason, some vehicle original equipment manufacturers prefer to use exhaust brakes despite their lower <b>braking</b> power. Combining <b>compression</b> breaking with exhaust breaking can increase effectiveness without being as loud as <b>compression</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development and}} experimental validation of a coordination scheme between friction and discretely variable <b>compression</b> <b>brakes</b> for a Class 8 Freightliner truck used as a development platform in the California PATH program. The coordination scheme that we developed maintains the speed tracking performance of the nominal PID controller which was originally designed by the UCLA team for the case of friction brakes only. Through the coordination scheme, the command of the nominal PID controller is split into a friction <b>brake</b> command and <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> command.

5000|$|The use of <b>compression</b> release <b>engine</b> <b>brakes</b> {{may cause}} {{a vehicle to}} make a loud {{chattering}} or [...] "machine gun like" [...] exhaust noise, especially vehicles having high flow mufflers, or no mufflers at all, causing many communities in the United States, Canada and Australia to prohibit <b>compression</b> <b>braking</b> within municipal limits.

40|$|In this report, we {{extend our}} {{previous}} work within MOU 372 on modeling and longitudinal speed control design for heavy commercial {{vehicles equipped with}} variable <b>compression</b> <b>braking</b> mechanisms. Previously, we developed a detailed crankangle based simulation model for a six cylinder, 350 hp diesel engine with a continuously varying <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> {{that is capable of}} describing the intrinsic interactions between individual cylinder intake and exhaust processes, turbocharger dynamics during combustion and braking modes, and the transition between those modes. Moreover, for control design and analysis purposes we derived a low-order approximation of that model. In this report we present our new results on developing longitudinal control algorithms that coordinate the variable <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> with conventional service brakes and gear selection. Specifically, we integrate the <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> actuator with the service brakes and design a PI-controller that emulates the driver's actions on long grades. The controller uses the engine speed measurement to activate the service brakes only when retarding power of the <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> is insufficient. We also employ robust linear control technique using the concept of structured singular values to design a controller that is robust to parameter variations and model uncertainty in the CHV. Finally, we compare the performance of this robust controller with the performance of an adaptive control scheme that we have derived within MOU 393. The performance of all the controllers is demonstrated through extensive simulations on the 24 th order nonlinear vehicle model developed in our previous work within MOU 372.

50|$|Compression-release ("Jake") braking, a form {{of engine}} braking used almost {{exclusively}} on diesel engines, produces extreme amounts of noise pollution {{if there is no}} muffler on the intake manifold of the engine. Anecdotally, it sounds similar to a jackhammer, however the loudness is between 10 and 20 times the sound pressure level of a jackhammer (10 to 13 dB greater). Numerous cities, municipalities, states, and provinces have banned the use of unmuffled <b>compression</b> <b>brakes,</b> which are typically only legal in roads away from populations. In Australia, traffic enforcement cameras are currently being tested that automatically photograph heavy vehicles that use <b>compression</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another braking {{feature of}} semi-trucks is engine braking, {{which could be}} either a <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> (usually {{shortened}} to Jake brake) or exhaust brake or combination of both. However, the use of <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> alone produces a loud and distinctive noise, and to control noise pollution, some local municipalities have prohibited or restricted the use of engine brake systems inside their jurisdictions, particularly in residential areas. The advantage to using engine braking instead of conventional brakes is that a truck can descend a long grade without overheating its wheel brakes. Some vehicles can also be equipped with hydraulic or electric retarders which have an advantage of near silent operation.|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} two {{chapters}} of this report, the development of discrete <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> and transmission models is explained. In the vehicle model development, special efforts {{have been put in}} transmission shifting scheduling. Transmission up-shift and down-shift scheduling are separated in the modelling. Hysteresis during shifting is introduced to reduce chattering. A <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> effect on transmission shifting is identified and considered in the modelling. The new transmission shifting model has been validated through experimental data. The transmission shifting model is combined with the <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> model and the model of the longitudinal vehicle dynamics for a high-fidelity predictive simulation software tool. Power-width-modulation (PWM) actuation for brake coordination is proposed to further exploit the capacity of the <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> and reduce the usage of service brake. Simulation results indicates that the PWM actuation strategy will have the same speed regulation performance as the direct torque split strategy, while the usage of the service brake is significantly reduced, and the <b>compression</b> <b>brake</b> can handle a down slope of - 4 when tracking a speed of 56 mile per hour. Simulation results also indicated the importance of vehicle mass and road grade estimation in controller performance. The estimation problem is addressed in detail next. In the third chapter, a recursive least square scheme with multiple forgetting factors is proposed for on-line estimation of road grade and vehicle mass. The estimated mass and grade can be used to robustify many automatic controllers in conventional or automated heavy-duty vehicles. We demonstrate with measured test data from the July 26 - 27, 2002 test dates in San Diego, CA, that the proposed scheme estimates mass within 5 % of its actual value and tracks grade with good accuracy. The experimental setup, signals, their source and their accuracy are discussed. Issues like lack of persistent excitations in certain parts of the run or difficulties of parameter tracking during gear shift are explained and suggestions to bypass these problems are made. In the final part of this work, an adaptive model predictive control scheme is designed for speed control of heavy vehicles. The controller coordinates use of <b>compression</b> <b>brakes</b> and service brakes on downhill slopes. The advantage of model predictive control (MPC) scheme over PI design is its ability to explicitly handle the constraints on service <b>brake</b> and <b>compression</b> command. MPC minimizes use of service brakes based on constrain optimization techniques. Given a perfect model, good performance was obtained in closedloop. We showed with simulation analysis that model uncertainties due to uncertainty in vehicle mass result in degraded and sometimes poor oscillatory closed-loop response. Unknown road disturbance (grade) was another limiting factor to the performance of the controller. It is shown that accurate estimate of mass is necessary for safe and comfortable operation in closed-loop. Also knowledge of the road grade can improve the results further by contributing in feedforward control. Therefore the estimation method presented in the third chapter of the report is used in parallel with the controller to update the estimates of mass and road grade. We show that adaptation allows robust speed tracking even if initial mass is 300 percent over or underestimated. ...|$|R
