[...] I'm like [...] "I'm not a dick, I'm going to tell the truth." [...] I wrote it two years ago when I was writing and recording Teenage Dream, [...] it didn't feel right on the record.

500|$|Taylor {{explained}} {{the process of}} recording an episode {{in an interview with}} Animerica Magazine; first, the script is translated from Japanese into English, it is then adapted to fit the lip flap (movement of the mouth). Taylor said that she is {{the only one in the}} recording booth when she works, as they record each voice separately throughout each episode. Taylor added that she is often the first one to record so she has to imagine how the previous line would be said. [...] "Luckily, <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> a great director who helps with the interpretation of the line, matching of the lip flap, and consistency of the voice," [...] she said.|$|E
500|$|Taylor met DeBorah Sharpe in 1977 {{during the}} {{production}} of The Wiz where she was the understudy for Dorothy. They married in 1980 and had a son, Adamah. In his spare time, Taylor often helped teach vulnerable young people {{through a variety of}} projects, including at the George Street Playhouse in New Jersey. He noted [...] "things have come out of the air for me...I'm grateful; that's why <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> kids. I've had a blessing in my career, to have gone as far as I've gone." [...] A 1995 piece in The Plain Dealer described Taylor as [...] "A jolly giant of a man, he looks like a natural force – a mountain, perhaps, who can tell great stories."

Now, he's a rock star. They were famous.They had done big stuff. But it's transcended that. [...] But he hasn't changed. And they haven't changed. They're three friends who love one another". Courtney Love also commented on the success of the band, stating [...] "Billie Joe looks absolutely beautiful. You know how when people get super A-list, their face gets prettier? I think it's perception. [...] It's something that happens in your subconscious". At the time of American Idiots release, the album was not sold in Wal-Mart due to its explicit content.|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to write the episode however, Kaling had to perform a Google search, as she had {{forgotten}} many details. She explained, [...] "I was a little embarrassed with how little I knew about it. I'm Hindu, but I'm not really a practicing Hindu, so I had {{to do a lot of}} research." [...] Kaling was pleased to learn more about her culture, at first being concerned that Daniels [...] "and people <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> were a little antsy about assigning the Hindu writer the Indian episode. I didn't want to feel like they pigeonholed me, but I felt like I'd done enough episodes that it was okay." [...] She found that making the episode [...] "was kind of the perfect meeting of being the child of immigrants and writing for a comedy show." [...] The series writers have since joked that they should do a Diwali-themed episode every year in the same vein as the Christmas specials.|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 2007, Washington {{appeared}} on Larry King Live, {{to present his}} side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a [...] "B-word", a [...] "P-word", and the [...] "F-word", which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back". In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on right here on the ground...with the people <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I remember saying , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. got to come out and I got to say to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay. [...] The idea that a gay actor can't play a straight man is insulting." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>with,</b> 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Björk herself, {{the lyrics}} express {{how she felt}} obliged to produce music because {{of the people that}} occupationally {{depended}} of her.

I have to isolate myself and put myself in a state so I will write a song." [...] After the success Björk encountered as a solo artist with Debut (1993) and Post (1995) —her most promoted album—, she began to feel more pressured as she noticed how her creative output directly affected the life of those around her. In an interview with Dave Hemingway she stated: ...|$|E

We even agree on whether a dialogue should end with wa or yo." [...] From Late Spring on, partly due to Noda's influence, all Ozu’s characters would be comfortably middle class and thus, unlike the characters in, for example, Record of a Tenement Gentleman or A Hen in the Wind, beyond immediate physical want and necessity.|$|E
2500|$|Jane Austen famously {{wrote to}} her nephew James Edward Austen that his [...] "strong, manly, {{spirited}} Sketches, full of Variety and Glow" [...] would not fit on [...] "the little bit (two Inches wide) of Ivory on which <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> so fine a Brush, as produces little effect after much labour." [...] Austen novels have often been characterized as [...] "country house novels" [...] or as [...] "comedies of manners". Comedies of manners are concerned [...] "with the relations and intrigues of gentlemen and ladies living in a polished and sophisticated society" [...] and the comedy {{is the result of}} [...] "violations of social conventions and decorum, and relies for its effect in great part on the wit and sparkle of the dialogue." [...] However, Austen's novels also have important fairy tale elements to them. Pride and Prejudice follows the traditional Cinderella plot while [...] "Persuasion rewrites the Cinderella narrative, as it shifts the fairy tale's emphasis from the heroine's transformation into a beauty to the prince's second look at her face." [...] However, Fanny, in Mansfield Park, rejects the Prince Charming character and at least one scholar has suggested that in this Austen is signalling [...] "a general attack on the dangers of 'fiction'".|$|E

2500|$|Regardless, Clooney was {{determined}} {{to stay with the}} role. Loyal to the script, Clooney helped convince executives to support certain aspects of the film (such as the exploding cow scene) even after he was urged to drop out of production, as his contract called for his compensation with or without his decision to stay in the film. After a number of arguments, Clooney wrote Russell a letter that criticized Russell's behavior in a last attempt to make peace between the two, days before another fight would break out during the filming of the movie's finale. In it, the three lead characters attempt to escort Iraqi rebels across the border to Iran. There were a number of actors and extras in the scene, as well as other elements, such as helicopters flying overhead and landing {{in the center of the}} location. The fight began after an extra was having difficulty throwing Ice Cube's character to the ground. After a number of takes, Russell came to the extra and put him through the motions of the action. Some individuals present on the set during the incident state that Russell was simply showing the extra how to convincingly act in the scene. However, Clooney and others thought that Russell had violently thrown the extra to the ground. Clooney recalls: [...] "We were trying to get a shot and then he went berserk. He went nuts on an extra." [...] Clooney approached Russell and began criticizing him again, coming to the extra's defense. The two began shouting at one another before entering a physical fight. Second assistant director Paul Bernard was so fed up with the experience when the fight broke out that he put down his camera and walked off the set, effectively quitting. Clooney concludes, [...] "Will <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> David ever again? Absolutely not. Never. Do I think he's tremendously talented and do I think he should be nominated for Oscars? Yeah." [...] Russell offered a different view, saying [...] "we're both passionate guys who are the two biggest authorities on the set," [...] and maintaining that the two continue to be friends. Ice Cube felt the conflict helped the film, saying [...] "it kind of kicked the set into a different gear where everybody was focused and we finished strong. I wouldn't mind if the director and the star got into an argument on all of my movies." ...|$|E
