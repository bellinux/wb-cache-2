5|$|Bogoljub Petranović {{collected}} Bosnian Serb lyric folk {{poems and}} published them in 1867 {{in a separate}} book (Српске народне пјесме из Босне (Женске)). The First Bosnian-Serb Calendar for the Common Year 1869 (Први босанско-српски календар за просту годину 1869), consisting of 58 pages, was edited by Jovan R. Džinić. In Serbian tradition, calendars contained more than just calendarical data and were also popular literary and educational almanacs. Džinić's calendar <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an educational, rather than literary, character.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} too, a {{marriage}} was arranged between {{the son of}} Matad, Mormaer of Atholl, and the daughter of Haakon Paulsson, Earl of Orkney. The marriage temporarily secured the northern frontier of the Kingdom, and held out the prospect that a son of one of David's Mormaers could gain Orkney and Caithness for the Kingdom of Scotland. Thus, by the time Henry I died on 1 December 1135, David <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Scotland under his control than ever before.|$|E

Since his departure, he has {{released}} seven studio albums (including one instrumental), a live album, two compilation albums, two covers projects, two DVDs, and two EPs (with his then-wife, Sandra McCracken). While these have been less commercially successful than his work with Caedmon's Call, Webb has <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a free hand to shape his work to his vision.|$|E

Ipomoea quamoclit has leaves that are more divided, resembling a pine bough, and look more like a cypress vine. Ipomoea coccinea <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a red orange color while I. hederifolia <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a darker, red color. Also, they <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a pinched shaped seed. Their leaves are lobed but not separated into leaflets. There is one leaf per node along the stem; the edge of the leaf blade depends, some have teeth and lobes.|$|R
5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which {{all members of}} the legislature (but not the governor) were up for election, the shutdown was a major campaign issue. The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature, giving the DFL full control of the state government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably was one reason for their electoral defeat. However, other national and state issues may have <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an influence on the result. The presidential race was also on the ballot, as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment, which had been put on the ballot by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E
5|$|The Dinosaur Park Formation, home to Prosaurolophus maximus, is {{interpreted}} as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and flowering plants. In this well-studied formation, P. maximus is only known from the upper part, which <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a marine influence than the lower section. It {{was the most common}} hadrosaurine of this section, which was deposited about 75.5million years ago. The Dinosaur Park Formation was also home to well-known dinosaurs like the horned Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Chasmosaurus, fellow duckbills Gryposaurus, Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus, and Parasaurolophus, tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus, and armored Edmontonia and Euoplocephalus.|$|E

25|$|In 1880 Gude had {{between five}} and eight students, but this number had shrunk {{to two or three}} by 1890. In part this {{reduction}} of pupils was {{due to a lack of}} interest in the Berlin academy, as explained to Gude by Prince Eugén, Duke of Närke who wrote that he, as well as numerous other young artists, <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a taste for French art than German.|$|E

25|$|As such, the Scottish branch {{has always}} had strong links with Northern Ireland, and tends to be largest {{wherever}} there are most descendants of Irish Protestants. In 1881, three-quarters of its lodge masters were born in Ireland and, when compared to Canada, the Scottish branch has been both smaller (no more than two percent of adult male Protestants in west central Scotland have ever been members) and <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an Ulster link.|$|E
25|$|The United States imposed an {{arms embargo}} on Cuba on March 14, 1958 during the armed {{conflict}} between rebels led by Fidel Castro and the Fulgencio Batista regime. The armed conflict violated U.S. policy which had permitted {{the sale of}} weapons to Latin-American countries that {{were a part of}} the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) {{as long as they were}} not used for hostile purposes. The arms embargo <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an impact on Batista than the rebels. After the Castro socialist government came to power on January 1, 1959, Castro made overtures to the United States, but was rebuffed by the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, which by March began making plans to help overthrow him. Congress did not want to lift the embargo.|$|E

25|$|A {{group of}} psychologists {{conducted}} a study to test the McGurk effect with Aphasia patients and speech reading. The subjects watched dubbed videos in which the audio and visual did not match. Then after they completed {{the first part of}} the experiment, the experimenters taught the aphasic patients to speech read, which is the ability to read lips. The experimenters then conducted the same test and found that the people still <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an advantage of audio only over visual only, but they also found that the subjects did better in audio-visual than audio alone. The patients also did improve their place of articulation and their manner of articulation. This all means that aphasic patients might benefit from learning how to speech read (lip reading).|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of Jesuit missionaries in Huron society was nonnegotiable. The Huron natives relied on French goods to facilitate life and warfare. Because the French would refuse trade to all Native American societies that denied relations with missionaries, the Huron natives <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a propensity towards Christian conversion. The Huron natives heavily relied on European goods to perform burial ceremonies known as The Huron Feast of the Dead. Trading with the French allowed for larger amounts of decorative goods {{to be buried}} during ceremonies as opposed to only a bare minimum. With the growing epidemics and high number of deaths, the Huron natives {{could not afford to}} lose relations with the French, fearing to anger their ancestors.|$|E
25|$|King Amadeus {{made him}} prince of Vergara. The Restoration caused a statue {{to him to}} be built near {{the gate of the}} Retiro Park in Madrid. A {{magnificent}} statue and fountain was raised in his memory at Logrono. Spaniards of all political factions, except Carlists and Ultramontanes, paid homage to his memory when he died at his La Rioja on 8 January 1879. His preferences were modest, his manners rather reserved but always kind and considerate of humble folk. He was a typical Spanish soldier-politician but <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the better traits of the soldier born and bred than of the arts of the statesman. His military traits did not always make it easy for him to accommodate himself to courtiers and professional politicians.|$|E

25|$|These stories can {{be linked}} to what is known about the Samoa-based Tu'i Manu'a Confederacy, ruled by the holders of the Tu'i Manú'a title, which confederacy likely {{included}} much of Western Polynesia and some outliers at the height of its power in the 10th and 11th centuries. Tuvalu is thought to have been visited by Tongans in the mid-13th century and was within Tonga's sphere of influence. The extent of influence of the Tuʻi Tonga line of Tongan kings and the existence of the Tuʻi Tonga Empire which originated in the 10th century is spoken of by the world-famous Captain James Cook during his visits to the Friendly Isles of Tonga. By observing such Pacific nations as Tuvalu and Uvea, the influence of the Tu'i Tonga is quite strong and has <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an impact in Polynesia and also parts of Micronesia than the Tu'i Manu'a.|$|E
25|$|On 19 February, Parma {{travelled}} to Roma's Stadio Olimpico {{to take on}} Luis Enrique's {{charges in}} a stadium where they had beaten Roma just once in 22 attempts. Raffaele Palladino was surprisingly selected to partner Sebastian Giovinco in Parma's front two and the decision paid dividends through two early forays into Roma territory. Roma then began to gain the upper hand and had two penalty appeals turned down and finally made their dominance pay through Fabio Borini, co-owned by Parma, who finished well past Mirante. Stefano Okaka, on loan from Roma to Parma, then replaced the injured Palladino just before half-time. Roma had by far the better of the first half, but had made just one chance. In the second half, Parma <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the ball in Roma's half, but Roma had numerous attempts on goal and the 1–0 defeat, the first of Donadoni's reign, could have been heavier.|$|E
25|$|The second {{portion of}} the show, called the olio, was {{historically}} the last to evolve, as its real purpose was {{to allow for the}} setting of the stage for act three behind the curtain. It <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a variety show structure. Performers danced, played instruments, did acrobatics, and demonstrated other amusing talents. Troupes offered parodies of European-style entertainments, and European troupes themselves sometimes performed. The highlight was when one actor, typically one of the endmen, delivered a faux-black-dialect stump speech, a long oration about anything from nonsense to science, society, or politics, during which the dim-witted character tried to speak eloquently, only to deliver countless malapropisms, jokes, and unintentional puns. All the while, the speaker moved about like a clown, standing on his head and almost always falling off his stump at some point. With blackface makeup serving as fool's mask, these stump speakers could deliver biting social criticism without offending the audience, although the focus was usually on sending up unpopular issues and making fun of blacks' ability to make sense of them. Many troupes employed a stump specialist with a trademark style and material.|$|E
