40|$|AbstractOur {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effect of mid-infrared (MIR) homogenizer efficiency on accuracy and repeatability of Fourier transform MIR predicted fat, true protein, and anhydrous lactose determination given by traditional filter and partial least squares (PLS) prediction models. Five homogenizers with different homogenization performance based on laser light-scattering particle size analysis were used. Repeatability and accuracy were determined by conducting 17 sequential readings on <b>milk</b> <b>homogenized</b> externally to the instrument (i. e., control) and unhomogenized milk. Milk component predictions on externally <b>homogenized</b> <b>milks</b> were affected by variation in homogenizer performance, but the magnitude of effect were small (i. e., < 0. 025 %) when milks were pumped through both efficient and inefficient homogenizers within a MIR milk analyzer. Variation in the in-line MIR homogenizer performance on unhomogenized milks had a much larger effect on accuracy of component testing than on repeatability. The increase of particle size distribution [d(0. 9) ] from 1. 35 to 3. 03 μm (i. e., fat globule diameter above which 10 % of the volume of fat is contained) due to poor homogenization affected fat tests the most; traditional filter based fat B (carbon hydrogen stretch; − 0. 165 %), traditional filter-based fat A (carbonyl stretch; − 0. 074 %), and fat PLS (− 0. 078 %) at a d(0. 9) of 3. 03 μm. Variation in homogenization efficiency also affected traditional filter-based true protein test (+ 0. 012 %), true protein PLS prediction (− 0. 107 %), and traditional filter-based anhydrous lactose test (+ 0. 027 %) at a d(0. 9) of 3. 03 μm. Effects of variation in homogenization on anhydrous lactose PLS predictions were small. The accuracy of both traditional filter models and PLS models were influenced by poor homogenization. The value of 1. 7 µm for a d(0. 9) used by the USDA Federal Milk Market laboratories as a criterion to make the decision to replace the homogenizer in a MIR milk analyzer appears to be a reasonable limit, given the magnitude of effect on the accuracy of fat tests. In the future, as new PLS models are developed to measure other components in milk, the sensitivity of the accuracy of the predictions of these models to factors such as variation of homogenizer performance should be determined as part of the ruggedness testing during PLS model development...|$|R

Purpose of the work: {{development}} and investigation of devices and methods which {{make it possible}} to reduce the power consumption of the dispersion process in slit homogenizers without deteriorating the quality of the product.

40|$|Foaming is an {{important}} process {{in the production of}} many food products. It usually involves mechanical agitation or gas injection. Foaming of milk for making cappuccino coffee, a common practice in many countries, involves the injection of steam into cold milk until the temperature reaches ∼ 65 °C. However, it is also possible to foam milk at this temperature using mechanical agitation or air bubbling. The objective of this research was to compare mechanical agitation, steam injection and air bubbling for foaming different types of milk. Five types of milk were chosen, namely reconstituted skim milk, pasteurized skim <b>milk,</b> pasteurized <b>homogenized</b> full-cream <b>milk,</b> UHT skim milk and UHT full-cream milk. Foaming characteristics were assessed in terms of foam stability and foam strength. There was little difference in the stability of the foams produced by the three methods of foaming but steam injection produced significantly stronger foams compared to air bubbling while the effect of mechanical agitation relative to steam and air bubbling varied considerably between milk types. Overall, foams with greater stability and strength were produced from the skim milks than from full-cream milks with the difference being most pronounced when mechanical agitation was used.

There was {{a reduction in the}} turbidity, but viscosity of milk was not affected. The size of the casein micelles, fat globules and soluble particles, respectively, after 60 min of sonication were 174 nm, 157 nm and 89 nm at 20 W and 172 nm, 175 nm and 84 nm at 41 W in comparison to 178 nm, 170 nm and 136 nm for unsonicated samples. The whey proteins in the milk were denatured and formed soluble whey-whey/whey-casein aggregates, which further interacted with casein micelles to form micellar aggregates during the initial 30 min of sonication. Prolonged sonication resulted in the partial disruption of some whey proteins from these aggregates. Industrial relevance: Ultrasonic processing is a promising technique, which could be adapted in food processing sector. The minor changes to the milk, which are imparted by the shear forces of the acoustic cavitation, foresee the potential for optimizing this technique for industrial applications. The optimization process needed, depends on the functionality and the end products, such as food emulsions using bioactives. The optimization can be achieved by fine tuning the power density, temperature, processing time, etc. This study reports on the processing effect of ultrasound on a simple food matrix (milk) in view of establishing a base to extend the investigation to other complex foods...|$|R

In this paper, the influence of the dairy fat structure on the biochemical andtextural characteristics of curds coagulated by an extract of Calotropis procera leaves was studied. Standardizedmilks were reconstituted with the same contents in protein (35 g·kg− 1) and fat (35 g·kg− 1) but with differentstructures of fat i. e. <b>homogenized</b> anhydrous <b>milk</b> fat (HAMF), <b>homogenized</b> cream (HC) and non-homogenizedcream (NHC). As expected, the size distributions of fat globules in the different milks were different. After theircoagulations by the plant extract, the physico-chemical characteristics of the curds and respective wheys weredetermined. No difference was observed in the coagulation time between the three milks but the whey removedmore quickly from HAMF and HC curds than NHC-curd. The biochemical analyses of curds revealed a lowercontent in dry matter and fat in the NHC-curd compared to HAMF- and HC-curds. Otherwise, the NHC-wheyexhibited the highest amount of fat. Observations by confocal microscopy showed that the fat globules werehomogenously distributed and well trapped in the protein networks of HAMF- and HC-curds. In the NHC-curd,the fat globules were located in whey pockets, with less connectivity with the protein network. The texturalanalysis showed that the NHC-curd was more elastic, soft and adhesive than HAMF- and HC-curds.

The most acceptable cheese was from ultrafiltered retentate heated for 16 sec at 76. 7 °C before cheese making. Organoleptic tests showed that samples highest in calcium content ranked highest in acceptability. Acidification with citric acid removed more calcium than phosphoric acid and resulted in softer cheese than the control cheese (non-acidified). Slight bitterness was observed when excessive starter and low salt (NaCl) concentration were used. Addition of salt to the retentate prior to heating caused thickening of the retentate before 70 °C was reached. Extending the heating time increased the tendency toward mealiness in the cheese...|$|R

In this work, <b>homogenized</b> whole <b>milk</b> was fortified with iron, magnesium and zinc, individually and collectively, shortly before ultra-high-temperature (UHT) processing (145  °C, 6  s). Sulphates of iron, magnesium and zinc were added to give total concentrations (natural plus added) of approximately 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of the recommended daily intakes (RDI) per litre of the UHT milk. The highest concentrations (100 % RDI) were 8, 320 and 16  mg. L− 1 for iron, magnesium and zinc, respectively. The fortified milks were analysed to determine the distribution of the minerals, their sensory characteristics and their stability during storage. Zinc and iron preferentially became associated with the casein fraction, while most of the magnesium remained in the serum phase. Some sensory panellists could perceive a different taste in UHT milk supplemented to 75 % of the RDI per litre, but not in milks supplemented to 50 %. During storage at 30  °C of milks supplemented to 50 %, changes in flavour were detected in milks supplemented with zinc and iron after 30 and 60  days, respectively; this generally corresponded with increases in oxidation. Viscosity and protein hydrolysis also increased but not to detrimental levels.
