40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} the {{relationship}} between perceived employability (PE) and turnover intention is stronger when job resources (job control, social support from the supervisor and colleagues) are low. Results from a prospective study one year apart were similar in samples of Finnish university (N = 1314) and hospital workers (N = 308). The interaction between PE and job control related significantly <b>to</b> <b>turnover</b> intention at Time 2 in both samples, and in the hospital sample also when controlling for turnover intention at Time 1 : PE related positively <b>to</b> <b>turnover</b> intention when job control was low. Furthermore. PE at Time I was not significantly related and job resources at Time 1 were negatively related <b>to</b> <b>turnover</b> intention at Time 2. For social support from colleagues in particular, this relationship held when controlling for Time 1 turnover intention. Thus, PE does not present a risk of turnover intention, unless job control is low. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
