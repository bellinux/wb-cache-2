5|$|Kovalainen's car had {{apparently}} been fitted with mismatched tyres at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> during the first stint, meaning that the tyres spun {{in the opposite direction}} to which they were designed, causing his understeer. At his first pit stop his team, not realising the cause of the problem, had adjusted his front wing to compensate for the understeer and replaced the tyres correctly. This caused further handling problems, and eventually led to his retirement.|$|E
5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} ghost stories, “chuyện ma”, which {{relate to the}} manner in which ghosts haunt <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> Vietnam. Ghosts are present in turns in <b>the</b> roads where <b>car</b> {{accidents}} occur on a regular basis. There is a general understanding that it is at these places that ghosts pop out in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> causing them to go off the road or hit oncoming cars.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the video was meant to {{illustrate}} the lyrics of the song. It depicts the sexual fantasies of a rich and bored housewife played by Beyoncé who tries to seduce her man while having breakfast at her house wearing a white robe. The video opens with various shots of a big mansion in which the singer is seen {{in one of the}} rooms. She tries to get her man's attention while he reads a newspaper. As he does not notice her, she throws a napkin on the floor and her female servant comes to lift it. The clip transitions to scenes of Beyoncé dressed in a Victorian jeweled outfit with a mask in her hands, lip-syncing the lyrics and dancing to the rhythm of the song. Afterwards, she is seen entering a limousine in which Jay-Z is already inside. Scenes of Beyoncé with a black coat and lingerie walking in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> are also intertwined throughout.|$|E
5|$|The No. 9 Audi {{began to}} fall off the race pace after {{multiple}} visits to the garage for repairs to its hybrid system, but the No. 7 Audi kept fighting as Lotterer reset the fastest lap of the race with a three minutes and 17.476 seconds time. KCMG had an anxious moment when Lapierre missed the Indianapolis corner, but recovered with marshal assistance without losing the LMP2 class lead. The No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari slowed on course {{and came to the}} garage with gearbox issues, handing the LMGTE Pro lead back to Corvette and allowing the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari to climb to second place after recovering from its earlier issues. Vanthoor drove his car into his pitbox with gearbox problems but his team were unable to repair it before the race's conclusion and retired. Jann Mardenborough's Nissan came to a halt at the Porsche Curves after smoke bellowed out of the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> as the gearbox failed, leaving Nissan with a single car left circulating. Light rain {{began to fall}} on portions of the circuit in the final hour, but it was not heavy enough to affect the race. Dalla Lana, having led the previous 125 laps in LMGTE Am and within forty five minutes of the race finish, went straight on at the Ford Chicane and crashed heavily into an outside tyre barrier, ending the car's run and promoting the SMP Ferrari to the class lead which it held to the finish. Dalla Lana was unhurt.|$|E
50|$|The Italian Studebaker {{importer}} commissioned two-door and four-door redesigns from Francis Lombardi and Pietro Frua respectively. These {{were first}} shown in November 1960, at the Turin Auto Show. Both designs {{came in for}} criticism regarding <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> but were otherwise well regarded. Intended for small-scale production for the Italian market, it is unknown if any were built aside from the display examples.|$|R

25|$|All six F90s used a Ferrari Testarossa chassis which Pininfarina used {{to sculpt}} {{an entirely new}} body and {{interior}} on top of. The engines were stock units, producing 390bhp to the rear wheels, but the radiators were moved to the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vignale {{delivered}} {{the body of}} the new car directly to the Geneva show. As this left no time to install the engine, it was displayed separately in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> The design retained the gull-wing door concept from The Bug and the car attracted widespread interest and acclaim.|$|E

5000|$|The 6 HP [...] "Charron Type TC" [...] {{represented}} a {{return for the}} prewar [...] "Charronette". The 4-cylinder engine had grown to 1057 cc and the radiator was moved in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> sat on a 2300 mm wheelbase.|$|R
50|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new theming, {{the wooden}} {{superstructure}} was painted indigo, and <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> repainted {{to mimic the}} Fairy Oddparents characters from the show; one train pink and the other green, with the fairies' faces on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> To depict these characters as roller coaster trains is accurate to the television show because on screen, the fairies can change their shape at will, though their faces always remain visible on whatever they become.|$|R
25|$|The X300, {{introduced}} in 1994, was stylistically intended {{to evoke the}} image of the more curvaceous Series XJ. The <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was redesigned significantly to return to four individual round headlamps that provided definition to the sculptured hood. Mechanically, it was similar to the XJ40 that it replaced.|$|E
25|$|The American {{models were}} facelifted for the 1966 model year with more squared-off {{front and rear}} styling. The <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was {{extended}} three inches (76mm), that increase allowed the optional air conditioning to be installed with the new 199, and 232 in-line six-cylinder engines, which were longer than the previous 195.6 versions.|$|E
25|$|One {{innovation}} was {{the attention}} paid to passive safety. The car featured a robust chassis providing above average side impact protection, an unusually short steering column with the steering gear set well back from the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> and a fuel tank placed in a carefully protected location above the rear axle {{in order to minimize}} fire risk {{in the event of an}} accident.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{drive-in}} theaters had to {{deal with}} sound issues. The original Hollingshead drive-in had speakers installed on the tower itself which caused a sound delay affecting patrons at <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drive-in's field. In 1935, the Pico Drive-in Theater attempted to solve this problem by having a row <b>of</b> speakers in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> [...] In 1941, RCA introduced in-car speakers with individual volume controls which solved the noise pollution issue and provided satisfactory sound to drive-in patrons.|$|R

25|$|Components of the {{bodywork}} {{were replaced}} with slightly revised carbon fibre and kevlar panels. The under tray {{was replaced with}} a flat version for better stability at high speeds. A second seat and leather upholstery were installed in the cramped cockpit, {{as well as a}} video screen for DVD playback in later years. A small compartment was added to the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to carry luggage. A hydraulic suspension system was also added to meet German ride height requirements for street cars.|$|E
25|$|These {{sets were}} branded for New Zealand Rail's {{suburban}} operator Cityline, {{and carried the}} Cityline branding and logo under the central four windows on the car body side. The NZR logo was painted in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> numbers at either end. Following the sale of NZ Rail Ltd to Wisconsin Central and the rebranding of suburban services as Tranz Metro, the NZR logos and Cityline branding were deleted and replaced with the Tranz Metro logo {{in the place of}} the former Cityline branding.|$|E
25|$|At 6:14am, as {{the police}} were taking details, {{they were told that}} a man had run into a red Peugeot further ahead on the same road. The driver saw Duggan move onto the road in front of him. The car swerved from the inside lane to the outside, but the driver said Duggan leapt in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> arms raised and mouth open. The car hit him, denting the {{passenger}} door and shattering the passenger window and windscreen, and throwing Duggan into the path of a blue Golf, which ran over him. He was certified dead at the scene at 6:35am.|$|E

25|$|Each car is {{required}} to display its number on each door {{of the car and}} on its roof. The <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and bottom of the rear bumper are required to match the decal specifications of the car manufacturer. Each car {{is required}} to display a series of around 30 NASCAR sponsor decals just to the left of each door and on the front fenders. These contingency decals represent series sponsors and bonus money teams are eligible to earn during the race, but may be omitted in the event in which they conflict with the team's sponsors or moral beliefs. The series sponsor's logo is displayed on top of the windshield, called the windshield header or windshield banner.|$|E
25|$|The {{first car}} left {{the works in}} January 1897, fitted with a Panhard engine, {{followed}} in March by Daimler-engined cars. The first Coventry Daimler-engined product made its maiden run in March 1897. By mid-year they were producing three of their own cars a week and producing Léon Bollée cars under licence. Lawson claimed to have made 20 cars by July 1897 making the Daimler Britain's first motor car to go into serial production, an honour that is also credited to Humber Motors who had also displayed, but in their case their production models, at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1896. The Daimlers had a twin-cylinder, 1526cc engine, mounted at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> four-speed gearbox and chain drive to the rear wheels.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the main}} options {{included}} the sunroof $2390, satellite navigation $3800, rear-seat DVD players $3900, Xenon headlights $1800, tyre pressure monitoring system $1395. Inside it features Nappa leather on the seats. The braking system on the Senator comes with ABS with twin-piston front callipers and grooved discs. The specially designed rear suspension has a self-levelling feature, so if the Senator was towing a trailer, instead of the weight forcing the back down and causing the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to go up, the rear suspension would harden itself and therefore keeping the car levelled and aerodynamic. This feature {{is also on the}} current E-series Senator Signature and has been optioned on Holden models as far back as WH Caprice in 1999.|$|E
