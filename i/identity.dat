40|$|This paper {{presents}} algebraic <b>identities</b> and algebraic query optimization for a parametric {{model for}} temporal databases. The parametric model has several features {{not present in}} the classical model. In this model a key is explicitly designated with a relation and an operator is available to change the key. The algebra for the parametric model is three-sorted; it includes relational expressions that evaluate to relations, domain expressions that evaluate to time domains, and boolean expressions that evaluate to TRUE or FALSE. The <b>identities</b> in the parametric model are classified as weak <b>identities</b> and strong <b>identities.</b> Weak <b>identities</b> in this model are largely counterparts of the <b>identities</b> in classical relational databases. Rather than establishing weak <b>identities</b> from scratch, a meta inference mechanism, introduced in the paper, allows weak <b>identities</b> to be induced from their classical counterpart. On the other hand, the strong <b>identities</b> will be established from scratch. An algorithm for algebraic optimization to transform a query to an equivalent query that will execute more efficiently is presented...|$|R
