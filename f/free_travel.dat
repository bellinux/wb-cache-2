5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine {{with him in the}} executive dining room by sending them a blue chip that had the meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running of the railroad. Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to <b>free</b> <b>travel.</b> Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>free</b> <b>travelling</b> speed {{and the risk}} of involvement in a casualty crash was explored using a case control study design in two studies conducted in South Australia by the Road Accident Research Unit; one in 60 km/h speed limit zones in metropolitan Adelaide; and one in 80 km/h or greater speed limit zones in rural South Australia. Exponential increases in crash risk associated with high <b>free</b> <b>travelling</b> speeds were found in both studies and no evidence was found for an increase in risk at low <b>free</b> <b>travelling</b> speeds. Hypothetical calculations on the effect of lowering <b>free</b> <b>travelling</b> speeds in both these studies indicated that significant reductions in casualty crashes could be expected from even small reductions in <b>free</b> <b>travelling</b> speeds. The results of an alcohol case control study conducted by the Road Accident Research Unit in metropolitan Adelaide were compared to the <b>free</b> <b>travelling</b> speed studies and it was found that driving with a blood alcohol concentration of 0. 05 g/lOOmL equates to roughly the same increase in risk (about double) as travelling 5 km/h faster in a metropolitan area and 10 km/h faster in a rural area.

40|$|Modified {{logistic}} regression modelling {{was used to}} reanalyse <b>free</b> <b>travelling</b> speed case control data in an urban 60 km/h speed limit environment. An exponentiated second order polynomial function was used to model the relative risk {{of being involved in}} a casualty crash based on <b>free</b> <b>travelling</b> speed. The relative risk was found to approximately double for each 5 km/h increase in <b>free</b> <b>travelling</b> speed. This curve and the original data were then used to estimate the effects of various hypothetical speed reduction scenarios. Illegal speeding was found to be a major factor in casualty crashes and it was found that even very small reductions in the speeds of vehicles in general could be expected to result in a major reduction in the frequency of casualty crashes in an urban area.

5|$|Following a {{satisfactory}} inspection {{carried out by}} Major Marindin of the Board of Trade on 3 September 1892, the line between Paddock Wood and Hope Mill, for Goudhurst and Lamberhurst was opened to passenger and goods traffic nine days later. The first service drawn by Cudworth E1 class 2-4-0 No. 112 left Hope Mill at 08:25 and <b>free</b> <b>travel</b> was offered throughout the day. The official opening took place on 1 October 1892, and services were extended to Hawkhurst on 4 September 1893. The line was worked by the SER (soon to become the SECR) which formally absorbed the Cranbrook and Paddock Wood Railway on 29 January 1900.|$|E

5000|$|Wycliffe Kiyingi was a Ugandan playwright whose plays {{influenced}} the <b>free</b> <b>travelling</b> theatre at Makerere University {{in the mid}} 1960s. Kiyingi was the first Ugandan to stage a play at the National Theatre in 1953, with his play [...] "Pio Mbereenge Kamulaali". The play {{was the first in}} a local language to be staged at the National Theatre. Kiyingi formed the country’s first theatre group to comprise native Ugandans; the African Artistes Association.The group adopted the mode of a travelling theatre, taking its productions to different parts of the central region. It is from there that other theatre groups (such as the Makerere <b>Free</b> <b>Travelling</b> Theatre of the 1960s) got inspiration, leading {{to the development of a}} fully-fledged local theatre movement in the country. Kiyingi was also the pioneer native writer of radio and TV drama in Uganda in the late 1950s.|$|R

5|$|After almost 22 {{months of}} construction, {{the road was}} opened {{for a day of}} <b>free</b> <b>travel</b> on October 20, 1956 between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. An {{estimated}} 12,000 to 15,000 cars traveled on the turnpike. Many of those motorists traveled to Lawrence for a football game between the University of Kansas and University of Oklahoma. Official opening ceremonies were held at interchanges {{in each of the three}} major cities on October 25. The Kansas City celebration included Gene Autry jumping his horse through a large paper map of the turnpike. John Masefield, the British Poet Laureate, wrote a tribute to commemorate the occasion. On the first day after the official opening, 7,197 vehicles traveled the turnpike, with 81 toll collectors and 50 maintenance workers on duty. The turnpike originally had 14 interchanges; by 2012, there were 22.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>free</b> <b>travelling</b> speed {{and the risk}} of involvement in a casualty crash in a 60 km/h speed limit zone was quantified using a case control study design. The 151 case vehicles were passenger cars involved in crashes in the Adelaide metropolitan area which were investigated at the scene by the NHMRC Road Accident Research Unit and reconstructed using the latest computer aided crash reconstruction techniques. The 604 control vehicles were passenger cars matched to the cases by location, direction of travel, time of day, and day of week and their speeds were measured with a laser speed gun. It was found that the risk of involvement in a casualty crash doubled with each 5 km/h increase in <b>free</b> <b>travelling</b> speed above 60 km/h. Hypothetical speed reductions applied to the case vehicles indicated large potential safety benefits from even small reductions in travelling speed, particularly on arterial roads.

5|$|The {{first modern}} wave of {{economic}} globalization began {{during the period}} of 1870–1914, marked by transportation expansion, record levels of migration, enhanced communications, trade expansion, and growth in capital transfers. During the mid-nineteenth century, the passport system in Europe dissolved as rail transport expanded rapidly. Most countries issuing passports did not require their carry, thus people could travel freely without them. The standardization of international passports would not arise until 1980 under the guidance of the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization. From 1870 to 1915, 36 million Europeans migrated away from Europe. Approximately 25 million (or 70%) of these travelers migrated to the United States, while most of the rest reached Canada, Australia, Argentina, and Brazil. Europe itself experienced an influx of foreigners from 1860 to 1910, growing from 0.7% of the population to 1.8%. While the absence of meaningful passport requirements allowed for <b>free</b> <b>travel,</b> migration on such an enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation, particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of steam-powered boats over traditional sailing ships. World railway mileage grew from 205,000 kilometers in 1870 to 925,000 kilometers in 1906, while steamboat cargo tonnage surpassed that of sailboats in the 1890s. Advancements such as the telephone and wireless telegraphy (the precursor to radio) revolutionized telecommunication by providing instantaneous communication. In 1866, the first transatlantic cable was laid beneath the ocean to connect London and New York, while Europe and Asia became connected through new landlines.|$|E
