The thesis contains the characteristics and the description of ammonia as dangerous substance, with focus on its toxicity and it analyses the results of a possible leakage.

40|$|A general {{hypothesis}} is presented {{for the decline}} in the rate of ethanol production (per unit of cell protein) during batch fermentation. Inhibition of ethanol production is proposed to result from the intracellular accumulation of AMP during the transition from growth to the stationary phase.

When assayed in vitro in the presence of ATP and AMP concentrations equivalent to those within cells at different stages of fermentation, hexokinase activity declined in parallel with the in vivo decline in the rate of ethanol production. The coupling of glycolytic flux and fermentation to cell growth via degradation products of RNA may be of evolutionary advantage for Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

An easy way to get started on the environmental review is to map out the boundaries of the EMS and highlight areas where there are environmental considerations (Eco‐Mapping), this could include chemical storage points, location of waste, chimneys etc. For that Khartoum North Industrial Area was selected as case study. The objectives of the study is to initiate and eco‐ mapping research. Study area: The spread of some significant air pollutants in random locations in two vital areas in Khartoum state namely, Khartoum North industrial Area and the university of Khartoum central campus, is monitored using Short‐term exposure limit (STEL) method. Methods and Tools: A portable gas detector which is capable of monitoring a range of atmospheric gases and combustibles simultaneously in an instant performance with a very low detection limits was used during {{the first two weeks of}} November 2007. Results and Conclusion: The concentration of selected gases (carbon monoxide and chlorine) over the targeted areas, reveals and increase with increased processing and its related activities, but those concentration were still below the effective <b>harmful</b> <b>concentrations</b> as indicated by SSMO (Sudanese Standards and Metrology Organization). Some of the monitored gases (H 2 S and NH 3) were absent or at lower rates than the detection limits. The possible causes and probable adverse impacts of these poisonous pollutants were addressed and some recommendations for getting rid of them were raised V aiming at a continual improvement of environmental behaviour and performance and for better management of the environment...|$|R
