500|$|III.1 {{opens with}} the Four Masters' ass narrating how <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "dropping asleep", {{he had heard}} and seen an {{apparition}} of Shaun the Post. As a result, Shaun re-awakens, and, floating down the Liffey in a barrel, is posed fourteen questions concerning the significance {{and content of the}} letter he is carrying. Shaun, [...] "apprehensive about being slighted, is on his guard, and the placating narrators never get a straight answer out of him." [...] Shaun's answers focus on his own boastful personality and his admonishment of the letter's author â€“ his artist brother Shem. After the inquisition Shaun loses his balance and the barrel in which he has been floating careens over and he rolls backwards out of the narrator's earshot, before disappearing completely from view.|$|E
2500|$|The parody {{generally}} {{follows the}} outline of The Lord of the Rings, including the preface, the prologue, poetry, and songs, while making light of what Tolkien made serious (e.g., [...] "He would have finished him off then and there, but pity stayed his hand. [...] It's a pity I've run out of bullets, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> went back up the tunnel..."). Names and words in the various languages are parodied with brand names that mimic their sounds (for example, Moxie and Pepsi replace Merry and Pippin). There are many topical references, including once-popular brand names. It has the distinction for a parody of having been continuously in print since it was first published.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{what can}} one trust, then?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> leant there. So feeble and insubstantial did he feel {{himself that he}} {{repeated}} the word aloud.|$|E
60|$|It was strange, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> even <b>as</b> <b>he</b> said it, that {{he could}} bring his lips so glibly to utter words that his heart detested.|$|R
60|$|The boy {{was rapidly}} {{changing}} to the man. His mother's words beating upon his brain aroused something in him {{which he had}} not hitherto acknowledged. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> deeply <b>as</b> <b>he</b> peered into her eyes, burning with resolution.|$|R
60|$|And all {{the while}} <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of Alftruda, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> hai seen her at Peterborough.|$|R
6000|$|Rufus {{noticed his}} hat and gloves on the table, and left him without saying more. [...] "The trouble with Amelius," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> closed the cottage gate, [...] "is not over yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It iss circumventin' you at {{your own}} trade, fightin' you wi' your own claymore, that I will be doin'," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> rose a second time, and swam softly with the stream.|$|E
6000|$|... "Looking for {{the girl}} had brought him into trouble, more than likely," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> rode away from Honnewell, taking a due south course. [...] "And what can have become of her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was waving}} {{to him from}} a one-seated phaeton, come alone to meet him--and she was the adorable, the perfect comrade. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> jubilantly <b>as</b> <b>he</b> strode along the platform: [...] "She's wonderful. Love her? Should say I do!" ...|$|R
60|$|Hodder <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> detected, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke these words, {{a certain}} {{relaxation}} of the tension.|$|R
6000|$|Poor Oliver! <b>He</b> little <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> lay {{sleeping}} in happy unconsciousness of all around him, {{that the board}} had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes. But they had. And this was it: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sat {{watching}} her from his stall {{that she was}} one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. Her voice was not great. She had warned him not to expect too much.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish they}} would all hang up their stockings," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> drove to the next chimney. [...] "It would save {{me a lot of}} time and I could then visit more {{children}} before daybreak." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will have}} to go slowly up the long hill, and I'll catch them then," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> tore over the ground, for he was a good runner and prided himself on his strong legs.|$|E
60|$|So perhaps <b>he,</b> too, <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{passed his}} hand across his brow, as if to sweep away some {{gathering}} dream, and sighing, rose and wandered along the cliffs, peering downward at every point and cranny, in search of fuel for the monastery from whence he came.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{like to be}} you; that's all I said," [...] <b>he</b> replied, <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> {{were saying}} what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> {{accurately}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll show Andrew that I {{mean to be}} on time," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> to himself, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{turned into}} the street upon which the stable was situated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Proud as Lucifer," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> drove away. [...] "Well, she's {{none the}} worse of that. I don't like your weak women--they're always sly. If Stephen Fair don't get better she'll {{be free and}} then--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Rufus {{handed her}} silently into the carriage, [...] "Fond of him, are you?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> walked away by himself. [...] "I reckon it's {{a sort of}} fondness that don't wear well, and won't stand washing." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{held out}} her hand, and Soames raised it to his lips. When he looked up, her face wore again that strange expression. 'I can't tell,' <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> went out; 'but I mustn't think--I mustn't worry: ...|$|E
60|$|There was no {{help for}} it. Bill Mills {{was obliged to}} stay on duty, in the old shepherd's absence, this evening as before, or give up his post and living. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> bravely <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could of what lay behind the Devil's Door, but with no great success, and was {{therefore}} in a measure relieved, even if awe-stricken, {{when he saw the}} forms of the Duke and Duchess strolling across the frosted greensward. The Duchess was a few yards in front of her husband and tripped on lightly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{not much}} further,' <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> to himself <b>as</b> <b>he</b> reached an avenue of walnut trees, when {{suddenly}} a voice spoke out from over his head, and made him jump.|$|R
6000|$|... "Marry again?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> to himself, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{rang the}} bell. [...] "Donna Brigida, {{was your first}} failure not enough for you? Are you going to try a second time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Siegmund woke {{with wonder}} in the morning. 'It {{is like the}} magic tales,' <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{realized}} where he was; 'and I am transported to a new life, to realize my dream! Fairy-tales are true, after all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> lit {{his cigar}} and {{examined}} his mustache {{in the mirror}} (kindly provided for that purpose in well-appointed hansoms)--"after all it is only, the dead who tell no tales, and make no inconvenient claims." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{may as well}} {{be caught}} by Redtail as Shadow," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> ran up the tree, [...] "but if my plan works out right, I won't be caught by either. Anyway, it is my very last chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tall," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{to himself}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> looked at her: [...] "dark, fine face, {{beautiful}} figure, large eyes; makes her own dresses; strange {{sort of person}} to meet at the Balfours' dances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't know as I blame yeh a bit. But, all the same, I'm {{glad you}} {{was working in}} it today," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> to hiniseif <b>as</b> <b>he</b> walked beside her horse toward the house.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Wilfred {{had thought it}} {{expedient}} to put his bicycle to greater speed, and indulge in a long whistle to show how contemptible <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> his sisters <b>as</b> <b>he</b> went out of hearing.|$|R
6000|$|... "If only {{somebody}} would {{come along with}} a wagon," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> gazed {{up and down the}} rather rough woodland road. [...] "I would willingly pay a half-dollar for a lift, as much as I need my money." ...|$|E
6000|$|Denis {{stepped down}} from the bench; tied insecurely and crookedly to the tentpole, the Union Jack hung limp on the windless air. [...] "If only I could do things like that!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> carried the bench back to the tea-tent.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is rather}} awkward," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> braced himself to battle, [...] "especially as I like that girl and don't {{want to hurt}} her feelings. Hullo! Miss Fregelius, are you taking the air? You should walk, or you will catch cold." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> of her <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sat at {{the table}} with George and his aged mother. They lived alone, and their lives were curiously silent. Once in a while a low-voiced question, and that was all.|$|R
6000|$|This apology left Francis no polite {{alternative}} but to grant the manager's request. 'There is {{an end to the}} Countess's wild scheme,' <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> to himself, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> retired for the night. 'So much the better for the Countess!' ...|$|R
60|$|Just {{then his}} father called him. So he wheeled the {{wheelbarrow}} {{back to its}} place, and told the corporal that he liked it very much. He wanted his father to engage one for him then, {{but he did not}} ask him. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had already expressed a wish for one, it would be better not to say any thing about it again, but to wait and let his father do <b>as</b> <b>he</b> pleased.|$|R
