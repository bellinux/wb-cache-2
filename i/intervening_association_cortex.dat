50|$|The <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> {{includes}} most of {{the cerebral}} surface {{of the brain and}} is responsible for processing that goes between the arrival of input in the primary sensory cortex and the generation of behaviour. Receives and integrates information from various parts of the brain and influences many cortical and subcortical targets. Inputs to the association cortices include the primary and secondary sensory and motor cortices, the thalamus, and the brain stem. The <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> projects to places including the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, and other association cortices. Examination of patients with damages to {{one or more of these}} regions, as well as noninvasive brain imaging, it has been found that the <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> is especially important for attending to complex stimuli in the external and internal environments. The temporal <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> identifies the nature of stimuli, while the frontal <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> plans behavioural responses to the stimuli.|$|R

This last observation currently highlights a point of controversy within the neuroscientific community. Sadato et al. (2004) concluded, in line with Bernstein et al.

40|$|Knockout of the {{mitochondrial}} complex I protein, NDUFS 4, profoundly increases {{sensitivity of}} mice to volatile anesthetics. In mice carrying an Ndufs 4 lox/lox gene, adeno-associated virus expressing Cre recombinase was injected into {{regions of the}} brain postulated to affect sensitivity to volatile anesthetics. These injections generated otherwise phenotypically wild type mice with region-specific, postnatal inactivation of Ndufs 4, minimizing developmental effects of gene loss. Sensitivities to the volatile anesthetics isoflurane and halothane were measured using loss of righting reflex (LORR) and movement in response to tail clamp (TC) as endpoints. Knockdown (KD) of Ndufs 4 in the vestibular nucleus produced resistance to both anesthetics for movement in response to TC. Ndufs 4 loss in the central and dorsal medial thalami and in the parietal <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> increased anesthetic sensitivity to both TC and LORR. Knockdown of Ndufs 4 only in the parietal <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> produced striking hypersensitivity for both endpoints, and accounted for half the total change seen in the global KO (Ndufs 4 (KO)). Excitatory synaptic transmission in the parietal <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> in slices from Ndufs 4 (KO) animals was hypersensitive to isoflurane compared to control slices. We identified a direct neural circuit between the parietal <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> and the central thalamus, consistent with a model in which isoflurane sensitivity is mediated by a thalamic signal relayed through excitatory synapses to the parietal <b>association</b> <b>cortex.</b> We postulate that the thalamocortical circuit is crucial for maintenance of consciousness and is disrupted by the inhibitory effects of isoflurane/halothane on mitochondria...|$|R

40|$|Neurons in sensory cortices {{are often}} topographically {{organized}} {{according to their}} response preferences. We here show that such an organization of response preferences also exists in multisensory <b>association</b> <b>cortex.</b> Using electrophysiological mappings we probed the modality preference to auditory and visual stimuli of neurons in the superior temporal <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> of non-human primates. We found that neurons preferring the same modality (auditory or visual) often co-occur in close spatial proximity, or occur intermingled with bimodal neurons. Neurons preferring different modalities, in contrast, occur spatially separated. This organization at the scale of individual neurons leads to extended patches of same modality preference when analyzed at the scale of millimeters, revealing larger scale regions that preferentially respond to the same modality. In addition, we find that neurons exhibiting signs of multisensory interactions, such as super- or sub-additive response summation, also occur in spatial clus ters. Together, these results reveal a spatial organization of modality preferences in a higher <b>association</b> <b>cortex,</b> and {{lend support to the}} notion that topographical organizations might serve as a general principle of integrating information within and across the sensory modalities...|$|R
40|$|Three cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) {{were trained}} preoperatively in visual {{discrimination}} learning for an auditory secondary reinforcer. Each new discrimination problem was solved {{on the basis}} of the secondary reinforcer, and primary reinforcement (food reward) was given only after a new problem had been solved. The animals learned 50 new problems in each daily session and it was therefore possible to assess accurately their average rate of learning new discrimination problems in this procedure. After the learning rate had stabilized preoperatively the animals were operated upon to transect the uncinate fascicle, the cortico-cortical pathway from visual <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> in the temporal lobe to prefrontal cortex. The animals' learning rate was unchanged after uncinate fascicle section.

40|$|Two {{principal}} {{findings in}} the Pearson et al. paper [73] are commented on here. The first is the regional selectivity within the cerebrum of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) which targets <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> and the primary olfactory cortex alone among regions of primary sensory cortex. The second finding is the clustering of NFT in columns of supra- and infra-granular layers of <b>association</b> <b>cortex.</b> We review recent evidence confirming these findings and comment on their possible significance. We consider that the most attractive hypothesis to explain {{the vulnerability of the}} olfactory system and <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> is the persistent neural plasticity of these regions. On this basis there would be no need to postulate a progressive spreading process. The columnar distribution of clustered NFT can be well understood in the context of recent concepts of columnar organization of the cerebral cortex. The original interpretation that this distribution of NFT reflects pathology in neurons subserving cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical connections seems to us to have stood the test of time. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.

Overlapping brainstem regions modulate visual pathways and REM sleep functions via gating of thalamocortical networks. A 66 -year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation developed abrupt–onset complex visual hallucinations with preserved insight and violent dream enactment behavior. Brain MRI showed restricted diffusion {{in the left}} rostrodorsal pons suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) was diagnosed on polysomnography. We investigated the integrity of ponto-geniculate-occipital circuits with seed-based resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) in this patient compared to 46 controls. Rs-fcMRI revealed significantly reduced functional connectivity between the lesion and lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN), and between LGN and visual <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> compared to controls. Conversely, functional connectivity between brainstem and visual <b>association</b> <b>cortex,</b> and between visual <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> and prefrontal cortex (PFC) was significantly increased in the patient. Focal damage to the rostrodorsal pons is sufficient to cause RBD and PH in humans, suggesting an overlapping mechanism in both syndromes.

The present study used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure brain correlates of mental stress induced by an arithmetic serial subtraction task in CAD and healthy subjects.

These same regions were activated within the CAD patient group during mental stress versus control conditions. In the group of healthy subjects, activation was significant only in the left inferior frontal gyrus during mental stress compared with counting control. Decreases in blood flow also were produced by mental stress in CAD versus healthy subjects in right thalamus (lateral dorsal, lateral posterior), right superior frontal gyrus (areas 32, 24, and 10), and right middle temporal gyrus (area 21) (in {{the region of the}} auditory <b>association</b> <b>cortex).</b> Of particular interest, a subgroup of CAD patients that developed painless myocardial ischemia during mental stress had hyperactivation in the left hippocampus and inferior parietal lobule (area 40), left middle (area 10) and superior frontal gyrus (area 8), temporal pole, and visual <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> (area 18), and a concomitant decrease in activation observed in the anterior cingulate bilaterally, right middle and superior frontal gyri, and right visual <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> (area 18) compared with CAD patients without myocardial ischemia.

40|$|Few microanatomical {{measures}} have been reliably correlated with cognitive measures in aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), particularly {{in the early stages}} of degeneration, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, cortical minicolumn organi-zation has been shown to correlate with cognitive ability in aging monkeys, and the present study extends this finding to humans. We have previously reported that minicolumn spacing of cells in human <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> is selectively reduced in normal aging (minicolumn thinning). The present study found that such mea-sures detected early disease changes in MCI as well as further minicolumn thinning and disruption in AD. Plaques, tangles, and minicolumns were quantified, postmortem, for 20 controls, 10 MCI, and 20 AD subjects. Minicolumn changes were correlated with premortem cognitive scores (mini-mental state examination and verbal fluency). Two regions were studied from each brain: <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> in the planum temporale (BA 22) and primary auditory cortex (BA 41).

40|$|An {{earlier study}} found that rhinal cortex ablations in the monkey (Macaca fascicularis) {{impaired}} delayed matching-to-sample only when the stimuli in the experiment came from a large population of possible stimuli, not when the stimulus population was small. The present experiment tested the idea that delayed matching-to-sample with a small stimulus population selectively engages the direct projection from visual <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> to the prefrontal cortex, bypassing the rhinal cortex. This selective involvement could explain the preservation, after rhinal cortex ablations, of memory for items drawn from a small stimulus population. We trained monkeys preoperatively in delayed matching-to-sample with large and small stimulus populations, exactly as in the earlier study, then examined the effect of sectioning the cortico-cortical pathway between visual <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> and prefrontal cortex, the uncinate fascicle. Uncinate fascicle section {{had no effect on}} postoperative performance of delayed matching-to-sample, with either large or small stimulus populations.

40|$|The {{prevalent}} {{concept in}} modular models {{is that there}} are discrete cortical domains dedicated more or less exclusively to such cognitive functions as visual discrimination, language, spatial attention, face recognition, motor programming, memory retrieval, and working memory.

Network models are predicated on the basic tenet that cognitive representations consist of widely distributed networks of cortical neurons. Cognitive functions, namely perception, attention, memory, language, and intelligence, consist of neural transactions within and between these networks. The present model postulates that memory and knowledge are represented by distributed, interactive, and overlapping networks of neurons in <b>association</b> <b>cortex.</b> Such networks, named cognits, constitute the basic units of memory or knowledge. The <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> of posterior-post-rolandic-regions contains perceptual cognits: cognitive networks made of neurons associated by information acquired through the senses.

At the bottom of that organization—that is, in parasensory and premotor cortex—cognits are small and relatively simple, representing simple percepts or motor acts. At the top of the organization—in temporo–parietal and prefrontal cortex—cognits are wider and represent complex and abstract information of perceptual or executive character. Posterior and frontal networks are associated by long reciprocal cortico–cortical connections. These connections support the dynamics of the perception–action cycle i...|$|R
