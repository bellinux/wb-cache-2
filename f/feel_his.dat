5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by the neighbors of the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did not agree with him, because he did not <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E
5|$|Flashbacks {{throughout}} the episode show the attempts {{of a teenage}} Dexter (Devon Graye) to <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> heart pound.

5|$|Tauranac, an {{engineer}} at heart, started to <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> Formula One budget of around £100,000 was a gamble {{he could not}} afford to take on his own and began to look around for an experienced business partner. He sold the company for £100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman Bernie Ecclestone, Rindt's former manager and erstwhile owner of the Connaught team. Tauranac stayed on to design the cars and run the factory.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{conceived}} around a protagonist whose abilities {{can not be}} measured through standardized evaluation; as such, he is mistakenly categorized as a poor performing student or an irregular. This premise served as a basis for the character, Tatsuya Shiba. Satō has two processes for scripting the story arcs: the first is to create scenarios to have characters behave and interact in certain ways; the second is to plan a scene, then script the story so it leads to that scene. Satō professed that he does not <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> characters are alive or have a will of their own when scripting them.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing <b>feel.</b> <b>His</b> lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E

5|$|Kikuta {{was born}} in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He first became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} ten after hearing songs by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. He began writing his own songs two years later, after listening to country blues music; it inspired him to study acoustic guitar and write his own songs in hope of one day becoming a singer/songwriter. He was also inspired as a child by music from movies. It was not until he got a synthesizer, however, that he began to <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> potential as a composer. Kikuta went on to earn an interdisciplinary degree in Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Cultural Anthropology from Kansai University, which he attended from 1981 to 1984. He never received any form of formal musical training, and instead taught himself by reading music theory books and listening {{to a wide variety of}} musical genres.|$|E
5|$|Miles, {{who just}} wants a normal life, is unhappy about having these abilities, and {{initially}} nauseated {{at the idea}} of risking his life to engage in superheroics, a reaction that Bendis wrote to further contrast Miles with Parker. However, after witnessing Spider-Man's death {{at the hands of the}} Green Goblin, the guilt-ridden Miles realizes he could have helped. After Ganke suggests he assume the mantle of Spider-Man, and learns from Gwen Stacy why Parker did what he did, Miles is inspired to try his hand at costumed crimefighting. During his first foray into costumed superheroics, he is confronted not only by those who <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> use of the Spider-Man costume is in bad taste, but also by Spider-Woman, a member of the government superhuman team, the Ultimates, over his use of the Spider-Man identity.|$|E
5|$|Most men {{typically}} just {{wear the}} towel provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, {{it is perfectly}} acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel to <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> penis, which, if well received, {{is the first step}} in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.|$|E

25|$|In fall 2003, Nadeau began {{discussions with}} MB2 Motorsports boss Jay Frye about a {{long-term}} comeback. Frye gave Nadeau a test at Concord Speedway, {{where he was}} unable to <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> car's brake pedal. He also suffered a loss of stamina during this test. Because of the effects of his accident, Nadeau had to learn to walk. He also experienced slurred speech. He undertook physical therapy five times during the week. This was later reduced to three when his condition improved. While Nadeau received a small financial settlement from NASCAR, it was not enough to pay for all of his rehabilitation, so he sold his large house near Lake Norman and moved to Davidson, North Carolina. He also suffered from depression caused by the loss of his racing career.|$|E
25|$|Around 1981 his {{scheme was}} {{discovered}} when suspicious regulators {{wrote to the}} vehicles' previous owners, whose addresses were on the dealer's applications, and learned what the odometers had {{said at the time}} of sale. He was arrested by federal authorities and indicted on 12 counts of mail fraud, a felony, for cars he had sold to five different dealers, some as many as five times over a two-year period. At his trial, presided over by district judge Barbara Brandriff Crabb, he admitted that he had rolled back the odometers, but denied that he had committed mail fraud since the dealers had sent the applications after they had bought the cars from him, therefore it wasn't necessary that they do so for him to have realized the proceeds of the odometer tampering. Before his trial in United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, his attorney, Peter Lewis Steinberg, moved that the jury be instructed that they could convict Schmuck on the lesser included charge of odometer tampering, at the time a misdemeanor, if they did not <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> actions constituted mail fraud.|$|E

25|$|Battle is raging outside. Arindal {{is anxious}} {{and refuses to}} lead the army out. Morald does so instead. Ada appears with her two {{children}} by Arindal. She seems to throw them into a fiery abyss. Meanwhile, defeated warriors rush in. Ada refuses to console Arindal saying {{she has come to}} torment him instead. More defeated warriors arrive with reports that Morald has disappeared, captured or dead. Then Harald, who was sent to bring reinforcements, comes. He reports that his army was defeated by one led by Ada. Arindal curses her. Zemina and Farzana express joy that Ada will remain immortal. But she sorrowfully explains that the fairy-king had required as a condition of her renouncing her immortality, that she conceal her fairy background from Arindal for eight years and on the last day torment him as best she can. If he cursed her, she would remain immortal and be turned to stone for a hundred years while he would go mad and die. In truth, Morald is not dead, the army Harald led was full of traitors, and the children are still alive. Already Arindal can <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> sanity slipping.|$|E

According to Touré of The New York Times in 1994, Wallace's lyrics [...] " [...] autobiographical details about crime and violence with emotional honesty". Marriott of The New York Times (in 1997) believed his lyrics were not strictly autobiographical and wrote he [...] "had a knack for exaggeration that increased sales". Wallace described his debut as [...] "a big pie, with each slice indicating a different {{point in my life}} involving bitches and niggaz... from the beginning to the end".|$|E
500|$|On 5 September 1945, {{just as the}} war had ended, Harrison died {{suddenly}} of hypertensive cerebrovascular disease {{at his home in}} the Melbourne suburb of Brighton; he was survived by his wife and daughter, and cremated. The Minister for Air, Arthur Drakeford, commented that [...] "all members of the service, and, indeed, all Australians interested in aviation, must <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> loss as the snapping of one of the last links with the pioneer days of flying". One of the original Deperdussins that Harrison ordered and helped assemble for the Central Flying School in 1914 later went on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.|$|E
500|$|Harper {{described}} {{the extent to}} which Duvall inhabited his character: [...] "Someone once said to me, 'Well, how's Robert Duvall?' and I said, 'I don't know Robert Duvall.

Duvall made an effort to help Harper, who was making her film debut. While preparing to shoot a scene in which Mac and Rosa Lee fight, he yelled at a make-up artist in front of Harper to make her angry and fuel her performance; he apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot.|$|E
