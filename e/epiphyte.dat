5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an <b>epiphyte.</b> The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E
5|$|Ficus aurea is {{a fast-growing}} tree. As a hemiepiphyte it germinates in {{the canopy of}} a host tree and begin life as an <b>epiphyte</b> before growing roots down to the ground. F. aurea is also a {{strangler}} fig (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots fuse and encircle the host tree. This usually results {{in the death of}} the host tree, since it effectively girdles the tree. Palms, which lack secondary growth, are not affected by this, but they can still be harmed by competition for light, water and nutrients. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, F. aurea trees regenerated from root suckers and standing trees.|$|E

40|$|Composition and {{distribution}} of vascular <b>epiphytes</b> were studied in three different areas at Obafemi Awolowo University estate, Nigeria. Each plot, in the selected area, was used for identification of host and <b>epiphytes.</b> Trees were carefully examined. Presence, positions on the host plants and life-forms of all the <b>epiphytes</b> were recorded. Diameter at breast height of the hosts, bark characteristics and height were determined. The climatic data of the areas were measured to determine the relationship between them and <b>epiphytes</b> distributions. Result showed 41 <b>epiphytes</b> belonging to 14 genera and 11 families were identified. Open area had {{the highest number of}} <b>epiphytes</b> (22) followed by forest patches (14) then secondary forest (five). The <b>epiphytes</b> were not host specific except epiphytic ferns and Ficus vogelii. Diameter at breast height has effect on the <b>epiphytes</b> distribution and composition. The distribution of <b>epiphytes</b> and environmental factors were lowest in the secondary forest. Moraceae was the most dominant host family (44. 8 %) while Nephrolepis undulata and Nephrolepis biserrata were the most common species of <b>epiphytes.</b> Most <b>epiphytes</b> preferred sub-canopy level, few occurred in the canopy level but none at emergent level.

40|$|Vascular <b>epiphytes</b> {{represent}} 10 % of {{the total}} vascular plants of the world. Nevertheless, because {{it is hard to}} reach them in the forest upper-canopy where they usually live, there are few studies (especially in Chile) about them. With the objective of identifying the vascular <b>epiphytes</b> growing on tree stems (under 1. 5 m height), we sampled three transects in an Olivillo old-growth stand, in the Rucamanque forest, in the central valley of south-central Chile, near the city of Temuco. Several variables were measured for both the vascular <b>epiphytes</b> and their host-trees. We studied the floristic composition of the vascular <b>epiphytes</b> community, and their relationship with their host-trees, as well as their sociability, cover, and frequency. Eight vascular <b>epiphytes</b> species were identified, corresponding to four genus distributed in three families: Hymenophyllum and Hymenoglossum (Hymenophyllaceae), Asplenium (Aspleniaceae) and Sarmienta (Gesneriaceae). We found only a non-statistically significant linear correlation between vascular <b>epiphytes</b> and their host-trees.

40|$|<b>Epiphytes</b> are plants {{susceptible}} to the current climate change due to continuous exposure of environmental changes. In this study, we review the <b>epiphytes</b> responses to fluctuations in their surrounding environments. Abiotic factors such as light and water are the important contributors towards the <b>epiphytes</b> growth. <b>Epiphytes</b> might suffer from environmental stresses namely high light intensity and water deficit, affecting its growth and physiological attributes. <b>Epiphytes</b> use several mechanisms to counter aforementioned problems and one of it is through changes of physiological pathways. Some of the <b>epiphytes</b> use Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) as protection system for survival in severe environments. Future studies should include more approaches used by this plant as defense mechanisms to such stresses and more studies on leaf anatomy, leaf structure and variations in biochemical components for further understanding of the mechanisms involved...|$|R
50|$|<b>Epiphytes</b> are plants which grow {{above the}} ground, {{on top of}} other plants. They are not planted in the soil and are not {{parasitic}} (i.e. they do not feed on other plants; however, some types still damage their host in various ways). By growing on other plants, the <b>epiphytes</b> can reach to the light better or where they can avoid struggling for light. Many mosses and lichens are <b>epiphytes,</b> as are approximately 10 per cent of all seed plants and ferns. <b>Epiphytes</b> are common in some groups of plants, such as ferns, mosses, lichens, and algae. Over half of the 20,000 species of orchids are <b>epiphytes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Compared {{to other}} genera {{of the family}} Araceae, philodendrons have an {{extremely}} diverse array of growth methods. The habits of growth can be epiphytic, hemiepiphytic, or rarely terrestrial. Others can show {{a combination of these}} growth habits depending on the environment. Hemiepiphytic philodendrons can be classified into two types: primary and secondary hemiepiphytes. A primary hemiepiphytic philodendron starts life high up in the canopy where the seed initially sprouts. The plant then grows as an <b>epiphyte.</b> Once it has reached a sufficient size and age, it will begin producing aerial roots that grow toward the forest floor. Once they reach the forest floor, nutrients can be obtained directly from the soil. In this manner, the plant's strategy is to obtain light early in its life at the expense of nutrients. Some primary epiphytic species have a symbiotic relationship with ants. In these species, the ants' nest is grown amongst the plant's roots, which help keep the nest together. Philodendrons have extrafloral nectaries, glands that secrete nectar to attract the ants. The philodendron, in turn, obtains nutrients from the surrounding ant nest, and the aggressive nature of the ants serves to protect the plant from other insects which would eat it.|$|E

40|$|In the wet tropics, <b>epiphytes</b> form a {{conspicuous}} layer {{in the forest}} canopy, support abundant coexisting biota, and {{are known to have}} a critical influence on forest hydrology and nutrient cycling.

The abundance and richness of <b>epiphytes</b> were evaluated by the epiphyte/phorophyte ratio and differences in the use of phorophytic species by <b>epiphytes</b> were verified using a MDS. To analyze the influence of phorophyte diameter and height we used a multiple regression. In the dry forest we registered 193 arboreal individuals, of which 96 were phorophytes. Anacardium occidentale was the most abundant arboreal and phorophyte species as well. In the flooding forest we registered 234 arboreal individuals, 131 phorophytes. The most abundant arboreal species were also the ones with the greater number of phorophytes.

40|$|Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile is a subtidal {{seagrass}} whose {{leaves are}} commonly colonized by <b>epiphytes.</b> <b>Epiphytes</b> pose physical barriers to light penetration within the leaves, with possible significant impacts on photosynthesis.

The aim of this work was to investigate in situ (i) the effect of <b>epiphytes</b> on the composition and balance of light harvesting pigments in leaves of the naturally growing seagrass P. oceanica, and (ii) evaluate differences in antioxidant responses. Epiphytized and non-epiphytized plants were analyzed to establish potential photosynthetic pigment roleshift between light harvesting and photoprotection functions. The experiments were carried out in Cabo de Gata Natural Park, southern Spain, where epiphytized and non-epiphytized plants can be found at identical depths and light exposure. The results showed that both O 2 evolution rate along the day and chlorophyll a/b ratio were higher in non-epiphytized plants, indicating a negative effect of <b>epiphytes</b> on photosynthesis and light harvesting. Although under high irradiance (at solar noon) the xanthophyll cycle was activated in both epiphytized and non-epiphytized leaves, the de-epoxidation-ratio (AZ/VAZ) was lower in epiphytized leaves, due to light attenuation by <b>epiphytes.</b> The antioxidant capacity (TEAC and ORAC essays) and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes ascorbate peroxidase and dehydroascorbate were higher in epiphytized plants, showing that <b>epiphytes</b> can also be a potential source of oxidative stress to P. oceanica.

40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluated}} {{the richness of}} vascular <b>epiphytes</b> on Pseudobombax sp. nov. in three inselbergs in the Atlantic Forest Domain in state of Espírito Santo and {{evaluated the}} floristic similarity between the areas. We sampled 111 phorophytes in three regions in the southern of Espírito Santo state and identified 151 species, 77 genera and 21 families of vascular <b>epiphytes,</b> of which the families Orchidaceae and Bromeliaceae showed the highest richness. Non-parametric estimators (Chao 2, Jackknife 1) indicate that 90 and 95 % of species richness of <b>epiphytes</b> was recorded. The most diversified ecological category was the characteristic holoepiphytes. The ratio {{of the number of}} <b>epiphytes</b> and number of phorophytes sampled in a montane inselberg, in this study, was greater than the richness of vascular <b>epiphytes</b> found in the rocky outcrops of quartzite, and, in general, different types of Atlantic Domain forests, but smaller in richness for some Dense Ombrophilous Forests of southern Brazil. The three inselberg areas had distinct floras.

Landa has one of the few mesophile forests in the state of Querétaro, which is mostly found in steep canyon areas between 800 and 2000 masl. Between 600 and 800 meters, the mesophile forest blends with tropical rainforest such as {{in the bottom of the}} Tancuilin Canyon. A study of flora in {{the municipality}} counted 774 species of vascular plants, with the most diversity found in old growth areas where the thick tree canopy traps moisture.

40|$|<b>Epiphytes</b> are {{important}} components in tropical and subtropical forest ecosystems, and are well-known for their sensitivity to environmental changes. To understand <b>epiphyte’s</b> response to forest fragmentation and edge effects, we established four plots {{at the edges}} of a montane moist evergreen broad-leaved forest in the Ailao Mountains of Yunnan. Within each plot, we established four transects at 10, 20, 40, and 80 m from forest edge to study the species composition, biomass, and life form of <b>epiphytes</b> on host trunks 0 – 2 m above the ground. Distance to edge influenced biomass of <b>epiphytes</b> (P < 0. 001) and coverage of epiphytic bryophytes (P < 0. 001). Epiphytic bryophytes were more sensitive to edge effects than epiphytic ferns. The intensity of edge effects were life-form specific, and turf (P = 0. 014) and weft forms (P = 0. 030) both showeda pronounced response. Based on the distributional traits of <b>epiphytes</b> in all plots, we concluded that both the biomass of <b>epiphytes</b> and coverage of epiphytic bryophytes are biological indicators of forest edges. Furthermore, Ditrichum pallidum, Wijkia hornschuchii and Herbertus giraldianus are capable of indicating edgehabitats, while the conservation status of Thuidium philibertii, T. cymbifolium, Claopodium pellucinerve, Pseudotrismegistia undulata and Trachypus bicolor deserve further attention because they are excluded from forest edges...|$|R

60|$|UTRICULARIA MONTANA.--This species inhabits the {{tropical}} parts of South America, and {{is said to}} be epiphytic; but, judging from the state of the roots (rhizomes) of some dried specimens from the herbarium at Kew, it likewise lives in earth, probably in crevices of rocks. In English hothouses it is grown in peaty soil. Lady Dorothy Nevill was so kind as to give me a fine plant, and I received another from Dr. Hooker. The leaves are entire, instead of being much divided, as in the foregoing aquatic species. They are elongated, about 1 1/2 inch in breadth, and furnished with a distinct footstalk. The plant produces numerous colourless rhizomes, as thin as threads, which bear minute bladders, and occasionally swell into tubers, as will [page 432] hereafter be described. These rhizomes appear exactly like roots, but occasionally throw up green shoots. They penetrate the earth sometimes to the depth of more than 2 inches; but when the plant grows as an <b>epiphyte,</b> they must creep amidst the mosses, roots, decayed bark, &c., with which the trees of these countries are thickly covered.|$|E

The impressions of nature received during that sick period are blurred, or else so coloured and exaggerated by perpetual torturing anxiety, mixed with half-delirious night-fancies, that I can only think of that country as an earthly inferno, where I fought against every imaginable obstacle, alternately sweating and freezing, toiling as no man ever toiled before. Hot and cold, cold and hot, and no medium.

Doubtless I met with help from the natives, otherwise I do not see how I could have continued my journey; yet in my dim mental picture of that period I see myself incessantly dogged by hostile savages. They flit like ghosts through the dark forest; they surround me and cut off all retreat, until I burst through them, escaping out of their very hands, to fly over some wide, naked savannah, hearing their shrill, pursuing yells behind me, and feeling the sting of their poisoned arrows in my flesh.|$|E

The most common species that distributed in those three studied plots were Derris elegans, Spatholobus gyrocarpus and Embelia ribes. Number of <b>epiphytes</b> and lianas on the single individual tree host were increase as the tree diameter increased. Number of species of <b>epiphytes</b> and lianas on a species of host were increased as the number of individuals were increased, indicates that most of these <b>epiphytes</b> and lianas were not host specific...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of <b>epiphytes</b> associated with physical substrates to the nutritional requirements of post-larval shrimp, Penaeus esculentus Haswell, was determined in high-density rearing systems (3000, 6000 and 11 000 m- 3). Stable isotope signatures of <b>epiphytes</b> on polyethylene mesh substrate, AquaMats頡nd tank walls {{were compared with}} shrimp signatures. Two methods were used: the determination of carbon and nitrogen natural abundance ratios; and 15 N-nitrogen enrichment ratios after the addition of 15 N-ammonium to tanks. Using the natural abundance technique and a simple mixing model, <b>epiphytes</b> were found to contribute substantially to the carbon requirements of post-larval shrimp (39 - 53 %). This was despite the addition of formulated feed at satiation levels. There was no indication of a reduced {{contribution of}} carbon from <b>epiphytes</b> to shrimp nutrition at higher shrimp densities. The lack of {{a difference in the}} 15 N/ 14 N ratios of the two food sources meant that mixing models could not be used to calculate the contribution of nitrogen from <b>epiphytes</b> vs. artificial feed to shrimp nutrition. Using the 15 N-nitrogenenrichment method, the amount of nitrogen contributed by <b>epiphytes</b> to shrimp nutrition over 24 h could be determined. This method showed that nitrogen from <b>epiphytes</b> was assimilated by shrimp. 15 N-enrichment methods provided a more accurate alternative to natural abundance techniques, particularly when the stable isotope signals ofthe food sources are similar. This experiment hasshown the benefits in providing substrates for P. esculentus in high-density rearing systems to provide an additional food source for shrimp. Full Tex...|$|R
