I did that and I was quite successful. I think at the end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages.

25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> who survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would {{believe that there is a}} God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> who wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this {{for the rest of your}} life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E

500|$|Saunders {{was among}} {{a party of}} men {{evacuated}} from Crete by a British submarine in May 1942, and returned to Australia in October.

In November 1942, Saunders' younger brother Harry, who had enlisted shortly after him in 1940, was killed in action while serving in New Guinea with the 2/14th Battalion. When Harry had joined up, Reg recalled, [...] "I was angry because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> that was supposed to go.... with two of us there, one of us was going to get killed..." [...] The elder Saunders subsequently served in New Guinea as well, fighting in the Salamaua–Lae campaign in mid-1943 where, having again been promoted temporary sergeant, he took over command of a platoon when its commander was wounded in action. For his leadership, he was recommended for a commission by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Guinn. When Guinn told him of his plan, Saunders laughed and said, [...] "I don't want to be an officer... I'd rather be Regimental Sergeant Major".

2500|$|Show creator William J. Bell {{introduced}} {{the role of}} psychiatrist Dr. Taylor Hamilton Hayes, played by actress Hunter Tylo, during the episode dated June 6, 1990. According to Variety, Bell created Taylor as [...] "a romantic leading lady {{but also as a}} character who could facilitate social issues — and directly partake in a few, too". Previously, Tylo was dismissed from two other soaps, All My Children and Days of Our Lives. The actress noted that her [...] "crazy sense of humor" [...] and [...] "funny business" [...] could have won her the role of Taylor, and she said: [...] "After the audition, they told me <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> right for the role. I think they liked my 'a woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do' attitude." [...] Sherilyn Wolter temporarily replaced Tylo in 1990. Tylo vacated the role in May 1994 to pursue other projects, but the soap opera left the door open for her to return, which she did months later. During her absence, the character was presumed to be dead. In March 1996, following Taylor's decreased airtime and rumors circulating of her exit, it was confirmed that the actress was to leave The Bold and the Beautiful after her contract expired that June, to pursue a primetime role on the Fox television drama Melrose Place. Taylor's final appearance was in May 1996. However, in July 1996, Tylo was controversially fired from Melrose Place on the grounds of being pregnant and was replaced by Lisa Rinna. In response, she sued that show's executive producer Aaron Spelling and Spelling Productions for millions of US dollars, and won her case. It was immediately reported that she would return to The Bold and the Beautiful, with head writer and executive producer Bradley Bell issuing the statement: [...] "I am certain that Hunter's talent and ability will continue to be an asset to the show." ...|$|E
