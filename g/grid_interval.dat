30|$|One {{method of}} {{representing}} convection cells is to perform downscale forecasts with the {{model with a}} <b>grid</b> <b>interval</b> of a few kilometers and to obtain the initial conditions by spatial and temporal interpolation of the analyzed or predicted fields of a data assimilation system. For example, a local heavy rainfall, which caused a flash flood in the Toga River in Kobe that swept away six people, was reproduced by downscale experiments with JMA’s non-hydrostatic model (JMANHM), the initial fields of which were obtained with a LETKF system (Seko et al. 2011). Though the linear band of intense rainfall responsible for the local heavy rainfall was represented as a weak rainfall region by the NHM-LETKF system with a <b>grid</b> <b>interval</b> of 20  km, downscale simulations with a <b>grid</b> <b>interval</b> of 1.6  km were successful in reproducing the linear rainfall band.

40|$|Spaceborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to be a potential tool for generating digital elevation models (DEM). The co-registration of SAR complex images {{is one of the}} most important processing procedures involved in InSAR. The quality of the co-registration significantly influences the final quality of any SAR interferometric generation, and thus the quality of DEM reliable results can never be achieved if the initial co-registration is not sufficiently reliable. In SAR image co-registration, the distribution of tiepoint affects the quality or reliability of the results. Due to lack of well defined points, tiepoints are normally selected as the intersections of a grid cells. In this case, the <b>grid</b> <b>interval</b> of the tiepoint grid becomes the critical factor. Theoretically, the smaller the <b>grid</b> <b>interval,</b> (the more tiepoints), more reliable the registration. However, it is not always the case. In this study, some experimental investigations into the effect of <b>grid</b> <b>interval</b> on the co-registration results are conducted. 4 pieces of SAR complex images collected by ERS- 1 / 2 are used for testing. Tiepoints with varying grid intervals have been used for co-registration. The results indicate that there is no single optimum <b>grid</b> <b>interval</b> for tiepoint grid but the grid with 8 × 8, coresponding to 205 * 34 pixels, always result in either best or very good in terms of both RMS and the coherence of interferograms.

The grid size was 20 arc seconds (about 600 m) and bathymetry grid data was produced from the following bathymetry data: J-EGG 500 provided by the Japan Oceanographic Data Center (500 -m <b>grid</b> <b>interval),</b> JTOPO 30 by the Marine Information Research Center, the Japan Hydrographic Association (30 -arc-seconds <b>grid</b> <b>interval).</b> The grid size near coastal tide-gauge stations was set to 4 arc seconds as nested grids.

30|$|The {{ensemble}} forecasts operationally {{performed by}} the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) with the highest horizontal resolution are typhoon forecasts and 1  week forecasts. However, these ensemble forecasts cannot represent convection cells of thunderstorms that cause local heavy rainfall and tornadoes because the horizontal <b>grid</b> <b>interval</b> (40  km) is too large to resolve the convection cells. Recently, several ensemble forecast experiments in which heavy rainfall or local heavy rainfall was reproduced have been performed with a local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF; Hunt et al. 2007; Miyoshi and Aranami 2006). For instance, Kunii (2013) reproduced a heavy rainfall in northern Kyushu by assimilating JMA’s operational observation data with a LETKF system with a <b>grid</b> <b>interval</b> of 5  km.
