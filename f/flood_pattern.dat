40|$|Detecting the {{availability}} of sufficient water in tidal land management is important for agriculture. Tidal <b>flood</b> <b>pattern</b> provides an information of area where has tidal flood as well as drought by time and places. The objectives of this research are 1) to study the tidal flood spatial pattern by using real time data and digital data image processing, 2) to determine a tidal flood classification based on ground water level on a specific locationand time, and 3) to study the hydrological factors affecting the flood. The tidal <b>flood</b> <b>pattern</b> can be classified within a block by their ground water fluctuation. The visual analysis with four image of different time, gives a clear differences between tidal <b>flood</b> <b>pattern</b> change and tidal fluctuation. The classification on the moist Landsat TM image after a Tesseled Cap transformation can produce classified image with similar flooded condition with the same range of ground water level. After the test, the tidalflooded pattern was found similar with the classification results. The tidal <b>flood</b> <b>pattern</b> is also recognized having a specific relationship with land use or land utilization type. The land use and land management affect the pattern.

30|$|In the relief, aspects are {{calculated}} as relief ratio (Rr), basin relief (R), ruggedness number (Rn) and gradient ratio (Rg), {{and the data}} are presented in Table  2. Basin relief is a parameter that shows the elevation difference between the highest and lowest point in the basin (Hadley and Schumm 1961). It is the determined stream gradient that influences <b>flood</b> <b>pattern</b> and volume of sediment that can be transported (Hadley and Schumm 1961; Kanhaiya et al. 2018). The basin relief varies from 0.085 to 0.58  km (Table  2). According to Schumm (1956), relief ratio is a ratio between basin relief and basin length. Relief ratio is an effective measure of gradient aspects of the basin (Schumm 1956; Vittala et al. 2004). Relief ratio in study area varies from 0.004 (KW) and 0.014 (SW- 6) (Table  2).

Gradient ratio is a parameter which indicates channel slope which enables measurement of the runoff volume (Sreedevi et al. 2004, 2009; Thomas et al. 2010). The Rg value of KW is 0.004 (Table  2).|$|E
40|$|Floods {{are governed}} by largely varying {{processes}} and thus exhibit various behaviors. Classification of flood events into flood types and the determination of their respective frequency is therefore important for a better understanding and prediction of floods. This study presents a flood classification for identifying <b>flood</b> <b>patterns</b> at a catchment scale {{by means of a}} fuzzy decision tree. Hence, events are represented as a spectrum of six main possible flood types that are attributed with their degree of acceptance. Considered types are flash, short rainfall, long rainfall, snow-melt, rainfall on snow and, in high alpine catchments, glacier-melt floods. The fuzzy decision tree also makes it possible to acknowledge the uncertainty present in the identification of flood processes and thus allows for more reliable flood class estimates than using a crisp decision tree, which identifies one flood type per event. Based on the data set in nine Swiss mountainous catchments, it was demonstrated that this approach is less sensitive to uncertainties in the classification attributes than the classical crisp approach. These results show that the fuzzy approach bears additional potential for analyses of <b>flood</b> <b>patterns</b> at a catchment scale and thereby it provides more realistic representation of flood processes...|$|R

40|$|The Pantanal of MatoGrosso and Mato Grosso do Sul is {{situated}} in a large intracontinental depression that is drained by the Paraguay River. Pliocene-Pleistocene sandy sediments fi ll the depression but are eroded in the surrounding uplands by the Paraguay River and its large tributaries, which form a large inland delta. Paleoclimatic changes between wetter and dryer periods {{led to the formation}} of sediment cones, which in part rise above the actual mean fl ood level. The annual pronounced rainy and dry seasons have resulted in the formation of a wetland that follows the behaviour described by the flood pulse concept. According to hydrological parameters, the Pantanal is a floodplain that is subject to a monomodal, predictable flood pulse of low amplitude and a smooth shape. However, the local <b>flood</b> <b>pattern</b> is highly variable because of the different discharge patterns of the Paraguay River and its large tributaries and the impact of local rainfall, which varies between regions and years. In addition to the flood stress, the extended dry season causes intense drought and fire stress, with impacts on the Pantanal’s plants and animals. The region’s paleoclimatic instability favoured the immigration from the surrounding biomes of species with a large ecological amplitude and hindered the development of endemic species. The low nutrient status of most upland areas is reflected in the soils and waters of the Pantanal, which are of low fertility. However, internal nutrient-retention mechanisms driven by the change between aquatic and terrestrial phases, and the associated flora, support a rich wildlife and form the basis for low- density cattle- ranching. Threats to the system are the products of changes in the flood pulse due to reservoir construction at the tributaries in the uplands and by dike and road construction locally inside the Pantanal. Construction of the highly controversial hidrovia, which would drain parts of the Pantanal and modify the <b>flood</b> <b>pattern</b> in large areas, would likewise have a catastrophic impact on the region. The increasing load of suspended material by strong erosion in agrarian areas located in the uplands fills the channels inside the Pantanal such that during high-water periods the rivers are forced above their beds and thus flood the surroundings for long periods of time, as is the case for the Taquari River. Untreated wastewater and solid waste from the region’s fast-growing cities pollute several areas of the Pantanal. The intensifi cation of cattle- breeding destroys habitats and reduces species diversity. Although local, national, and international efforts to protect the Pantanal have recently been undertaken, they need to be strengthened in order to reduce the negative impacts of ongoing development projects and to reinforce plans for the sustainable use of the region...|$|E
30|$|Over the years, {{waterflooding}} {{has been}} the most widely used secondary oil recovery method after the exhaustion of the primary depletion energy of the reservoir. Waterflooding schemes have to be planned such that at every point of the operation, net income from oil recovery exceeds operating expenditure of which produced water disposal cost is paramount. Hence, engineers are regularly plagued with challenges such as optimal completions zones for injectors and producers, optimal <b>flood</b> <b>pattern</b> to adopt and number/type of producers and injectors to use in waterflood field development so as to improve oil recovery, but reduce water production. The aim {{of this study is to}} optimize waterflooding from a case study model using reservoir simulation techniques. A simple optimization methodology involving the analysis of the effects of zones of production and injection, pattern of waterflood selected and number/type of producers and injectors on cumulative recovery from a waterflooded reservoir was used. Results revealed that (1) pressure maintenance/increment is more effective when there is water injection into more zones of the reservoir, (2) for waterflood operations involving the use of vertical injectors, higher water production was observed because water is expected to flow more conveniently in the upward direction due to gravity rather than laterally and (3) with horizontal injectors, higher cumulative production was achieved especially for cases where water is injected into the same zones from which oil is produced.|$|E

Technical design and budget for a larger (60 -acre, 24. 3 ha) CO 2 demonstration project are being reviewed by the US DOE for approval. Further analysis of the pilot site by the partners has indicated that a staged demonstration is considered optimal. A phased approach to implementation of the demonstration is proposed {{to reduce the risk of}} uncertainties as to whether the reservoir has basic properties (connectivity and ability to pressure-up) conducive to a meaningful CO 2 flood demonstration. The proposed plan is to flood a 10 +-acre pattern. The results of this small flood will be used to evaluate the viability of performing a larger-scale ({approx} 60 -acre) demonstration and will be used by the partners to decide their role in a larger-scale demonstration. The 10 +-acre pattern requires the least up-front expense to all parties to obtain the data required to accurately assess the viability and economics of CO 2 flooding in the L-KC and of a larger-scale demonstration. In general, the following significant modifications to the original Statement of Work are proposed: (1) The proposed plan would extend the period of Budget Period 1 to May 7, 2003. (2) Redefine the period of Budget Period 2 from 3 / 7 / 01 - 3 / 7 / 05 to 5 / 7 / 03 - 3 / 7 / 08. (3) Redefine the period of Budget Period 3 from 3 / 7 / 05 - 3 / 7 / 06 to 3 / 7 / 08 - 3 / 7 / 09. (4) To allow initial verification of the viability of the process before proceeding into the flood demonstration, move activities involved with preparing wells in the <b>flood</b> <b>pattern</b> (Task 5. 1), repressurizing the pattern (Task 5. 2), and constructing surface facilities (Task 5. 3) from Budget Period 2 to Budget Period 1. (5) Allow US Energy Partners (USEP) to be a supplier of carbon dioxide from the ethanol plant in Russell, Kansas. (6) Change the pilot <b>flood</b> <b>pattern,</b> including the number and location of wells involved in the pilot. (7) Expenses are shifted from Budget Period 2 to Budget Period 1 to cover costs of additional reservoir characterization. All modified activities and tasks would maintain the existing required industry match of 55 % in Budget Period 1, 65 % in Budget Period 2, and 90 % in Budget Period 3. Carbon dioxide supplied by the USEP ethanol facility would be valued such that the total cost of CO 2 delivered to the demonstration site injection wellhead would not exceed the $ 3. 00 /MCF cost of supplying CO 2 from Guymon, OK.

The lack of {{information}} on the characteristics of floods, the orography of the sites and the receptors hampers its production. However, even with scant information, it is possible to create preliminary risk mapping. This tool can be used by local administrations in decision making on emergency plans or on climate change (CC) action plans. From 2010 onwards the River Niger at Niamey (1. 1 million inhabitants, 123 km 2 in 2014) swelled at unseasonal times. That new river <b>flood</b> <b>pattern</b> can be linked to CC. Each flooding event affected thousands of people and homes. The unceasing development of areas that {{did not seem to be}} flood prone in the past is the main cause of these impacts. These areas require special measures if further impact is to be avoided in the future. This chapter presents the flood risk preliminary map of Niamey 1 : 20, 000. The map is built up using an historic approach (flooded area derived from satellite images) and considering risk (R) as the result of hazard (H) and damage (D), R = H * D. Risk is measured according to two scenarios: medium and high probability of flooding. The inverse of the return period of river and pluvial flooding (H) and the potential damage to buildings and crops according the water depth are used. Information to measure risk components is sourced by daily rainfall and daily discharge of the River Niger from 1946 to 2014 and from high-resolution satellite images (2014). The risk map identifies hot spots for emergency and CC action planning. The fifth district alone contains 52 % of the potential damage. 99 % of the potential damage is concentrated within 225 hectars. Reinforcing existing embankments and constructing new ones to protect these areas seems more appropriate than resettlement.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of 2007 / 60 /EC Directive requires European countries to implement flood hazard and flood risk maps {{by the end}} of 2013. Flood risk is the product of flood hazard, vulnerability and exposure, all three to be estimated with comparable level of accuracy. The route to flood risk assessment is consequently much more than hydraulic modelling of inundation, that is hazard mapping. While hazard maps have already been implemented in many countries, quantitative damage and risk maps are still at a preliminary level. A parsimonious quasi- 2 -D hydraulic model is here adopted, having many advantages in terms of easy set-up. It is here evaluated as being accurate in flood depth estimation in urban areas with a high-resolution and up-to-date Digital Surface Model (DSM). The accuracy, estimated by comparison with marble-plate records of a historic flood in the city of Florence, is characterized in the downtown's most flooded area by a bias of a very few centimetres and a determination coefficient of 0. 73. The average risk is found to be about 14 € m − 2 yr − 1, corresponding to about 8. 3 % of residents' income. The spatial distribution of estimated risk highlights a complex interaction between the <b>flood</b> <b>pattern</b> and the building characteristics. As a final example application, the estimated risk values have been used to compare different retrofitting measures. Proceeding through the risk estimation steps, a new micro-scale potential damage assessment method is proposed. This is based on the georeferenced census system as the optimal compromise between spatial detail and open availability of socio-economic data. The results of flood risk assessment at the census section scale resolve most of the risk spatial variability, and they can be easily aggregated to whatever upper scale is needed given that they are geographically defined as contiguous polygons. Damage is calculated through stage–damage curves, starting from census data on building type and function, for the main categories in the study area: structures, household contents and commercial contents.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} "router-based " defense mechanisms, {{and whether they}} can provide {{effective}} solutions to network Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Router-based defenses operate either on traffic aggregates or on individual flows, and have been shown, either alone or {{in combination with other}} schemes, e. g., traceback, to be reasonably effective against certain types of basic attacks. Those attacks are, however, relatively brute-force, and usually accompanied by either significant increases in congestion, and/or traffic patterns that are easily identified. It is, therefore, unclear if router-based solutions are viable in the presence of more diverse or sophisticated attacks. As a result, even if incorporating defense mechanisms in the routers themselves has obvious advantages, such schemes have not seen wide deployments. Our ultimate goal is to determine whether it is possible to build router-based defense mechanisms that are effective against a wide range of attacks. This paper describes a first phase of this effort aimed at identifying weaknesses in existing systems. In particular, the paper demonstrates that aggregate defense systems can be readily circumvented, even by a single attacker, through minor modifications of its <b>flooding</b> <b>patterns.</b> Flow-based defenses fare slightly better, but can still be easily fooled by a small number of attackers generating transient <b>flooding</b> <b>patterns.</b> The findings of the paper provide insight into possible approaches for designing better and more robust router-base...|$|R

Router-based defenses operate either on traffic aggregates or on individual flows, and have been shown, either alone or {{in combination with other}} schemes, e. g., traceback, to be reasonably effective against certain types of basic attacks. Those attacks are, however, relatively brute-force, and usually accompanied by either significant increases in congestion, and/or traffic patterns that are easily identified. It is, therefore, unclear if router-based solutions are viable in the presence of more diverse or sophisticated attacks. As a result, even if incorporating defense mechanisms in the routers themselves has obvious advantages, such schemes have not seen wide deployments.
