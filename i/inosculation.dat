2500|$|His first {{reference}} to transmutation {{appears in the}} Red Notebook around early March 1837, after John Gould {{told him that the}} common Rhea was a different species to the Petisse. Darwin wrote [...] "Speculate on neutral ground of 2 ostriches; bigger one encroaches on smaller. change not progressif: produced at one blow. if one species altered", proposing a sudden change or saltation in contrast to Lamarck's idea that species graded imperceptibly into each other: later, Darwin referred to this jump as <b>inosculation.</b> He drew on the relationship Owen had shown between fossils of the extinct giant Macrauchenia and the modern guanacos that Darwin had hunted in Patagonia: [...] "The same kind of relation that common ostrich bears to : extinct Guanaco to recent: in former case position, in latter time. .... – As in first cases distinct species inosculate, so must we believe ancient ones: not gradual change or degeneration. from circumstances: if one species does change into another it must be per saltum – or species may perish." [...] Here, he related the geographical distribution of species to their replacement over time, and tentatively proposed that the Rheas had a shared ancestor.|$|E

60|$|From all which {{evidence}} it is tolerably {{clear that}} the earliest mode of conveying the idea of any number of things, was by holding up as many fingers as there were things; that is--using a symbol which was equal, in respect of multiplicity, to the group symbolised. For which inference there is, indeed, strong confirmation in the recent statement that our own soldiers are even now spontaneously adopting this device in their dealings with the Turks. And here it should be remarked that in this recombination {{of the notion of}} equality with that of multiplicity, by which the first steps in numeration are effected, we may see one of the earliest of those <b>inosculations</b> between the diverging branches of science, which are afterwards of perpetual occurrence.|$|R
60|$|When {{mechanics}} {{had reached}} the point to which Galileo brought it--when the simple laws of force had been disentangled from the friction and atmospheric resistance by which all their earthly manifestations are disguised--when progressing knowledge of physics had given a due insight into these disturbing causes--when, by an effort of abstraction, it was perceived that all motion would be uniform and rectilinear unless interfered with by external forces--and when the various consequences of this perception had been worked out; then it became possible, by the union of geometry and mechanics, to initiate physical astronomy. Geometry and mechanics having diverged from a common root in men's sensible experiences; having, with occasional <b>inosculations,</b> been separately developed, the one partly in connection with astronomy, the other solely by analysing terrestrial movements; now join in the investigations of Newton to create a true theory of the celestial motions. And here, also, we have to notice the important fact that, in the very process of being brought jointly to bear upon astronomical problems, they are themselves raised to a higher phase of development. For it was {{in dealing with the}} questions raised by celestial dynamics that the then incipient infinitesimal calculus was unfolded by Newton and his continental successors; and it was from inquiries into the mechanics of the solar system that the general theorems of mechanics contained in the Principia,--many of them of purely terrestrial application--took their rise. Thus, {{as in the case of}} Hipparchus, the presentation of a new order of concrete facts to be analysed, led to the discovery of new abstract facts; and these abstract facts having been laid hold of, gave means of access to endless groups of concrete facts before incapable of quantitative treatment.|$|R

60|$|On the Nature of the Tissues {{through which}} the Motor Impulse is Transmitted.--It will be {{necessary}} first to describe briefly {{the course of the}} main fibro-vascular bundles. These are shown in the accompanying sketch (fig. 11) of a small leaf. Little vessels from the neighbouring bundles enter all the many tentacles with which the surface is studded; but these are not here represented. The central trunk, which runs up the footstalk, bifurcates near the centre of the leaf, each branch bifurcating again and again according {{to the size of the}} leaf. This central trunk sends off, low down on each side, a delicate branch, which may be called the sublateral branch. There is also, on each side, a main lateral branch or bundle, which bifurcates in the same manner as the others. Bifurcation does not imply that any single vessel divides, but that a bundle [page 248] divides into two. By looking to either side of the leaf, it will be seen that a branch from the great central bifurcation inosculates with a branch from the lateral bundle, and that there is a smaller <b>inosculation</b> between the two chief branches of the lateral bundle. The course of the vessels is very complex at the larger inosculation; and here vessels, retaining the same diameter, are often formed by the union of the bluntly pointed ends of two vessels, but whether these points open into each other by their attached surfaces, I do not know. By means of the two inosculations all the vessels on the same side of the leaf are brought into some sort of connection. Near the circumference of the larger leaves the bifurcating branches also come into close union, and then separate again, forming a continuous zigzag line of vessels round the whole circumference. But the union of the vessels in this zigzag line seems to be much less intimate than at the main <b>inosculation.</b> It should be added that the course of the vessels differs somewhat in different leaves, and even on opposite sides of the same leaf, but the main <b>inosculation</b> is always present.|$|E
60|$|It is {{probable}} that they are occasionally transported by what may be called accidental means. Thus fishes still alive are not very rarely dropped at distant points by whirlwinds; and {{it is known that}} the ova retain their vitality for a considerable time after removal from the water. Their dispersal may, however, be mainly attributed to changes in the level of the land within the recent period, causing rivers to flow into each other. Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred during floods, without any change of level. The wide differences of the fish on the opposite sides of most mountain-ranges, which are continuous and consequently must, from an early period, have completely prevented the <b>inosculation</b> of the river systems on the two sides, leads to the same conclusion. Some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration. Moreover, Dr. Gunther has recently been led by several considerations to infer that with fishes the same forms have a long endurance. Salt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of which all the members are confined to fresh water, so that a marine species belonging to a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores of the sea, and could, it {{is probable}}, become adapted without much difficulty to the fresh waters of a distant land.|$|E
60|$|Further {{analysis}} {{would show}} that the many arts thus concerned in the economical production of a child's frock, have each of them been brought to its present efficiency by slow steps which the other arts have aided; and that from the beginning this reciprocity has been ever on the increase. It needs but {{on the one hand}} to consider how utterly impossible it is for the savage, even with ore and coal ready, to produce so simple a thing as an iron hatchet; and then to consider, on the other hand, {{that it would have been}} impracticable among ourselves, even a century ago, to raise the tubes of the Britannia bridge from lack of the hydraulic press; to at once see how mutually dependent are the arts, and how all must advance that each may advance. Well, the sciences are involved with each other in just the same manner. They are, in fact, inextricably woven into the same complex web of the arts; and are only conventionally independent of it. Originally the two were one. How to fix the religious festivals; when to sow: how to weigh commodities; and in what manner to measure ground; were the purely practical questions out of which arose astronomy, mechanics, geometry. Since then there has been a perpetual <b>inosculation</b> of the sciences and the arts. Science has been supplying art with truer generalisations and more completely quantitative previsions. Art has been supplying science with better materials and more perfect instruments. And all along the interdependence has been growing closer, not only between art and science, but among the arts themselves, and among the sciences themselves.|$|E
60|$|In {{my first}} letter I {{mentioned}} {{the state of}} our inland navigation, neglected as it had been from the reign of King William to the time of my observation. It was not till the present reign that the Duke of Bridgewater's canal first excited a spirit of speculation and adventure in this way. This spirit showed itself, but necessarily made no great progress, in the American war. When peace was restored, it began of course to work with more sensible effect; yet in ten years from that event the bills passed on that subject were not so many as from the year 1793 to the present session of Parliament. From what I can trace on the statute-book, I am confident that all the capital expended in these projects during the peace bore no degree of proportion (I doubt, on very grave consideration, whether all that was ever so expended was equal) to the money which has been raised for the same purposes since the war.[49] I know that {{in the last four years}} of peace, when they rose regularly and rapidly, the sums specified in the acts were not near one third of the subsequent amount. In the last session of Parliament, the Grand Junction Company, as it is called, having sunk half a million, (of which I feel the good effects at my own door,) applied to your House for permission to subscribe half as much more among themselves. This Grand Junction is an <b>inosculation</b> of the Grand Trunk; and in the present session, the latter company has obtained the authority of Parliament to float two hundred acres of land, for the purpose of forming a reservoir, thirty feet deep, two hundred yards wide at the head, and two miles in length: a lake which may almost vie with that which once fed the now obliterated canal of Languedoc.|$|E
60|$|But {{this power}} in fresh-water {{productions}} of ranging widely, though so unexpected, can, I think, {{in most cases}} be explained by their having become fitted, in a manner highly useful to them, for short and frequent migrations from pond to pond, or from stream to stream; and liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary consequence. We can here consider only a few cases. In regard to fish, I believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distant continents. But on the same continent the species often range widely and almost capriciously; for two river-systems will have some fish in common and some different. A few facts seem to favour the possibility of their occasional transport by accidental means; {{like that of the}} live fish not rarely dropped by whirlwinds in India, and the vitality of their ova when removed from the water. But I am inclined to attribute the dispersal of fresh-water fish mainly to slight changes within the recent period in the level of the land, having caused rivers to flow into each other. Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred during floods, without any change of level. We have evidence in the loess of the Rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a very recent geological period, and when the surface was peopled by existing land and fresh-water shells. The wide difference of the fish on opposite sides of continuous mountain-ranges, which from an early period must have parted river-systems and completely prevented their <b>inosculation,</b> seems to lead to this same conclusion. With respect to allied fresh-water fish occurring at very distant points of the world, no doubt there are many cases which cannot at present be explained: but some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration. In the second place, salt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water, so that we may imagine that a marine member of a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores of the sea, and subsequently become modified and adapted to the fresh waters of a distant land.|$|E

50|$|Dan Ladd is a Northampton, Massachusetts based American {{artist who}} works with trees and gourds. He began experimenting with glass, china, and metal {{inclusions}} in trees in 1977 in Vermont and started planting trees for Extreme Nature in 1978. He became inspired by <b>inosculation</b> he noticed in nature and by the growth of tree trunks around man-made objects such as fences and idle farm equipment. He shapes and grafts trees, including their fruits and their roots, into architectural and geometric forms. Ladd calls human-initiated <b>inosculation</b> 'pleaching' and calls his own work 'tree sculpture'. Ladd binds a variety of objects to trees, for live wood to grow around and be incorporated, including teacups, bicycle wheels, headstones, steel spheres, water piping, and electrical conduit. He guides roots into shapes, such as stairs, using above-ground wooden and concrete forms and even shapes woody, hard-shelled Lagenaria gourds {{by allowing them to}} grow into detailed molds. A current project at the DeCordova and Dana Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Massachusetts incorporates eleven American Liberty Elm trees grafted next to each other to form a long hillside stair banister. Another of his installations, Three Arches, consists of three pairs of 14-foot sycamore trees, which he grafted into arches to frame different city views, at Frank Curto Park in Pittsburgh.|$|E
50|$|Two trees {{may grow}} to their mature size {{adjacent}} {{to each other}} and seemingly grow together or conjoin, demonstrating the process of <b>inosculation.</b> These may be of the same species or even trees of two different genera or families, depending on whether the two trees have become truly grafted together (once the cambium of two trees touches, they self-graft and grow together) or not. Usually grafting is only between two trees of the same or closely related species or genera, but the appearance of grafting can be given by two trees that are physically touching, rubbing, intertwined, or entangled. Both conifers and deciduous trees can become conjoined. Beech trees in particular are frequent conjoiners, as is blackthorn (Prunus spinosa).|$|E
50|$|Tree {{branches}} {{and more often}} roots {{of the same species}} will sometimes naturally graft; this is called <b>inosculation.</b> The bark of the tree may be stripped away when the roots make physical contact with each other, exposing the vascular cambium and allowing the roots to graft together. A group of trees can share water and mineral nutrients via root grafts, which may be advantageous to weaker trees, and may also form a larger rootmass as an adaptation to promote fire resistance and regeneration as exemplified by the California black oak (Quercus kelloggii). Additionally, grafting may protect the group from wind damages {{as a result of the}} increased mechanical stability provided by the grafting. Albino redwoods use root grafting as a form of plant parasitism of normal redwoods.|$|E

50|$|Pleaching is a {{technique}} used in the very old horticultural practice of hedge laying. Pleaching consists of first plashing living branches and twigs and then weaving them together to promote their <b>inosculation.</b> It is most commonly used to train trees into raised hedges, though other shapes are easily developed. Useful implementations include fences, lattices, roofs, and walls. Some of the outcomes of pleaching can be considered an early form {{of what is known}} today as tree shaping. In an early, labor-intensive, practical use of pleaching in medieval Europe, trees were installed in the ground in parallel hedgerow lines or quincunx patterns, then shaped by trimming to form a flat-plane grid above ground level. When the trees' branches in this grid met those of neighboring trees, they were grafted together. Once the network of joints were of substantial size, builders laid planks across the grid, upon which they built huts to live in, thus keeping the human settlement safe in times of annual flooding. Wooden dancing platforms were also built and the living tree branch grid bore the weight of the platform and dancers.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: During {{the first}} 48 hours after placement, an {{autograft}} “drinks ” nutrients and dissolved oxygen from fluid exuding from the underlying recipient bed (“plasmatic imbibition”).

40|$|The {{engineering}} of preformed microvessels {{offers the}} promising opportunity to rapidly vascularise implanted tissue constructs {{by the process}} of <b>inosculation.</b> Herein, we analyzed whether this process may further be accel-erated by cultivation of prevascularised tissue constructs in Matrigel before implantation. Nano-size hydroxyapatite particles/poly(ester-urethane) scaffolds were implanted into the flank of FVB/N-TgN (Tie 2 /GFP) 287 Sato mice to allow the ingrowth of a granulation tissue with green fluorescent protein (GFP) -positive blood vessels. After harvesting, these prevascularised constructs were then transferred into dorsal skinfold chambers of FVB/N recipient mice to study the process of <b>inosculation.</b> The constructs were implanted directly after embedding in Matrigel or after 3 days of cultivation in the extracellular matrix. Matrigel-free constructs served as control. Cultivation in Matrigel resulted in the outgrowth of CD 31 /GFP-positive vascular sprouts. Vascularisation of these constructs was markedly improved when compared to the other two groups, as indicated by a significantly elevated functional microvessel density between days 6 to 14 after implantation into the dorsal skinfold chamber. This was associated with an increased number of GFP-positive blood vessels growing into the surrounding host tissue. Thus, the blood supply to prevascularised tissue constructs can be accelerated by their pre-cultivation in an angiogenic extracellular matrix, promoting external <b>inosculation</b> of the preformed microvascular networks with the host microvasculature...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2016. Major: Chemical Engineering. Advisor: Robert Tranquillo. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 144 pages. The single greatest restraint in tissue engineering is {{the inability to}} create and perfuse functional microvasculature in dense engineered tissues of physiological stiffness. Without active delivery of nutrients and oxygen, tissue size is diffusion-limited to thicknesses of around 400 µm, or much less for highly metabolic tissues. Thus, the creation of pre-vascularized tissues that have a high density of organized microvessels that could be perfused is a major goal of tissue engineering. The present work makes significant advances toward this goal. Tissue patches containing a high density of human microvessels that were either randomly oriented or aligned were placed acutely on rat hearts post-infarction and in both cases, <b>inosculation</b> occurred and perfusion of the transplanted human microvessels was maintained, proving the in vivo vascularization potential of these engineered tissues. In vitro, a high-throughput assay was developed to investigate optimal conditions for angiogenic sprouting, vasculogenic microvascular network formation, and <b>inosculation</b> of the sprouts and microvessels in 3 D fibrin gels. Samples loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor exhibited enhanced angiogenic sprouting, and a hybrid medium culture regimen resulted in enhanced sprouting, well-developed microvascular networks, and <b>inosculation</b> of the microvessels and sprouts. These results showed potential for the in vitro perfusion of larger-scale microvascular tissues. An engineering strategy was developed to perfuse endothelialized microchannels that could form sprouts into fibrin gels containing a microvascular network. An in vitro perfusion bioreactor was designed and tested that enabled these microvascular tissues to be cultured, compacted, and aligned to form a dense network of microvessels that also contained perfusable microchannels with sprouts. Different microchannel seeding regimens and perfusion regimens were applied and it was determined which conditions ultimately led to microchannel endothelialization, sprouting, perfusion, and maintenance during gel compaction. While <b>inosculation</b> and perfusion of the microvessels {{has yet to be}} achieved, this work presents the building blocks for a potential strategy that could ultimately enable the perfusion of a dense, aligned microvascular network through anastomoses of sprouts and microvessels. Achievement of this goal would unlock a number of tissue engineering opportunities in the development of large engineered tissues for regenerative therapies...|$|E
