50|$|The daily accrual {{method is}} {{commonly}} used in the UK. The annual rate is divided by 365 to give a daily rate. Each day, {{the balance of the}} account is multiplied by this rate, {{and at the end of}} the cycle the total interest is billed to the account. The effect of this method is theoretically mathematically the same over one year as the average <b>daily</b> <b>balance</b> method, because the interest is compounded monthly, but calculated on <b>daily</b> <b>balances.</b> Although a detailed analysis can be done that shows that the effective interest can be slightly lower or higher each month than with the average <b>daily</b> <b>balance</b> method, depending upon the detailed calculation procedure used and the number of days in each month, the effect over the entire year provides only a trivial opportunity for arbitrage.|$|R

5000|$|The {{sum of the}} <b>daily</b> <b>balances</b> of the {{previous}} two cycles is used, but interest is charged on that amount only over the current cycle. This can result in an actual interest charge that applies the advertised rate to an amount that does not represent the actual amount of money borrowed over time, much different that the expected interest charge. The interest charged on the actual money borrowed over time can vary radically from month-to-month (rather than the APR remaining steady). For example, a cardholder with an average <b>daily</b> <b>balance</b> for the June, July, and August cycles of $100, 1000, 100, will have interest calculated on 550 for July, which is only 55% of the expected interest on 1000, and will have interest calculated on 550 again in August, which is 550% higher than the expected interest on the money actually borrowed over that month, which is 100.|$|R
40|$|When {{seeking to}} {{properly}} consider the time value of money, typical periodic cash flows such as payments and interest charges {{are difficult to}} model. This paper explores a new signal function that employs singu-larity functions to express such intermittent phenomena. This flexible signal function allows manipulating the parameters of start and finish, amplitude, and period of the signal efficiently, so that payments and in-terest charges can be modeled accurately. This novel approach is beneficial in several ways. First, the new model can effectively incorporate shift and delay effects that may affect an activity. Second, it applies an exact <b>interest</b> <b>calculation.</b> Third, it can handle compounding in its accumulation. Finally, a comprehensive model is created that returns the cumulative <b>balance</b> including <b>interest</b> charges at all times. It is concluded that signal functions are a promising area for future research on modeling and optimizing the cash flows. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To examine {{associations}} between mean <b>daily</b> fluid <b>balance</b> during {{intensive care unit}} study enrollment and clinical outcomes in patients enrolled in the Randomized Evaluation of Normal vs. Augmented Level (RENAL) replacement therapy study. Design: Statistical analysis of data from multicenter, randomized, controlled trials. Setting: Thirty-five intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand. Patients: Cohort of 1453 patients enrolled in the RENAL study. Interventions: We analyzed the association between <b>daily</b> fluid <b>balance</b> on clinical outcomes using multivariable logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards, time-dependent analysis, and repeated measure analysis models. Measurements and Main Results: During intensive care unit stay, mean <b>daily</b> fluid <b>balance</b> among survivors was - 234 mL/day compared with + 560 mL/day among nonsurvivors (p <. 0001). Mean cumulative fluid balance {{over the same period}} was - 1941 vs. + 1755 mL (p =. 0003). A negative mean <b>daily</b> fluid <b>balance</b> during study treatment was independently associated with a decreased risk of death at 90 days (odds ratio 0. 318; 95 % confidence interval 0. 24 - 0. 43; p <. 000. 1) and with increased survival time (p <. 0001). In addition, a negative mean <b>daily</b> fluid <b>balance</b> was associated with significantly increased renal replacement-free days (p =. 0017), intensive care unit-free days (p <. 0001), and hospital-free days (p =. 01). These findings were unaltered after the application of different statistical models. Conclusions: In the RENAL study, a negative mean <b>daily</b> fluid <b>balance</b> was consistently associated with improved clinical outcomes. Fluid balance may be a target for specific manipulation in future interventional trials of critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy...|$|R

40|$|For a {{population}} of identical one compartment systems with daily inputs which are random samples from a stationary distribution {{the mean of the}} <b>daily</b> <b>balance</b> (balance = input minus excretion) taken over the population of compartments or over days for one compartment is linearly dependent on input with a slope which is independent of the distribution of the inputs and an intercept which depends only on the mean of the distribution of intakes.
