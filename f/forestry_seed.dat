Significant reduction in genetic diversity and significant difference in genetic composition of the seedling lots compared to the seed origin stand were detected. The female and the total effective number of parents were quantified by means of maternity assignment of seedlings and temporal changes in allele frequencies. Extremely low effective maternity numbers were estimated (Nfe ≈ 2 - 4) and estimates accounting for both seed and pollen donors gave also low values (Ne ≈ 35 - 50). These values {{can be explained by}} an inappropriate <b>forestry</b> <b>seed</b> harvest strategy limited to a small number of spatially close trees...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- Xylopia aromatica is {{a native}} species from Brazil’s “Cerrado”, {{recommended}} for restoration ecology and also as a medicine. Its seeds have embryos with morphophysiological dormancy, making nursery propagation difficult. The objective {{of this study was}} to verify the efficiency of X-ray and tetrazolium tests for evaluating the viability of three seed lots, stored for different periods. All seeds were X-rayed (13 kV, 350 seconds) and samples used for tetrazolium and germination tests. In the tetrazolium test, seeds were submitted to six treatments at two temperatures (25 and 30 °C) with imbibition in distilled water and immersion in three concentrations of tetrazolium solution (0. 5, 0. 75 and 1 %) at the two imbibition temperatures. Seeds for the germination test were placed for imbibition in distilled water and a 500 ppm Promalin ® (6 -Benzyladenine + GA 4 + GA 7) solution and later sown in sterilized sand. The embryo could not be observed with the X-ray test. However, those seeds observed with an undamaged endosperm did not differ in the percentages of seeds with firm and stained endosperms observed in the tetrazolium test for all the lots. The tetrazolium test is efficient for evaluating seed viability, principally if imbibed at 30 °C and immersed in a 0. 5 % solution at 30 °C.

40|$|Physiological {{quality is}} one of the {{parameter}} used to determine the seed quality standard in a certification procedure. Information on the physiological quality often not readily available since germination test as a direst test takes time. Rapid test can predict the potency of a seed lot quickly yet accurately but it requires standardization of procedures and interpretation keys. This method relies on the tight correlation between physiological/development of a seed and its viability. In applying a rapid test, the suitability of the test toward the species needs to be determined. Compared to direct test, significant time saving are obtained for 13 - 34 days with TZ test, 13 – 44 days with cutting test and X-ray test, 7 – 25 days with hydrogen peroxide, 8 – 37 days with excision test and 12 – 19 days with leachate conductivity test. The TZ test and cutting test have been accommodated in the regulation on the physical and physiological test on <b>forestry</b> <b>seeds.</b> The other rapid tests such as excision, hydrogen peroxide, XC-Radiography and leachate conductivity need to be included in that regulation as well. The analyst for the rapid test for this rapid test should be an official that has been certified through intensive training. (peng...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Ecoregion Caatinga {{presents}} a great diversity of species with potential for exploitation. Among them 'pereiro-vermelho' (Simira gardneriana M. R. Barbosa & Peixoto) stands out for its importance in timber and <b>forestry</b> activities. Its <b>seeds</b> germinate slowly. Therefore, {{the use of}} tetrazolium test to estimate viability becomes essential when quick answers on seeds quality are wanted. This study has aimed to establish the best concentration of tetrazolium solution and the coloration period for assessing the viability of Simira gardneriana seeds. Initially, seeds were subjected to pre-wetting between paper sheets for 144 hours at 30 °C. Subsequently, the endosperm portion containing the embryo was immersed at four concentrations of tetrazolium solution (0. 075, 0. 1, 0. 5 and 1. 0 %) and three coloration periods (2, 4 and 6 hours) in the dark under the temperature of 30 °C and another one at 35 °C. The percentage of viable seeds was compared with the results obtained in the germination test conducted on paper substrate at 30 °C in four replicates of 25 seeds. Tetrazolium test was efficient to estimate the viability of S. gardneriana seed and the concentration of 0. 075 % for six hours at 35 °C was the best condition...|$|R
40|$|Tree seed {{studies are}} often {{conducted}} or repeated {{under field conditions}} {{to better understand the}} significance of seed ecology in forest regeneration. The incentive for much <b>forestry</b> research on <b>seeds</b> is directly related to testing alternative silvicultural treatments that facilitate natural regeneration. This section will briefly review forest practices that affect regeneration by seeds, and offer some suggestions for studying seed dynamics under field conditions. 8. 1. 1 Principles of forest stand manipulation In silviculture, the environmental factors discussed in Section 2 are manipulated to enhance the regeneration, establishment, and growth of desired tree crops. Most silvicultural practices are designed to alter either the canopy (the above-ground growing space), or the seedbed (the substrate for seedling establishment and the below-ground growing space). Promoting forest regeneration from seeds requires a favourable combination of seed supply, seedbed, and environmental conditions (Figure 8. 1), so many silvicultural practices are designed specifically to enhance these factors. Silvicultural practices may range from specialized procedures to induce tree seed production to the multipurpose practices of canopy opening and forest floor disturbance. Should these activities be unable to regenerate the desired tree species at target stocking levels, then specific site preparation operations are undertaken to create or improve microsites so they are more suitable for tree seedling establishment. Regeneration silviculture is based on two important principles of forest ecology: • Some level of disturbance (natural or artificial) is usually required to free plant growth resources and provide growing space for new trees (Bazzaz 1983; Canham and Marks 1985). • Seed germination and seedling emergence are crucial steps in the life cycle of many plant species, and only a narrow range of conditions is suitable for seedling establishment (Grubb 1977; Harpe...|$|R

Montgomery. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 104 pages, appendix p. 100 - 104. White spruce is highly valued for its wood pulp in commercial <b>forestry</b> in Minnesota. <b>Seed</b> orchards {{have been developed}} using genotypes selected for increased volume production. I conducted three different experiments to study the variation of ecophysiologic traits among genotypes selected from the Minnesota Tree Improvement Cooperative's program to better characterize the phenotype of selected genotypes. In chapter 1, I analyzed wood specific gravity, tree volume, and leaf traits on 25 -year old trees in a white spruce progeny test. Wood specific gravity was negatively correlated with tree volume. Needle traits, primarily specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR) and leaf mass ratio (LMR), were positively correlated with wood volume. In chapter 2, I planted seedlings from four genotypes selected for superior volume growth and two wild sources in a common garden. I harvested ten trees from each genotype, each year for three years. I examined biomass allocation, tree allometry and assessed genetic correlations among allocation of biomass to major organs. The largest differences in biomass {{were found between the}} two wild sources that represented two different seed zones in Minnesota. Selected sources more closely resembled the southern, than the northern, wild source. The northern wild sources had slightly higher allocation to roots but otherwise no significant differences in allometry were found. In chapter 3, I set up an outdoor experiment by planting five selected- and two wild- seed sources into 1 -gallon containers to test the effects of mid-winter warming on phenology and growth of white spruce. Bud-break time was delayed in plots that were warmed in February, and advanced in those warmed in March. Overall controls had the highest height growth and intermediate bud-break time. Climatic warming that takes place during winter months may delay or advance bud-break depending on the timing. Growth of white spruce is expected to decline with increased episodes of winter warming. Selected sources should be favored in reforestation across Minnesota because of the higher productivity and adaptability to local conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} project {{was carried out}} during 2007 - 08 at the Open University, UK to explore the suitable strategic policy & practices, and partnership possibilities for open, distance and e-learning (ODEL) programme for the postgraduate agricultural education in Bangladesh. The methodology followed {{was based on the}} searches on Internet, Journal articles, books, periodicals, brochures, proceedings, reports, attending lectures workshops, seminars, symposia, conferences, contacts, and visits to other Universities/Instition/Organisations for case studies. Under the new millennium context resurgence of global interest in web-based Open, distance and e-learning (ODEL) has been proved to be potentially useful strategy for human development issues, particularly due to the evolution of fast-growing as well as net-working new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The study reveals that though ODEL has been found widely used in many reputed and world leading universities in UK for higher studies leading to degrees, diploma and certificates on arts, general & environmental sciences as well the commerce subjects, and trainings for professional developments etc. The application ODEL especially in higher agricultural education and training leading to MScs and PhDs is almost scanty except a few cases of Fisheries and Livestock, the two sections of Agriculture in the Universities like the University of Sterling, University of Edinburgh and the University of London (Royal Veterinary College) etc. But in cases of other major areas of Agricultural subjects such as the crop sciences including Agronomy, Soil science, Crop botany, Horticulture, Plant Pathology, Entomology, Genetics & Pl. Breeding, Agric. Extension Education, Agric. Chemistry, Biochemistry, Agro <b>forestry,</b> Biotechnology, <b>Seed</b> Sci. & Techno. Farm Structure, Farm Power & Machinery, Irrigation & Water Management, Food Tech. & Rural Farm Industry, Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Finance, Agricultural Statistics, Ag. Cooperation & Ag. Marketing, Rural Development etc. the application of ODEL has not yet been found employed in anywhere except, a few recent endeavours under a limited scope in the Asian countries like India (IGNOU). ODEL extends the learning and self-development opportunities to those beyond the access to the conventional system due to professional, familial, economic, geographical etc. restrictions. The scenario is more acute especially in case of the applied science like Agriculture in Agriculture-dependent developing country like Bangladesh where the tool may be potential alternative to address the postgraduate agricultural education, the acute problem of a vast number of target group seeking higher studies. Bangladesh {{is one of the most}} thickly populated and agriculture dependent developing countries of the world, and Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) established in 1962 is only the premier seat of higher agricultural education and research in the country offering Masters and Doctoral degrees through the conventional face to face class room system. Since its establishment out of the total passed out bachelors (BSc Ag.) so far till July 2007 only 31. 29 % Masters and 0. 64 % PhDs have been produced. Bangladesh has recently been connected to the information super-highway through submarine cables. As a result, along with BTTB private companies already could ramify their ICT-based business orientations in different sectors like banking, transportation, administration etc. The use of computer and the long-ranged, portable electronic device with the telephone and the cell phone networks are widely used now a day. Under the circumstances, for better and progressive existence in the competitive global context it should be concentrated on its special attention to the ICT-based ODEL as a pragmatic focal issue with a view to transforming the ever increasing vast population potential into more productive force, so as to solve the higher agricultural education problems and ultimately towards greater awareness and appreciation leading to sustainable agricultural development and alleviating poverty in the country. The study evidences that there is an ample paradigm shift towards ODEL system in providing accessible postgraduate agricultural education in Bangladesh. On the basis of study on ODEL ongoing programmes at different Universities the following policy and practices have been recognised to be recommended to the concerned BAU authority. Ø The course materials for the students must be bespoke, having been developed for the ODEL mode, and are not simply a course that provides material on the web. It ensures that the students enjoy the same high quality teaching environment and exposure to innovation as the students on campus-based courses. Ø Development of adequate students’ supports and facilities along with valid accreditation of their degrees. Ø Development of highly skilled special academic as well as administrative expertise for the ODEL-based postgraduate in agricultural education programme. Ø For high technology and innovation as well as need-based action researches, global partnership development programme should be initiated. Thus BAU can go even beyond the boundary of the country with its high quality ODEL, especially Asian countries and the South Asian neighbourhood in particular but requires a strong need for an international intervention in planting the ‘ODEL seed’ into the conventional system in Bangladesh...|$|R
