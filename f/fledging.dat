5|$|Juveniles have a 43% {{chance of}} {{surviving}} their first year, and the annual survival rate of adults is about 80%. Choughs generally have a lifespan of about seven years, although an age of 17years has been recorded. The temperature and rainfall in the months preceding breeding correlates {{with the number of}} young <b>fledging</b> each year and their survival rate. Chicks <b>fledging</b> under good conditions are more likely to survive to breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those <b>fledging</b> under poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|Albatross chicks take a {{long time}} to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to <b>fledging</b> they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually <b>fledging</b> at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after <b>fledging,</b> unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E

2500|$|The Pterodactyl designs {{have their}} roots in the Manta <b>Fledge</b> hang gliders of the 1970s. The <b>Fledge</b> was {{designed}} by Klaus Hill and produced by Manta Products in a series that ran from the <b>Fledge</b> I to the IV, with numerous sub models designated by letters. The <b>Fledge</b> series were of a [...] "rigid-wing" [...] type, {{as opposed to the}} predominantly [...] "flex-wing" [...] hang glider designs then common. These designs all featured weight-shift pitch control and tip-rudders for yaw and roll control. The tip rudders were controlled by control-bar sliders which deployed one tip rudder at a time to create a yaw. The glider's swept wing then translated the yaw into a matched rolling motion. The <b>Fledge</b> series were considered to be high performance hang gliders during their production run in the 1970s.|$|R
25|$|California {{inventor}} Jack McCornack {{took the}} <b>Fledge</b> IIB wing and designed a tubular assembly that replaced the <b>Fledge's</b> hang glider seat with a reclined pilot seat, wheeled landing gear and engine mount for a pusher powerplant. The aircraft used a mouth-controlled throttle, as both hands were {{used on the}} tip rudder twist grips which were retained from the <b>Fledge.</b> The aircraft had no canard or tail and was a true flying wing. Power was supplied by a two-stroke Xenoah engine of 16 horsepower driving a 36-inch propeller. This new design, named the Pterodactyl Fledgling, was first flown in 1977. It is also referred to variously as the Pterodactyl <b>Fledge</b> and Pfledge.|$|R
50|$|After {{the chicks}} are {{six weeks of}} age, both parents go to sea to supply food to their rapidly growing offspring. Chicks usually <b>fledge</b> in mid-February and are totally {{independent}} from then on. Chick <b>fledge</b> weights are generally between 5 and 6 kg.|$|R
5|$|Incubation {{takes two}} weeks. The hatched young, called squabs, are {{strongly}} altricial, being helpless at hatching {{and covered with}} down. Both parents feed the squabs pigeon's milk (dove's milk) for the first 3–4 days of life. Thereafter, the crop milk is gradually augmented by seeds. <b>Fledging</b> takes place in about 11–15 days, before the squabs are fully grown but after {{they are capable of}} digesting adult food. They stay nearby to be fed by their father for up to two weeks after <b>fledging.</b>|$|E
5|$|The chicks are fed by {{the parents}} for several days after <b>fledging.</b> The family may travel as a group or the parents may divide the brood, taking one or two chicks each.|$|E
5|$|The chicks hatch 12–14days after {{incubation}} begins. Like all passerines, {{the chicks}} are altricial; they are hatched naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey down, and closed eyes. The mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow. The hatchlings develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing {{the growth of}} olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11–15days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up to three weeks after <b>fledging,</b> they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their <b>fledging</b> call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.|$|E

5|$|After breeding, {{adults have}} a {{complete}} moult which takes at least eight weeks; males acquire more yellow in the plumage each time they moult. Juveniles have a partial moult not long after <b>fledging,</b> replacing the head, body and some covert feathers.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are monogamous, mate for life, {{and defend}} territories. They usually lay two {{eggs in a}} nest that is either {{suspended}} from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share the tasks of incubation and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After <b>fledging,</b> each parent cares exclusively for one chick.|$|E
5|$|Around 56% of eggs lead to {{successful}} <b>fledging</b> of young, with fieldwork in northeastern Victoria yielding {{an average of}} 2.77 young leaving the nest. The lace monitor (Varanus varius) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) are nest predators. Baby birds may perish by overheating in very hot weather, or by being drowned in the hollows after heavy rain.|$|E

50|$|Breeding is {{at various}} seasons {{and may be}} {{variable}} for all races. They build large stick nests on any elevated structure available, and sometimes breed cooperatively. One to three eggs are laid. The incubation period is 26 to 36 days. The nestlings <b>fledge</b> anywhere from 40 to 74 days. The larger-bodied, high-elevation hawks take longer to incubate and much longer to <b>fledge</b> than lower elevation hawks.|$|R
5|$|Between October and January, and peaking in November, {{the species}} {{normally}} lays two smooth, white eggs, though sometimes it lays three or four. The incubation period and <b>fledging</b> {{time of this}} ground roller is unknown. After the young fledge, {{they live in a}} family group of four to five birds until approximately February, at which point the family disperses.|$|E
5|$|Eurasian rock pipits {{construct}} a cup nest under coastal vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay {{four to six}} speckled pale grey eggs which hatch in about two weeks with a further 16days to <b>fledging.</b> Although insects are occasionally caught in flight, the pipits feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the rocks or from shallow water.|$|E
5|$|In a British survey, a {{hatching}} rate of 82% and a <b>fledging</b> rate of 78% gave an overall 58% nesting success, {{with an average}} 2.5 surviving young per pair. In contrast, a study in northwestern France found juvenile mortality was nearly 70%. The average lifespan is not recorded, although the maximum recorded age is 10.9 years.|$|E
25|$|The chicks hatch {{naked and}} with closed eyes. <b>Fledged</b> juveniles usually appear as duller {{versions}} of the adult.|$|R

5|$|Juveniles moult their head, {{body and}} some wing {{feathers}} {{a few weeks}} after <b>fledging,</b> and adults have a complete moult after breeding. In both cases, if the process is not complete by the time of migration it is suspended and completed on the wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the {{tawny owl}} include large birds such as Ural owls, eagle owls, {{northern}} goshawks, golden eagles, and common buzzards. Pine martens may raid nests, especially where artificial nest boxes make the owls easy to find, and several instances {{have been recorded}} of Eurasian jackdaws building nests {{on top of a}} brooding female tawny owl leading to the death of the adult and chicks. A Danish study showed that predation by mammals, especially red foxes, was an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young, with 36% dying between <b>fledging</b> and independence. The mortality risk increased with <b>fledging</b> date from 14% in April to more than 58% in June, and increasing predation of late broods may be an important selective agent for early breeding in this species.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids are {{vulnerable}} to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic flotsam {{is a problem for}} the family as it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are <b>fledging</b> are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of <b>fledging</b> Barau's petrels are attracted to the streetlights on Réunion.|$|E
50|$|Choco toucans lay 3-4 {{pure white}} eggs that are {{incubated}} for 16 days. The young <b>fledge</b> in about 45-50 days.|$|R

50|$|Blue-winged teal ducklings {{can walk}} to water within 12 hours after {{hatching}} {{but do not}} <b>fledge</b> until 6 to 7 weeks.|$|R
5|$|Swifts as {{a family}} have smaller egg {{clutches}} and much longer and more variable incubation and <b>fledging</b> times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling tubenoses in these developmental factors. Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents; they can cope with not being fed {{for long periods of}} time, and delay their feather growth when undernourished. Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. These adaptations mean that when conditions are good, the survival rate is very high. One large Yellow Sea colony had hatching success of 73.5%, with 63.6% of the chicks <b>fledging.</b> The average productivity was 1.24fledged young per pair per year.|$|E
5|$|The female lays {{eight to}} {{thirteen}} creamy white to greenish-buff spotless eggs, on alternate days. Incubation takes 27 to 28 days and <b>fledging</b> takes 50 to 60 days. The ducklings are precocial and fully capable of swimming {{as soon as}} they hatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which chicks fledge varies dramatically. The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, {{following}} their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators. Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, {{they are able to}} fly. The amount of parental care after <b>fledging</b> varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after <b>fledging.</b> Chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration.|$|E
50|$|They are annual breeders {{and will}} lay one egg. Both parents will then {{incubate}} {{the egg and}} care for the young until they <b>fledge.</b>|$|R
