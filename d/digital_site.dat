Other major {{clients include}} Bell Sports, Converse, Hewlett-Packard, House of Marley, JVC, Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, MasterCraft, and Oakley, Inc. In November 2013, Converse named Nemo its North American agency of record for retail after working together for six months. Previously, the show company handled retail responsibilities in-house. The two companies had collaborated on a Jack Purcell shoe using the hybrid name [...] "Converse x Deus Ex Machina", for which Nemo created [...] "retail elements" [...] in Deus Ex Machina's Venice, California shop. Nemo helped Converse launch three shoes (Aerojam, Anarchy and Star Player Plus), branded as the CONS lifestyle sneaker collection, in Champs Sports, Foot Locker, and Footactions stores.

40|$|Combining {{national}} forest inventory (NFI) data with <b>digital</b> <b>site</b> maps of high resolution enables spatially explicit predictions of site productivity. The {{aim of this}} study is to explore the possibilities and limitations of this database to analyze the environmental dependency of height-growth of Norway spruce and to predict site index (SI) on a scale that is relevant for local forest management. The study region is the German federal state of Bavaria. The exploratory methods comprise significance tests and hypervolume-analysis. SI is modeled with a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). In a second step the residuals are modeled using Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). The interaction between temperature regime and water supply strongly determined height growth. At sites with very similar temperature regime and water supply, greater heights were reached if the depth gradient of base saturation was favorable. Statistical model criteria (Double Penalty Selection, AIC) preferred composite variables for water supply and the supply of basic cations. The ability to predict SI on a local scale was limited due to the difficulty to integrate soil variables into the model...|$|E

They enforce the {{regulations}} governing the operation of a correctional institution, serving as both a supervisor and counselor of inmates. Following the model of Dr. Doran Larson’s American Prison Writing Archive, a <b>digital</b> <b>site</b> for sharing prisoner narratives, this project collected interviews from prison employees and created a website for disseminating them. Privatized prisons, prisons for profit, and prisons for job creation have fostered problems throughout these institutions. “The private contracting of prisoners for work fosters incentives to lock people up. Prisons depend on this income. Corporate stockholders who make money off prisoners’ work lobby for longer sentences, in order to expand their workforce. The system feeds itself,” says {{a study by the}} Progressive Labor Party (Paelaez). This study takes a look into those who work within the United States Northwest prisons. Primarily the research focuses on Correctional Officers, retired and actively employed, in Idaho. The Idaho Correctional Facilities have moved dramatically from violence as a tool for management to the more meaningful and safe campaigns for both inmate and officer safety, over the past thirty years...|$|E
