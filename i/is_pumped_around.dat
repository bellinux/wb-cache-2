50|$|The first {{approach}} for the controlled production of phototrophic organisms was {{and still is}} a natural open pond or artificial raceway pond. Therein, the culture suspension, which contains all necessary nutrients and carbon dioxide, <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> <b>around</b> in a cycle, being directly illuminated from sunlight via the liquid’s surface. This construction principle is the simplest way of production for phototrophic organisms. But due to their depth (up to 0.3 m) and the related reduced average light supply, open systems only reach limited areal productivity rates. In addition, the consumption of energy is relatively high, as high amounts of water containing low product concentration have to be processed. Open space is expensive in areas with a dense population, while water is rare in others. Using open technologies causes high losses of water due to evaporation into the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The Foss Barrier {{is built}} {{across the river}} near its mouth at Castle Mills. When closed, it {{prevents}} floodwater from the River Ouse forcing {{the flow of the}} Foss back on itself. When the river Ouse reaches a level of 7.4m above ordnance datum, the staff at the barrier are alerted. When the level reaches 7.8m AOD the barrier is then lowered, after running pumps for several minutes to clear silt and debris from the river bed. This provides a watertight fit. It takes four minutes to lower the barrier. To avoid the build-up of water behind the barrier causing the Foss to burst its banks, the water <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> <b>around</b> the barrier and into the Ouse.

Thirteenth century anatomist and physiologist Ibn Al-Nafis accurately theorized that there was no 'direct' passage between the two sides (ventricles) of the heart.

The days of being satisfied with only simple hot product to cold feed exchange, restricted to the plot boundaries of each unit, are a thing of the past. This paper presents results of a refinery-wide survey to identify potential high temperature heat sources that are not being recovered and low temperature systems that consume fuel. The best candidates in each category were connected by a circulating heat medium loop where waste heat is recovered for useful purposes. The heat medium chosen is turbine fuel. It <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> <b>around</b> the refinery to pick up heat at the crude distilling unit, the hydrocracker, the catalytic cracker, and the coker; the heat is used to reboil a butylenes splitter column and to preheat boiler feed Water. The heat that is recovered is equivalent to some 660 B/D of fuel: at an illustrative fuel value of say $ 30 per barrel, the value of the recovered heat is $ 20, 000 per day. An energy conservation project at Shell's Norco (Louisiana) Manufacturing Complex involves several processing units and recovers heat that was previously lost to air or cooling water. The recovered heat is used to reboil a butylenes splitter column and to preheat boiler feed water. Essentially, the system consists of a circulating heat medium that transfers waste heat to heat consumers. The heat medium picks up heat from multiple donors and transfers it to multiple consumers...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 45) This study determined {{an acceptable}} {{design of a}} fuel handling machine to refuel future liquid metal fast breeder reactors (LMFBR). To date, approximately seven fuel handling machines have been designed' and built for small scale liquid metal cooled reactors. Limitations of these previously operated handling devices eliminated their use for, the LMFBR. A study was therefore performed to establish a simple machine to meet the more stringent design safety criteria for the future LMFBR spent fuel assemblies. This study was however restricted to only those aspects of the design believed to be particularly critical for such a fuel handling machine. Once these critical design: aspects are satisfied, the detailed design can be prepared by more conventional design techniques. Fuel assemblies from the reactor must be removed periodically and, replaced with new fuel assemblies. The heat generated by the fission products in these spent fuel assemblies can cause the assemblies to melt unless adequate cooling is provided. The cooling system is therefore the most critical component of the fuel handling machine. Since provision for adequate heat removal from a spent fuel assembly is the most critical aspect of the design, two independent heat removal systems are suggested to provide near complete redundancy. Each heat transfer system must be capable of removing the entire 27 Kw generated internally in the spent assembly being removed. Sodium in the liquid state is used to transfer heat from the fuel assembly to the outside surface of the transfer container. In {{one of the two}} independent cooling systems, all of the decay heat is transferred froi the outside surface of the transfer container to an air-cooled cold wall by radiation. In the second cooling system, cold argon <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> <b>around</b> the transfer container and through an air-to-argon heat exchanger to remove all of the decay heat of the spent fuel assembly by convection. Selection of the shielding material and the shielding dimension is the second critical design problem considered. The choice for shielding material is based on raw material costs, ease of fabrication, and shielding performance. No definitive answer exists to this selection problem, but this study showed that cast steel would be the best shielding material for this application. A flexible member must be used to raise and lower the fuel handling machine's grapple {{into and out of the}} reactor liquid sodium. To date none of the liquid metal reactor fuel handling machines have been designed with this constraint. The design of this component represented the third critical aspect of the design of the machine. The results show that log chain would be the best choice of the five alternative considered. A design concept for a IMFBR fuel handling machine evolved as a consequence of the results obtained by examination of the three critical design considerations discussed above...|$|E

50|$|An {{engineering}} {{option was}} designed to {{reduce the power loss}} due to engine radiator fan operation and to increase the heat available for heating of the passengers. After experiments by Wing-Commander T.R. Cave-Browne-Cave (CBC), Professor of Engineering at Southampton University, a satisfactory design was produced. The 'CBC' system involved two small engine radiators being placed above the driver's cab roof level at the front outer corners of the double deck to give maximum aerodynamic air flow. The engine coolant water <b>was</b> <b>pumped</b> <b>around</b> these instead of the traditional radiator. In cold weather, all or a portion of the air passing through these radiators, was diverted by flaps, the left into the upper saloon and the right to the lower deck. In hot weather, the flaps could be changed by push-pull levers in the driver's cab roof to divert all the hot air to the outside of the vehicle. The movement of the vehicle was (usually) adequate to cool the engine without the need for a fan or radiator at the traditional position in front of the engine. The traditional 'radiator' grille {{at the front of the}} vehicle was not required, but was usually retained (with a few exceptions) and blanked off behind. 'Varivane' wax capsule operated shutters were fitted in front of the upper radiators to keep the coolant at optimum temperature. There were some disadvantages to the scheme and eventually customers stopped specifying it.|$|R
40|$|The {{early stages}} of {{evaporation}} induced self-assembly of titanium oxide mesophases from a precursor solution containing TiCl 4 and the Pluronic triblock copolymer F- 127 in HCl-water-ethanol solution have been studied using time-resolved SAXS techniques. Two experimental protocols were used to conduct these experiments. In one of these, the precursor solution <b>was</b> <b>pumped</b> <b>around</b> a closed loop as solvent was allowed to evaporate at a constant humidity-controlled rate. In the second protocol, a film of precursor solution was measured periodically as it dried completely to a residue under a stream of dry air. This permitted the detailed monitoring of changes in solution chemistry {{as a function of}} the elimination of volatile components followed by the actual drying process itself. The SAXS data were modeled in terms of two Guinier radii for soft nanoparticles while a broad Gaussian feature in the scatter profiles was accounted for by particle-article scattering interference due to close packing. For the initial precursor solution, one Guinier radius was found to be about 17 (A) over circle while the other ranged from 4 to 11 (A) over circle. Changing the rate of evaporation affected the two radii differently with a more pronounced effect on the smaller particle size range. Analysis gave an interparticle distance in the range 55 - 80 (A) over circle for the initial precursor solution which decreased steadily at both of the humidities investigated as evaporation proceeded and the particle packing increased.

In this paper, exploitation and precipitation data are combined with the measured piezometric levels to analyse their relationship and help to understand the observed trend in declining groundwater storage.

40|$|The process {{industry}} is today aiming for more advanced process control strategies. These strategies rely on quick and accurate sensing of process variables. Considering processes where particles are suspended in a fluid, e. g. paper and pulp industry, {{there is a}} need for development of a new or improved in-line sensor technique determining different properties of the particles. In this study we present a sensing strategy where a combination of acoustical and optical measurement techniques is used. For this purpose have we designed and built a measurement cell which utilises the ultrasonic signal generated from an ultrasonic transducer as well as the ultrasonic, or photoacoustic, signal generated using a pulsed laser. The photoacoustic method is using the same transducer as in the transducer based method above. In the transducer based method, the well known pulse-echo technique is used. The pulse is generated by an ultrasonic transducer, travels through the suspension and reflects at a steel reflector. In the photoacoustic method, the ultrasonic transducer receives the ultrasound that is generated when a pulse of laser light is scattered and absorbed in the suspension. The laser beam enters the cell through fused silica windows. The laser beam is crossing the cell orthogonally to the ultrasonic transducer. The photoacoustic signal contains two echoes. The first echo is the acoustic signal which is generated when photons are absorbed by the medium. The second echo is the signal that has been travelling through the suspension and reflected at the steel reflector. The two measurement techniques were tested experimentally in the cell using aqueous suspensions of Nylon 66 fibres. The samples were mixed from fibres of three different diameters 17, 51 and 55 µ m with the length of 1. 2 mm for the 17 µm and 1. 5 mm for the 51 and 55 µm. The fibres were suspended in distilled and degassed water to mass fractions of 0. 12 % and 0. 25 %. Distilled and degassed water was also used as a reference medium when determining the calibration constants for the cell. The photoacoustic signal is generated using a double-pulsed laser having pulse energy of 10 mJ and the laser beam is focused at the centre of the cell. The suspension <b>was</b> <b>pumped</b> <b>around</b> in a closed loop using a peristaltic pump and the temperature of the suspension was monitored during the measurement cycle. The result shows that the signal generated using the transducer based method scales linearly with mass fraction for each type of fibre. The results also show that the photoacoustic signal is sensitive to the number density of scatters in the suspension, i. e. the amplitude of the signal decreases with decreasing fibre diameters. These preliminary results indicate that a combination of these two techniques might be used in resolving the proportion of different particles with different diameter in a suspension.
