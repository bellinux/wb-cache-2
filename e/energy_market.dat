5|$|In a liberalised <b>energy</b> <b>market,</b> investors, {{operators}} and consumers should face {{the full cost}} of their decisions. But {{this is not the case}} in many economies or energy sectors. Many policies distort the market in favour of existing fossil fuel technologies.|$|E
5|$|Renewable energy {{targets in}} most {{countries}} are indicative and nonbinding but they have assisted government actions and regulatory frameworks. The United Nations Environment Program has suggested that making renewable energy targets legally binding could be an important policy tool to achieve higher renewable <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> penetration.|$|E
40|$|Competition ensures {{competitive}} prices. In this respect, the liberalisation of the EU <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> is a must. The {{regulatory framework}} for the <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> should be properly designed and implemented by the member states {{in order to ensure}} enough competition. This paper aims to analyse the status quo of the EU <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> in terms of regulatory framework and degree of competition and to recommend improvements of the system in order to balance the issues of competition, energy security and environment protection in the EU <b>energy</b> <b>markets.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|From {{the aspect}} of capital flow, all kinds of <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> could affect one another, for example, the {{fluctuation}} of oil markets might affect the other <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> and affect the stability of power market further, and investment in {{the rapid expansion of}} renewable energy industries could benefit from the substantial appreciation of prices of fossil fuels and the introduction of carbon pricing. From {{the aspect of}} information flow, <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> rely on timely information being available to market participants, and the relationship between physical energy systems and <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> is bound by the rules of economic dispatch under security constraints, all facilitated by complex information and computation. The information flows within <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> and systems are not shown in Fig.  1.|$|R
40|$|Pollution Under Environmental Regulation in <b>Energy</b> <b>Markets</b> {{provides}} {{a study of}} environmental regulation when <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> are imperfectly competitive. This theoretical treatment focuses on three relevant cases of <b>energy</b> <b>markets.</b> First, the residential space heating sector where hybrid regulation such as taxation and emissions trading together are possible. Second, the electricity market where transactions are organized {{in the form of}} multi-period auctions. Third, namely natural gas (input) and electricity (output) markets where there is combined imperfect competition in vertical related <b>energy</b> <b>markets.</b>   The development of free or low carbon technologies supported by energy policies, aiming at increasing security of supply, is also explored whilst considering competition policies that reduce <b>market</b> power in <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> thus improving market efficiency. Pollution Under Environmental Regulation in <b>Energy</b> <b>Markets</b> discusses the key issues of whether imperfect competition can lessen the ability of environmental policy to reduce pollution and/or to minimize the cost of meeting environmental targets.   Policymakers, analysts and researchers gain a thorough understanding of the performance of environmental policy from Pollution Under Environmental Regulation in <b>Energy</b> <b>Markets</b> leading to better design of simulation models of performance and costs of environmental regulation...|$|R
5|$|After {{the end of}} the {{war there}} were {{extended}} arguments over how the pipelines should be used. In 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation purchased the pipelines for $143,127,000, the largest post-war disposal of war-surplus property. The corporation converted them to transport natural gas, transforming the <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> in the north-east. The Little Big Inch was returned to carry oil in 1957. The pipelines are owned by Spectra Energy Partners and Enterprise Products and remain in use.|$|E
5|$|The United States <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> {{is about}} 29,000 {{terawatt}} hours per year. Energy {{consumption per capita}} is 7.8tons (7076kg) of oil equivalent per year, the 10th-highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources. The United States is the world's largest consumer of petroleum.The United States has 27% of global coal reserves. It is the world's largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{the energy}} {{consumption}} was 240 billion kilowatt hours. As Turkey imported 72 {{percent of its}} energy in 2013, the government decided to invest in nuclear power to reduce imports. Three nuclear power stations are to be built by 2023. Turkey's first nuclear power plants are planned {{to be built in}} Mersin's Akkuyu district on the Mediterranean coast; in Sinop's İnceburun district on the Black Sea coast; and in Kırklareli's İğneada district on the Black Sea coast. Turkey has the fifth highest direct utilisation and capacity of geothermal power in the world. Turkey is a partner country of the EU INOGATE energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing energy security, convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU internal <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> principles, supporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.|$|E
30|$|In the grid-level, Blockchain {{can help}} to {{establish}} the trusted cross-border <b>energy</b> <b>markets.</b> Such markets could be inside of a country (e.g. cross-provincial <b>energy</b> <b>markets)</b> or be transnational. In these systems, the role of market operator is weakened from running the market to be the market supervisor, {{and there is no}} third-party regulator is needed to settle the energy transaction. Such secure cross-border <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> will be beneficial to optimize the energy allocation in wider communities.|$|R
40|$|Does {{bundling}} trigger mergers {{in energy}} industries? We observe mergers between firms belonging to various <b>energy</b> <b>markets,</b> for instance between gas and electricity providers. These mergers enable firms to bundle. We consider two horizontally differentiated markets. In this framework, {{we show that}} bundling strategies in <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> create incentives to form multi-market firms in order to supply bi-energy packages. Moreover, we find {{that this type of}} merger is detrimental to social welfare. Product Bundling Endogenous Mergers <b>Energy</b> <b>Markets...</b>|$|R

5|$|The main map (the upper {{two thirds}} of the screen) is divided into squares, on which players can {{establish}} bases, move units and engage in combat. Through terraforming, players may modify the effects of the individual map squares on movement, combat and resources. Resources are used to feed the population, construct units and facilities, and supply energy. Players can allocate energy between research into new technology and energy reserves. Unlike Civilization II, new technology grants access to additional unit components rather than pre-designed units, allowing players to design and re-design units as their factions' priorities shift. Energy reserves allow the player to upgrade units, maintain facilities, and attempt to win by the Global <b>Energy</b> <b>Market</b> scenario. Bases are military strongpoints and objectives that are vital for all winning strategies. They produce military units, house the population, collect energy, and build secret projects and Subspace Generators. Facilities and secret projects improve the performance of individual bases and of the entire faction.|$|E

25|$|Most issues {{regarding}} energy {{are controlled by}} the UK government, although control over planning laws allows the Scottish government to prevent {{the construction of new}} nuclear power stations in Scotland. Supporters of independence want to retain a single <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> for the whole of Great Britain after independence, in order to maintain price stability and support for suppliers. Opponents have said that independence would threaten the single <b>energy</b> <b>market.</b> Euan Phimister, professor of economics at Aberdeen University, has said that although independence would affect the relationship, it is likely that there would be continued English demand for electricity generated in Scotland because OFGEM projections suggest that there is little spare capacity. The second largest supplier of energy in the UK, SSE plc, believes that a single market would be the most likely outcome under independence, although it would require negotiations and may involve changes to the existing system.|$|E
