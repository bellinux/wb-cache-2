Instruments took on other purposes than accompanying singing or dance, and performers used them as solo instruments. Keyboards and lutes developed as polyphonic instruments, and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced tablature.

2500|$|Although {{the origins}} of the word [...] "emo" [...] are uncertain, it dates back to at least 1985. According to Andy Greenwald, author of , [...] "The origins of the term 'emo' are {{shrouded}} in mystery... but it first came <b>into</b> <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> in 1985. If Minor Threat was hardcore, then Rites of Spring, with its altered focus, was emotional hardcore or emocore." [...] Michael Azerrad, author of Our Band Could Be Your Life, also traces the word's origins to the mid-1980s: [...] "The style was soon dubbed 'emo-core,' a term everyone involved bitterly detested, although the term and the approach thrived for at least another fifteen years, spawning countless bands." [...] MacKaye traces it to 1985, attributing it to an article in Thrasher magazine referring to Embrace and other Washington, D.C. bands as [...] "emo-core" [...] (which he called [...] "the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard in my entire life"). Other accounts attribute the word to an audience member at an Embrace show, who shouted as an insult that the band was [...] "emocore". Others have said that MacKaye coined the word when he used it self-mockingly in a magazine, or that it originated with Rites of Spring.|$|E

Princeton University professor Sheldon Wolin describes this process as inverted totalitarianism. The United States can also be said to fit this description because of the enormous influence of corporate money on the US political system.

They are already here and {{have been here for}} years but are not being used properly. ”- David L Parnas, interview in Software Engineering Notes The process by which innovations move from research settings <b>into</b> <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> is called “technology transfer ” or “diffusion”. Researchers have found that it typically takes 10 – 15 years for innovations to flow down the technology transfer stream <b>into</b> <b>common</b> <b>practice.</b> It is a fact the many innovations in Software have been described in print for 15 years of more. Why aren’t they being used? The seminal work on technology transfer is Everett M Roger’s “Diffusion of Innovation”, which was originally published in 1962. By the time the fourth edition of this book was published in 1995, there were more than 3500 published works on this topic. The various categories of adopters of innovations are Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority and Laggards. Around 70 % of the adopters of Innovations are either Early Majority o...|$|E
