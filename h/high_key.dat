5|$|The Power of Four was {{commissioned}} by Sir Clive Woodward for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand and was written by Neil Myers. It was recorded by the Melody Music Lions Choir. The song is a classical composition played in a <b>high</b> <b>key.</b> It was first performed live by Welsh opera singer Katherine Jenkins before the British and Irish Lions rugby union match against Argentina at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales in 2005. it was performed despite suggestions of either God Save the Queen, the Welsh national anthem Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau {{or a combination of}} the anthems of the Home Nations of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland being played instead of The Power of Four. It is always sung in English.|$|E

Under the management of Luigi Barbesino, the Roman club came close to their first title in 1935–36, finishing just one point behind champions Bologna.|$|E

The gold and the purple-red represent Roman imperial dignity. White shorts and black socks are usually worn with the red shirt, however in particularly <b>high</b> <b>key</b> matches, the shorts and socks are the same colour as the home shirt.|$|E

500|$|Except for the 1894-S dime, {{there are}} no great rarities in the series, as mintages were {{generally}} <b>high.</b> <b>Key</b> dates for the dime include the 1895-O, 1896-S, 1897-O, 1901-S and 1903-S. For the quarter, key dates are the 1896-S, 1901-S, and 1913-S. The rarest half dollar is the 1892-O [...] "Micro O", in which the mint mark [...] "O" [...] for New Orleans was impressed on the half dollar die with a puncheon intended for the quarter; other key dates are the regular 1892-O, 1892-S, 1893-S, 1897-O, 1897-S, 1914, and 1915. As half dollars were heavily circulated, prices tend to steeply rise for all coins in higher grades. [...] "Condition rarities", relatively inexpensive in circulated condition but costly in high grades, include the 1901-S, 1904-S, and 1907-S half dollars. Thus, although most dates are obtainable, many are scarce in uncirculated grades. Note too that in 1909 a new half dollar hub was introduced. [...] This made the headband word [...] "Liberty" [...] stronger, thus changing a grading diagnostic. [...] Finally, large quantities of Barber coins were melted for bullion when silver prices rose in the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|The offer was, of course, {{dependent}} on {{the approval of the}} owner of Harper's Bazaar, William Randolph Hearst. Brodovitch eagerly returned to Philadelphia and assigned his students apprenticing at his Van Pelt Street studio to make two dummy issues of the magazine. [...] He insisted that each page have a [...] "shock value" [...] of its own to set the magazine apart, [...] "cutting paper dolls out of patterned paper, or illustration perfume bottles to look like <b>high</b> <b>key</b> photography - whatever was unlike other fashion magazines was tried." [...] Although preferring more conservative design, Hearst put his trust in Carmel Snow and allowed her to take on Brodovitch as art director where he remained for 24 years.|$|E

However, as current sources operate at a low efficiency and frequency key rates and transmission distances are limited. Another solution is to modify the BB84 protocol, as is done for example in the SARG04 protocol, in which the secure key rate scales as [...] The most promising solution is the decoy state protocol, in which Alice randomly sends some of her laser pulses with a lower average photon number. These decoy states can be used to detect a PNS attack, as Eve has no way to tell which pulses are signal and which decoy. Using this idea the secure key rate scales as , the same as for a single photon source. This idea has been implemented successfully first at the University of Toronto, and in several follow-up QKD experiments, allowing for <b>high</b> <b>key</b> rates secure against all known attacks.|$|E

25|$|An oft-repeated {{story that}} the whistle used in the {{arrangement}} was an innovation by the record's producer appears to be unfounded because very similar arrangements, complete with whistle, had been recorded on earlier versions by Earl Royce & The Olympics (UK, 1964) and by The <b>High</b> <b>Keys</b> (USA, 1963).|$|R
