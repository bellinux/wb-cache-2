5|$|Donald Gray, who {{had found}} himself typecast after {{appearing}} in the lead role in Saber of London, a detective series, was having to resort to voice work to support his acting career. The South African actor was selected for three regular roles: Colonel White, Captain Black and the Mysterons. After <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> hijacked in the pilot episode, Black speaks with the same voice that the Mysterons are heard to use when transmitting threats to Earth. For his portrayals of Black and his Mysteron masters, Gray's voice was electronically deepened, by running the tape at high speed whilst he was recording his lines and playing it back at normal speed, to produce a haunting effect.|$|E

The {{returned}} Prime attempts to get proactive by moving {{the location of the}} Ark-19, but it is shot down by Sixshot, though the crew survive. The subsequent battle between Prime and Sixshot exposes the Transformers to the world at large and forces the military to call in a carpet bombing strike. The Autobots escape, but Verity and Jimmy are seemingly killed. Elsewhere, Hot Rod and Wheeljack set out to recover Ironhide's body, but are confronted by the Machination's Headmaster army, only escaping due to Wheeljack's gadgets.

Meanwhile, Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), the commander of a Klingon vessel, intercepts information about Genesis. Believing the device to be potentially useful as a weapon, he takes his cloaked ship to the Genesis planet, destroys the Grissom, and searches the planet for the survivors.|$|E
500|$|... "Phyllis' Wedding" [...] {{was written}} by staff writer Caroline Williams and {{directed}} by Ken Whittingham, his fifth such credit for the series. Recurring guest stars Creed Bratton, Rashida Jones, and Bobby Ray Shafer appeared in the episode. The episode {{is the first of}} the series to revolve around a wedding. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Baumgartner described the episode, [...] "Michael plays a very important role in that wedding. He is to walk Phyllis' dad down the aisle by pushing him in a wheelchair, which in <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> him walking Phyllis down the aisle, a very important position of authority. Of course, Phyllis has asked him to do this only so she can get six weeks of vacation time. But for him it's a place of honor, and from there, things don't go quite the way that he hopes." ...|$|E

500|$|During the {{classical}} period, the main justification for slavery was economic. From a philosophical point of view, {{the idea of}} [...] "natural" [...] slavery emerged at the same time; thus, as Aeschylus states in The Persians, the Greeks [...] "f no man are they called the slaves or vassals", while the Persians, as Euripides states in Helen, [...] "are all slaves, except one" [...] — the Great King. Hippocrates theorizes about this latent idea {{at the end of}} the 5th century BC. According to him, the temperate climate of Anatolia produced a placid and submissive people. This explanation is reprised by Plato, then Aristotle in Politics, where he develops the concept of [...] "natural slavery": [...] "for he that can foresee with <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> naturally ruler and naturally master, and he that can do these things with his body is subject and naturally a slave." [...] As opposed to an animal, a slave can comprehend reason but [...] "…has not got the deliberative part at all." ...|$|E
500|$|For Hazlitt, Othello is {{especially}} notable for {{the interplay between}} the characters, and the way Shakespeare communicates the slow and gradual [...] "movement of passion [...] the alternate ascendancy of different passions, [...] the entire and unforeseen change from the fondest love and most unbounded confidence to the tortures of jealousy and the madness of hatred." [...] He finds especially remarkable the gradual alteration of Othello's feelings about Desdemona as <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> played upon by Iago. Othello is not naturally a violent person in everyday life: [...] "The nature of the Moor is noble, confiding, tender and generous; but his blood is of the most inflammable kind; and being once roused {{by a sense of}} his wrongs, he is stopped by no considerations of remorse or pity till he has given a loose to all the dictates of his rage and despair.

Later, the two run into each other again and Kenneth tries to talk to Tracy, but Tracy refuses to acknowledge him as he believes <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> playing tricks on him. To prove he is real, Kenneth throws himself in front of a car, thus making Tracy believe him. He pleads with Kenneth to come back to NBC, but Kenneth says he is happy working at CBS. At the end of the credits, Kenneth admits to himself that he lied to Tracy and that he misses everyone at TGS. [...] Kenneth then starts hallucinating Tracy.|$|E

500|$|In December 2008, he {{appeared}} alongside his Blackpool co-star David Tennant in [...] "The Next Doctor", the 2008 Christmas special of Doctor Who, playing Jackson Lake, {{a man who}} believes he is the Doctor after <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> affected by alien technology. Morrissey {{had been asked to}} appear in the series before but had to turn down the offers due to other commitments. He approached the character like any other dramatic part, and was influenced in his performance by previous Doctor actors William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton and Tom Baker. Secrecy surrounded the exact details of Morrissey's role in the episode; until the day of broadcast his character was referred to only as [...] "the other Doctor". This prompted media speculation that Morrissey would be taking over the lead role after Tennant quit, and in October 2008 he was reported as a favourite of bookmakers. He was pleased that the episode was a [...] "decoy" [...] for the truth that actor Matt Smith had actually been chosen for the part of the Eleventh Doctor. In September 2009, he told entertainment website Digital Spy that he would gladly return to the show if asked.|$|E
500|$|November {{began with}} a home match against Manchester United. Going into the match, both clubs were level on points and goal difference, {{at the top of}} the league.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored what was thought to be the winning goal, eight minutes from the end, but Arsenal equalised for the second time in the match via Gallas. The draw pleased Wenger, who after the game noted his team were [...] "...still charge of the title race because we are top with a game in hand". A win against Reading at the Madjeski Stadium on 12 November 2007 brought about Arsenal's 1,000th Premier League goal, scored by Adebayor. Reading striker Dave Kitson afterwards praised Arsenal's performance and asserted they were [...] "the best team on the planet": [...] "The thing that amazes you most is they are not just passing to each other – they are passing so that person can run on to the ball and then <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> already made up what he is going to do next.

Vaughn added that Bacon [...] "had that bravado that Shaw needed", while stating that the actor was his top choice along with Colin Firth. Bacon accepted the role as he was a fan of Vaughn's Kick-Ass, and liked both the character of Shaw and the script, which he described as [...] "a fresh look at the franchise, but also the comic book movies in general". The actor considered that Shaw was a sociopath to whom [...] "the morality of the world did not apply", with producer Simon Kinberg adding that Bacon portrayed him as [...] "somebody, who in <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>is</b> the hero of the movie". Bacon also said that, [...] "aside from the kind of evil side, I portrayed him as kind of a Hugh Hefner type". Vaughn discarded Shaw's look from the comics as he felt he would [...] "look like an Austin Powers villain".|$|E
