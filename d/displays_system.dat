Traffic operations centers (TOCs) that monitor and manage traffic are one example of such implementations. The present study is believed {{to be one of the}} first research efforts to investigate issues of team process, information display, and automation within TOCs. ^ The implementation of two shared <b>display</b> <b>systems,</b> a manual <b>display</b> <b>system</b> and an automated <b>display</b> <b>system,</b> within a TOC in the northeast US was evaluated based on principles of ecological interface design and social cybernetic theory. Each <b>display</b> <b>system</b> was evaluated in terms of its impact on overall TOC performance as assessed via objective traffic measures, and on operator workload, situation awareness (SA), team coordination within the TOC, and satisfaction with the <b>display</b> <b>system</b> as assessed via subjective operator survey responses. For each <b>display</b> <b>system,</b> data were collected for two weeks during weekday commute periods (defined as 6 : 30 am- 9 : 30 am and 3 : 30 pm- 6 : 30 pm). ^ Two-by-two multivariate analyses of variance were used to test the effects of <b>display</b> <b>system</b> and time of day on objective TOC performance measures and subjective operator ratings. No differences in TOC performance were found based on <b>display</b> <b>system</b> or time of day. Operator ratings of overall workload were higher with the automated <b>display</b> <b>system</b> and during the evening commute. A <b>display</b> <b>system</b> by time of day interaction was also found. Significant differences were also found in operator ratings of the individual workload components. Trend-level differences were found in overall operator SA, with overall operator SA higher with the automated <b>display</b> <b>system.</b> Operator SA of past traffic conditions was higher with the automated <b>display</b> <b>system,</b> and SA of future traffic conditions was higher during the morning commute. No differences were found in operator ratings of teamwork between the two <b>display</b> <b>systems,</b> however time of day differences were found. Operator satisfaction did not differ between the two <b>display</b> <b>systems.</b> ^ The present study suggests that principles of ecological interface design and social cybernetic theory can be used to understand why specific human factors design aspects of shared displays promote SA and benefit certain aspects of operator workload within control room settings. ...|$|R

Also use of traditional keyboard in multi-lingual environment is tricky job. The virtual keyboard we proposed uses only 2 D webcam and no other hardware and a sheet of paper with keyboard printed on it.

40|$|A tape {{certification}} program tests the useability of magnetic tape at different densities by writing test patterns and re-reading them. The ability to certify tapes {{is important in}} environments that do large amounts of tape processing. TAPECERT is a VAX utility for tape certification in use at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Multi-Mission Image Processing Laboratory which handles data from projects such as Voyager and Galileo.

40|$|In this {{research}} an Ethernet-based lotto betting machine is developed, tested and deployed as an embedded web-client in a network. The device’s hardware mainly comprises a microcontroller, an Ethernet network interface shield, a keypad for input and an LCD screen output. The web-client sends requests {{to a remote}} Windows-Apache-MySQL-PHP (WAMP) server using PHP scripts. The Apache webserver serves the requests by querying the MySQL database where user identification, player-tokens and winning number records are stored and sends bet receipt SMS messages directly to users. To access the system a player enters a pre-purchased token number that allows them several chances via keypad. The remote server checks the token for authenticity, allows the user to enter a 6 -digit number and registers the number in the database. It then sends a bet acknowledgement SMS while the LCD <b>displays</b> <b>system</b> transaction messages. This system eliminates the use of paper in betting slips, receipts and associated spoilt paper.

The Project {{was made}} in TRIMPOT ELECTRONICAS Ltda. This is an {{electronical}} components manufacturing enterprise. The East plant has a water supply system conformed by a deep well pump which feeds two capture tanks automatically and feeds manually an emergency tank. The level control systems of the tanks was installed more than 25 years ago and it has undergone many modifications due to component failures. Furthermore, {{it did not have}} any monitoring system interface, which allowed observing and controlling the actuators, besides identifying failures generating alarm messages on the computer screen. In this project, the control system for filling the process tanks was updated and improved, and the emergency tank was included in the control system. This was done with an Omron PLC controlled by ultrasonic sensors, flow sensors and pressure transmitters. The sequence also considers the time to decrease the probability that the well pump will start in the peak period of CNFL billing and increase in the night period An application was also designed in LabVIEW that communicates with the PLC via FINS / UDP, Omron protocol, with which it is possible to monitor the status of tank levels and volumes, pressures and specific pipeline flows, remotely control the solenoid valves and the deep well pump, perform configurations and also <b>displays</b> <b>system</b> alerts.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} performance of the digital servo and motion control system for the 6 -meter diameter parabolic antennas of the Submillimeter Array (SMA) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The system {{is divided into three}} nested layers operating at a different, appropriate bandwidth. (1) A rack-mounted, real-time Unix system runs the position loop which reads the high resolution azimuth and elevation encoders and sends velocity and acceleration commands at 100 Hz to a custom-designed servo control board (SCB). (2) The microcontroller-based SCB reads the motor axis tachometers and implements the velocity loop by sending torque commands to the motor amplifiers at 558 Hz. (3) The motor amplifiers implement the torque loop by monitoring and sending current to the three-phase brushless drive motors at 20 kHz. The velocity loop uses a traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm, while the position loop uses only a proportional term and implements a command shaper based on the Gauss error function. Calibration factors and software filters are applied to the tachometer feedback prior to the application of the servo gains in the torque computations. All of these parameters are remotely adjustable in software. The three layers of the control system monitor each other and are capable of shutting down the system safely if a failure or anomaly occurs. The Unix system continuously relays antenna status to the central observatory computer via reflective memory. In each antenna, a Palm Vx hand controller <b>displays</b> <b>system</b> status and allows full local control of the drives in an intuitive touchscreen user interface. It can also be connected outside the cabin for convenience during antenna reconfigurations. Excellent tracking performance (0. 3 arcsec rms) is achieved with this system. It has been in reliable operation on 8 antennas for over 10 years and has required minimal maintenance.
