40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the concept of second law applications to all processes of thermofluid systems. The presentation is motivated by the need for engineers to be familiar with the new concept of exergy and entropy generation minimization, EGM which are used to design industrial production plants or individual components to maximize their energetic efficiency, and to minimize their environmental impact. It is essential for understanding to what extent resource and <b>energy</b> <b>scarcities,</b> nature’s capacity to assimilate loss as well as the irreversibility of transformation processes, constrain economic action. With these techniques and computational fluid dynamics, CFD, which is used for the conversion of the differential equations of flow to algebraic equations, designers can use the second law to focus on particular regions where design modifications can be made to improve and optimize thermofluid systems performance. Two case studies of exergy/EGM computations are presented for the design of open cycle simple gas turbine and vapour compression refrigeration...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 168 - 173. In {{this thesis}} {{the energy sector}} of the East and Southern Africa Region (as defined by the World Energy Council) is investigated. Special {{attention}} is given to South Africa and the potential future role she could play in the region. The region is characterized by large population growth rates, insufficient economic growth, political and civil instability, massive urbanization, high illiteracy rates, {{a low level of}} development, a lack of finance and foreign exchange, and inadequate institutional structures, all of which effect the energy sector making the provision of a sustainable and adequate supply of energy difficult. On the other hand, South Africa, the economic giant of the region, has a sophisticated and well established energy infrastructure and•has the potential to play a large role in the energy sector of the region. A large portion of the region's energy demand is supplied by traditional energy sources and is consumed by the domestic sector. In many countries of the region, energy demand exceeds sustainable supply, resulting in <b>energy</b> <b>scarcities</b> and increased deforestation. These issues need to be addressed as a priority. Reforestation based on agro- forestry, was identified as the option most likely to succeed in this regard. Although commercial energy resources are abundant within the region, they are largely unexploited {{as a result of the}} lack of suitably large markets, vast distances, a lack of finance and regional instability. The promotion of the utilization of these resources, which would ease supply constraints, is reliant on regional cooperation and the trade in energy. Forecasts of future energy consumption in the region indicate that unless present constraints on the energy sector are alleviated, the adequate supply of energy, and in particular traditional energy, will be jeopardized. It is proposed that any long-term cost-effective solution for the provision of an adequate and sustainable supply of energy requires regional political stability and cooperation, institutional reform, the integration of traditional and commercial energy structures, and should address the issues of deforestation and population growth...|$|R

The latter can be potentially used for additional industrial processes, such as thermal desalination, material drying, residential heating, greenhouse heating, and a wide variety of membrane distillation processes that can desalinate water without using additional energy, thus saving water and energy. These applications avoid environmental damage and they are able to capture and later use energy currently wasted.Crystal Lagoons’ sustainable cooling system for thermal power plants was successfully applied to Endesa’s San Isidro combined-cycle thermal power plant for more than a year. The project proved mathematical models, validating sustainability and optimal heat and cold transfer rates. This technology is currently being commercialized.Crystal Lagoons has recently created an alliance with a well renowned European scientific research institution in order to develop its first desalination plant.

This is a result of growing challenges associated with the increasing <b>energy</b> cost, <b>scarcity</b> of water resources and stricter environmental legislation. Dry comminution technologies, such as High Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR) and Vertical Roller Mills (VRM), have been successfully used in other industries such as cement and coal for decades, and the literature claims that these technologies are more energy efficient than conventional comminution practices. Pilot scale testing was conducted for each of these technologies using rock with properties similar to many mineral ores to test the claims in the literature and evaluate the applicability for hard rock mining operations. Whilst the test results for the HPGR and VRM are not directly comparable (due to different degree of size reduction), both demonstrated the potential for considerable energy savings compared to conventional ball milling. The HPGR and air classification circuit used 20 - 30 % less energy than the HGPR, screen, ball mill circuit.
