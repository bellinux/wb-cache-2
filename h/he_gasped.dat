25|$|After {{his captors}} departed, he freed himself by chewing through the ropes with his teeth, {{and made his}} way through the miles of jungle to American lines. Before {{accepting}} medical attention from Lt. Col. Stanley Radzyminski MD, <b>he</b> <b>gasped</b> a warning to Martin Clemens and Lieutenant Colonel Edwin A. Pollock, whose 2nd Battalion 1st Marines held the defences at the Ilu River mouth. Vouza told him that an estimated 250 to 500 Japanese soldiers were coming to attack his position in any minute. This warning gave the Marines brief but precious time of about 10 minutes to prepare their defences along the Ilu river. The subsequent Battle of the Tenaru was a clear victory for the Marines.|$|E
500|$|Midazolam {{has been}} used as part of a three-drug cocktail, with vecuronium bromide and {{potassium}} chloride in Florida and Oklahoma prisons. [...] Midazolam has also been used along with hydromorphone in a two-drug protocol in Ohio and Arizona. Ohio used midazolam in the execution of Dennis McGuire in January 2014; it took McGuire 24 minutes to die after the procedure started, and <b>he</b> <b>gasped</b> and appeared to be choking during that time, leading to questions about the dosing and timing of the drug administration, as well as the choice of drugs.|$|E

6000|$|Again gurgles {{the mouth}} of my dying general, he furiously waves [...] with his hand, [...] <b>He</b> <b>gasps</b> through the clot Mind not me--mind--the entrenchments.|$|R
6000|$|PETKOFF. You! (<b>He</b> <b>gasps.)</b> Sergius: do you {{remember}} how those two women went on this morning when we mentioned it? (Sergius smiles cynically. Petkoff confronts Raina severely.) You're a nice young woman, aren't you? ...|$|R
60|$|NAPOLEON (his breath {{taken away}} by the coolness of the proposal). A fair di-- (<b>He</b> <b>gasps.)</b> It seems to me, madame, that you have come to regard my letters as your own property, of which I am trying to rob you.|$|R

60|$|Something of {{his former}} Gawd-help-us-ness seemed to return to him. <b>He</b> <b>gasped</b> a bit.|$|E
6000|$|... "It an't {{right for}} him to turn 'em up in that way," [...] said the {{astonished}} Carrier, [...] "is it? See how he's winking with both of 'em at once! and look at his mouth! Why, <b>he's</b> <b>gasping</b> like a gold and silver fish!" ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY CICELY. I didn't give orders: I {{just asked}} him. He {{has such a}} nice face! Don't you think so, Captain Kearney? (<b>He</b> <b>gasps,</b> speechless.) And now will you excuse me a moment. I {{want to speak to}} {{somebody}} before the inquiry begins. (She hurries out.) ...|$|R
5000|$|He again {{asks her}} name, but again she says [...] "Mi fein." [...] As he {{approaches}} her, she throws boiling water at him. He flees to his mother, Maggy Moulach, who asks who wounded him. Fatally burned by the boiling water, <b>he</b> <b>gasps</b> out [...] "Me fein" [...] (Me Myself) {{as he was}} told.|$|R
6000|$|The room {{remained}} {{still as}} before. Presently <b>he</b> <b>gasped</b> again: [...] "Throat--water--Sue--darling--drop of water--please--oh please!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him then, and <b>he</b> <b>gasped</b> at the {{deepening}} glow in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|He {{handed the}} thing to his secretary. Rupert Baxter's eyes lit up with sudden enthusiasm. <b>He</b> <b>gasped.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Colonel had {{straightened}} himself, though <b>he</b> still <b>gasped</b> {{a little}} in his breathing.|$|R
25|$|The Prior again {{demands that}} Alaide reveal her identity, but she refuses. However, she does agree {{to lift her}} veil for the Prior alone and <b>he</b> <b>gasps</b> upon seeing her face. Immediately, he sends her away with Valdeburgo. Arturo is left alone, while the Prior chastises Osburgo for his false {{testimony}} against Alaide, stating that his actions will be watched.|$|R
5000|$|Mungo {{lifts his}} knife over Chapman and cries, [...] "Revenge!" [...] Gilberto rounds {{the corner and}} grabs the angry cook just in time. [...] "Mungo!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>gasps,</b> [...] "Mungo, never kill a customer!" [...] Gilberto dies from his war wound. Mungo raises his knife again, but Gaston tackles him before he can kill Chapman.

6000|$|... "Now we {{have time}} to breathe, lord," [...] <b>he</b> <b>gasps.</b> [...] "See, here is water," [...] and he takes a pitcher that stands by, and gives Eric to drink from the pool, then drinks himself and pours the rest of the water on Eric's wound. Then new life comes to them, and they both stand on their feet and win back their breath.|$|R
6000|$|... (He {{disappears into}} Olhausen's, the porkbutcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A {{few moments later}} he emerges from under the shutter, puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one {{containing}} a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter, sprinkled with wholepepper. <b>He</b> <b>gasps,</b> standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his ribs and groans.) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> {{stumbled}} <b>gasping</b> {{into the}} thick gloom, and {{the roar of the}} traffic came to his bewildered ears.|$|R

50|$|Whereas {{the finale}} symbolizes a cheerful man:I {{have tried to}} sketch a man who storms thoughtlessly forward {{in the belief that}} the whole world belongs to him, that fried pigeons will fly into his mouth without work or bother. There is, though, a moment in which {{something}} scares him, and <b>he</b> <b>gasps</b> all at once for breath in rough syncopations: but this is soon forgotten, and even if the music turns to minor, his cheery, rather superficial nature still asserts itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" [...] <b>he</b> finally <b>gasped,</b> {{sitting up}} and wiping his eyes. [...] "This is too rich! It's almost too joyful to be true." ...|$|R

With this, <b>he</b> <b>gasps</b> to his companion and attorney, Dr. Gonzo, [...] "We can't stop here. This is bat country." ...|$|R
