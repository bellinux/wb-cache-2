5|$|Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder {{mentioned}} that damp wood sometimes <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> a glow and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen {{was involved in}} the process, both in wood and in glow-worms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments where dinoflagellates cause phosphorescence in the surface layers of water. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.|$|E

5|$|Direct {{clitoral}} stimulation involves physical stimulation to {{the external}} anatomy of the clitoris– glans, hood and the external shaft. Stimulation of the labia minora (inner lips), due to its external connection with the glans and hood, may {{have the same effect}} as direct clitoral stimulation. Though these areas may also receive indirect physical stimulation during sexual activity, such as when in friction with the labia majora (outer lips), indirect clitoral stimulation is more commonly attributed to penile-vaginal penetration. Penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve, which <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris) or by the crura ("legs").|$|E
5|$|In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, {{received}} {{instructions from}} Treasury officials {{to clear the}} old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the furnaces ran up {{the walls of the}} basement in which they were housed, under the floors of the Lords' chamber, then up through the walls and out through the chimneys.|$|E

40|$|Some rare {{anomalies}} of the celiaco-mesenteric {{system were}} observed postmortem in a Japanese adult male: a) The left gastric, common hepatic, splenic and superior mesenteric arteries arose independently from the abdominal aorta. b) The anterior {{inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery}} of the superior mesenteric artery issued a hepatic artery which ascended along the anterior surface of the pancreas and <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> the right gastroepiploic, right gastric and cystic arteries. c) The common hepatic artery <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> an anastomosing branch to the superior mesenteric artery. d) The left gastric artery <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> the left accessory hepatic artery. e) The splenic artery issued the accessory middle colic artery. f) The left inferior phrenic artery <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> the esophageal branch. These anomalies are discussed in light of a typological system which we proposed in a previous paper for the celiaco-mesenteric system. </p...|$|R

5|$|Kakashi reveals to Naruto that Minato {{intended}} {{to combine the}} Rasengan with his elemental chakra {{but was unable to}} complete the technique. Naruto is able to complete his father's work through the use of shadow clones. In order to perform it, Naruto requires the aid of two shadow clones; he provides the chakra, one clone is responsible for the shape transformation, and the other provides the nature transformation. By manipulating the wind-natured chakra of the Wind Release: Rasengan, Naruto was able to create four large points, causing the Rasengan to take on the appearance of a giant fūma shuriken, with the Rasengan in the center remaining a perfect sphere. The technique <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> a loud screech-like noise during and following formation.|$|E
5|$|She was {{acutely aware}} of the {{importance}} of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, and even a Nobel Prize, would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann. Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The heart pumps blood with {{a rhythm}} {{determined}} {{by a group of}} pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.|$|E

5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E

50|$|In the 1770s Ingenhousz became {{interested}} in gaseous exchanges of plants. He did this after meeting the scientist Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) at his house in Birstall, Yorkshire on 23 May 1771. Priestley had found out that plants make and absorb gases. Ingenhousz' travelling party in northern England included Benjamin Franklin. In 1779, Ingenhousz discovered that, {{in the presence of}} light, plants <b>give</b> <b>off</b> bubbles from their green parts while, in the shade, the bubbles eventually stop. He identified the gas as oxygen. He also discovered that, in the dark, plants <b>give</b> <b>off</b> carbon dioxide. He realised as well that the amount of oxygen <b>given</b> <b>off</b> in the light is more than the amount of carbon dioxide <b>given</b> <b>off</b> in the dark. This demonstrated that some of the mass of plants comes from the air, and not only the water and nutrients in the soil.|$|R

Items such as a stove, dish washer, clothes dryer, hot water and incandescent lighting all add heat to the home. Low power or insulated versions of these devices give off less heat for the {{air conditioning}} to remove. The air conditioning system can also improve in efficiency by using a heat sink that is cooler than the standard air heat exchanger such as geothermal or water.|$|E
25|$|Bow hair is {{traditionally}} horsehair, though synthetic hair, in varying colors, is also used. Prior to playing, the musician tightens the bow by turning a screw {{to pull the}} frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back, and increase the tension of the hair. Rosin is applied by the player to make the hairs sticky. Bows need to be re-haired periodically. Baroque style (1600–1750) cello bows were much thicker and were formed with a larger outward arch when compared to modern cello bows. The inward arch of a modern cello bow produces greater tension, which in turn <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> a louder sound.|$|E
25|$|The {{obturator}} nerve (L2-L4) passes medially behind psoas major {{to exit the}} pelvis through the obturator canal, after which it <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> branches to obturator externus and divides into two branches passing behind {{and in front of}} adductor brevis to supply motor innervation to all the other adductor muscles. The anterior branch also supplies sensory nerves to the skin on a small area on the distal medial aspect of the thigh. The femoral nerve (L2-L4) is the largest and longest of the nerves of the lumbar plexus. It supplies motor innervation to iliopsoas, pectineus, sartorius, and quadriceps; and sensory branches to the anterior thigh, medial lower leg, and posterior foot.|$|E
