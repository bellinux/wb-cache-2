25|$|Spark offers {{asymmetric}} <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (ADSL), very-high-bit-rate <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (VDSL) and fibre to {{the premises}} (FTTP) fixed-line broadband. FTTP customers may choose either 30/10Mbit/s, 100/20 Mbit/s, 200/20 Mbit/s, 200/200 Mbit/s, or in selected areas, 1000/500Mbit/s maximum speed (down/up); ADSL and VDSL customers' download speeds are only limited to what their line and equipment can handle, while upload speeds {{are limited to}} 1Mbit/s and 10Mbit/s respectively. All three offer both data-capped and unlimited plans. Data-capped customers may choose either to pay extra per GB (or part thereof) over their data cap, or have their speed throttled back to 128kbit/s at no charge once they exceed the cap. Unlimited plans have no data caps, but a customer's download and upload speeds may be throttled during times of network congestion.|$|E
25|$|ITU G.992.5 (also {{referred}} to as ADSL2+, G.dmt.bis+, and G.adslplus) is an International Telecommunication Union standard for asymmetric <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (ADSL) broadband Internet access. The standard has a maximum theoretical download speed of 24 Mbit/s. Utilizing G.992.5 Annex M upload speeds of 3.3 Mbit/s can be achieved.|$|E
25|$|Data {{communications}} {{are provided}} by several companies. Telstra was the first company to provide dial-up Internet access via the Ballarat exchange, however the first network for broadband Internet access available in the city was a hybrid optical fiber cable and coaxial cable built by Neighbourhood Cable in 2001. Since then, Telstra and Optus have entered the Ballarat market, providing Asymmetric <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (ADSL) services for residential Internet access from four main exchangesâ€”Ballarat, Wendouree (Howitt Street), Sebastopol (Skipton Street) and Alfredton (Cuthberts Road). These companies also provide mobile data access Evolved HSPA and since late 2011 3GPP Long Term Evolution (4G). Ballarat's rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) is seen as vital for the city's growing IT industry. During Ballarat's first stage NBN rollout in 2012, 17,800 homes will be directly connected to the network via optical fibre cable.|$|E

25|$|Access network: The {{user can}} {{connect to the}} IP-core of NGN in various ways, most of which use the {{standard}} Internet Protocol (IP). User terminals such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and computers can register directly on NGN-core, {{even when they are}} roaming in another network or country. The only requirement is that they can use IP and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Fixed access (e.g., <b>Digital</b> <b>Subscriber</b> Line (DSL), cable modems, Ethernet), mobile access (e.g. W-CDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, GPRS) and wireless access (e.g.WLAN, WiMAX) are all supported. Other phone systems like plain old telephone service and non-compatible VoIP systems, are supported through gateways. With the deployment of the NGN, users may subscribe to many simultaneous access-providers providing telephony, internet or entertainment services. This may provide end-users with virtually unlimited options to choose between service providers for these services in NGN environment.|$|E

2500|$|Additionally, {{the rise}} of the Internet in the mid-1990s made {{point-to-point}} communications far less interesting. After dialing their local Internet service provider, the user could [...] "call out" [...] at high speed to services around the world, so the need for long-distance data calls was generally eliminated. As a result of this shift, there was no real need to limit the user to the speed of the long-distance lines, giving the Bell companies flexibility in terms of what to install at the user's site. Their attention turned to Asymmetric <b>Digital</b> <b>Subscriber</b> Line (ADSL), which ran over the existing wiring and did not block a telephone connection in the process. The end-user was offered much higher speeds while still being able to use existing phones, with the added [...] "benefit" [...] of helping tie the user to the telephone company's own ISP.|$|E

50|$|Asymmetric <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (ADSL) {{is a type}} of <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (DSL) technology, a data {{communications}} technology that enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines than a conventional voiceband modem can provide.
