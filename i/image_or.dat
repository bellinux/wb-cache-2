The heterodox offerings of Panchamakara– wine, meat, fish, parched grain, and coitus– along with {{mainstream}} offerings such as flowers, light, incense, etc., are prescribed for her worship. A fire sacrifice and repetition of her stotra (hymn of praise) or her nama-stotra (name-hymn) are also prescribed in her worship. The Shakta Pramoda has her sahasranama (thousand name-hymn) {{as well as a}} compilation of her 108 names in a hymn.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{anything}} that is lit will be seen {{on both sides of}} a scrim: scrims do not absorb light. Scrim can also be used in theatre in combination with a cyclorama or backdrop. The idea is similar to the other uses. When the drop is lit (<b>or</b> <b>images</b> <b>or</b> video are rear-projected onto the back of the drop), the <b>images</b> <b>or</b> colours projected are visible. However, when the drop is not lit, the <b>images</b> <b>or</b> colours will disappear. A scrim can also help dull the image, creating a greater sense of depth.|$|R

5|$|PHP acts {{primarily}} as a filter, taking input from a file or stream containing text and/or PHP instructions and outputting another stream of data. Most commonly the output will be HTML, although it could be JSON, XML or binary data such as <b>image</b> <b>or</b> audio formats. Since PHP 4, the PHP parser compiles input to produce bytecode for processing by the Zend Engine, giving improved performance over its interpreter predecessor.|$|E
5|$|The site {{features}} regular Photoshop contests, {{in which}} users use a graphical editing program (such as Adobe Photoshop, {{from which the}} contest draws its name) to manipulate an image provided by {{the creator of the}} contest. A similar site, Something Awful, sponsors Photoshop Phriday contests. The image is usually manipulated for humorous effect, but can also be edited to create an aesthetically pleasing <b>image</b> <b>or</b> to showcase a poster's image manipulation skill, which is then voted on by others in the forum.|$|E

This paper reviews some work done in image and video retrieval and then proposes an integrated model that can handle images and video clips uniformly.

5|$|In most temples, {{the focus}} was the cult image: a statue of the temple god which that god's ba was {{believed}} to inhabit while interacting with humans. The sanctuary in these temples contained either a naos, a cabinet-like shrine that housed the divine <b>image,</b> <b>or</b> a model barque containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions. In some cases the sanctuary may have housed several cult statues. To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in total darkness. Whereas in earlier times the sanctuary lay {{at the very back}} of the building, in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple, further insulated from the outside world by the surrounding corridors and rooms.|$|E
5|$|Of these, Ganesh Chaturthi is {{the most}} popular in the state of Maharashtra, however, Diwali, the most popular festival of Hindus {{throughout}} India, is equally popular in Maharashtra. Deshasthas celebrate the Ganesha festival as a domestic family affair. Depending on a family's tradition, a clay <b>image</b> <b>or</b> shadu is worshiped for one and a half, three and a half, seven or full 10 days, before ceremoniously being placed in a river or the sea. This tradition of private celebration was inspired by the public celebration introduced in 1894 by Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Modak is a popular food item during the festival. Ganeshotsav also incorporates other festivals, namely Hartalika and the Gauri festival, the former is observed with a fast by women whilst the latter by the installation of idols of Gauris.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a {{luminous}} or reflective overlay <b>image</b> <b>or</b> reticle at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.|$|E

5|$|The {{male who}} {{performs}} the shraddha {{should take a}} purifying bath beforehand {{and is expected to}} wear a dhoti. He wears a ring of kush grass. Then the ancestors are invoked to reside in the ring. The shraddha is usually performed bare-chested, as the position of the sacred thread worn by him needs to be changed multiple times during the ceremony. The shraddha involves pinda-daan, which is an offering to the ancestors of pindas (cooked rice and barley flour balls mixed with ghee and black sesame seeds), accompanying the release of water from the hand. It is followed by the worship of Vishnu in form of the darbha grass, a gold <b>image</b> <b>or</b> Shaligram stone and Yama. The food offering is then made, cooked especially for the ceremony on the roof. The offering is considered to be accepted if a crow arrives and devours the food; the bird is believed to be a messenger from Yama or the spirit of the ancestors. A cow and a dog are also fed, and Brahmin priests are also offered food. Once the ancestors (crow) and Brahmins have eaten, the family members can begin lunch.|$|E
