5|$|By {{early on}} August 27, the {{tropical}} storm became slightly better organized, although {{the most intense}} winds were still removed from the center. Danny peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this strength for about 12 hours before wind shear caused the storm to gradually weaken as it meandered northward. By August 28, Danny further deteriorated, and reconnaissance aircraft found that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> a tropical storm. After stalling during the afternoon, the center resumed a north or north-northwestward drift.|$|E
5|$|Having made {{landfall}} {{in southwestern}} Florida, Dottie quickly proceeded northeastward before re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean. High pressure {{building to the}} north of the storm indicated it would turn more towards the west, but it moved nearly due northward. The cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) at 0600 UTC on August 20 and subsequently began to weaken; by the time Dottie made landfall in Charleston, South Carolina later that evening, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> of tropical storm intensity. It deteriorated into a tropical depression on August 21 and dissipated shortly thereafter. The remnant low pressure system turned southward and once again entered the Atlantic before turning westward and crossing the Florida peninsula.|$|E

With the economy already suffering, many residents fled.|$|E
25|$|Radio Éireann {{tried to}} satisfy all tastes {{on a single}} channel (with very limited {{programming}} hours). However, {{this resulted in a}} rather conservative programming policy. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> tolerated by most Irish listeners, and usually trounced (particularly on the east coast and along the Northern Ireland border) by the BBC and later Radio Luxembourg. This did not really change until Radio Éireann became free of direct government control in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The core of Eisa {{consists}} of nembutsu songs. The Ryūkyū-koku yuraiki (1713) attributes {{the introduction of}} nembutsu to Taichū (1552–1639), a Jōdo sect monk from Mutsu Province. According to the record, he translated Buddhist teaching into the vernacular speech and taught {{it to the people}} of Naha during the reign of Shō Nei. Other sources confirm that Taichū stayed in the capital region for three years in the early 1600s and converted the king and other high-ranking officials. Some researchers speculate that he introduced odori nembutsu or dancing nembutsu to Naha. However, Taichū's teaching did not prevail; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> carried on by his followers in Kakinohana, Naha.|$|E

25|$|In 1945 the Light Programme {{was added}} to both the Start Point and Redruth transmitters, and in 1946, the Third Programme {{commenced}} broadcasting from these as well. In 1955, the BBC were looking to expand their 405 line television coverage. This resulted {{in the construction of}} the transmitter at North Hessary Tor on Dartmoor, Devon, which began transmitting FM radio signals for the Home, Light and Third Programme BBC stations in 1956. However, coverage of FM in Cornwall was only consistent in the east and south east of the county; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> receivable in the west of the county until the construction of the Four Lanes transmitter in 1964.|$|E
25|$|On March 10, 1989, Kilroy's {{childhood}} friend Bradley Moore finished exams early at Texas A University {{and headed to}} Austin to pick him up. Both of them then headed to Santa Fe to pick up two other friends, Bill Huddleston and Brent Martin, before heading to South Padre Island, Texas for spring break. After a foggy, 9-hour drive to South Texas, they arrived at South Padre Island shortly before midnight. They checked in at the Sheraton Hotels and Resorts the next morning before heading to the beach. When they first got to South Padre Island, {{there was not a}} huge crowd of people because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> the first weekend out of a five-week spring break season. But thousands of students from the entire U.S. were beginning to arrive as the weekend progressed. Beer sponsors were staging a variety of entertainment events, including free movies, music concerts, calls home, surf-simulator activities, and opportunities to appear on TV commercials. Kilroy and Bradley made free phone calls to their parents that day. Later that evening, they met a group of female students from Purdue University and partied until the next morning.|$|E
500|$|At {{one point}} the {{expedition}} met a tribe of Tuaregs and greeted them by offering their camels water from the container. According to the commentary in the documentary film, the camels had never tasted anything as delicious as the Norwegian glacier water. This was not entirely true; the water was contaminated by the glass wool and tar paper, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> drinkable. The expedition arrived at the Hoggar Mountains near the Tropic of Cancer after fourteen days of travelling. A measurement at that point showed a loss of 96litres of water. Once the Sahara was traversed, after [...] of driving, 177litres had melted away. On average 15litres melted each day in the desert.|$|E

500|$|The first players' {{union was}} formed February 12, 1957 by Red Wings player Ted Lindsay who had {{sat on the}} board of the NHL's Pension Society since 1952. Lindsay and his fellow players were upset by the league's refusal to let them view the books related to the pension fund. [...] The league claimed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> {{breaking}} even financially, and so could not contribute more than it did. [...] Players on the Pension Committee suspected otherwise, leading Lindsay and Doug Harvey of the Canadiens to discussions on forming a union in 1956. [...] The idea quickly gained popularity and when the union's founding was announced publicly, every NHL player had signed up with the exception of Ted Kennedy, who was retiring.|$|E
500|$|... "Rather Die Young" [...] was {{generally}} well received by contemporary music critics who {{described it as}} a dark, yet enchanting ballad. They highlighted Beyoncé's vocal power and the song's melody. Critics also noted that the ballad was heavily influenced by the 1980s R and soul music, adding that it has a Philadelphia soul vibe. However, some of them commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> distinguishable among the other songs on 4, criticizing its chorus which, according to them, forms the major part of the song. Following the release of 4, [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] charted at number 37 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart, based on downloads alone. The song was part of Beyoncé's set list for her 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé shows, held at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City.|$|E
500|$|Goods carried {{were mainly}} coal and culm, but also {{included}} timber, iron ore, sand, slag and copper ore, with smaller amounts of foodstuffs and general merchandise. Establishment of industries at Port Tennant, which included Charles Lambert's copper{{works in the}} 1850s and a patent fuel works in the 1860s, resulted in increased traffic of coal, from both Glan-y-wern and Tir-isaf collieries. Tir-isaf was served by a [...] branch built in 1863 by the Earl of Jersey, but leased to the Tennants. Traffic figures reached 225,304 tons in 1866, and then gradually declined after that, but this provided a steady revenue until 1895. The river lock at Red Jacket had a chequered history. Once the line to Aberdulais basin had been opened, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> used, and Tennant thought about removing it in 1832. However, {{it was back in}} use some time later, and was unused again in the 1880s, only to be rebuilt in 1898.|$|E

500|$|James Hunt for Den of Geek {{said that}} the episode was {{not as bad as}} [...] "", but that it {{contained}} [...] "almost every terrible cliché seen in TNG first season in one episode". He summed it up, saying [...] "We've seen all of this before, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> interesting the first time around. The second time, it's just tedious. A horrible episode on so many levels." [...] Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club and said that he [...] "expected more from TNG", saying that he was not sure what the reversal of gender roles in the episode was meant to achieve. He described the virus subplot as [...] "absurd" [...] and gave the episode an F grade. The episode was included in a couple of worst episode lists, including in one compiled by Scott Thrill for Wired magazine, and it was ranked the fourth worst episode by Jay Garmon at the website TechRepublic.|$|E
500|$|Chapman {{began the}} 1932 season in good form and {{appeared}} fitter {{than he had}} for many seasons. There were further calls in the press for him to captain England. Jardine's captaincy in 1931 left critics unimpressed and C. Stewart Caine, the editor of Wisden, wrote that [...] "the impression appears to be widely entertained that Chapman, were he in [...] form, would again be given charge of the [...] team." [...] Christopher Douglas believes {{that the difference between}} Jardine and Chapman in captaincy style made it harder for the press to accept Jardine. He writes: [...] "Chapman's was just the kind of daredevil approach that is remembered with affection and, even though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> a year since he had lost the leadership, his reign was being regarded through rose-coloured specs." [...] However, {{it is unlikely that the}} selectors ever considered returning to him. During the season, Chapman scored 951 runs, averaged 29.71, and led Kent to third place in the County Championship for the second year in succession.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{although most}} reviewers found {{some of the}} storylines more effective than others. Robert Canning of IGN wrote that [...] "the main portion of this episode was quite funny, even if the ending lacked bite." [...] Similarly, Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly found that the episode was [...] "another strong showing for 30 Rock... although Jenna's plotline was pretty tired." [...] TV Squad's Bob Sassone was similarly positive about [...] "The Bubble", calling it [...] "another good episode." [...] James Poniewozik of Time, also responded favorably to the episode {{with the exception of}} the Jenna storyline, writing that it [...] "was the first one in a long time that I enjoyed almost completely without reservation (Jenna's subplot was off, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> a blip)." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger disliked the bubble concept, reporting, [...] "he idea that attractive people get away with things that the more average-looking can't is an old joke, even on 30 Rock (with Cerie)", but nonetheless enjoyed the [...] "variations" [...] of the joke saying they were [...] "well-conceived". Sepinwall concluded, [...] "this was one of the funniest 30 Rocks of the season. Zap2it's Rick Porter was also favorable to [...] "The Bubble" [...] in his recap, opining that 30 Rock [...] "gave us a very well-done episode". As with Lyons and Poniewozik, Porter felt Jenna's story [...] "didn't really click", but liked the scene with Jenna and her stylist team firing off words to describe Jenna's beauty as [...] "scathingly funny." ...|$|E

500|$|The unusual {{stability}} of the helium-4 nucleus is also important cosmologically: it explains {{the fact that in}} the first few minutes after the Big Bang, as the [...] "soup" [...] of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei. So tight was helium-4 binding that helium-4 production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and also leaving few to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy) and thus, once helium had been formed, no energetic drive was available to make elements 3, 4 and 5. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon, carbon. However, due to lack of intermediate elements, this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously (see triple alpha process). There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4.|$|E
500|$|Gygax {{immediately}} discarded {{his movie}} ambitions—his D movie {{would never be}} made—and flew back to Lake Geneva. There, he discovered to his shock that although industry leader TSR was grossing , <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> breaking even; {{it was in fact}} [...] in debt and teetering on the edge of insolvency. After investigating the reasons why, Gygax brought his findings to the five other company directors. (Since 1982, TSR Inc. had conformed to the recommendations of the American Management Association by adding three [...] "outside" [...] directors to the board, increasing its size to six.) Gygax charged that the financial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many company cars, and some questionable (and expensive) projects such as dredging up a 19th century shipwreck. Gygax demanded that Kevin Blume be removed as company president, and the three outside directors agreed with him. However, the board still believed the financial problems were terminal and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to stay in control, in March 1985, Gygax exercised his 700-share stock option, giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and rather than selling the company, he took steps to produce new revenue generating products. To that end, he contacted Dave Arneson with a view to produce some Blackmoor material. He also bet heavily on a new AD book, Unearthed Arcana, a compilation of material culled from Dragon Magazine articles. And he quickly wrote a novel set in his Greyhawk setting, Saga of Old City, featuring a protagonist called Gord the Rogue. In order to bring some financial stability to TSR, he hired a company manager, Lorraine Williams.|$|E
