50|$|The <b>Danube</b> <b>gudgeon</b> {{occurs in}} the rapid running tributaries of the River Danube {{but not in the}} main river except for its upper stretches. It favours sand and gravel bottoms.|$|E
50|$|Species of fish: <b>Danube</b> <b>gudgeon</b> (Gobio uranoscopus), Mediterranean barbel (Barbus meridionalis), Sabanejewia aurata, streber (Zingel streber), Balkan loach (Cobitis elongata), Kessler's gudgeon (Gobio kessleri) or Amur {{bitterling}} (Rhodeus sericeus amarus).|$|E
50|$|Romanogobio uranoscopus, {{alternatively}} {{known as}} the Danubian longbarbel gudgeon, Danubian gudgeon, <b>Danube</b> <b>gudgeon</b> or the steingressling, is a European species of freshwater cyprinid fish. It {{can be found in}} Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine.|$|E

50|$|Romanogobio vladykovi, {{also called}} <b>Danube</b> whitefin <b>gudgeon,</b> is {{a species of}} {{freshwater}} fish in the Cyprinidae family. It is distributed in the Danube drainage. The maximal length is 11.5 cm, maximal reported age 4 years.|$|R
40|$|During the {{research}} 28 species {{of freshwater fish}} were found, belonging to 10 families. Most numerous family was Cyprinidae (18 species), followed by Percidae (3 species) and Cobitidae (2 species). Results showed that the most abundant in species were spirlin (Alburnoides bipunctatus) (17. 4 %), common roach (Rutilus rutilus) (15. 7 %) and prussian carp (Carassius gibelio) (12. 8 %). And {{in the terms of}} total fish weight, highest represented were asp (Aspius aspius) (28. 9 %), bream (Abramis brama) (18. 7 %) and pike (Esox lucius) (11. 4 %). Presence of four new fish species has been confirmed in Ilova River: bullhead (Cottus gobio), trout (Salmo trutta), <b>danube</b> whitefinned <b>gudgeon</b> (Romanogobio vladykovi) and tench (Tinca tinca) ...|$|R
5000|$|The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species {{lists the}} <b>Danube</b> <b>gudgeon</b> as being of [...] "Least Concern". This {{is because the}} species is {{abundant}} and widespread throughout the fast flowing rivers of the Danube basin. However, it is sensitive to organic pollution, and sedimentation may have occurred because of the building of damns. It is likely to react adversely to human disturbance to its habitat. Although its populations appear to be declining slowly, this is gradual and does not warrant a higher level categorization.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Danube</b> <b>gudgeon</b> {{grows to}} a maximum length of 15 cm, though a more normal size is 10 to 12 cm. It has a {{distinctive}} pair of barbels {{at the corner of}} the mouth which are long enough to extend back to beyond the eyes. These are tactile organs and are used to search through sediment for edible items. There are no scales on the throat and this helps distinguish it from its close relative, Kessler's gudgeon (Romanogobio kessleri). The dorsal fin has seven branched rays and the general colour is silver with a few dark spots. There is a thin blue streak that runs along the lateral line.|$|E
40|$|The {{study area}} {{is part of}} the Iad River basin, one of the largest basins, a right {{tributary}} of the Crisul Repede River. The Iad River, a tributary of the Crisul Repede River is located in the north-western Romania, and is intensively arranged in the matter of engineering. Throughout its length the Iad River is provided with three dams and reservoirs (Bulz, Munteni and Le≈üu), which are part of the hydropower developing system on the Crisul Repede River. Bulz Dam (17 m height), which is subject to this paper, is located near the confluence between the Iad River and Crisul Repede River and {{is part of the}} grayling fishing area, where there are three species of protected migratory fish: The <b>Danube</b> <b>gudgeon</b> (Gobio uranoscopus), the barbel (Barbus barbus) and the common nase (Chondrostoma nasus). In order to facilitate the possibility of migration of the above mentioned migratory fish species upstream of Bulz dam, we recommend to perform the execution of a canal for migrating fish, which is fastened to the right abutment of the dam. The achievement of such migration system suggested in this paper will help restoration the longitudinal connectivity of the Iad River on a length of about 5 km, creating optimal conditions for the development of aquatic faun...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Danube</b> whitefin <b>gudgeon</b> Romanogobio vladykovi Fang, 1943 {{belongs to}} the R. albipinnatus (Lukasch, 1933) species group. In the {{territory}} of Poland so-called whitefin gudgeon was recorded {{for the first time}} in the middle stretches of Vistula River (1965). Since then the species has been found in some 20 localities in the Vistula and Odra River drainages. In May and July 2009 two specimens identified initially as belonging to the R. albipinnatus species group were caught in the main course of Nida River. Molecular approach based on combination of both mitochondrial and nuclear markers confirmed occurrence of R. vladykovi on Polish territory. This conclusion alters the knowledge about the distribution of the species of the R. albipinnatus species group. Kottelat and Freyhof (2007) considered that the territory of Poland is inhabited by R. belingi, whereas R. vladykovi is restricted only to the drainage area of Danube River...|$|R
