Moreover, we argue that Polish NC facts would be difficult to model by a purely semantic account. 1 Introduction The aim of this paper is twofold. First, on the basis of facts rarely (if ever) considered in the linguistic literature, we argue for the Unbounded <b>Dependency</b> (UD) <b>status</b> of Negative Concord (NC) in Polish (and, by extension, possibly in other languages exhibiting NC).

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article articulates how two new {{urban poverty}} groups, namely the new urban poor and poor rural migrants, are pauperized under China’s social exclusion. We {{argue that the}} two poverty groups {{experience}} different pauperization processes and are subjected to distinctive social exclusions with relevance to their institutional-based status and changes in it. The urban poor experience status change from being beneficiaries of the planned economy to being victims of the market economy, and become a vulnerable group characterized by market exclusion and limited welfare <b>dependency.</b> The <b>status</b> of poor rural migrants changes from being institutionally inferior farmers in the planned economy to being a marginal group of urban society, which is now subjected to institutional exclusion and the resultant social exclusion. This research argues that positive social policies should be considered and a social security system should be established {{to pay more attention}} to the development issues of the urban poor. Over the last decades, the proliferating literature on new urban poverty and social exclusion encapsulates a broad debate on the social and spatial transformations taking place in Western cities (Badcock, 1997; Hamnett, 1996; Mingione, 1996). The prevailing interpretation is to treat the new urban poverty as an outcome of global economic restructuring, changes in the welfar...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{characterize}} the diet of a Merovingian population sample and examine if apparent differences in grave good assemblages of Merovingian burials and transfromation of this funerary rite during 6 th and 7 th centuries were reflected in diet. Dietary composition was assessed using a carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of 74 bone collagen samples from adults buried at an early medieval cemetery of le-Norroy-le-Veneur, France. Results showed diet based primarily on C 3 plants, supplemented with animal protein in a range similar to other contemporary sites. No significant contribution of C 4 plants (e. g. millet) or marine-derived protein has been detected and neither has δ 15 N <b>dependency</b> on <b>status,</b> sex or datation been found. However, persons with rich grave good assemblages had significantly higher δ 13 C than low-ranking individuals.

40|$|Objectives: To {{validate}} the ICECAP-O capability wellbeing measure’s German translation in older people with dementia {{living in a}} nursing home, and to investigate the influence of proxy characteristics on responses. Method: Cross-sectional study. For 95 residents living in a German nursing home, questionnaires were completed by nursing professionals serving as proxy respondents. We investigated the convergent validity of the ICECAP-O with other Quality of Life (Qol) measures, the EQ- 5 D extended with a cognitive dimension (EQ- 5 D+C), the Alzheimer’s Disease Related Quality of Life (ADRQL) measures, and the Barthel-index measure of Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Discriminant validity was investigated using bivariate and multivariate stepwise regression analysis, comparing ICECAP-O scores between subgroups varying in dementia severity, care <b>dependency,</b> ADL <b>status</b> and demographic characteristics. Results: Convergent validity between the ICECAP-O, EQ- 5 D+C, ADRQL and Barthel-Index scores was moderate to good (with correlations of 0. 72, 0. 69 and 0. 53 respectively), but differed considerably between dimensions of the instruments. Discriminant validity was confirmed by finding differences in ICECAP-O scores between subgroups based on ADL scores (0. 58 below 65 points on the Barthel-index and 0. 80 above 65 points) and other characteristics. The ICECAP-O scores based on available tariffs were related to proxy characteristics gender (0. 52 males versus 0. 65 females) and work experience (0. 61 below 2 years of experience versus 0. 68 above 2 years) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{late nineteenth}} century {{was a time of}} {{domestic}} crises and external threats for Joseon Korea (1392–1910). Starting in the 1860s, a series of rebellions caused by excessive taxation and misgovernment threatened the reigning dynasty, while foreign powers — mostly western countries, but also Meiji Japan — used military force to try to open Korea to trade. The Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876 opened three Korean ports to commerce and granted Japanese merchants extraterritoriality in these ports. This unequal treaty prompted even more foreign interventions, as it turned Korea into a target of rivalry between imperialist powers. One crucial issue was whether Korea was a sovereign state or a Chinese <b>dependency.</b> Despite Joseon's <b>status</b> as a tributary of Ming (1368–1644) and then Qing (1644–1911) China — which implied the sending of tribute missions and a ritually inferior position of the Korean king vis-à-vis the Chinese emperor — Korea could also dictate both its domestic and foreign policies, creating an ambiguous situation that frustrated western powers.|$|R
