40|$|The paper {{describes}} a multistage interconnection network (MIN) with regular interconnections {{in three dimensions}} (two space dimensions and the third dimension is the frequency) and dimension-dependent switches. (Regular interconnections mean that the same <b>interconnection</b> <b>principles</b> are applied throughout the stages of the MIN.) The frequency domain is organized by introducing artificial dimensions. The architecture is interpreted as an optical frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with multidimensional interconnections and switches where the dimension is an additional design parameter. The multidimensional interconnections may be implemented {{using a combination of}} space and frequency channels. The frequency interconnections (data movements between channels) are expressed by the Kronecker product (KP) of permutation matrices. In this case the number of frequency conversion (FC) operations and the number of frequency channels crossed during the generation of interconnections and switching decreases. The architectural principles presented are of general interest for the study of transmission and processing in arbitrary large scale interconnection systems implemented in the 3 -D physical space...|$|R
40|$|Smart' is a {{term that}} has earned {{considerable}} scientific attention in different areas of research {{over the last few}} years. The variety of areas the term 'smart' is used nowadays calls {{for the development of a}} comprehensive and inclusive definition that would fit to all the contexts and situations. Many researchers focus on the fragmentary aspects of the concept 'smart', but systematic research in this area is hard to find. In response to the increasing use of the concept 'smart', the main aim of this paper is to provide an accurate definition of 'smart' which would be applicable in different areas of modern economy. A standardized definition could be used as an 'umbrella' for the development of other relevant topics. This conceptual paper also introduces the 'smart' framework, which incorporates all the components of the definition: challenges, environment, orchestration and sustainable welfare. The 'smart' framework was built by integrating different concepts and principles, such as technology reference models (TRM), open systems <b>interconnection</b> <b>principles</b> (OSI), etc. It reveals the peculiarities of 'smart' performance and application under the conditions and challenges of modern economy...|$|R

40|$|China {{does not}} comply with its WTO {{obligations}} except in principle and experiences the problem that the incumbent carrier may use technical and commercial mechanisms to maintain market dominance. This is possible because of weaknesses in the Chinese interconnection regulations and difficulties {{in the application of}} Chinese anti-competition law to interconnection. The thesis aims to provide a model for interconnection that may be used to deal with the present market dominance in the Chinese interconnection service market. In order to achieve this aim, the thesis identifies the weaknesses in the Chinese interconnection regulations which may be utilized by the incumbent carrier to impede fair competition in the interconnection service market by comparing the Chinese regulations, and the relevant regulations in the WTO Reference Paper and the relevant U. S. interconnection regulations. On the other hand, the thesis also assesses the application of Chinese anti-competition law to interconnection. Consequently the thesis consists of two main parts. Part I includes chapter two, three, four and five. This part focuses on identifying the disadvantages in the present <b>interconnection</b> <b>principles</b> in force in China, technical conditions of interconnection and interconnection charges, and sets out the remedies that will be useful in preventing the incumbent carrier from using technical and commercial mechanisms to maintain market dominance. Part II covers chapter six and seven. This part focuses on the application of Chinese anti-competition law to interconnection, and provides a way to fine-tune the possible disputes rose in interconnection from the perspective of Chinese Anti-monopoly Law.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{technological}} demands {{have required}} {{the analysis and}} control design of increasingly complex, large-scale nonlinear dynamical systems. In analyzing these largescale systems, it is often desirable to treat the overall system {{as a collection of}} interconnected subsystems. Solution properties of the large-scale system are then deduced from the solution properties of the individual subsystems {{and the nature of the}} system interconnections. In this paper we develop an energy flow modeling framework for large-scale dynamical systems based on vector dissipativity notions. Specifically, using vector storage functions and vector supply rates, dissipativity properties of the composite large-scale system are shown to be determined from the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and their <b>interconnections.</b> Thermodynamic <b>principles</b> are also established using a large-scale systems perspective...|$|R
40|$|Incumbent {{telephone}} companies argue for reliance on voluntary negotiations {{to determine the}} terms of interconnection, or alternatively for regulated access prices equal to those that an incumbent would accept voluntarily. Such prices are justified as necessary to prevent inefficient entry, based on an economic theory called the 'parity principle'. This paper shows that the parity principle is largely inappropriate for setting interconnection prices in most current contexts, and that the claimed efficiency properties of the rule are often based on flawed, static analyses. Under dynamic considerations the parity principle can threaten the development of effective competition. The authors analyse examples where the parity principle has been advocated in the United States and New Zealand, explaining that interconnection charges are best set by legal or regulatory authority based on the costs of providing network access. <b>Interconnection</b> Parity <b>principle</b> Competition...|$|R

40|$|Geometry of {{the heart}} adapts to {{mechanical}} load, imposed by pressures and volumes of the cavities. We regarded preservation of cardiac geometry as a homeostatic control system. The control loop was simulated by a chain of models, starting with geometry of the cardiac walls, sequentially simulating circulation hemodynamics, myofiber stress and strain in the walls, transfer of mechano-sensed signals to structural changes of the myocardium, and finalized by calculation of resulting changes in cardiac wall geometry. Instead of modeling detailed mechano-transductive pathways and their <b>interconnections,</b> we used <b>principles</b> of control theory to find optimal transfer functions, representing the overall biological responses to mechanical signals. As biological responses we regarded tissue mass, extent of contractile myocyte structure and extent of the extra-cellular matrix. Mechano-structural stimulus-response characteristics {{were considered to be}} the same for atrial and ventricular tissue. Simulation of adaptation to self-generated hemodynamic load rendered physiologic geometry of all cardiac cavities automatically. Adaptation of geometry to chronic hypertension and volume load appeared also physiologic. Different combinations of mechano-sensors satisfied the condition that control of geometry is stable. Thus, we expect that for various species, evolution may have selected different solutions for mechano-adaptation...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, many discussions have centred around the issue of {{interconnection}} rates and their economic impact on the market. Interconnection charging in Europe is still based mainly on the calling party pays (CPP) principle combined with element based charging (EBC). Due to the convergence of the classical PSTN/ISDN and the IP world to next generation networks (NGN), the different charging principles and systems are being reviewed to determine the optimal solution for the future. In its working program for the year 2008, the Austrian Regulatory Authority (RTR) launched an industry working group on charging principles and systems for wholesale services. This paper highlights some of the central issues of the discussions {{that have taken place}} and contains the authors’ views and conclusions. 1 Further, the paper identifies possible charging systems, as well as economic assessment criteria for these systems and how the different charging systems may be evaluated with respect to those criteria. Regarding the usefulness of industry working groups, the work has shown that these lead to a higher degree of transparency between regulator and market players as well as a better understanding between the market players themselves. The main drawback is that working groups are time consuming and that {{it is almost impossible to}} agree on meaningful outcomes. Regarding the assessment of the charging models it was possible to derive a set of 10 criteria according to which charging systems can be evaluated. There was a rather broad consensus on the delineation of charging models as well as the economic criteria. When it comes to the results of the evaluation, the discussions brought forward very controversial views amongst the participants. No common views could be achieved on which the charging model fulfills the defined criteria in the best manner. <b>Interconnection,</b> NGN, charging <b>principles,</b> CPP, Bill&Keep. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} micro total {{analysis}} systems (μTAS) aims at developments toward miniaturized and fully integrated lab-on-a-chip systems for applications, such as drug screening, drug delivery, cellular assays, protein analysis, genomic analysis and handheld point-of-care diagnostics. Such systems offer to dramatically reduce liquid sample and reagent quantities, increase sensitivity {{as well as}} speed of analysis and facilitate portable systems via the integration of components such as pumps, valves, mixers, separation units, reactors and detectors. Precise microfluidic control for such systems has long been {{considered one of the}} most difficult technical barriers due to integration of on-chip fluidic handling components and complicated off-chip liquid control as well as fluidic <b>interconnections.</b> Actuation <b>principles</b> and materials with the advantages of low cost, easy fabrication, easy integration, high reliability, and compact size are required to promote the development of such systems. Within this thesis, liquid displacement in microfluidic applications, by means of expandable microspheres, is presented as an innovative approach addressing some of the previously mentioned issues. Furthermore, these expandable microspheres are embedded into a PDMS matrix, which composes a novel thermally responsive silicone elastomer composite actuator for liquid handling. Due to the merits of PDMS and expandable microspheres, the composite actuator's main characteristic to expand irreversibly upon generated heat makes it possible to locally alter its surface topography. The composite actuator concept, along with a novel adhesive PDMS bonding technique, is used to design and fabricate liquid handling components such as pumps and valves, which operate at work-ranges from nanoliters to microliters. The integration of several such microfluidic components promotes the development of disposable lab-on-a-chip platforms for precise sample volume control addressing, e. g. active dosing, transportation, merging and mixing of nanoliter liquid volumes. Moreover, microfluidic pumps based on the composite actuator have been incorporated with sharp and hollow microneedles to realize a microneedle-based transdermal patch which exhibits on-board liquid storage and active dispensing functionality. Such a system represents a first step toward painless, minimally invasive and transdermal administration of macromolecular drugs such as insulin or vaccines. The presented on-chip liquid handling concept does not require external actuators for pumping and valving, uses low-cost materials and wafer-level processes only, is highly integrable and potentially enables controlled and cost-effective transdermal microfluidic applications, as well as large-scale integrated fluidic networks for point-of care diagnostics, disposable biochips or lab-on-a-chip applications. This thesis discusses several design concepts for a large variety of microfluidic components, which are promoted by the use of the novel composite actuator. Results on the successful fabrication and evaluation of prototype devices are reported herein along with comprehensive process parameters on a novel full-wafer adhesive bonding technique for the fabrication of PDMS based microfluidic devices.

40|$|Many {{stress that}} the role of {{planners}} will change under the new global situation. But what is the ’old role’ of planners which is expected to change? And will the ’new role’ be truly different from this ’old role’? The key messages of Torremolinos Charter, Agenda 21, New Charter of Athens, Territorial Agenda and other documents concentrate around few repeating concepts: complexity, balance, integration, inter-disciplinarity, cooperation, participation, education, involvement of politics, long-term orientation, creativity and strategy. Should planners change these ideals?One of the most frequent and influential words today is strategy. Even though strategy can be defined in many ways and there are many different forms of strategic planning around the world, its original meaning often remains hidden. There is no doubt that concept of strategy has a military background. Therefore, this article focuses on two main topics. First, it presents the five ancient principles for victory which can be transferred into the five principles for balanced development of territories as Continuity, Sustainability, Context, Leaders and Conditions for implementation. Second, it seeks <b>interconnections</b> between these <b>principles</b> and the role of strategic spatial planners. It discusses the role of planners particularly in connection to two principles: Leaders and Context. Since strategic spatial planners deal with coordination of expert teams having relevant influence on development processes, they belong to the principle of Leaders. Since they have all the relevant data, analyses and expertise, their role is to be honest while evaluating the situation and unmasking the real Context to others. Dishonesty, misinterpretations and preference of politics to professional esteem inevitably lead to wrong decisions. Accepting this premise, education of planners needs revision in two basic points. First, is should increase abilities to identify context of time, place and causality. Instead of making a ’list of facts’, the context should be measured and calculated to be as objective as possible. Second, the education should increase soft inter-personal skills {{to be able to handle}} leadership, present the context, negotiate the reasonable further steps, lead multi-professional teams, manage conflicts and self-develop. Being first-line leader is equally or even more important than being planning expert. Of course, new discourses and practices influencing methods, tools and performance in spatial development are needed. However, the new global situation calls for rediscovering and coming back to the original core role of planners: honest, brave and responsible expertise. The article presents an anonymous case study of how this ’new role’ changed the planned development project. Godkänd; 2012; 20140218 (lucdob...|$|R
