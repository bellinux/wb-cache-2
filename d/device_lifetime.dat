40|$|Abstract — Extending {{lifetime}} of battery-operated devices {{is a key}} design issue that allows uninterrupted information exchange among distributed nodes in wireless networks. Cooperative communications has recently emerged as a new communication paradigm that enables and leverages effective resource sharing among cooperative nodes. In this paper, a general framework for lifetime extension of battery-operated devices by exploiting cooperative diversity is proposed. The framework efficiently takes advantage of different locations and energy levels among distributed nodes. First, a lifetime maximization problem via cooperative nodes is considered and performance analysis for M-ary PSK modulation is provided. With an objective to maximize the minimum <b>device</b> <b>lifetime</b> under a constraint on bit-errorrate performance, the optimization problem determines which nodes should cooperate and how much power should be allocated for cooperation. Since the formulated problem is NP hard, a closed-form solution for a two-node network is derived to obtain some insights. Based on the two-node solution, a fast suboptimal algorithm is developed for multi-node scenarios. Moreover, the <b>device</b> <b>lifetime</b> is further improved by a deployment of cooperative relays {{in order to help}} forward information of the distributed nodes in the network. Optimum location and power allocation for each cooperative relay are determined with an aim to maximize the minimum <b>device</b> <b>lifetime.</b> A suboptimal algorithm is developed to solve the problem with multiple cooperative relays and cooperative nodes. Simulation results show that the minimum <b>device</b> <b>lifetime</b> of the network with cooperative nodes improves 2 times longer than the {{lifetime of}} the non-cooperative network. In addition, deploying a cooperative relay in a proper location leads up to 12 times longer lifetime than that of the non-cooperative network.

Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Tertiary care institution. Patients: Sixty consecutive patients with total laryngectomy were included. All had indwelling tracheoesophageal speaking valves for voice restoration. Intervention: Anterograde replacement of voice prosthesis in case of failure of functional speech production or leakage of saliva. Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of successful tracheoesophageal speech rehabilitation for daily communication, influence of different clinicopathologic factors on the outcome, and prosthesis lifetime {{and its relationship to}} different clinicopathologic factors. Results: The success rate of speech rehabilitation was 78 %. Age younger than 60 years was the only clinicopathologic factor associated with successful speech rehabilitation (P=. 04, Fisher exact test). The median <b>device</b> <b>lifetime</b> was 8. 2 months. Both age of 60 years or older and {{the use of}} subsequent prosthetic valves were identified as risk factors for valve failure on univariate analysis (n= 192; log-rank test; P=. 02 and P=. 03, respectively), with age of 60 years or older as the only risk factor that reduced the <b>device</b> <b>lifetime</b> in the Cox proportional hazards model (P=. 03; relative hazard ratio, 1. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 1 - 2. 4).
