However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E

Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would <b>have</b> <b>acted</b> {{as a type of}} officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose role was to prevent the enemy reaching the walls as can be seen by the positioning of arrowslits.|$|E

Boley Hill has been suggested as the site of the first castle, an outwork reinforcing the castle's defences, or an abandoned siege castle like those documented in the 1088 siege. Boley Hill is a natural outcrop of rock, and could <b>have</b> <b>acted</b> as a motte.|$|E
