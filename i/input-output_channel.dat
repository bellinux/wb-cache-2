In this paper we resolve the problem for channels involving errors of any combination of the basic types substitution, insertion, deletion. Moreover, we consider the problem of finding the inverses of these channels, {{in view of the fact}} that L is error-detecting for γ if and only if it is error-detecting for the inverse of γ.

Unlike previous work we formulate {{the problem of the}} maximum achievable rate in this setting as an optimization problem with no assumption on the network size, topology, and signal-to-noise ratio. Previous work considered only scenarios wherein relays use all their power to amplify their received signals.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{to derive}} the linear model of flexible multibody system dynamics {{is presented in}} this paper. This approach {{is based on the}} twoport model of each body allowing the model of the whole system to be built just connecting the inputs/outputs of each body model. Boundary conditions of each body can be taken into account through inversion of some <b>input-output</b> <b>channels</b> of its two-port model. This approach is extended here to treat the case of closed-loop kinematic mechanisms. Lagrange multipliers are commonly used in an augmented differential-algebraic equation to solve loop-closure constraints. Instead, they are considered here as a model output, which is connected to the adjoining body model through a feedback. After a summary of main results in the general case, the case of planar mechanisms with multiple uniform beams is considered and the two-port model of the Euler-Bernouilli beam is derived. The choice of the assumed modes is then discussed regarding the accuracy of the first natural frequencies for various boundary conditions.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in linear system identification have proposed {{the use of}} non-parameteric methods, relying on regularization strategies, to handle the so-called bias/variance trade-off. This paper introduces an impulse response estimator which relies on an ℓ_ 2 -type regularization including a rank-penalty derived using the log-det heuristic as a smooth approximation to the rank function. This allows to account for different properties of the estimated impulse response (e. g. smoothness and stability) while also penalizing high-complexity models. This also allows to account and enforce coupling between different <b>input-output</b> <b>channels</b> in MIMO systems. According to the Bayesian paradigm, the parameters defining the relative weight of the two regularization terms {{as well as the}} structure of the rank penalty are estimated optimizing the marginal likelihood. Once these hyperameters have been estimated, the impulse response estimate is available in closed form. Experiments show that the proposed method is superior to the estimator relying on the "classic" ℓ_ 2 -regularization alone as well as those based in atomic and nuclear norm.

The analysis and control design process is carried out under the framework of individual channel analysis and design (ICAD), which is based on the multivariable structure function (MSF).

40|$|Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have {{recently}} evinced immense success for various image recognition tasks [11, 27]. However, {{a question of}} paramount importance is somewhat unanswered in deep learning research - is the selected CNN optimal for the dataset in terms of accuracy and model size? In this paper, we intend {{to answer this question}} and introduce a novel strategy that alters the architecture of a given CNN for a specified dataset, to potentially enhance the original accuracy while possibly reducing the model size. We use two operations for architecture refinement, viz. stretching and symmetrical splitting. Stretching increases the number of hidden units (nodes) in a given CNN layer, while a symmetrical split of say K between two layers separates the input and output channels into K equal groups, and connects only the corresponding <b>input-output</b> <b>channel</b> groups. Our procedure starts with a pre-trained CNN for a given dataset, and optimally decides the stretch and split factors across the network to refine the architecture. We empirically demonstrate the necessity of the two operations.

40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} {{linguistic}} faculties in animals pose an evolutionary paradox: language involves certain perceptual and motor abilities, {{but it is}} not clear that this serves as more than an <b>input–output</b> <b>channel</b> for the externalization of language proper. Strikingly, the capability for auditory–vocal learning is not shared with our closest relatives, the apes, but is present in such remotely related groups as songbirds and marine mammals. There is increasing evidence for behavioral, neural, and genetic similarities between speech acquisition and birdsong learning. At the same time, researchers have applied formal linguistic analysis to the vocalizations of both primates and songbirds. What have all these studies taught us about the evolution of language? Is the comparative study of an apparently species-specific trait like language feasible? We argue that comparative analysis remains an important method for the evolutionary reconstruction and causal analysis of the mechanisms underlying language. On the one hand, common descent has been important in the evolution of the brain, such that avian and mammalian brains may be largely homologous, particularly in the case of brain regions involved in auditory perception, vocalization, and auditory memory. On the other hand, there has been convergent evolution of the capacity for auditory–vocal learning, and possibly for structuring of external vocalizations, such that apes lack the abilities that are shared between songbirds and humans. However, significant limitations to this comparative analysis remain. While all birdsong may be classified in terms of a particularly simple kind of concatenation system, the regular languages, there is no compelling evidence to date that birdsong matches the characteristic syntactic complexity of human language, arising from the composition of smaller forms like words and phrases into larger ones...|$|E
40|$|There is wide {{consensus}} that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is able to exert cognitive control on behavior by biasing processing toward task-relevant information and by modulating response selection. This idea is typically framed in terms of top-down influences within a cortical control hierarchy, where prefrontal-basal ganglia loops gate multiple <b>input-output</b> <b>channels,</b> which in turn can activate or sequence motor primitives expressed in (pre-) motor cortices. Here we advance a new hypothesis, based {{on the notion of}} programmability and an interpreter-programmer computational scheme, on how the PFC can flexibly bias the selection of sensorimotor patterns depending on internal goal and task contexts. In this approach, multiple elementary behaviors representing motor primitives are expressed by a single multi-purpose neural network, which is seen as a reusable area of "recycled" neurons (interpreter). The PFC thus acts as a "programmer" that, without modifying the network connectivity, feeds the interpreter networks with specific input parameters encoding the programs (corresponding to network structures) to be interpreted by the (pre-) motor areas. Our architecture is validated in a standard test for executive function: the 1 - 2 -AX task.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} systems engineering based methodology for quantifying effects of cognitive loading, and for modeling the human brain response in systems engineering terms. The visual-cortical response was selected as the <b>input-output</b> <b>channel</b> around which the methodology was developed. A steady-state input (a continuous sum of 10 sine waves) and a transient input (a train of pulses) were used for system stimulation. The human occipital EEG (surface electrodes at Oz and mastoids) was used as the cortical output. Analysis of input stimuli and output EEG potentials produced human visual-cortical describing functions (gain and phase) and remnant spectra (background EEG). ^ A stimulus parametric investigation indicated that sensitivity to stimulus modulation depth is unequal across frequencies, and that relatively low stimulus intensity and depth of modulation are desirable to reduce response saturation. ^ Comparisons between transient and steady-state stimulation revealed that both forms produced functionally related responses, suggesting that the visual-cortical response contains a measurable linear portion. Time domain amplitude changes corresponded to transient and steady-state gain changes. ^ Consistent trends observed among subjects indicated that it is advisable to group subjects into two classes: alpha responders, and non-alpha responders. Classification would be based upon alpha band (8 to 12 Hz) responses in both remnant and gain curves. ^ To investigate cognitive loading effects three tasks were utilized: manual tracking, grammatical reasoning, and supervisory control. Changes in visual-cortical response measures related to task loading were observed. With increased cognitive loading, alpha responders generally showed reductions in alpha band gain and remnant, and increases in beta band gain. Non-alpha responders showed increases in beta band gain only. Performance of supervisory control caused a reduction in phase lag for all subjects tested. Results revealed that individual differences must be accounted for. ^ Some success in matching data with the model forms considered was achieved. Multipath modeling provided a promising approach for handling observed dropout points in the data. Model parameter values were found to relate to task performance scores. A model form based upon alpha and non-alpha classification should be individually applied. ...|$|E
40|$|Process {{industries}} {{have to operate}} in a very competitive and globalized environment, requiring efficient and sustainable production processes. As a result, production targets need to be translated into control objectives which are usually formulated as performance specifications of the process, i. e. tracking of references or rejection of process disturbances. This is often a hard and difficult task which involves assumptions and simplications because of the process complexity. Complexity arises often due to the large scale character of a process, i. e. a pulp and paper can host thousands of control loops. A critical step {{in the design of}} these loops is the choice {{of the structure of the}} control, which means that controllers need to be placed between sensors and actuators. Current methods for control structure selection include the Interaction Measures (IMs). The IMs help the designer to select a subset of the most significant <b>input-output</b> <b>channels,</b> which will form a reduced model on which the control design will be based. The IMs are traditionally evaluated using a nominal model of the process. However, all process models are affected by uncertainties as simplifications and approximations are unavoidable during modeling. Thus, the validity of the control structure suggested by the IMs cannot be assessed by only analyzing the nominal model. The first part of this thesis focuses in analyzing the sensitivity of the IMs to model uncertainties in order to determine a robust control structure which is feasible for all the uncertainty set. It also becomes clear that, control structure selection requires extensive knowledge about how the multiple process variables are interconnected. The second part of this thesis focuses on creating IMs which can help the control designers to understand the propagation of effects in the process, and express this propagation in directed graphs for an intuitive understanding of the process which will help to design a feasible control structure. These methods have been inspired by coherence analysis used in brain connectivity. Neurons and neural populations interact with each other in different brain processes related to events as perception, or cognition. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a measure of electrical activity in the brain which is acquired from sensors positioned on the surface of the head, each of the electrodes collects the aggregated voltage of a neuron population. Analyzing the flow of information between populations of neurons allows to understand the communication between different parts of the brain in different brain processes. In a very similar way, analyzing the flow of information between variables in an industrial process will provide designers with the required information to understand the behavior of the plant.

40|$|In a {{physical}} neural system, learning rules must be local both {{in space and}} time. In order for learning to occur, non-local information must be communicated to the deep synapses through a communication channel, the deep learning channel. We identify several possible architectures for this learning channel (Bidirectional, Conjoined, Twin, Distinct) and six symmetry challenges: 1) symmetry of architectures; 2) symmetry of weights; 3) symmetry of neurons; 4) symmetry of derivatives; 5) symmetry of processing; and 6) symmetry of learning rules. Random backpropagation (RBP) addresses {{the second and third}} symmetry, and some of its variations, such as skipped RBP (SRBP) address the first and the fourth symmetry. Here we address the last two desirable symmetries showing through simulations that they can be achieved and that the learning channel is particularly robust to symmetry variations. Specifically, random backpropagation and its variations can be performed with the same non-linear neurons used in the main <b>input-output</b> forward <b>channel,</b> and the connections in the learning channel can be adapted using the same algorithm used in the forward channel, removing the need for any specialized hardware in the learning channel. Finally, we provide mathematical results in simple cases showing that the learning equations in the forward and backward channels converge to fixed points, for almost any initial conditions. In symmetric architectures, if the weights in both channels are small at initialization, adaptation in both channels leads to weights that are essentially symmetric during and after learning.

40|$|Recent {{contributions}} have {{tackled the}} linear system identification problem {{by means of}} non-parametric Bayesian methods, which are built on largely adopted machine learning techniques, such as Gaussian Process regression and kernel-based regularized regression. Following the Bayesian paradigm, these procedures treat the impulse response of the system to be estimated as the realization of a Gaussian process. Typically, a Gaussian prior accounting for stability and smoothness of the impulse response is postulated, {{as a function of}} some parameters (called hyper-parameters in the Bayesian framework). These are generally estimated by maximizing the so-called marginal likelihood, i. e. the likelihood after the impulse response has been marginalized out. Once the hyper-parameters have been fixed in this way, the final estimator is computed as the conditional expected value of the impulse response w. r. t. the posterior distribution, which coincides with the minimum variance estimator. Assuming that the identification data are corrupted by Gaussian noise, the above-mentioned estimator coincides with the solution of a regularized estimation problem, in which the regularization term is the l 2 norm of the impulse response, weighted by the inverse of the prior covariance function (a. k. a. kernel in the machine learning literature). Recent works have shown how such Bayesian approaches are able to jointly perform estimation and model selection, thus overcoming one of the main issues affecting parametric identification procedures, that is complexity selection.  While keeping the classical system identification methods (e. g. Prediction Error Methods and subspace algorithms) as a benchmark for numerical comparison, this thesis extends and analyzes some key aspects of the above-mentioned Bayesian procedure. In particular, four main topics are considered. 1. PRIOR DESIGN. Adopting Maximum Entropy arguments, a new type of l 2 regularization is derived: the aim is to penalize the rank of the block Hankel matrix built with Markov coefficients, thus controlling the complexity of the identified model, measured by its McMillan degree. By accounting for the coupling between different <b>input-output</b> <b>channels,</b> this new prior results particularly suited when dealing for the identification of MIMO systems To speed up the computational requirements of the estimation algorithm, a tailored version of the Scaled Gradient Projection algorithm is designed to optimize the marginal likelihood. 2. CHARACTERIZATION OF UNCERTAINTY. The confidence sets returned by the non-parametric Bayesian identification algorithm are analyzed and compared with those returned by parametric Prediction Error Methods. The comparison is carried out in the impulse response space, by deriving “particle” versions (i. e. Monte-Carlo approximations) of the standard confidence sets. 3. ONLINE ESTIMATION. The application of the non-parametric Bayesian system identification techniques is extended to an online setting, in which new data become available as time goes. Specifically, two key modifications of the original “batch” procedure are proposed {{in order to meet the}} real-time requirements. In addition, the identification of time-varying systems is tackled by introducing a forgetting factor in the estimation criterion and by treating it as a hyper-parameter. 4. POST PROCESSING: MODEL REDUCTION. Non-parametric Bayesian identification procedures estimate the unknown system in terms of its impulse response coefficients, thus returning a model with high (possibly infinite) McMillan degree. A tailored procedure is proposed to reduce such model to a lower degree one, which appears more suitable for filtering and control applications. Different criteria for the selection of the order of the reduced model are evaluated and compared. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new {{efficient}} decision feedback equal-izer (DFE) {{appropriate for}} channels with long and sparse impulse response (IR) is proposed. Such channels are encountered in many high-speed wireless communications applications. It is shown that, {{in cases of}} sparse channels, the feedforward and feedback (FB) fil-ters of the DFE have a particular structure, which can be exploited to derive efficient implementations of the DFE, provided that the time delays of the channel IR multipath components are known. This latter task is accomplished by a novel technique, which es-timates the time delays based on {{the form of the}} <b>channel</b> <b>input-output</b> cross-correlation sequence in the frequency domain. A dis-tinct feature of the resulting DFE is that the involved FB filter con-sists of a reduced number of active taps. As a result, it exhibits con-siderable computational savings, faster convergence, and improved tracking capabilities as compared with the conventional DFE. Note that faster convergence implies that a shorter training sequence is required. Moreover, the new algorithm has a simple form and its steady-state performance is almost identical to that of the conven-tional DFE.
