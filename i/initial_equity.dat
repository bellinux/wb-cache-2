The State Bank of the Russian Empire (predecessor of the Central Bank of Russia) was founded in 1862 but did not deal in mortgages. A new law was passed in May 1872 which allowed the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Empire to approve new banks with less than 5 million rubles in capital. That greatly simplified approval procedures as new banks no longer needed approvals from the State Council or the Tsar. However, Finance Minister Mikhail Reytern was afraid that a rapid expansion of the banking network could cause banks to fail. He prohibited from establishing new banks in cities where one already existed and limited the number of banks to two per province. Therefore, entrepreneurs hurried to establish new banks in various regional centers. In total, eleven land banks were established in 1871–1873.
