5|$|Southeast Asian {{traditional}} beliefs, as well {{as traditional}} Chinese medicine, consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating. The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the <b>empty</b> <b>shell</b> of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or people {{with high blood pressure}} are traditionally advised not to consume durian.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} never to be a private {{residence}} again. It was offered for sale in 1929, {{and at a time}} when many country houses were being demolished was given a scrap value of £5,882. With the exception of the Phelips family portraits, the historic contents and furnishing were disposed of, and the house, an <b>empty</b> <b>shell,</b> remained on the market for two years.|$|E
5|$|After death, the <b>empty</b> <b>shell</b> of this {{sea snail}} {{is often used}} by hermit crabs. On {{the coast of the}} Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a study of shell use in the diogenid hermit crab species Isocheles sawayai was carried out. This study {{revealed}} that 11.5% of the population of these hermit crabs were using shells of Semicassis granulata. The occupation of shell type was reported as not being random, but was instead described as being influenced by the weight, size, shape and internal volume of the shell, the occurrence of epibionts such as bryozoans on the shell, and the degree of resistance the shell offered to predation and desiccation.|$|E
40|$|Intact virions and <b>empty</b> <b>shells</b> of {{simian virus}} 40 may be rapidly {{separated}} {{from each other}} and from cell contaminants by a procedure employing a CsCl cushion. This approach permits quantitation of their respective syntheses in infected cells labeled with radioactive amino acids. As much as 5 to 10 % of the total acid-precipitable radioactive lysine in infected cell extracts was incorporated into viral particles in a two-hour pulse late in infection. Evidence for multiple origins of <b>empty</b> <b>shells</b> is presented. Some of the <b>empty</b> <b>shells</b> result from breakdown of intact virions. However, <b>empty</b> <b>shells</b> can also form independently of intact virions. First, labeling for periods of 15 min to 2 hr late in the course of infection results in preferential incorporation of 3 H-lysine into <b>empty</b> <b>shells.</b> Secondly, treatment with the deoxyribonucleic acid inhibitor cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside late in infection results in a 50 % inhibition in the rate of formation of intact virions with minimal reduction in the rate of appearance of <b>empty</b> <b>shells...</b>|$|R

Upon their arrival in London on Saturday 7 November 1987, they witness the {{accident}}, but Rose is unable to move when the Doctor tells her to go comfort her dying father. Rose asks the Doctor if she can try again, and the Doctor allows it but warns Rose to not run until their former selves have left to prevent a paradox. As the accident is about to happen, Rose suddenly runs out and pushes Pete aside, saving his life. The younger versions of the Doctor and Rose vanish. Rose and the Doctor fight about her actions, with the Doctor rebuking her for potentially damaging the timeline. The Doctor takes Rose's TARDIS key back and storms off without her. Rose decides to go with Pete to the wedding, while the Doctor walks back to the TARDIS only to find that it is now an <b>empty</b> <b>shell.</b> Strange flying beasts called Reapers appear and begin consuming people.|$|E

DiZ's plans are threatened when Nobodies led by Axel, Roxas's former friend in Organization XIII, infiltrate the virtual town. However, Roxas is able to repel the Nobodies and finally merges with Sora. Sora, Donald, and Goofy wake up in the real Twilight Town and meet King Mickey and Yen Sid, who send them on another journey. Their goal is to find Riku and figure out the plans of Organization XIII, who control the Nobodies—the <b>empty</b> <b>shell</b> left over when a person with a strong heart is turned into a Heartless. Afterward, Maleficent is resurrected and joins with Pete to continue her quest for power.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the Cliffords began {{spending}} more time at their other castles, particularly Skipton Castle in Yorkshire. Brougham descended through several generations of Cliffords, intermittently serving as a residence. However, by 1592, {{it was in a}} state of disrepair, as George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland was {{spending more}} time in southern England due to his role as Queen's Champion. The castle was briefly restored in the early 17th century, to such an extent, that King James I of England was entertained there in 1617. In 1643, Lady Anne Clifford inherited the estates, including the castles of Brougham, Appleby, and Brough, and set about restoring them. Brougham Castle was kept in good condition for a short time, after Lady Anne's death in 1676; however, Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet, who had inherited the Clifford estates, sold the furnishings in 1714. The <b>empty</b> <b>shell</b> was left to decay, as it was too costly to maintain. As a ruin, Brougham Castle inspired a painting by J. M. W. Turner, and was mentioned at the start of William Wordsworth's poem The Prelude, as well as becoming the subject of Wordsworth's Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle upon the Restoration of Lord Clifford, the Shepherd, to the Estates and Honours of his Ancestors. The castle was left to the Ministry of Works, in the 1930s, and is today maintained by its successor, English Heritage.|$|E

At first, only three funnels were planned to be installed. However, in order for her not to appear weaker than the Cunard's four-funnels duo, a fourth funnel was added. Its {{function}} was the ventilation of the kitchen and the storage of deck chairs. For her propulsion, Olympic was driven by three propellers. The two three-bladed side propellers were driven by two triple-expansion engines, while the four-bladed central propeller was driven by a turbine that utilised recovered steam escaping from the triple expansion engines. The utilisation of escaped steam was tested on the SS Laurentic two years before.|$|E

500|$|The {{novel is}} written in the first-person, from Clay's perspective. Clay, who [...] "felt betrayed by Less Than Zero", uses Imperial Bedrooms to make a stand or a case for himself, though {{ultimately}} [...] "reveals himself to be far worse than the author of Less Than Zero ever began to hint at." [...] Clay still bears similarities to the earlier character in Less Than Zero; according to one reviewer, [...] "not all that much is changed. Clay is a cipher, an <b>empty</b> <b>shell</b> who is only able to approximate interactions and experiences through acts of sadism and exploitation." [...] He is also, in many ways, a new character, because {{the opening of the}} book presents that the Clay of Less Than Zero had merely been [...] "just a writer pretending to be him". When asked why he [...] "changed" [...] Clay from [...] "passive" [...] to [...] "guilty", Ellis explained he felt Clay's inaction in the original novel made him equally as guilty; it had [...] "always bothered" [...] Ellis that Clay didn't do anything to save the little girl being raped in the first novel. The Independent notes [...] "his passivity [...] has hardened into something far more culpable, and nefarious." [...] According to Ellis, [...] "In LA, over time, the real person you are ultimately comes out." [...] He also speculates [...] "maybe the fear turned him into a monster". Ellis remarks that he finds the developments in Clay [...] "so exciting". One reviewer summarized the character's development, [...] "The nascent narcissist of Less Than Zero... is now left in a [...] "dead end". The novel is Ellisdeeply pessimistic presentation of human nature as assailable... an unflinching study of evil." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2010, he co-starred with Michelle Williams in Derek Cianfrance's directorial debut, {{the marital}} drama Blue Valentine. The low-budget film was mainly improvised and Gosling has said [...] "you {{had to remind}} {{yourself}} you were making a film". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt he [...] "brings a preternatural understanding of people to his performance" [...] while A.O. Scott of The New York Times found him [...] "convincing as the run-down, desperate, older Dean, and maybe a bit less so as the younger version". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly noted that he [...] "plays Dean as a snarky working-class hipster, but when his anger is unleashed, the performance turns powerful." [...] However, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe felt the performance {{was an example of}} [...] "hipsterism misdirected". He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. The film was a box office success, grossing over $12 million worldwide from a production budget of $1 million. Gosling's second on-screen appearance of 2010 was in the mystery film All Good Things with Kirsten Dunst, based on a true story. He played the role of New York real-estate heir Robert Durst, who was investigated for the disappearance of his wife (played by Dunst). Gosling found the filming process to be a [...] "dark experience" [...] and did not undertake any promotional duties for the film. When asked if he was proud of the film, he replied, [...] "I'm proud of what Kirsten does in the movie." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone felt he [...] "gets so deep into character you can feel his nerve endings." [...] Mick La Salle of the San Francisco Chronicle found the [...] "chameleonic Gosling is completely convincing as this <b>empty</b> <b>shell</b> of a man". Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that the film belonged to Dunst, but noted that Gosling [...] "is good too". The film grossed $644,535 worldwide.|$|E
