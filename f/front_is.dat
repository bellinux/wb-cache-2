5|$|A second range stood {{along the}} north-west wall, {{and would have}} been {{connected}} to the hall range by the donjon tower. The ground floor housed a kitchen. In 1725 the range was remodelled into a two-storey house, accessed via a stone stair, and topped with the dormer windows which now form part of the gatehouse. The well in <b>front</b> <b>is</b> original, although the large stone surround is of 19th century date.|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} <b>front</b> <b>is</b> a non-moving (or stalled) {{boundary between}} two air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain essentially in the same area for extended periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.|$|E

5|$|Although m1 {{is nearly}} rectangular, the width at the <b>front</b> <b>is</b> still {{smaller than the}} width at the back. There is a strong anteroconid. A crest, the metalophid, reaches from the protoconid nearly to the metaconid. A small cusp, the mesostylid, is {{connected}} to the metaconid in front of it, unlike in Miopetaurista and Aliveria. There are two broad roots. The next tooth, m2, is similar to m1 in most respects, but the width at the <b>front</b> <b>is</b> virtually equal to the width at the back, so that the tooth is about rectangular. The back of m3 is rounded, but the tooth is still nearly rectangular. There is a long anteroconid, with is mainly connected to the metaconid. There is no metalophid. This tooth has three roots: two at the front and a larger one at the back.|$|E
5|$|An {{occluded}} <b>front</b> <b>is</b> formed {{during the}} process of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm <b>front</b> <b>is</b> cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm <b>front</b> <b>is</b> not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E

5|$|For the 10metre air {{pistol and}} air rifle {{disciplines}} match diabolo pellets are used. These pellets have wadcutter heads, meaning the <b>front</b> <b>is</b> (nearly) flat, that leave clean round holes in paper targets for easy scoring.

50|$|A {{number of}} <b>fronts</b> <b>were</b> {{created by the}} Second Polish Republic from 1918 to 1939, among them being the Polish Southern Front. See :pl:Kategoria:Fronty polskie. In addition, the {{creation}} of a Polish <b>Front</b> <b>was</b> considered to group the First and Second Armies of the Polish Armed Forces in the East in 1944, and during the Warsaw Pact period, a Polish <b>Front</b> <b>was</b> created, seemingly as a mobilization-only organization.|$|R
50|$|The Soviet <b>fronts</b> <b>were</b> first raised {{during the}} Russian Civil War. They were wartime {{organizations}} only, in the peacetime the <b>fronts</b> <b>were</b> normally disbanded and their armies organized back into military districts. Usually a single district formed a single front {{at the start}} of the hostilities, or when hostilities were anticipated. Some military districts could not form a <b>front.</b> <b>Fronts</b> <b>were</b> also formed during the Polish-Soviet War of 1920.|$|R

5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold <b>front</b> <b>is</b> marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the <b>front</b> <b>is</b> experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
5|$|After the {{terrorist}} organization {{known as the}} Human Liberation Front claims responsibility for blowing up the Megatech Body Corporation building, Section 9 is sent to resolve the situation. Section 9 is able to trace {{the terrorist}}s' communications and find their location in the bay area; however, it is a trap. Chief Aramaki later announces that {{the leader of the}} Human Liberation <b>Front</b> <b>is</b> a mercenary known as Zebra 27. Ishikawa then reports that the Energy Ministry is interested in files relating to Zebra; Aramaki orders further investigation.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Front</b> <b>was</b> a {{combination}} of the 13th and 21st Armies. 13th Army, in the area of Mogilyov, had under command the 61st Rifle and 20th Mechanised Corps and in the Krichevsky direction the 45th and 20th Rifle Corps. The other initial component of the <b>Front</b> <b>was</b> 21st Army, under General Lieutenant Mikhail Yefremov, with 25th Mechanised Corps, and 66th, 63rd, 21st and 67th Rifle Corps. The new <b>Front's</b> air component <b>was</b> 136 aircraft (75 patched and repaired) under the command of Major General (Aviation) G.A. Vorozheikin. The Central Front thus became the first new Front formed after the German invasion.At the time the <b>Front</b> <b>was</b> created its boundary with the Western <b>front</b> <b>was</b> along the Bryansk-Roslavl-Shklov-Minsk line (all inclusive for the Western front), and the main operational direction of the <b>front</b> <b>was</b> along the Gomel-Bobruisk-Волковыск axis.On August 1, 3rd Army joined the Front, and on August 7 Kuznetsov was recalled to Moscow to be given a new assignment.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the multidimensional {{stability}} of time periodic V-shaped traveling fronts in bistable reaction–diffusion equations. It {{is well known that}} time periodic V-shaped traveling <b>fronts</b> <b>are</b> asymptotically stable in two dimensional space. In the current study, we further show that such <b>fronts</b> <b>are</b> asymptotically stable under spatially decaying initial perturbations in Rn with n≥ 3. In particular, we show that the <b>fronts</b> <b>are</b> algebraically stable if the initial perturbations belong to L 1 in a certain sense. Furthermore, we prove that there exists a solution oscillating permanently between two time periodic V-shaped traveling fronts, which implies that time periodic V-shaped traveling <b>fronts</b> <b>are</b> not always asymptotically stable under general bounded perturbations. Finally we show that time periodic V-shaped traveling <b>fronts</b> <b>are</b> only time global solutions of the Cauchy problem if the initial perturbations lie between two time periodic V-shaped traveling fronts...|$|R

5|$|Built between 1079 and 1532, Winchester Cathedral has had {{an unusual}} {{architectural}} history. The exterior, apart from the modified windows, gives {{the impression of a}} massive Norman building and indeed, it is the longest medieval church in the world. However, the west <b>front</b> <b>is</b> now Perpendicular, with its huge window filled with fragments of medieval glass. Inside, only the crypt and the transepts have retained their Norman appearance. The spectacular Perpendicular nave with its tall arcade arches and strong vertical emphasis has been literally carved out of the original Norman interior. The Very Rev. Sykes wrote of it “Well might the visitor who enters … by the west door gasp with amazement.” Winchester is also famous for its carved wooden fittings of many different periods.|$|E

5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{can bring}} mild weather {{with a little}} rain and surface winds of , or they can be cold and dangerous with torrential rain and winds exceeding , (sometimes referred to as windstorms in Europe). The band of precipitation {{that is associated with}} the warm <b>front</b> <b>is</b> often extensive. In mature extratropical cyclones, an area known as the comma head on the northwest periphery of the surface low can be a region of heavy precipitation, frequent thunderstorms, and thundersnows. Cyclones tend to move along a predictable path at a moderate rate of progress. During fall, winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall.|$|E

5|$|The current view among astronomers who model Type Ia {{supernova}} explosions, however, is {{that this}} limit is never actually attained and collapse is never initiated. Instead, the increase in pressure and density due to the increasing weight raises {{the temperature of the}} core, and as the white dwarf approaches about 99% of the limit, a period of convection ensues, lasting approximately 1,000years. At some point in this simmering phase, a deflagration flame <b>front</b> <b>is</b> born, powered by carbon fusion. The details of the ignition are still unknown, including the location and number of points where the flame begins.
