5000|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>welding</b> (ERW) {{refers to}} a group of welding {{processes}} such as spot and seam welding that produce coalescence of faying surfaces where heat to form the weld is generated by the electrical resistance of material combined with the time and the force used to hold the materials together during welding. Some factors influencing heat or welding temperatures are the proportions of the workpieces, the metal coating or the lack of coating, the electrode materials, electrode geometry, electrode pressing force, electrical current and length of welding time. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the point of most electrical resistance (the connecting or [...] "faying" [...] surfaces) as an electrical current (100 - 100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, resistance welding methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are limited to relatively thin materials and the equipment cost can be high (although in production situations the cost per weld may be low).|$|E

High residual tensile stress retains in welding zone of ERW pipes without heat treatment.

40|$|Abstract. Projection welding is a {{variation}} of <b>electric</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>welding</b> with the dynamic changes of the flow paths for heat and electrical properties with changing temperature caused by the large plastic deformation with collapse of projection.

However, the standard proposed in this paper researches on is a special one with the slots designed on {{the two sides of}} the projection. A comprehensive thermal-electrical-mechanical analysis was performed to quantitatively simulate the projection welding of the special standard by a coupled finite element method.

40|$|Grooving {{corrosion}} is {{a phenomenon}} by which the <b>weld</b> seam of <b>electric</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>welded</b> (ERW) pipe is preferentially attacked in wet natural gas environments containing CO 2. The attack initiates as an aligned string of pits which grow and intersect, forming a round-bottomed groove of damage centered on the weld seam. The susceptibility of ERW pipe to this damage mechanism {{is known to be}} related to the chemical composition (particularly the sulfur content) of the pipe, the welding process employed, and the use of a post weld heat treatment. Of particular concern to the natural gas pipeline industry is the fact that at the present time there are no effective means for predicting the susceptibility of a specific lot of ERW pipe to grooving corrosion, prior to placing the pipeline in service. The objective of this program, therefore, is to begin the development of an accelerated laboratory test technique which may be useful as a screening test to establish the susceptiblity of an ERW weld to grooving corrosion. ...|$|R
40|$|A new cold-formed steel beam, {{known as}} the LiteSteel Beam (LSB), has the {{potential}} to transform the low-rise building industry.

Currently available design rules based on longitudinal connection spacing limits and doubling the capacity of single members were found to be inadequate.

In this research, finite element models of LSBs were developed to simulate the combined shear and bending behaviour and strength of LSBs. They were then validated by comparing their results with test results and used in a parametric study. Both experimental and finite element analysis results showed that the current design equations are not suitable for combined shear and bending capacities of LSBs.
