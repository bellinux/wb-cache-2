An aerodynamic test bench was used to study the coolant flow processes in a TVSA-type fuel assembly bundle.

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, with {{increasing}} traffic volumes and higher wheel loads, fatigue damage in steel parts of typical orthotropic steel bridge decks, has been experienced on heavily trafficked routes. A demand exists {{to find a}} durable system to increase the fatigue safety of orthotropic steel bridge decks. A solution might be to enhance the stiffness of the traditional orthotropic bridge deck by using a cement-based overlay. In this paper, an orthotropic steel bridge <b>deck</b> <b>stiffened</b> with a cement-based overlay is analyzed. The analysis is based on nonlinear fracture mechanics, and utilize the finite element method. The stiffness of the steel deck reinforced with an overlay depends highly on the composite action. The composite action {{is closely related to}} cracking of the overlay and interfacial cracking between the overlay and underlying steel plate (debonding). As an example, a real size structure, the Farø Bridges located in Denmark, are analyzed. The steel box 1 girders of the Farø Bridges spans 80 meters, and have a depth of 3. 5 m, and a width of 19. 5 m. The focus of the present study is the top part of the steel box girders, which is constructed as an orthotropic deck plate. Numerous factors can influence the cracking behavior of the cement-based overlay system. Both mechanical and environmental loading have to be considered and effects such as shrinkage, temperature gradients and traffic loading are taken into account. The performance of four overlay materials are investigated in terms of crack widths. Furthermore, the analysis shows that debonding is initiated for a certain crack width in the overlay. The load level where cracking and debonding is initiated depends on the stress-crack opening relationship of the material...|$|R

40|$|Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is the {{engineering}} discipline of diagnosing damage and estimating safe remaining life for structures and systems. Often, SHM {{is accomplished by}} detecting changes in measured quantities from the structure of interest; {{if there are no}} competing explanations for the changes, one infers that they are the result of damage. If the structure of interest is subject to changes in its environmental or operational conditions, one must understand the effects of these changes in order that one does not falsely claim that damage has occurred when changes in measured quantities are observed. This problem – the problem of confounding influences – is particularly pressing for civil infrastructure where the given structure is usually openly exposed to the weather and may be subject to strongly varying operational conditions. One approach to understanding confounding influences is to construct a data-based response surface model that can represent measurement variations as a function of environmental and operational variables. The models can then be used to remove environmental and operational variations so that change detection algorithms signal the occurrence of damage alone. The current paper is concerned with such response surface models in the case of SHM of bridges. In particular, classes of response surface models that can switch discontinuously between regimes are discussed. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} Gaussian Process (GP) models are an effective means of developing response surface or surrogate models. However, the GP approach runs into difficulties if changes in the latent variables cause the structure of interest to abruptly switch between regimes. A good example here, which is well known in the SHM literature, is given by the Z 24 Bridge in Switzerland which completely changed its dynamical behaviour when it cooled below zero degrees Celsius as the asphalt of the <b>deck</b> <b>stiffened.</b> The solution proposed here is to adopt the recently-proposed Treed Gaussian Process (TGP) model as an alternative. The approach is illustrated here on the Z 24 bridge and also on data from the Tamar Bridge in the UK which shows marked switching behaviour in certain of its dynamical characteristics when its ambient wind conditions change. It is shown that treed GPs provide an effective approach to response surface modelling and that in the Tamar case, a linear model is in fact sufficient to solve the problem...|$|R

40|$|Typical riveted <b>stiffened</b> seat <b>angle</b> {{connections}} {{taken from}} an 83 years old building were tested {{to investigate the}} actual hysteretic behavior and potential moment resistance of these connections and to determine how they could be efficiently retrofitted with a minimum amount of structural modifications.

Connections were tested with and without that concrete fireproofing. This study shows that, in their as-is condition, these existing connections can develop a considerable moment resistance, but their pinched hysteretic curves indicate they have a relatively low energy dissipation capability. Connections embedment into the concrete of the columns was found to be of little benefit, contrary to what has been alleged by other researchers. Three retrofitting schemes are proposed to improve the connection’s hysteretic behavior. These are steel fuse-plates, ductile knee-braces and a “selective welding ” approach. The steel-band and fuse-plates retrofit scheme permits to enhance connection strength and ductility, without requiring removal of the column concrete cover.

40|$|Many steel {{structures}} contain multiple fatigue sensitive details that have similar geometries and {{are subjected to}} similar load fluctuations. Examples are orthotropic (bridge) <b>decks</b> and <b>stiffened</b> (ship) hulls where tens to thousands of similar details are present in one structure. Generally only visual inspections on fatigue cracks are considered for these structures because more accurate techniques {{are considered to be}} too expensive and time consuming when so many details need to be inspected. Visual inspections are known to have a low probability of detection. Consequently Bayesian update techniques usually show a marginal effect of the result of visual inspections on the reliability of structures with respect to fatigue failure. On the other hand the inspection result of one location also provides information on similar details at other locations and thus the significance of the inspection result may be larger if multiple potential crack locations occur and cracks are not detected at any of these locations. This paper provides a probabilistic fatigue crack growth (fracture mechanics) model of a system containing a fatigue sensitive detail at multiple locations that accounts for the results of inspections. Spatial correlations of loading, resistance, and uncertainty variables between the different locations are evaluated and estimated through a literature review and are accounted for in the model. The model is demonstrated on a practical example of an orthotropic bridge deck containing a detail at 100 locations. The paper shows that visual inspections may be effective provided that a certain minimum inspection reliability can be guaranteed, that the structure is relatively tolerant to large cracks, and that the geometry and loading conditions are similar for a large number of location...|$|R

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: In {{the early}} 20 th century, steel frame {{buildings}} were built to different standards from {{those used in}} modern construction. Riveted, built-up members were used instead of rolled sections, with joints and members encased in concrete for fire protection. These early steel buildings were designed based upon observations of past building performance rather than through detailed calculations and predictions of structural behaviour. The walls were infill masonry and floors were typically reinforced concrete. The strength and stiffness of the semi-rigid connections and masonry infill {{as well as the}} effect of floor slabs integral with their supporting beams are not well documented. Although riveted <b>stiffened</b> seat <b>angle</b> connections are not designed to resist moments, they can develop a considerable moment capacity and exhibit a relatively ductile hysteretic behaviour which could be beneficially considered when evaluating frames built of these connections and subjected to small and moderate earthquakes. Structural engineers have found it challenging to make realistic predictions of the seismic performance of these buildings, many which are quite prestigious, in full service and often enjoying heritage protection. Examples include Auckland’s Britomart Station and Guardian Trust Building, and Wellington’s Tower Corporation, Prudential Assurance and Hope-Gibbons Buildings. To predict the complicated behaviour of riveted connections, 3 D nonlinear finite element models of a sample clip-angle connection taken from drawings of the now-demolished Jean-Batten building in Auckland and a sample T-stub connection taken from drawings of the Hope-Gibbons building have been generated using the ABAQUS finite element software package. The joint models were used to investigate load-displacement, failure mode and energy dissipation under axial loads, shear loads, and combined axial loads plus shear loads. ...|$|R
