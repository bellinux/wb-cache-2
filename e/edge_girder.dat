40|$|The Champlain Bridge, {{constructed}} in 1957, {{is one of}} Canada’s busiest and most economically critical bridges. This 3. 4 km-long bridge consists {{of as many as}} 50 simply supported spans, 50 to 53 m long, plus an elevated truss structure over the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Each span has a cross-section of seven precast post-tensioned girders supporting cast-in-place infill strips that constitute a deck with six traffic lanes. Like many other structures, Champlain Bridge is subjected to environmental, traffic or hydrological loads, which adversely affect the structural condition of the bridge. This structural degradation is further accelerated for the Champlain Bridge due to Montreal’s cold climate, with snowfall and windy conditions, in addition to seasonal salting on the concrete deck. Consequently, structural degradation has been observed due to the corrosion of some of the post-tensioned strands in the main <b>edge</b> <b>girders</b> on the upstream and downstream side...|$|R
40|$|Chajes, Michael J. As {{the average}} age of our {{transportation}} infrastructure increases, it becomes critical that the methods for identifying changes and evaluating the structural integrity of the bridge be both robust and accurate. Structural health monitoring can provide great benefits to the inspection and evaluation process by providing quantifiable data {{that can be used to}} identify changes in the structure and determine the condition of the structure. In this research, the strain data obtained from the structural health monitoring system on the Indian River Inlet Bridge was used to both create an accurate finite element model of the bridge as well as to load rate the critical element of the bridge, the west <b>edge</b> <b>girder.</b> Three load tests were performed in order to establish the baseline response of the bridge and to develop a finite element model. A parametric study of the model was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to changes in structural parameters such as concrete strength, effective width of the <b>edge</b> <b>girder</b> deck section, and boundary conditions. A load rating on the west <b>edge</b> <b>girder</b> was performed incorporating the load test data and compared to a load rating based on the finite element model results. Based on the load test, a load rating adjustment factor of 1. 14 was calculated, showing a possible increase of 14 % over the purely analytical load rating. This research works to increase the base of knowledge of structural health monitoring systems used for load rating and, specifically, serves as an important example of long term monitoring of stay cable bridges.

40|$|Recently, {{research}} {{strives to}} apply Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) to large-sized structures owing to its remarkable mechanical performance and durability compared to normal concrete. The Korea Institute of Construction Technology proposed SuperBridge 800, an <b>edge</b> <b>girder</b> type UHPC {{cable stayed bridge}} with central span of 800 m, through its detailed design. The bridge {{is designed to be}} erected through the connection of precast UHPC segments. The precast UHPC segment is monolithically composed of one ribbed deck slab and edge girders at each side. The connection between the precast segments is achieved by steel bars at the edge girders and by UHPC cast-in-place wet joint at the slab. Despite of the outstanding mechanical performance of UHPC, the fabrication of large-sized members is a difficult task since UHPC hardens faster than normal concrete and requires a special curing process. Therefore, the constructability of large-sized UHPC segment should be secured to achieve SuperBridge 800. Besides, the performance of the connection between segments should also be guaranteed, especially in terms of the fatigue performance of the UHPC cast-in-place joint, which constitutes a weak point. To that goal, two half-scaled UHPC segments are manufactured and the constructability is examined by fabricating a large-sized UHPC member connected with respect to the design conditions. This study conducts rolling fatigue test on the so-fabricated large-sized UHPC member. Rolling fatigue test is carried out up to 2 million cycles considering actual vehicle load at each center and quarter points of the member. The test results confirm that the service limit state is satisfied...|$|E

40|$|Chajes, Michael J. Shenton, Harry W., IIIThe {{safety and}} {{serviceability}} of bridges is of paramount concern for bridge owners {{and for the}} traveling public. As our bridge infrastructure continues to age, {{there is a growing}} need for new methods and technologies that can enable transportation agencies to better evaluate their bridges to ensure their structural safety and to optimize their maintenance and inspection procedures. Following the collapse of the I- 35 Bridge in Minnesota in 2007, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) began requiring a bridge load rating for all bridges in the United States. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, one out of every nine bridges in the United States is classified as structurally deficient and is in urgent need of repair. The required maintenance of these and other bridges is very expensive. In fact, the FHWA estimates that it would cost nine billion dollars per year more than what is currently being spent on bridge maintenance to repair and maintain our deficient bridges. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a technique that has been evolving and has been used in recent years to measure the loading environment and response of bridges in order to assess serviceability and safety. There are several examples around the world that have demonstrated the benefits of SHM using both short- and long-term monitoring. However, transportation agencies still lack the ability to directly implement SHM data into their maintenance and decision making processes. More specifically, transportation agencies are generally not capable of implementing the existing complex methods for using short- or long-term SHM data for bridge evaluation. ☐ The primary objective {{of this study was to}} develop new methods for utilizing SHM data that are analogous to more traditional methods and can be easily implemented by transportation agencies to better evaluate their bridges to achieve optimal maintenance and effective decision making. In developing the new methods, two approaches were taken. ☐ The first approach, referred to as the Continuous Rating Factor-Structural Health Monitoring method, uses SHM data to compute continuous rating factors. This approach applies SHM data directly into the Load Resistance Factor Rating (LRFR) equations to produce continuous rating factors for specific bridge components. To do this, the continuously recorded SHM data is converted into structural forces and/or stresses and incorporated directly into conventional rating equations to calculate continuously rating factors over time. More specifically, this new approach converts the measured strain and temperature data to live loads, thermal loads, prestressing losses, i. e. to yield accurate site-specific rating factors for various critical bridge components. ☐ The second approach, referred to as the Reliability Analysis-Structural Health Monitoring method, uses a reliability analysis framework combined with SHM data. In this approach loads and resistances were expressed as Probability Distribution Functions (PDF), where loads and resistances are treated as random variables. The concept of estimating the probability of failure or probability of exceedance is utilized and expressed as a reliability index for a specific bridge component. The reliability analysis was conducted first using design loads and then using long-term SHM data. The analyses were performed using Monte Carlo simulation and Rackwitz-Fiessler method and considered a variety of limit states. In the first type of analysis (using design information), the resistance model, dead load model, and live load model used in the reliability analysis were based solely on design information. In this analysis, the same statistical parameters used to develop the load effects and resistances in the AASHTO LRFD calibration were applied. In the second type of analysis (using SHM data), the load effects consisted of dead, live, and thermal loads. A live load statistical model was created based on data from Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) stations close to the location of the IRIB and a 3 -D finite element model. The thermal load statistical model was created based on data from Delaware Environmental Observing System (DEOS) and correlation analysis between measured SHM strain and temperature data from the IRIB. In both cases, reliability indices for the west <b>edge</b> <b>girder</b> were computed along the bridge for various limit states. ☐ In order to demonstrate the two methods, the Indian River Inlet Bridge (IRIB), a prestressed concrete cable-stayed bridge located in Sussex County Delaware, was used as a study case. The research showed that the two methods can serve as possible evaluation approaches for bridges that have SHM systems. Both methods are successful in taking huge amounts of SHM data and translating them into simple and well understood evaluation parameters (ratings and reliability indices). ☐ The primary findings from results given by the continuous rating factor method were (1) SHM data can be used to directly compute bridge load ratings, (2) the developed technique provides results that can be easily understood and utilized by transportation agencies, and (3) the ratings show that thermal effects can have a significant effect on load ratings for long-span bridges. The primary findings from results given by the reliability method based on SHM data were (1) the method can be used to determine whether or not the monitored bridge meets the design code standards in terms of reliability by allowing a comparison of the target reliability indices to indices computed based on SHM data, (2) the developed reliability-based methodology using SHM data can be applied to other bridges, (3) the developed method shows promise for enabling SHM data to be directly incorporated into the maintenance, inspection, and decision making processes, and (4) the work suggests how reliability analysis results can be integrated with bridge field inspection results.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the flow structure under a partially inundated bridge deck measured by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and flow visualization techniques. The approaching flow was subcritical having Froude number Fin the range 0. 12 similar to 0. 55. The proximity ratio P-r(= ratio of clearance below the bridge deck h {{to the total}} depth of deck D) was varied from 0. 57 to 2. Depending upon the Froude number F and proximity ratio P-r, four types of flow structures under the bridge deck were recognized. In flow Type I, the water surface elevation on the downstream side of bridge deck is slightly lower than the counterpart on the upstream side, and the shear layer formed {{at the bottom of}} upstream girder continuously fluctuates and touches soffit of all girders. In the case of flow Type II, the water surface on downstream side of bridge deck is lower than that on the upstream side and the shear layer originating from the upstream girder impinges near the third cavity between girders. However, in both the cases, the cavities between the girders are completely occupied by vortices. On the contrary, in the cases of flow Type III and flow Type IV, the flow is separated from the upstream <b>girder</b> <b>edge.</b> However, in flow Type III, the separated flow impinges on successive girders and cavities are partially filled by water; while in flow Type IV, the flow is totally separated from the deck bottom like orifice flow. The phenomena of vortex formation within the cavities are discussed for the cases of flow Type I and flow Type II. Also, for the vertical distribution of mean streamwise velocity in the shear layer below bridge deck, the nonlinear regression equations are developed. Using the distributions of measured mean streamwise velocity within the shear layer below the bridge deck at different streamwise distances, the similarity profile is obtained. The mean velocity deficit (u(sl) - u(su)) and representative thickness b(s) are considered as the appropriate characteristic velocity and length scales for developing similarity profile. The proposed characteristic scales provided unique similarity profiles having promising regression coefficient. The similarity profile proposed is suitable for more general case of bridge deck having different bridge girders and even for rectangular block without girder. Further, the turbulence characteristics for the flow below the bridge deck are also presented...|$|R
