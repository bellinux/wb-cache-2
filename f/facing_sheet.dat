40|$|This {{research}} paper {{focuses on the}} prediction of different failure modes to improve the sandwich composite panel with honeycomb core for application in marine structures. Marine, automotive and aerospace industries are continually trying to optimize material performance {{in terms of strength}} and weight. Success has been achieved through the growth of high performance materials, including fibrous composites such as ceramics, new alloys, and carbon fiber composites and through the use of structural concepts such as sandwich composite panel construction. Sandwich composite panel construction with honeycomb core consists of three components: two facing sheets, the core that fill the space between the <b>facing</b> <b>sheet</b> and the core-to-facing bonding adhesives. The facing sheets of a sandwich panel can be compared to the flanges of an I-beam element, as they carry the bending stresses to which the beam is subjected. With one <b>facing</b> <b>sheet</b> in compression, the other is in tension. Similarly the honeycomb core corresponds to the web of the I-beam that resists the shear loads and vertical compressive load to the face sheet.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the sound {{emission}} of modern gas turbines or jet engines, bias flow liners are used, where the damping of the sound is based on a complex interaction of the sound wave and the bias flow injected through a perforated <b>facing</b> <b>sheet.</b> The optimization of these liners regarding a high damping efficiency necessitates a deeper understanding of complex three dimensional (3 D) aeroacoustic phenomena. To this aim, a contactless threecomponent vector (3 C) measurement of both the flow velocity (in the order of several m/s) and the acoustic particle velocity (down to few mm/s) is needed. However, these two velocities overlap at the measured velocity, which necessitates the decomposition of the measured velocity field in order to analyze the interaction of sound and flow. For this purpose, the natural Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition is applied {{for the first time at}} a bias flow liner. Therefore, velocity field data is obtained with a high spatial resolution of 660 μm at more than 4000 measurement points using the frequency modulated Doppler global velocimeter. The measurement system provides a high dynamic range > 10 ³ and low uncertainty as well as a high measurement rate up to 100 kHz and, thus allows the measurement of both the flow field and the sound field. Furthermore, the analysis of the velocity spectrum is enabled. As a result, an oscillation of the fluid velocity is measured. This velocity oscillation is dominated by sound induced vortices in the flow. Additionally, the hypothesis of an aeroacoustic source near the <b>facing</b> <b>sheet</b> of the liner is suggested.

40|$|An {{indirect}} {{technique for}} educing the homogenized acoustic impedance of a liner {{mounted on the}} wall of a barrel is presented. It is based on measurements and computational simulations of the multimodal scattering matrix of this lined duct. Measurements are performed with a multisource method and the use of an anechoic duct termination. The numerical computation of the scattering matrix relies on a finite element model, and assume that the duct is axisymmetric and uniformly covered by a locally reacting material. The impedance is educed by minimizing the difference between the theoretical and experimental acoustic power dissipations, which are deduced from the scattering matrix. The source is an incoming pressure field generated {{at one end of the}} duct only and composed of all cut-on modes. This technique was tested on a cylindrical barrel whose wall was partially lined with a realistic, locally reacting material made of honeycomb cells and a perforated <b>facing</b> <b>sheet.</b> Results for the acoustic impedance are compared with those deduced from semiempirical models and the experimental two microphone method.

40|$|Acoustic liners {{placed in}} the intake and bypass ducts of {{commercial}} turbofan aeroengines have {{played a major role}} in reducing the environmental impact of turbomachinery noise at take-off and approach. The fan stage is the principal source of turbomachinery noise for a modern High Bypass Ratio (HBR) turbofan engine. Typically a turbofan liner is formed from single or double layers of honeycomb material which are separated from the flow and from each other by porous sheets, and fixed to a rigid backing sheet. The acoustic performance of such panels depends upon the nature and spectrum of the source, on the depth of the honeycomb(s) and the resistance(s) of the internal ‘septum’ (in the case of a double layer) and <b>facing</b> <b>sheet,</b> which in turn depend upon gross parameters such as percentage open area but also by more subtle details such as the diameter and profile of the holes, thickness of the sheet, and whether or not a mesh is overlayed to produce a more ‘linear’ response at high sound pressure levels. Overall liner performance is assessed by the extent to which it contributes to a reduction in whole aircraft noise in the far field, as measured by Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) at three noise certification points (lateral, cutback and approach). The selection of physical liner parameters (depth, hole size, open area etc) to reduce EPNL is a complex task which requires the following components: 1. An impedance model which can translate physical liner parameters, such as honeycomb depth, <b>facing</b> <b>sheet</b> percentage open area, hole diameter etc, into resistance and reactance at the surface of the liner. 2. A source model which defines the modal content of the sound field propagating away from the fan stage at the fan face (intake) and OGV (bypass duct). 3. A propagation model to predict sound attenuation in the intake and bypass duct taking into account geometric non-uniformities, mean flow effects and absorption by acoustically treated segments of the duct wall. 4. A radiation model to propagate the acoustic disturbance from the nacelle to the far field, and to predicts the directivity of the resulting sound field. 5. An optimization procedure which embeds steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 within an EPNL calculation for the whole aircraft (including other noise sources). This process represented by steps 2 to 4 is illustrated in figure 1 for the case of exhaust radiation. The current paper deals with potential strategies for implementing step 5 of the above sequence. The study presented in this paper explores the feasibility of using modern CAA tools to perform steps 3 and 4 in the above sequence, and to run such computations within a modern multi-objective optimization suite in step 5 to automate the liner optimization procedure. The computational resources required are shown to be acceptable for realistic optimization or HBR intake liners and the results are shown to be consistent with those obtained using a less automated approach. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This {{conceptual}} dissertation {{is both a}} study of, and an enactment of, {{the evolution}} of consciousness {{for the purpose of}} evolving education. The research draws attention to and situates itself within four complex, interlinked challenges: the current planetary crisis; the epistemological crisis underpinning it; the global youth problematique; and the inadequacy of the modernist, formal education model to meet these challenges. The research aims to identify and elucidate a new movement of consciousness through integrating and cohering literature on postformal, integral and planetary consciousness in conversation with literature from a variety of postformal pedagogies. It does so through what I refer to as postformal research, which I distinguish from formal research in numerous ways. The most obvious ways in which this dissertation differs from a standard social sciences dissertation is that it interweaves three different types of text throughout the dissertation: the five main chapters; the Prologue, Metalogue and Epilogue; and the reflective narratives—Prelude, Interludes and Coda. These three types of text are each visibly distinguished by a colour-coded <b>facing</b> <b>sheet.</b> The five main chapters are academic publications, developed and published as part of the research process. The key research focii of the dissertation are addressed in each of these five chapters. Chapter One identifies features of the youth problematique and the broad cultural pedagogical context surrounding it, through a layered analysis of causal factors. Chapter Two provides a macrohistorical context for understanding the relationships among education, evolution of consciousness and culture. Chapter Three undertakes a broadening and deepening of the evolution of consciousness discourse through incorporating integral theoretic approaches including heterodox evolutionary narratives that offer alternative interpretations to classical Darwinism. In this chapter, I engage in an integral hermeneutic analysis of the evolutionary writings of Rudolf Steiner and Ken Wilber in the light of Jean Gebser’s structures of consciousness. I weave an epic but pluralistic narrative tapestry created from an interweaving of these three alternative views of evolution. Chapter Four draws out significant features of the new consciousness and distils new understandings of evolution in a form suitable for engaging the current education discourse. Chapter Five contributes significant new perspectives to educational philosophy. This final chapter offers an aesthetic-philosophic alternative to scientism for present and future cultural pedagogical practice by identifying four core values that are seeds for evolving education in line with emerging shifts in consciousness. In addition to the five chapters, the Prologue introduces the research, provides an overview of the dissertation and a preliminary discussion of my substantive content, the evolution of consciousness, and my pragmatic interest in futures of cultural pedagogical practice. The Metalogue discusses my integral evolutionary philosophy, my transdisciplinary epistemology, my complex methodology of theoretic bricolage and my objective-subjective role as researcher. Finally the Epilogue summarises the significance and limitations of my research, evaluates it, and offers some suggestions for further research and closing reflections. It is proposed that a more conscious evolution of cultural pedagogical practice informed by postformal-integral-planetary consciousness may be more responsive to addressing the crises and complexities of the future...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sandwich plates used {{in marine}} {{structures}} {{are made of}} laminated <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> bonded to a structural foam core. Low-velocity impact by a stiff indenter may cause local deflection of the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> and permanent deformation or crushing of an underlying volume of the foam core. Upon unloading, the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> tends to spring back, while the permanent strain in the core gives rise to residual stresses that may nucleate local interfacial cracks. Extension of such interfacial cracks by applied loads can compromise structural integrity. This article examines the protective effect of thin, ductile interlayers, inserted between the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> and the foam core, that absorb the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> deflection and thus prevent or reduce the extent of damage to the foam core. Finite element solutions are obtained for a stiff, incompressible, and very ductile polyurethane (PUR) interlayer, and also for a compliant and compressible elastomeric foam (EF) layer, in a sandwich plate made of quasi-isotropic AS 4 / 3501 - 6 laminated <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> and H 100 PVC core. Loading is applied by a concentrated force acting on a rigid cylindrical indenter. Results show that the PUR interlayer better supports the impacted <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> than does the foam core or the EF interlayer. The PUR layer also reduces the extent of permanent deformation of the foam core. At a given magnitude of applied load, the energy release rate for cracks extended by residual stresses at the interface between the foam core and either interlayer is much lower than that at the interface between the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> and the foam core in the conventional design.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{two methods}} for predicting the in-plane compression strength of impact damaged sandwich structures. For developing these methods uniaxial in-plane compression tests of impact damaged unsymmetrical sandwich coupons are conducted. The specimens {{were made of}} two CFRP <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> of different thickness and an embedded honeycomb core. Low velocity impacts from 1 J up to 15 J caused varying amounts of core and <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> damage and {{a dent in the}} impacted <b>face</b> <b>sheet.</b> While increasing the in-plane compression in the residual strength tests, the dent grew in depth and transverse to the loading direction until final failure of the impacted <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> occurred. This phenomenological observation is reproduced in computational simulations. The simulations use either an efficient finite element model or a semi-analytical Ritz approach including non-linear displacement-strain relations and progressive damage growth in the core. For the latter stress-based failure criteria and stiffness degradation models are applied. Residual strength criteria are developed depending on the numerical solver. The comparison of simulation and test results demonstrates that the presented methods are able to predict the damage tolerance of unsymmetrical sandwich structures. For damages due a high-energy impact the simulations show that the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> damage has {{to be included in the}} model. Including the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> damage into the semi-analytical model increases the computational time tremendously. Therefore, the semi-analytical model should be used only for impact damages with negligible <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> damage. ...|$|R

The Extended Higher order SAndwich Plate theory (EHSaPT) is suitable for representing the independent motion of the <b>face</b> <b>sheets.</b> A 1 D spectral element based on EHSaPT is developed in this work. The wave number and the wave speed characteristics are obtained using the developed spectral element. It is shown that the developed spectral element is capable of representing independent wave motions of the <b>face</b> <b>sheets.</b> The propagation speeds of a high frequency modulated pulse in the <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> and the core of a honeycomb sandwich are demonstrated. Responses of a typical honeycomb sandwich beam to high frequency shock loads are obtained using the developed spectral element and the response match very well with the finite element results. It is shown that the developed spectral element is able to represent the flexibility of the core resulting into independent wave motions in the <b>face</b> <b>sheets,</b> for which a finite element method needs huge degrees of freedom.

40|$|Results of an {{extensive}} study conducted to evaluate multilayer insulation (MLI) materials suitable for repeated space vehicle operation are presented. Materials studied were radiation shields, shield spacers, blanket <b>face</b> <b>sheets,</b> fasteners, and adhesives. The Superfloc MLI concept - Kapton shields goldized {{on both sides}} as the radiation barrier with Dacron flock tufts as the spacers - {{appeared to be an}} excellent MLI for reusable cryogenic tankage. Superfloc configurations consisting of various combinations of film, spacer, and adhesive materials were manufactured and tested. Tensile, flexing, expansion, and cycling tests were performed on goldized Kapton and Mylar Superfloc and Beta glass reinforced Pyre ML <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> material. A <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> material that retains its shape was developed. Polyphenylene oxide material was selected for fabricating lightweight twin and tri-pin fasteners, together with grommets, <b>face</b> <b>sheets,</b> and reinforcement slabs. Measured material thermal conductivity values are tabulated...|$|R
