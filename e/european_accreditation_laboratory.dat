40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century there are defined priorities in laboratory medicine such as laboratory automation, laboratory consolidation, molecular diagnostics, and <b>accreditation</b> of <b>laboratories</b> aiming {{to improve the quality of}} patient care. Laboratory medicine is backbone in the medical treatment, diagnosis and prevention. Laboratory diagnostics influences 70 - 80 % of hospital health care decisions and costs between 3 - 5 % of total health care costs. Laboratory attempts to improve quality aim to reduce diagnostic errors and decrease turn around time with traceability of all laboratory procedures. Concerning quality, the strategic plans of IFCC and EFCC include focusing of accreditation of labs based on ISO standards and cooperation with <b>European</b> <b>Accreditation</b> and national accreditation bodies. IFCC recognises that ISO 15189 : 2007 - Medical laboratories - Particular requirements for quality and competence, encompasses all the assessment criteria specified in the policy statement and as such should form the basis for the <b>accreditation</b> of <b>laboratories.</b> There are also different systems in EU countries based on national quality systems which are based on ISO 15189. Accreditation is not about who the best is, but who has a system of standard procedures. Quality system is about people, with people and for people...|$|R

40|$|The <b>European</b> Board for <b>Accreditation</b> in Cardiology (EBAC) {{is a joint}} {{initiative}} of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the Cardiology Section of the Union of European Medical Specialists or Union Européenne des Médecins Spécialistes (UEMS). EBAC operates independently from these parent organisations. The ESC is the highest cardiovascular scientific authority in Europe {{and the most important}} provider of Continuing Medical Education (CME) in cardiology. The UEMS officially represents the European medical specialists at the European Union (EU). The UEMS consists of different mono-specialist sections, among which the Cardiology Section. The recognition of the importance of CME and the need for quality standards and quality control led the UEMS to establish the <b>European</b> <b>Accreditation</b> Council for CME (EACCME) in January 2000. CME activities that seek <b>European</b> <b>accreditation</b> have to comply with the regulations of this council. As a consequence of the establishment of EACCME, the mono-specialist sections of the UEMS together with the different European scientific societies started to create accreditation boards with the aim to assess international CME activities in accordance with the regulations of UEMS and EACCME. EBAC was founded in 2000. EBAC accreditation is complimentary to national CME accreditation. The Netherlands Society of Cardiology (Nederlandse Vereniging voor Cardiologie, NVVC) and its Institute for CME, the Netherlands Institute for Continuing Cardiovascular Education (Cardio-Vasculair Onderwijs Instituut, CVOI) formally recognise EBAC accreditation and Attendance Certificates...|$|R

40|$|The <b>European</b> Agency for <b>Accreditation</b> in Public Health Education (APHEA) was {{launched}} in 2011. This followed nearly two decades of efforts {{in a variety of}} programmes supported by international donor agencies, and others that provided experience and field testing of peer review systems for schools of public health in Europe. The Association of Schools of Public Health in the European Region (ASPHER) Public Health Education European Review (PEER) project, devised with the aid of WHO EURO in the early 1990 s and later by the Open Society Institute (OSI) within the framework of a joint ASPHER-OSI Program from 2000 - 2005, helped to develop a cadre of expertise on the process of international peer review and standards that are compatible with a full accreditation process. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a brief overview of the background, criteria and current pilot phase of <b>European</b> <b>accreditation</b> for the Master of Public Health degree and equivalent study programmes. Undergoing the accreditation process will help longstanding and new schools review their programmes to meet new <b>European</b> <b>accreditation</b> system standards and provide students, graduates and potential employers with confidence in the future acceptability of their credentials. The new accreditation agency was established by a consortium of European public health organisations and represents a new phase for development of standards and quality of education systems in Europe to face the challenges of workforce development for a “New Public Health” era in the 21 st century...|$|R

5000|$|The Blevin Report, {{published}} in 1998, examined {{the state of}} worldwide metrology. The report originated from a resolution passed at the 20th CGPM (October 1995) which committed the CIPM to [...] to study and report on the long-term national and international needs relating to metrology, the appropriate international collaborations and the unique role of the BIPM to meet these needs, and the financial and other commitments that will be required from the Member States in the coming decades. The report identified, amongst other things, a need for closer cooperation between the BIPM and other organisations such as International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) and International <b>Laboratory</b> <b>Accreditation</b> Cooperation (ILAC) with clearly defined boundaries and interfaces between the organisations. Another major finding was the need for cooperation between <b>accreditation</b> <b>laboratories</b> {{and the need to}} involve developing countries in the world of metrology.|$|R
50|$|The Association for Assessment and <b>Accreditation</b> of <b>Laboratory</b> Animal Care International, or AAALAC, is a private, nonprofit {{organization}} that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs.

In 1996, AAALAC {{changed its name to}} the Association for Assessment and <b>Accreditation</b> of <b>Laboratory</b> Animal Care International (AAALAC International). The name change reflects the organization's growth in other countries, and its commitment to enhancing life sciences and quality animal care around the world.
