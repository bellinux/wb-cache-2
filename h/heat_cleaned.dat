40|$|The sliding {{friction}} behavior of single filaments of SiO 2, SiC, and an aluminoborosilicate has been determined. These fibers {{are used in}} thermal protection systems (TPS) and are subject to damage during weaving and aero-maneuvering. All fibers exhibited stick-slip friction indicating the successive formation and rupture of strong junctions between the contacting filaments. The static frictional resistance of the sized SiC filament was 4 X greater than for the same filament after heat cleaning. This result suggests that the sizing is an organic polymer with a high shear yield strength. Heat cleaning exposes the SiC surface and/or leaves an inorganic residue so that the adhesional contact between filaments has a low fracture energy and frictional sliding occurs by brittle fracture. The frictional resistances of the sized and <b>heat</b> <b>cleaned</b> SiO 2 and glass filaments were all {{comparable to that of}} the <b>heat</b> <b>cleaned</b> SiC. It would appear that the sizings as well as the <b>heat</b> <b>cleaned</b> surfaces of the silica and glass have low fracture energies so that the sliding resistance is determined by brittle fracture...|$|E
40|$|The {{negative}} {{electron affinity}} photocathodes, in particular GaAs, have been extensively studied {{in recent years}} [1]. Negative electron affinity occurs when a low work function coating, for example caesium plus oxygen, reduces the vacuum level below {{the bottom of the}} conduction band. Electrons are excited in the bulk of the crystal, and, having rapidly thermalised diffuse to the vacuum interface where a certain fraction are emitted. The efficiency of this final process depends on various parameters such as the nature of the surface, the (Cs-O) activation procedure used, and the electronic properties of the surface, for example the degree of bandbending. An equally important parameter which is particularly evident in the case of photoemission from ternaries is the heterojunction barrier [2] between the semiconductor and the Cs-O coating. Experiments have been conducted to measure this parameter on n and p type GaAs. Using <b>heat</b> <b>cleaned</b> (100) Si doped GaAs, the photoelectric thresholds were determined as the thickness of the (Cs-O) coating increased. Values for the heterojunction barrier in the range 1. 26 - 1. 32 eV were measured. In the case of p type GaAs, {{because of the nature of}} the band bending at the surface, it is not possible to measure the thresholds directly. However some work has been carried out on <b>heat</b> <b>cleaned</b> (100) Zn doped p type GaAs and, taking energy distribution measurements as the thickness of the Cs-O coating is increased, the heterojunction barrier has been found to be ~ 1. 3 eV. There is thus some evidence from these measurements, that the barrier height is the same for both n and p type GaAs. It is difficult to assess the importance of the barrier, but in the case of p type material it appears that the maximum sensitivity occurs when the work function is equal to the barrier height...|$|E

Air conditioning had become a standard option on most vehicle for enhancing comfort and safety. Most of automotives air conditioning system, the compressor is a belt-driven coupled to the engine.

Based on the situation, the air conditioning test rig was built to understand clearly about the air conditioning system including the vapor compression refrigeration cycle in the system and the function of each component in the system. There are four locations of temperature measurement were selected in order to develop the test rig. These locations are at the inlet and outlet of the compressor, the outlet of the condenser, and the inlet of the evaporator, respectively. The pressure was measured at the low pressure side and high pressure side which are at the outlet of the evaporator and inlet of the condenser, respectively. All of the parameters are measured during the cycle and were analyzed by using the properties table for refrigerant- 134 a and the p-h diagram for refrigerant- 134 a in order to determine the heat rejection, cooling effect, work of compressor and the coefficient of performance (COP) of the air conditioning system.
