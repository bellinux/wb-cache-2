50|$|There {{are many}} forms of tow hitch, {{including}} a ball hitch, tow bar, pintle and lunette ring, three-point, <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>coupling,</b> and drawbar, among others.|$|R
50|$|The {{two types}} of {{couplings}} are <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> and automatic. In some applications, no separable coupling is fitted, and the trailer is bolted to the tractor unit, using a bearing, and rocker feet as are used under a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> skid plate.|$|R
50|$|The nipple at {{the front}} of a {{semi-trailer}} to connect to a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> on a tractor unit is also known as a kingpin, which usage is analogous to the original horse-drawn wagon and traction engine steering use.|$|R
5000|$|Low loader dolly, {{equipped}} with a gooseneck type drawbar that attaches to the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> on the rear of a prime mover to distribute the mass on the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> on the dolly between the prime mover and {{the wheels of the}} dolly. These are predominantly fitted with two axles.|$|R
25|$|The <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> {{provides}} a pivoting link between a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly. Some recreational vehicles have a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> configuration, requiring the coupling {{to be installed}} {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck as a towing vehicle. The coupling consists of a <b>coupling</b> <b>pin</b> (or kingpin) {{on the front of the}} semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> on the rear of the towing vehicle. In 1911, Charles Martin invented the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> coupler consisting of a round plate with a hole in it, attached to a frame mounted on his tractor.|$|R
5000|$|Semi-trailers {{with two}} trailer units are called B-doubles (Australian English) or tandem tractor trailers, tandem rigs, or doubles (American English). Other terms used are [...] "B-train" [...] or (when {{there are three}} or more trailers) [...] "road train". A B-double {{consists}} of a prime mover towing two semitrailers, where the first semitrailer {{is connected to the}} prime mover by a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> (a.k.a. 'converter dolly') and the second semitrailer is connected to the first semitrailer by a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling.</b> In Australian English, the tractor unit is usually referred to as a [...] "prime-mover", and the combination of a prime-mover and trailer is known as a [...] "semitrailer" [...] or [...] "semi".|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of these tractors are designed to pull long semi-trailers, most often to transport freight over a significant distance, and {{is connected to the}} trailer with a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling.</b> In England, this type of [...] "tractor" [...] is often called an [...] "artic cab" [...] (short for [...] "articulated" [...] cab).|$|R
50|$|The years beyond 1920 saw several advancements, such as {{improved}} rural roads, {{the introduction}} of the diesel engine (which are 25-40% more efficient than gasoline engines), the standardization of truck and trailer sizes along with <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> systems, as well as power assisted brakes and steering. By 1933, all states had some form of varying truck weight regulation.|$|R
50|$|The {{towing vehicle}} {{has a wide}} {{coupling}} plate known as a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> bolted onto its chassis on which the semi-trailer rests and pivots. As the tractor reverses under the trailer, a kingpin under {{the front of the}} trailer slides into a slot in the skidplate, and the jaws of the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> close onto it. The driver has to raise the trailer legs manually, and couple the airbrake lines and electrical cables.|$|R
50|$|In {{operation}} the translifter is {{coupled with}} a universal terminal tractor with lifting 5th <b>wheel</b> (<b>Fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling).</b> Terminal tractors' 5th wheel connects to the translifter's Kingpin. The translifter is lowered down and driven under the cassette and then raised again with the cassette for transportation. Translifters usually have automatically steered tires which helps handling {{the combination of the}} translifter and terminal tractor.|$|R
50|$|The {{tractor-trailer}} combination distributes a load {{across multiple}} axles while being more maneuverable than an equivalently sized rigid truck. The most common trailer attachment {{system is a}} <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling,</b> allowing rapid shift between trailers performing different functions, such as a bulk tipper and box trailer. Trailers containing differing cargos can be rapidly swapped between tractors, eliminating downtime while a trailer is unloaded or loaded.|$|R

The two middle axles are rigidly attached to the A-Trailer and support the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> with which the rear trailer is towed. The A-Trailer wheels electronically counter steer with respect to the tractor unit.|$|R
50|$|Towing is {{coupling}} {{two or more}} objects {{together so}} that they may be pulled by a designated power source or sources. The towing source may be a motorized land vehicle, vessel, animal, or human, the load anything that can be pulled. These may be joined by a chain, rope, bar, hitch, three-point, <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>coupling,</b> drawbar, integrated platform, or other means of keeping the objects together while in motion.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the road}} {{transport}} or trucking industry a B-train {{consists of two}} trailers linked together by a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel,</b> and are up to 26 m (85 ft) long. The <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> {{is located at the}} rear of the lead, or first, trailer and is mounted on a [...] "tail" [...] section commonly located immediately above the lead trailer axles. In North America this area of the lead trailer is often referred to as the [...] "bridge". The twin-trailer assembly is hooked up to a tractor unit via the tractor unit's <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in the customary manner.|$|R
50|$|The drawbar {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling.</b> The drawbar requires a trailer which either loads the drawbar lightly (for example a small boat trailer, or caravan, where a load of up to ~50 kg is part of correct trailer loading practice), or the load is the weight of the coupling components only (larger trailers, usually but not always with a steerable hauled axle, front or rear). By contrast, the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> is designed to transmit a major proportion of the load's weight to the hauling vehicle.|$|R
50|$|While some {{trackless}} {{trains are}} functional or modern in appearance, many are often constructed with false bodywork and are painted {{to look like}} nineteenth century steam trains. Others may feature decorative or fun paint schemes to appeal to children. Certain models of trackless train may look the same as narrow gauge rail guided amusement park trains, due to the common manufacture of both vehicles. Some <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupled</b> trailer buses may also be similarly decorated.|$|R
50|$|In 1970 SAT {{started a}} {{development}} project jointly with consulting company Jaakko PÃ¶yry for suitable vehicles for {{loading and unloading}} of ro-ro vessels. As a result, SAT launched a four-wheel-drive model TV-10 and its reversed steering version T-10 in 1971. 22 units were produced in the same year. A significant feature was its patented <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> system which enabled a quick a flexible engagement. The solution was developed by technician Nils Fagerstedt and it paved the success in export market.|$|R
40|$|Tractor {{trolleys}} {{are widely}} used in rural India. The major transport material and labor is done with tractor trolleys. Through the trolleys have been designed and put in transport, fabricated by local fabricators. No standards have been followed. The trolleys are more prone accidents due to various reasons. Most common reason in absence of any standard braking system. The design of braking system for four-wheeler Trolley have been done and presented. For synchronisation of motion between tractor engine and trolley a concept of <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> have been incorporated. The standard <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> couplings have been designed and planned. The necessary changes will be made in hydraulic circuit of the tractor. Key words Tractor Trolley, Brakes, Fifthwheel couplin...|$|R
50|$|In the UK, cargo {{carrying}} {{vehicles were}} previously defined, {{and are still}} commonly known, as HGVs (Heavy Goods Vehicles), although for harmonisation with other European Union member states, this term was officially changed to LGV (Large goods vehicle). Articulated lorries are the more common configuration of larger LGV in the UK, where a tractor unit tows a semi-trailer through a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling.</b> The drawbar configuration is a less common example of large LGV, and consists of a rigid lorry with cargo carrying capacity, which also pulls a second cargo trailer, using a drawbar link. The UK also allows the use of 18 m long 'bendy buses' for public transport. Buses however have their own legal classification, as PSVs (Passenger Service Vehicles).|$|R
50|$|Like other semi-trailers, most {{commercial}} car carrier trailers {{attach to the}} tractor using a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling.</b> Trailers can either be enclosed, possessing walls like a conventional box trailer, which affords the shipped vehicles more protection {{at the cost of}} lower capacity; or open, as in the commonly seen skeletal tube steel design, which exposes the vehicles to the elements but allows for greater carrying capacity. An American {{commercial car}} carrier typically fits between 5 and 9 cars, depending on the car size and trailer model (capacity is limited by an 80,000 lb weight cap that a road vehicle is subject to under U.S. law.). Significantly higher-capacity vehicles have been observed around the world, such as a side-by-side loading Chinese model.|$|R
50|$|For a long while, it {{was common}} to use 'dollies' to recover vehicles. These were cranes and underlifts as above, but mounted on a two-wheeled axle. They were {{designed}} to be towed behind a suitable towing vehicle. Another portable device was a crane, which clipped on to an articulated tractor unit's <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling.</b> Popular in the seventies and eighties, they were cheap to buy (compared with a purpose-built recovery vehicle) and appealed to fleet operators, who could use them to recover their own vehicles. Total lift dollies were carried by some spectacle lifts to place under the wheels {{at the opposite end}} to the lifted wheels, thereby converting the half lift into a total lift. These are used, for example, when a vehicle has had an accident and both ends are damaged.|$|R
5000|$|While the Denby Eco-Link is in {{the catch}} all {{category}} of a Longer Heavier Vehicle (LHV), in particular, it achieves this using a vehicle configuration known as a [...] "B-Train" [...] or [...] "B-Double". The Denby design of B-Double takes the tractor and trailer of a standard 16.5 m long articulated lorry, and turns it into a B Double by adding a special trailer in the middle, which has a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> mounted above the trailer bogey, extending the overall length, and hence cargo carrying volume. All in, the Denby Eco-Link has a maximum gross weight (vehicle and cargo) of 60 tonnes. It has a total vehicle length (tractor and two trailers) of 25.25 m, {{with a total of}} 8 axles (three on the tractor, two on the middle trailer, three on the rear trailer).|$|R
50|$|Fruehauf Trailer Corporation, {{previously}} Fruehauf Trailer Company (1918-1963) and Fruehauf Corporation (1963-1989), was an American company {{engaged in}} the manufacture and sale of truck trailers, and other machinery and equipment, with headquarters located in Detroit, Michigan. It was founded in 1918 in Detroit, after August Fruehauf created the semi-trailer and launched a new industry. The Fruehauf trailer company introduced revolutionary inventions to trucking and transportation with hydraulic dump trailers, bulk tanker trailers, and automatic <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> among their over one thousand patents, including the shipping container in 1956. Expanding across the country, Fruehauf had 16 plants and over 80 distributorships for parts and service. Globally, the company expanded into Europe, South America and Asia. Following a proxy battle in the late 1980s the company filed for bankrupt protection in 1997. International divisions became independent, U.S. subsidiaries like Kelsey Hayes, Pro-Par, Budd Wheels and Hobbs were sold; Wabash National acquired the crippled company in 1997.|$|R
50|$|The M15A2 trailer the M123 {{was first}} {{intended}} to tow {{had a higher}} load plate and larger <b>coupling</b> <b>pin</b> than a standard semi-trailer. Early M123s had a larger <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted above the frame rails, but as more standard trailers were used the M123C and all following models had lowered <b>fifth</b> <b>wheels.</b> The pin remained larger, so any trailer towed by any M123 had to have an interchangeable pin.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fifth</b> <b>wheels</b> were {{originally}} {{not a complete}} circle and were hand forged. When mass production of buggy parts {{began in the early}} 19th century, <b>fifth</b> <b>wheels</b> were among the first products to be made. There were a number of patents awarded for fifth-wheel design. Edward and Charles Everett, Quincy, Illinois patented a type of <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1850, followed by Gutches' metallic head block and <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1870 and Wilcox <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1905.|$|R
5000|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> for motorized trucks is often credited to US inventor Charles H. Martin of the Martin Rocking <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> Co. who invented the device in 1915. [...] It was submitted for patent in 1915, and finalized in 1916. Herman Farr invented it, and Martin hooked up with him and became the assignee. When they formed the Martin <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> company Martin was president and Farr was named secretary. The 5th wheel was Farr's invention. Martin capitalized on it. [...] "It's a fair question whether you really can consider the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> as a milestone separate from the semi-trailer. After all, {{the purpose of the}} <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> is to link the tractor and the trailer; indeed, trailers existed before Charles H. Martin introduced the Martin Rocking <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> in 1915. At the time, the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> literally was a wheel that moved with the trailerâunlike todayâs technology that secures a kingpin. What makes the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> so important is the ability it gave fleet owners to attach large trailers to tractors easily and safely and the freedom it gave them to switch out trailers. Without a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel,</b> the modern distribution system would look quite different as drop-and-hook would not be easy. The semi-trailer increased the capacity of trucks, but it was the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> that brought the flexibility for drivers to keep moving while receivers unloaded the loads they just delivered." ...|$|R

50|$|Today's <b>fifth</b> <b>wheels</b> {{allow the}} {{trailers}} to {{slide into the}} <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> and lock into it, and are a very reliable unit when maintained and serviced properly. The engagement of the king pin into the fifth-wheel locking mechanism is {{the only means of}} connection between tractor and trailer; no other device or safety mechanism is used. Couplers and pintle hooks use safety chains {{in the event of a}} trailer separation while going down the road. Trailer-to-trailer connection can also be made by using <b>fifth</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
