2500|$|In 1953, the [...] "Autronic Eye" [...] was introduced. This feature would {{automatically}} <b>dim</b> high-beam <b>headlamps</b> {{for the safety}} of oncoming motorists.|$|R

25|$|The Mini Cooper S won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965 and 1967. Minis were {{initially}} placed first, {{second and third}} in the 1966 rally as well, but were controversially disqualified {{for the use of}} a variable resistance <b>headlamp</b> <b>dimming</b> circuit in place of a dual-filament lamp.|$|R
50|$|Speed and {{handbrake}} levers are now {{central and}} a tail lamp is supplied at no extra charge. The front seat {{is a single}} seat but it has an 8-inch range of adjustment. The side windows have quick action winders, the driver's is a lever not winder. One windscreen wiper is provided and provision made for another. The top of the steering wheel has controls for the horn, <b>dimming</b> the <b>headlamps,</b> and the spark and the throttle. Wire wheels continue to be provided. The spare remains behind the petrol tank {{in front of the}} folding luggage grid.|$|R
50|$|A new AM/FM stereo {{radio with}} {{cassette}} tape player, {{as well as}} Ford's new top-of-the-line Electronic AM/FM Stereo Search Radio with Quadrasonic 8-track tape player, were added as new radio options. The latter received a floor-mounted foot-switch (inboard of the physically identical floor-mounted <b>headlamp</b> <b>dimmer</b> switch), which would allow the driver to left-foot-tap the switch to scan radio stations or advance tracks on the 8-track player, without having to take their hands off the steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|An inquiry {{blamed the}} crew of the vacationers' train for failing to obey orders. The inquiry also {{determined}} that the crew's error had been precipitated by their seeing a clear signal, which implied that the track ahead was clear, and that the Continental Limited’s <b>dimming</b> of its <b>headlamp</b> while waiting in the station lessened its visibility to the oncoming vacation train. This resulted in both the acquisition of modern rail cars and the improvement of rules regarding operations on the line.|$|R
50|$|The new Cutlass Salon was {{an upscale}} Euro-style luxury/sports sedan similar in concept to the Pontiac Grand Am of the era. The Salon, which {{included}} {{items such as}} uprated suspension, radial tires, reclining bucket seats and hand-operated <b>headlamp</b> <b>dimmer</b> switch (integral to the turn signal lever) {{was based on the}} Cutlass Supreme series, first as a 4-door Colonnade sedan, joined by a 2-door Colonnade hardtop coupe in 1974. The Cutlass Salon was the first Oldsmobile with the international-flags emblem, later carried on the Cutlass Ciera. Front disc brakes were standard.|$|R
5000|$|A vinyl roof in {{cavalry twill}} pattern was optional, but {{examples}} without the vinyl roof were rare. One {{reason for the}} rarity of the plain-roofed version {{is the fact that}} the roof was made in two pieces and required extra preparation at the factory to conceal the seam; consequently, its availability was not widely advertised. Other options included the aforementioned leather interior, air conditioning, further power adjustments for the front seats, a variety of radios and 8-track tape players, tinted glass, and power locks. A limited slip differential could be ordered, as could anti-lock brakes, called [...] "Sure Trak". Cruise control was also an option. Finally, an automatic <b>headlamp</b> <b>dimmer</b> that dimmed the headlights for oncoming cars without driver intervention was available. Full instrumentation could be ordered.|$|R
5000|$|The Mini Cooper S won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965 and 1967. Minis {{initially}} placed first, {{second and}} third in the 1966 rally as well, but were disqualified after a controversial decision by the judges. The disqualification related {{to the use of}} a variable resistance <b>headlamp</b> <b>dimming</b> circuit in place of a dual-filament lamp. Fourth placed Roger Clark's Ford Cortina was disqualified for the same reason, along with six other cars. The fifth car past the finishing line, a Citroën DS, a model that had won the race previously, was awarded first place - the DS had similar headlamps, but these were standard production equipment on the car - in line with the letter of the rules. The driver of the Citroën, Pauli Toivonen, felt that he hadn't really [...] "won" [...] the rally. [...] BMC probably received more publicity from the disqualification than they would have gained from a victory.|$|R
