The microstructure and fluorescence properties of the four kinds of <b>Eu</b> 3 + <b>coordination</b> complexes were characterized via FTIR, FESEM, EDS, 1 H NMR, TGA, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The conversion of hydroxyl groups to carboxyl groups during the esterification reactions was up to 100 % for the synthesized polymers and modified HNT-based hybrids.

The improved luminescence properties of both of the <b>Eu</b> 3 + <b>coordination</b> HNT-based hybrids are attributable to the efficient intramolecular energy transfer from the hybrid ligands and phen to Eu 3 + ions, and the rigid HNTs framework also plays a positive role in the enhancement of the emission intensity.

Although the power base of Brazil is its respective region, there may be specific policy areas in which its influence might be global. (1) With this in mind, the paper raises interesting questions: is the EU an attractive partner for Brazil? Does the EU want cooperation with Brazil? What are the characteristics of Brazil? What are the EU’s priorities in its foreign trade policy? With which instruments can the EU engage Brazil and how can the <b>EU</b> internal <b>coordination</b> be ensured...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} if, {{how and why}} the EU coordinates for the G 7, G 8 and G 20 (Gx). It focuses on internal <b>EU</b> <b>coordination</b> in Brussels involving all EU member states as opposed to ‘external’ coordination among European Gx participants in the margins of Gx meetings. It appears that internal <b>EU</b> <b>coordination</b> not only differs across the three Gx forums, but also within a single forum such as the G 20. In order to understand these patterns of coordination, six potential causal factors are assessed: existing policies, interests, competences, relevance, EU influence and Gx organization. It is argued that Gx-related factors significantly influence the level of internal coordination for the G 7, G 8 and G 20. However, coordination seems to be less affected by the informal character of the Gx than it is generally assumed. Furthermore, it is argued that the role of the non-Gx EU member states cannot be ignored if one seeks to understand the level of internal <b>EU</b> <b>coordination</b> for the Gx. Finally, it appears that the European Commission seems to be more concerned about its own performance and that of the Union in the Gx, rather than about involving the non-Gx EU member states in the Gx process...|$|E
40|$|Defence date: 20 December 2011 Examining Board: Professor Dr. Adrienne Héritier, European University Institute (Supervisor); Professor Dr. Tanja Börzel, Freie Universität Berlin; Professor Dr. Peter Nedergaard, University of Copenhagen; Professor Dr. Pascal Vennesson, European University InstituteWhat {{are the key}} {{determinants}} behind how {{member states}} develop positions for the negotiations in the Council of the European Union? This is the major question that this thesis seeks to answer. In order to develop negotiation positions for the Council, all member states have established an <b>EU</b> <b>coordination</b> system which {{can be defined as}} a structure containing interlinked units whose function is to align national EU-related activities so that a national negotiation position can be presented in negotiations in the EU decision making system. A number of studies have investigated <b>EU</b> <b>coordination</b> systems and their determinants. By and large, existing studies find that <b>EU</b> <b>coordination</b> systems vary to a large extent because they are a function of pre-existing institutions and values characterising the political systems of each member state. However, these studies are not calibrated to single out exactly which national institutions matter most and many of them neglect national agency. In order to address this shortfall and advance our knowledge about <b>EU</b> <b>coordination,</b> a number of predictions are generated using the veto player approach. The predictions are assessed against empirical evidence from Germany and Denmark, which varies considerably in terms of the constellation of veto players. The two coordination systems are outlined, using process tracing, from three perspectives. First, a diachronic perspective is taken to analyse how coordination systems were established and have changed over time. This analysis shows that veto players play a prominent role in shaping coordination systems, as they utilise their veto powers to increase their influence when determining national negotiation positions. Second, a synchronic perspective is used to examine how coordination systems are organised at a specific point in time. The veto player approach performs well in explaining cross-country variation in the role of subnational units and national parliaments. Third, an applied perspective is used to analyse how <b>EU</b> <b>coordination</b> systems work de facto when establishing national negotiation positions for the draft Services Directive. This analysis indicates that veto players are important but there is not a straightforward correlation between their number and the effectiveness of the coordination systems...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to explore {{the changes in the}} <b>EU’s</b> <b>coordination</b> of {{employment}} and social policies after the introduction of stricter economic governance. It hypothesises that new economic governance has introduced characteristics of hard law into the soft law coordination cycles of employment and social policies. The paper analyses such steps towards hard law by exploring two routes. The first route is the introduction of new instruments in the coordination cycles of Europe 2020 and the Stability and Growth Pact and the implementation of two new coordination cycles, these being the Euro Plus Pact and the Macro-economic Imbalances Surveillance. The second route stems from the integration of policy fields which leads to ambiguity concerning what policy items fall within the scope of which coordination method. The paper therefore analyses the coordination elements that have been introduced as of 2010 and assesses their place on the continuum of hard and soft law coordination. Then, the paper explains the ambiguities that arise concerning the appropriateness of coordination instruments and how this ambiguity may bring employment and social policy elements within the range of hard law surveillance. Subsequently, the paper analyses the actual interaction between the EU and four member states by comparing national reports of 2009 and 2011 as well as the EU’s assessment of national policies. The paper concludes that whereas stricter economic coordination has increased the precision of soft governance as well as introduced more obligation and delegation into hybrid coordination methods, countries still have ample leeway to respond to EU level targets. In addition, ambiguity still exists concerning which coordination method applies to what policy items, leaving employment and social policies as potential subjects for hard law assessment via economic and financial coordination processes...|$|R
40|$|The EU is not {{a member}} of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), but {{relatively}} elaborate <b>EU</b> <b>coordination</b> takes place anyway. This paper addresses two research questions: 1) How is it possible to evaluate the coordination of the EU in its specific observable configuration in the ILO?, and 2) To what outcome does this coordination lead and why? Based on an analysis of <b>EU</b> <b>coordination</b> before and during the International Labour Conference in 2005, and on a comparison with coordination processes of the IMEC group, it is found that the Commission and the Presidency act as twin-agents vis-à-vis their principals, the Member States. The Commission is the leading agent in the phase leading up to the Conference; the Presidency then takes over. On the one hand, due to the Treaty obligations and their interpretations by the Court of Justice, both the Presidency and the Commission are kept within tight limits by the principals. On the other hand, both before and during the Conference, the Member States accept the so-called discursive coordination of the Commission, which seems to be of great (but often neglected) importance. Owing to the organisational set-up in which coordination takes place, the EU is able to coordinate relatively elaborate agreements due to the strength of its coordination as far as professional or technical and political activities (excepting the ILO budget) are concerned. In other more clear-cut or 'simple' policy areas such as the ILO budget, the <b>EU</b> <b>coordination</b> is weak: this contrast with the strong coordination of the IMEC. policy coordination; European Commission; Council of Ministers; social policy; social dialogue; working conditions; ILO; political science; international relations...|$|E

In shedding light on the emergence and first implementation of this governing mode, this paper aims at addressing two research questions. The first more theoretical is about the normative foundation of the OMC process: is it a case of regulatory or of post-regulatory (deliberative) mode of governance? Some authors have stressed the deliberative and post-regulatory nature of new governing modes introduced at EU level. Yet, others {{have focused on the}} persistence of regulatory techniques. This issue has important consequences on the actual traits of the process, in terms of the legitimacy and effectiveness through access, participation, accountability, etc. The second more empirical question is related to the effects of the <b>EU</b> <b>coordination</b> process. Is the Pensions OMC effective in improving EU governance? And in particular, has this contributed to improve participation (of key institutions and political and social actors) and common knowledge production (in terms of common language, shared values, ideas and indicators) ?

In this paper we i) document this increasing heterogeneity, ii) try to explain it and iii) draw from our diagnosis indications as to the appropriate set of policies to reduce unemployment and labour market disparities. Our analysis suggests that the divergence in labour market outcomes across Europe is the by-product of interactions between, on the one hand, shocks of varying size and nature, and, on the other hand, country-specific labour market institutions. We argue that <b>EU</b> policy <b>coordination</b> and conditionality during the Great Recession and the euro area debt crisis did not properly take into account these interactions.

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{effectiveness}} of the member states of the European Union (EU) and the European Commission in negotiations taking place in the World Health Organisation (WHO) is analysed and related to its ability to act as a united bloc. EU unity in external representation is taken to result from European Community (EC) competence, preference homogeneity and processes of socialisation among EU member states representatives. A comparison is made between the negotiations on global strategies on diet, physical activity and health (DPAS, 2004) and on public health, innovation and intellectual property (PHI, 2008). In the DPAS, member states operated primarily on the basis of national positions, whereas in the PHI they operated {{on the basis of a}} coordinated position brought forward by the EU presidency and European Commission. In both cases the EU (or a majority of EU member states) was moderately successful in obtaining its objectives in the negotiations. More unity in external representation originated from the Commission claiming EC competence, a pro-active EU presidency and a process of intensive <b>EU</b> <b>coordination</b> becoming gradually institutionalised. Member states' representatives identified economies of scale in conducting a unified external representation, although their initial preferences were rather different. Identified drawbacks included the extensive time spent in <b>EU</b> <b>coordination,</b> the dependency on the intention and qualities of the lead negotiator, and the EUs difficulties with reacting swiftly to new issues coming up in the negotiations...|$|E
