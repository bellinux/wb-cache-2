40|$|A new {{technique}} called edge boundary classification (EBC) for recognition of features from boundary representation (B-rep) solid model to support integrated manufacturing is presented. Features are interpreted from patterns formed {{by identifying the}} solid and void 'sides' of a boundary entity using the spatial addressability information of solid models. The application of the EBC technique for recognising simple and interacting cylindrical-based features is explained and discussed. The type of features experimented are through-hole, blind-hole, boss and <b>internal</b> <b>undercut.</b> The results obtained show that cylindrical-based features can easily be recognised using the EBC technique...|$|E

The {{regulations}} make provision for this via <b>internal</b> door <b>undercuts</b> to maintain a minimum gap of 10mm above the finished floor surface. This provides a 7600mm² permanent opening when a door is closed.|$|R

40|$|AbstractComputerized {{tomography}} is {{an emerging}} technology for geometric inspection. Its capability of easily scanning <b>internal</b> and <b>undercut</b> surfaces, {{as well as}} micro components, makes it the only possible choice for several measurement tasks. However, traceability is still a relevant issue, {{due to the lack}} of well-established procedures for testing CT scanners: several international standards about the application of computerized tomography for geometric inspection are still under development. In this work, we will propose the results we obtained in the application of the VDI/VDE 2617 part 13 standard on two computerized tomography scanners. In particular, we will show the impact of the choice of the threshold on the results of the test...|$|R
25|$|If {{the size}} of the {{undercut}} is small enough and the material is flexible enough a side action is not always required. In these cases the undercut is stripped or snapped out of the mold. When this is done usually a stripping plate or ring is used instead of stripper pins so that the part is not damaged. This technique can be used on <b>internal</b> and external <b>undercuts.</b>|$|R
25|$|Undercuts on molded {{parts are}} {{features}} that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an injection molding machine. They are categorized into <b>internal</b> and external <b>undercuts,</b> where external undercuts {{are on the}} exterior of the part and interior undercuts are {{on the inside of the}} part. Undercuts can still be molded, but require a side action or side pull. This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine.|$|R

40|$|This Article, {{written for}} a {{symposium}} on compliance issues in financial-services firms, {{focuses on the}} role of the chief compliance officer (“CCO”). Contrasting the position with that held by a firm’s general counsel or Chief Legal Officer (CLO), the article argues that a CCO’s position holds distinct challenges. Additionally, although internal compliance systems and personnel may be characterized as functional substitutes for external regulation, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of internal compliance requires a willingness to look deep within firms. The article argues that the law and regulation may enhance firms’ incentives to invest in effective internal compliance but may also <b>undercut</b> <b>internal</b> compliance through unforeseen consequences of legal doctrine and regulation; the relatively underdeveloped status of compliance as a profession may also serve to weaken the effectiveness of compliance personnel. The article recounts several recent incidents stemming from evident failures in internal compliance to illustrate more systemic and general issues...|$|R
