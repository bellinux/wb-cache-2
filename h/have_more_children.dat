5|$|A son, Geoffrey Bruce Oliphant, {{was born}} 6 October 1930, but {{he died of}} {{meningitis}} on 5 September 1933, and was interred in an unmarked grave in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge alongside Timothy Cockcroft, the infant son of Sir John and Lady Elizabeth Cockcroft, who had died the year before. Unable to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>children,</b> the Oliphants adopted a four-month-old boy, Michael John, in 1936, and a daughter, Vivian, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Maternal age {{affects the}} chances of having a {{pregnancy}} with Down syndrome. At age 20, the chance is one in 1441; at age 30, it is one in 959; at age 40, it is one in 84; and at age 50 it is one in 44. Although the probability increases with maternal age, 70% of children with Down syndrome are born to women 35 {{years of age and}} younger, because younger people <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>children.</b> The father's older age is also a risk factor in women older than 35, but not in women younger than 35, and may partly explain the increase in risk as women age.|$|E
25|$|Since 2010, {{the rate}} of {{increase}} was of 0.3% in the Americas and Europe. On the other hand, Eric Kaufman, of University of London, argued that the main reason for expansion of Catholicism and conservative Protestantism along with other religions is because their religions tend to be “pro-natal” and they <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>children,</b> and not due to religious conversion.|$|E

25|$|While {{the total}} Fertility Rate of Muslims in North America is 2.7 {{children}} per {{woman in the}} 2010 to 2015 period, well above the regional average (2.0) and the replacement level (2.1). Europe’s Muslim population also has higher fertility (2.1) than other religious groups in the region, well above the regional average (1.6). A new study of Population Reference Bureau by demographers Charles Westoff and Tomas Frejka suggests that the fertility gap between Muslims and non-Muslims is shrinking and although the Muslim immigrants do <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>children</b> than other Europeans but their fertility tends to decline over time, often faster than among non-Muslims.|$|E
25|$|Hepburn met {{her second}} husband, Italian {{psychiatrist}} Andrea Dotti, on a Mediterranean cruise {{with friends in}} June 1968. She believed she would <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>children</b> and possibly stop working. They married on 18 January 1969; their son, Luca Dotti, was born on 8 February 1970. While pregnant with Luca in 1969, Hepburn was more careful, resting for months before delivering the baby via caesarean section. She {{wanted to have a}} third child, but had another miscarriage in 1974. Dotti was unfaithful and she had a romantic relationship with actor Ben Gazzara during the filming of the 1979 movie Bloodline. The Dotti-Hepburn marriage lasted thirteen years and was dissolved in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Another {{element in}} the {{immigration}} debate is a concern to alleviate adverse impacts arising from Australia's aging population. The former Federal Treasurer, Peter Costello has said that Australia is underpopulated due to a low birth rate, and that negative population growth will have adverse long-term effects on the economy as the population ages and the labour market becomes less competitive. To avoid this outcome the government increased immigration to fill gaps in labour markets and introduced a subsidy to encourage families to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>children.</b> However, opponents of population growth such as Sustainable Population Australia do not accept that population growth will decline and reverse, based on current immigration and fertility projections.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the causal relations between <b>having</b> <b>more</b> <b>children</b> and women's labour force participation using Korean data. Given the strong preference for sons in Korea, variables regarding the number of daughters were used as instrument variables for <b>having</b> <b>more</b> <b>children.</b> The results using 1980 s data showed that having a third child had a significantly positive impact on women's labour force participation in the ordinary least squares analysis, whereas the coefficient value was significantly negative in the two-stage least squares analysis. Such results imply that, unlike in the western societies such as the USA and the UK, the ordinary least squares analysis results might underestimate the negative correlations between <b>having</b> <b>more</b> <b>children</b> and women's labour force participation in a developing country such as Korea.

25|$|A loss of {{opportunity}} is {{another kind of}} loss that is represented in Albee’s play. Agnes has lost the opportunities of youth, of having another child. Agnes’s sister Claire has lost her opportunity at married life, having children, doing something with her life other than getting drunk. Julia, Agnes and Tobias’s daughter, has lost several marriages {{and the opportunity to}} have children. She has also lost her room, symbolic of having lost her childhood. Julia has also lost a brother, who died in his youth. This loss Agnes mourns as a loss of love. After the death of the child, Tobias and Agnes no longer attempted to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>children.</b> This eventually led to the loss of their sexual life together.|$|E
25|$|Polygynous marriages can be {{distinguished}} between sororal polygyny, in which the co-wives are sisters, and non-sororal, where the co-wives are not related. For men, the benefits of polygyny are that {{it allows them to}} <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>children,</b> may provide them with more productive workers (where workers are family), and allows them to establish politically useful ties with a greater number of kin groups. Senior wives can benefit as well when their work load is lightened by the addition of junior wives to the family. Wives', especially senior wives', status in the community can be increased by the addition of other wives, who add to the family's prosperity or are a sign of conspicuous consumption (much like a large house, domestic help, or expensive vacations would be in a western country). For such reasons, senior wives sometimes work hard or contribute from their own resources to enable their husbands to accumulate the bride price for a second wife.|$|E
25|$|The era saw the Demographic Transition {{take place}} in Germany. It was a {{transition}} from high birth rates and high death rates to low birth and death rates as the country developed from a pre-industrial to a modernized agriculture and supported a fast-growing industrialized urban economic system. In previous centuries, the shortage of land meant that not everyone could marry, and marriages took place after age 25. After 1815, increased agricultural productivity meant a larger food supply, {{and a decline in}} famines, epidemics, and malnutrition. This allowed couples to marry earlier, and <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>children.</b> Arranged marriages became uncommon as young people were now allowed to choose their own marriage partners, subject to a veto by the parents. The high birthrate was offset by a very high rate of infant mortality and emigration, especially after about 1840, mostly to the German settlements in the United States, plus periodic epidemics and harvest failures. The upper and middle classes began to practice birth control, and a little later so too did the peasants.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} of the German Confederation (excluding Austria) grew 60% from 1815 to 1865, from 21,000,000 to 34,000,000. The era saw the Demographic Transition take place in Germany.

Male promiscuity was likely advantageous because it allowed males to father more children.|$|E
