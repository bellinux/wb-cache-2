His tenacious style of fighting and <b>dedication</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nazi cause won him plaudits from Hitler, who considered him {{one of his best}} field commanders and repeatedly tasked him with retrieving desperate situations. However, their relationship had broken down {{by the end of the}} war after Model was defeated at the Battle of the Bulge. In April 1945, with the Third Reich's defeat imminent, Model committed suicide rather than be captured and stand trial for war crimes.|$|E

5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in <b>dedication</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Church. However, the Renaissance {{had a profound effect}} on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E
5|$|The {{opinion of}} historians {{is that the}} temple was built as a <b>dedication</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shaivite beliefs of Hinduism (from {{the large number of}} Shaivaite images seen on the lintels of the main temple and in other {{adjoining}} temples). But at some stage during the Middle Ages, there was a shift in the religious beliefs of the rulers and people adopted Vaishnavite beliefs of Hinduism as witnessed by the images of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita deified in the main sanctum sanctorum of the temple complex.|$|E
5|$|Vorazun {{had accused}} Zeratul of treasion against the Nerazim {{for his role}} in the death of her mother.

However, it is {{possible}} that these dedications are Anglian (Northumbrian) in origin, introduced by the monks of Dacre following the lead of Wilfrid, who adopted Saint Andrew as his patron saint.|$|R

5|$|Growing up {{primarily}} at Langley Field, Virginia, Olds virtually made daily {{contact with the}} small group of officers who would lead the US Army Air Forces in World War II (one neighbor was Major Carl Spaatz, destined to become the first Chief of Staff of the USAF), and as a result was imbued with an unusually strong <b>dedication</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> air service, and conversely, with a low tolerance for officers who did not exhibit the same. On November 10, 1925, his father appeared as a witness on behalf of Billy Mitchell during Mitchell's court-martial in Washington, D.C.. He brought three-year-old Robin with him to court, dressed in an Air Service uniform, and posed with him for newspaper photographers before testifying.|$|E
5|$|In March 1916 Mexican forces {{loyal to}} Pancho Villa crossed into New Mexico and raided the border town of Columbus. The {{violence}} in Columbus killed several Americans. In response, the U.S. launched the Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico. Chagrined {{to discover that}} his unit would not participate, Patton appealed to expedition commander John J. Pershing, and was named his personal aide for the expedition. This meant that Patton would have some role in organizing the effort, and his eagerness and <b>dedication</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> task impressed Pershing. Patton modeled much of his leadership style after Pershing, who favored strong, decisive actions and commanding from the front. As an aide, Patton oversaw the logistics of Pershing's transportation and acted as his personal courier.|$|E

5|$|Institute Professor is {{the highest}} title that can be awarded to {{a faculty member at}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a {{research}} university located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. It is analogous to the titles of distinguished professor, university professor, or regents professor used at other universities in recognition of a professor's extraordinary research achievements and <b>dedication</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school. At MIT, Institute Professors are granted a unique level of freedom and flexibility to pursue their research and teaching interests without regular departmental or school responsibilities; they report only to the provost. Usually no more than twelve professors hold this title at any one time. The position was created by President James R. Killian in 1951 and John C. Slater was the first to hold the position.|$|E
5|$|Leaving the building, Jeff finds all {{the pages}} in the {{envelope}} to be blank. He returns {{to the office of}} Dr. Duncan who tells him that he wanted to teach him a lesson although Jeff gets his car keys back. As he is about to leave campus, Jeff runs into Pierce and Troy, and shows his ability to make people feel better about themselves through advice and encouragement. The others join, and Jeff admits to being a fraud. He says that he does not have the test answers, and that he will probably flunk next day's test. The group has now taken a liking to him, and they invite him back in. The episode ends with a <b>dedication</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recently deceased John Hughes, whose film The Breakfast Club had been repeatedly referenced throughout the episode.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, 1973, Agnew {{appeared}} before the federal court in Baltimore, and pled no contest to one felony charge, tax evasion, for the year 1967. Richardson agreed {{that there would be}} no further prosecution of Agnew, and released a 40-page summary of the evidence. Agnew was fined $10,000 and placed on three years' unsupervised probation. At the same time, he submitted a formal letter of resignation to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in the best interest of the nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and uncertainty, and applauding Agnew for his patriotism and <b>dedication</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> welfare of the US. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford, who would be Agnew's successor as vice president (and Nixon's as president) recalled that he heard the news while on the House floor and his first reaction was disbelief, his second sadness.|$|E

These included use of printed catalogues supplied by firms like Aldus Manutius of Venice and Henri Estienne of Paris.|$|R
50|$|In East Anglia Rædwald's {{conversion}} was {{not universally}} acceptable to his household, nor by his wife. She and her pagan teachers probably {{persuaded him to}} default in part from his commitment to it. In his temple, therefore, there were two altars, one dedicated to Christ, and one for <b>dedications</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon gods. Raedwald is considered the most likely candidate for the Sutton Hoo ship burial, which displays both pagan and Christian iconography.|$|R
