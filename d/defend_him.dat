5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, the ACLU {{continued}} to steer a moderate course through the Cold War. When leftist singer Paul Robeson was denied a passport in 1950, {{even though he}} was not accused of any illegal acts, the ACLU chose to not <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b> The ACLU later reversed their stance, and supported William Worthy and Rockwell Kent in their passport confiscation cases, which resulted in legal victories in the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|After visiting Tiny's gym and {{intervening}} in a spar to <b>defend</b> <b>him,</b> Diana asks the trainers {{to let her}} box, too. She is told she can train there, but not compete in actual fights. When she learns that she cannot afford coaching from Tiny's trainer, Hector Soto, she asks her father for an allowance but he tells her to get a job. She resorts to stealing his money instead {{and returns to the}} gym, where Hector begins to teach her the basics of boxing.|$|E

5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b> The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E
5|$|Some Democrats {{remained}} unsatisfied {{with the}} outcome of the Music Hall Convention. After a period of silence, candidate William Stone publicly detailed the arrangement he believed he had with Goebel and how Goebel had broken it. Although Goebel's allies attempted to <b>defend</b> <b>him</b> against the charges, Stone's story was soon corroborated by former congressman W. C. Owens. Owens called on Democrats to vote for the Republican candidate, and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by Goebel could give him the governorship.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Sharp's brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, wrote Vindication of the Character of the Late Col. Solomon P. Sharp to <b>defend</b> <b>him</b> {{from the}} charges contained in Beauchamp's confession. In Vindication, Dr. Sharp portrayed the killing {{as a political}} assassination: he named Patrick Darby, a partisan of the Anti-Relief faction, as co-conspirator with Beauchamp, an Anti-Relief stalwart. Darby threatened to sue Sharp if he published his Vindication; and Waring threatened to kill him. Heeding these threats, Sharp did not publish his work; all extant manuscripts remained in his house, where they were discovered many years later during a remodeling.|$|E

5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in Bologna {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state to <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|The crowd roared in {{approval}} and Arab audiences were electrified. The assassination attempt backfired, quickly playing into Nasser's hands. Upon returning to Cairo, he ordered {{one of the}} largest political crackdowns in the modern history of Egypt, with the arrests of thousands of dissenters, mostly members of the Brotherhood, but also communists, and the dismissal of 140 officers loyal to Naguib. Eight Brotherhood leaders were sentenced to death, although the sentence of its chief ideologue, Sayyid Qutb, was commuted to a 15-year imprisonment. Naguib was removed from the presidency and put under house arrest, but was never tried or sentenced, and no one in the army rose to <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b> With his rivals neutralized, Nasser became the undisputed leader of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes to <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b> According to the directors, Kumar was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and {{they wanted him to}} underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive about such a bold character, due to the controversial theme of sexual harassment, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{was determined to}} give the soldiers a fair trial so {{there could be no}} grounds for retaliation from the British and so moderates would not be alienated from the Patriot cause. After several lawyers with Loyalist leanings refused to <b>defend</b> <b>him,</b> Preston sent a request to John Adams, pleading for him to work on the case. Adams, who was already a leading Patriot and who was contemplating a run for public office, agreed to help, in the interest of ensuring a fair trial. Adams was joined by Josiah Quincy II after the latter was assured that the Sons of Liberty would not oppose his appointment, and by Robert Auchmuty, a Loyalist. They were assisted by Sampson Salter Blowers, whose chief duty was to investigate the jury pool, and Paul Revere, who drew a detailed map of the bodies {{to be used in the}} trial of the British soldiers held responsible. Massachusetts Solicitor General Samuel Quincy and private attorney Robert Treat Paine, hired by the town of Boston, handled the prosecution. Preston was tried separately in late October 1770. He was acquitted after the jury was convinced that he had not ordered the troops to fire.|$|E

To further pacify Vander Ark's concerns, he added an addendum to the contract that stated that RDR Books would act to <b>defend</b> <b>him</b> in any future lawsuits.|$|E
25|$|Expelled {{from his}} Cluj University chair in 1945, Herseni managed to publish one more brochure, with Editura Clujana of Bucharest: Originile sociologiei ("The Origins of Sociology"). Arrested in 1951, he was tried {{for his role}} in the National Legionary administration, with Vianu showing up to <b>defend</b> <b>him</b> as a {{character}} witness. Sentenced, he did time in Jilava and Aiud, before being released in 1956. He received an interdiction to publish and was entirely marginalized in society, turning to ghostwriting for more politically suitable scholars.|$|E

Mos Def had reportedly recruited Kanye West to help <b>defend</b> <b>him,</b> and posted a message on West's website announcing his retirement from show business.

He was interviewed in hospital, where he denounced Foreign Minister Assef Ahmad Ali's claim that he had financed the explosives, detonation devices, and both vehicles used in the bombing. He stated that his work consisted solely of charitable work to provide food and schooling to Afghan orphans. Foregoing legal advice, he also refused to hire a lawyer to <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b> Suffering from a urinary tract infection due to weight loss, he claimed {{that he had been}} targeted simply because of his Egyptian background.|$|E
25|$|In late February, Gallinger {{was visiting}} {{his family in}} Port Colborne when he {{received}} a call to come to Toronto to be questioned concerning the Detroit gambler. On the train ride to Toronto, Gallinger made the decision he would deny everything to save his father the disgrace. In Toronto, {{the general manager of}} the Bruins, Art Ross, was questioning all the Boston players one-by-one. When it was his turn, Ross told Gallinger he knew he was involved, but Gallinger continued to insist on his innocence. Art Ross then personally approached Gallinger's father and proposed the idea of his son seeing a psychiatrist in Toronto. When his father told him of the idea, Gallinger refused. Years later, Gallinger stated that he regretted the decision as in retrospect he realized that Ross was {{looking for a way to}} <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upon being {{informed}} of the indictment, he urged his followers not to take any action {{if he was going}} to be sentenced to less than six months in prison, stressing that he wanted to give an example of dignity, but ordered a group of Legionaries to <b>defend</b> <b>him</b> in case of an attack by the authorities. He was arrested together with 44 other prominent members of the movement, including Ion Zelea Codreanu, Gheorghe Clime, Alexandru Cristian Tell, Radu Gyr, Nae Ionescu, Şerban Milcoveanu and Mihail Polihroniade, on the evening of April 16. The crackdown coincided with the Orthodox celebration of Palm Sunday (when all those targeted were known to be in their homes). After a short stay in the Romanian Police Prefecture, Codreanu was dispatched to Jilava prison, while the other prisoners were sent to Tismana Monastery (and later to concentration camps such as the one in Miercurea Ciuc).|$|E
