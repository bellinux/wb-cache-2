5|$|On 16 November 2010, {{five months}} after the Court of Inquiry was constituted, it {{submitted}} its report with input from the NTSB and Boeing, and stated that pilot error was the cause of the accident since the <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> was incorrect.|$|E
5|$|The {{intended}} <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> was a {{great circle}} route, which would have taken them across the English Channel, over the southwestern part of England and Ireland, across the Atlantic to Newfoundland, then south over Nova Scotia, to Boston, and finally to a water landing in New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has three}} autopilot modes. The standard mode for en-route navigation is LNAV, which navigates along a {{great circle route}} between waypoints, adjusting the aircraft's heading to compensate for wind. Other modes will maintain the aircraft's heading—direction the nose is pointed (<b>flight</b> <b>path</b> {{will be affected by}} winds)—or the aircraft's track—direction the aircraft travels (<b>flight</b> <b>path</b> in a straight direction). The latter two modes are further affected by whether the aircraft used magnetic (normal reference) or true north (typically only used at high latitudes) as the reference for the autopilot. Since Flight 370 flew near waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM, and possibly IGOGU—all along air route N571—while traversing the Malacca Strait, investigators considered whether Flight 370 followed any air routes or intersected any waypoints in the Southern Indian Ocean. Waypoints MUTMI and RUNUT were considered possible points that Flight 370 may have traversed, but tracks through these waypoints did not correlate well with paths generated from the BTO and BFO analysis.|$|E
40|$|The <b>flight</b> <b>paths</b> of {{arriving}} and departing aircraft {{at an airport}} are stochastically represented. Radar data of the aircraft movements are used to decompose the <b>flight</b> <b>paths</b> into linear and curvilinear segments. Variables which describe the segments are derived, and the best fitting probability distributions of the variables, based on a sample of <b>flight</b> <b>paths,</b> are found. Conversely, given information on the probability distribution of the variables, generation of {{a random sample of}} <b>flight</b> <b>paths</b> in a Monte Carlo simulation is discussed. Actual <b>flight</b> <b>paths</b> at Dulles International Airport are analyzed and simulated...|$|R

5|$|The {{first three}} lunar {{missions}} (Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 11) used a free return trajectory, keeping a <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> coplanar with the lunar orbit, {{which would allow}} a return to Earth in case the SM engine failed to make lunar orbit insertion. Landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated a lunar orbital plane change, which required a course change maneuver soon after TLI, and eliminated the free-return option.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 48, {{he learned}} to fly. Kesselring {{believed}} that first-hand knowledge of all aspects of aviation was crucial {{to being able to}} command airmen, although he was well aware that latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single and multi-engined aircraft and continued flying three or four days per week until March 1945. At times, his <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> took him over the concentration camps at Oranienburg, Dachau, and Buchenwald.|$|E
5|$|Civil Aeronautics Board {{investigators}} {{concluded that}} the outer portion of the wing had detached {{from the rest of}} the wing. The investigation revealed a fatigue crack 7/8inch long and 3/32inch deep at the point of detachment. Similar cracks were found on the wing root fittings of another Martin 2-0-2 aircraft that flew the same <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> through the same storm shortly after Flight 421. October inspections of three other Martin 2-0-2 aircraft revealed identical fatigue cracks in similar locations.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} EIS, (released on September 15, 2016) the flight plans were still unclear, with only long term 2050 (international expansion) <b>flight</b> <b>paths</b> outlined.

5|$|One of {{the changes}} made shortly after 9/11 was the colour scheme of the police cars; the {{original}} colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the New York City Police Department. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. Other changes include altering the <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> of a plane to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper, removing a mission referencing terrorists, {{as well as some}} changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{analyses}} {{called the}} original landing zone estimate into question: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> was significantly farther east than initially assumed. Additional {{data from a}} variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the Washougal River.|$|E
5|$|The {{communications}} between Flight 370 and the satellite communication network operated by Inmarsat, which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite, provide {{the only significant}} clues {{to the location of}} Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT. These communications have also been used to deduce possible in-flight events (see next section). The investigative team was challenged with reconstructing the <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> of Flight 370 from a limited set of transmissions with no explicit information about the aircraft's location, heading, or speed.|$|E
40|$|Noise is a {{big problem}} for people living near airports, {{therefore}} the public, airport authorities and pilots {{are looking for ways to}} reduce the noise in the vicinity of populated areas. Optimal solution would be <b>flight</b> <b>paths</b> that are farthest from those areas, and worst paths are those, that just go above them. There are two classes of paths, namely optimal and non-optimal ones. This paper is going to use one of successfully used data mining techniques, namely neural network, which is capable of recognizing patterns. We used some coordinates of various <b>flight</b> <b>paths</b> as input for learning purposes of Neural Network, and defined two classes representing the optimal and non-optimal <b>flight</b> <b>paths.</b> The results have shown that this technique is well capable of recognizing the optimal and non-optimal <b>flight</b> <b>paths.</b> This technique can be used to reduce the noise...|$|R

5|$|The {{crew of the}} Obsidian have {{temporarily}} {{abandoned the}} vessel {{in order to allow}} it to pass through a black hole. The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded, intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed through the black hole. A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its <b>flight</b> <b>path,</b> leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it will be destroyed. Only one member of the crew has the skills necessary to return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass through the black hole, this is the game's player character. The astronaut is forced to contend with the Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active. Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and reset the station's <b>flight</b> <b>path,</b> there is a limited time to teleport back to the smaller shielded craft before the Obsidian's engines carry the astronaut through the black hole without being shielded.|$|E
5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
5|$|It is {{one thing}} to say that a bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its <b>flight</b> <b>path.</b> It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{optimization}} is used {{to compute}} the optimum <b>flight</b> <b>paths,</b> based upon a parametric form that implicitly includes some of the problem restrictions. The other constraints are formulated as penalties in the cost function. Various aircraft on multiple trajectores (landing and takeoff) can be considered. The modular design employed allows for the substitution of alternate models of the population distribution, aircraft noise, <b>flight</b> <b>paths,</b> and annoyance, or for the addition of other features (e. g., fuel consumption) in the cost function. A reduction in the required amount of searching over local minima was achieved through use {{of the presence of}} statistical lateral dispersion in the <b>flight</b> <b>paths...</b>|$|R
5|$|SG 4′s {{mission was}} also a disaster. During the {{assembly}} phase, they flew across JG 11′s <b>flight</b> <b>path,</b> and the formation was broken up. Some of the pilots joined JG 11 in the confusion. Unable to recover the formation, I and II./SG 4 then decided to head home. The Kommodore, Druschel, had continued with five other pilots from III./SG 4 who had lost contact with their Gruppe. They crossed the front near Hürtgenwald around 09:10. As they did so, American anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, claiming seven aircraft in the next 30 minutes. Only six of the 50 Fw 190s of SG 4 carried out an attack, against airfields near Aachen and the Asch aerodrome. Of these six, four did not return. Druschel himself was reported missing.|$|E
5|$|The 9/11 Commission {{estimated}} that the flight was hijacked between 08:51 and 08:54, shortly after American Airlines Flight 11 struck the World Trade Center and not too long after United Airlines Flight 175 had been hijacked. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. Unlike the other three flights, there were no reports of anyone being stabbed or a bomb threat and the pilots were not immediately killed but shoved {{to the back of}} the plane with the rest of the passengers. At 08:54, the plane began to deviate from its normal, assigned <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> and turned south. Two minutes later at 08:56, the plane's transponder was switched off. The hijackers set the flight's autopilot on a course heading east towards Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Flight 370's disappearance, discussions {{concerning}} the analysis of satellite data began on the website of space scientist Duncan Steel. The informal group of people, most with scientific backgrounds, soon {{became known as the}} Independent Group (IG) and has worked to analyse possible flight paths to determine the most likely final location of Flight 370. For the first few months, their efforts were hindered by a lack of data publicly released and they were critical of the official analysis by Inmarsat; the IG also pressured officials to release data related to Flight 370's satellite communications. The IG did not believe there was sufficient evidence, using publicly available information, to exclude the possibility of Flight 370 following a northern track prior to the release of the communication logs on 27 May. Some of the IG members have worked on analysing specific elements of Flight 370's <b>flight</b> <b>path,</b> such as the mid-flight speed of Flight 370 and precise location of the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite.|$|E
5|$|Leonard {{arrived at}} Irish Helicopters on 31 October and was {{introduced}} to the pilot of the helicopter, Captain Thompson Boyes. Boyes was instructed to fly to a field in Stradbally, in order to pick up Leonard's photographic equipment. After landing Boyes saw two armed, masked men approaching the helicopter from nearby trees. Boyes was held at gunpoint and told he would not be harmed if he followed instructions. Leonard left with one gunman, while the other gunman climbed aboard the helicopter armed with a pistol and an Armalite rifle. Boyes was instructed to fly towards Dublin following the path of railway lines and the Royal Canal, and was ordered not to register his <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> with Air Traffic Control. As the helicopter approached Dublin, Boyes was informed of the escape plan and instructed to land in the exercise yard at Mountjoy Prison.|$|E
5|$|Motion {{camouflage}} is camouflage {{which provides}} a degree of concealment for a moving object, given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches their background or breaks up their outlines. The principal form of motion camouflage, and the type generally meant by the term, involves an attacker's mimicking the optic flow of the background as seen by its target. This enables the attacker to approach the target while appearing to remain stationary from the target's perspective, unlike in classical pursuit. The attacker chooses its <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> so as {{to remain on the}} line between the target and some landmark point. The target therefore does not see the attacker move from the landmark point. The only visible evidence that the attacker is moving is its looming, the change in size as the attacker approaches. Motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies, including swaying to mimic plant movements in the wind or ocean currents.|$|E
