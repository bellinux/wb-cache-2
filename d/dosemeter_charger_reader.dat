This research discovers that, from the point view of characters of free <b>charged</b> newspaper <b>readers</b> as Guangzhou Metro, it is mainly young instead of rich which is as the publisher claimed; And from the point view of the existence of the group structure, according to the relationship with traditional <b>charged</b> newspaper, <b>readers</b> could be divided into three groups: cumulative readers, substitutive readers, new readers. In these three groups, cumulative readers occupy the highest fraction, substitutive readers’ turn up, is not in a high rate, and mainly in partial replacement, new readers’ group supports the traditionally charged newspapers in an oblique way. This report shows that freely charged newspapers haven’t post a threat to the traditional charged newspaper, and have double effect of replacement and complementation, the latter effect being bigger than the former...|$|R

The purpose of this research was to assess the payment models for digital content in news organizations. A survey of 1, 100 daily newspaper publishers in the US [...] all members of the Newspaper Association of America (NAA) [...] was conducted in June 2010 to assess the status of policies for charging for digital news content across a variety of digital delivery platforms. The response rate of the U. S. survey was 10 percent.

The results revealed that the general polices in both countries were similar. Seventy percent of news organizations in the US and 80...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two chapters that focus on estimating {{the economic impact of}} two major pricing changes witnessed recently in the U. S. newspaper industry. The first chapter investigates the optimality of the decision adopted by print newspaper publishers to increase subscription prices notwithstanding a declining preference among readers for newspaper consumption. Further, it proposes and evaluates theoretical explanations for the increasing subscription price trajectory in this market. Of the three available subscription options in print (Daily, Weekend and Sunday only), subscription prices increased more steeply for the Daily option; {{this is consistent with the}} view that newspapers are driving away low valuation Daily option readers but not Sunday, as Sunday contributes higher ad revenues. As an extreme case of this strategy, several newspapers have adopted a policy change by limiting production/distribution of the newspaper only to weekends. A counterfactual simulation shows the implications of such a policy change and offers implications for effective newspaper product portfolio management. Second, over the last few years, another popular strategy among newspaper publishers operating online editions is the creation of paywalls (i. e., the practice of <b>charging</b> online <b>readers</b> a subscription fee for accessing news content). News publishers' objectives from setting up paywalls are believed to be threefold: a) creating a new revenue stream by monetizing online news content in the reader market, b) preserving the more lucrative print subscription revenues by discouraging print readers from switching to free online newspapers, and c) increasing the newspaper's ability to charge higher ad rates by promoting a subscription base of paying readers. It is unclear whether <b>charging</b> <b>readers</b> for online access will unambiguously serve all the expected objectives especially since the paywalls run the risk of leading to heavy attrition of readers and hence, advertisers. The second chapter employs readership and advertising data for the New York Times, a newspaper that has been cited in the media for its successful paywall execution, to investigate the effects of its paywall launch on online readership, print circulation and online advertising revenues...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} recession of 2008 {{and the growth}} of digital news content delivery has changed the revenue model in the newspaper industry. For example, some news publishers favor <b>charging</b> <b>readers</b> for online content, while others do not. Those who have already built pay walls and those who plan to build them in the near future can use several methods to do so. The purpose of this research was to assess the payment models for digital content in news organizations that publish a daily newspaper in the US. A survey of 1, 100 daily newspaper publishers in the US—all members of the Newspaper Association of America (NAA) —was conducted in June 2010 to assess the policies of charging for digital news content across a variety of digital delivery platforms. The response rate was 10 %. The results revealed that 70 % of the news organizations provided free access to news on their websites. However, 42 % of respondents indicated that they planned to change their payment model. Of those planning to change their payment model, 80 % (34 % of the total sample) said they would start charging for online, mobile, or electronic products. Regarding planned changes for the coming year, 21 % of respondents said they planned to increase the price for their mobile and online products, and 47 % of respondents said they planned to increase the price of their printed products...|$|R
