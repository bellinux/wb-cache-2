5|$|Beetle {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and chemical substances, {{but may also}} be used to physically feel a beetle's environment. Beetle <b>families</b> <b>may</b> use antennae in different ways. For example, when moving quickly, tiger beetles {{may not be able to}} see very well and instead hold their antennae rigidly in front of them in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Marks of cadency are {{generally}} not used with crests, {{though it is not}} incorrect to do so, and the British royal family continue this practice. It is, however, widely observed in England that no two <b>families</b> <b>may</b> use the same crest. This is in contrast to Scottish practice, in which crests are less significant, and are often borne in the same form by a great many unrelated people. As a result of this lack of need for differentiation, Scottish crests tend to be less ornamental than their English counterparts.|$|E
5|$|When {{speakers}} of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different <b>families</b> <b>may</b> converge {{to become more}} similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this {{may lead to the}} formation of language areas in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the Balkan language area, the Mesoamerican language area, and the Ethiopian language area. Also, larger areas such as South Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific areal features.|$|E

5|$|According to Williams, it is {{possible}} that after Sveinn defeated Ölvir and Frakökk, Ölvir may have fled to kinsmen of his in the Suðreyjar. Williams suggested that the blood feud between the <b>families</b> <b>may</b> be a reason for Sveinn's military activities in the Hebrides and the Isle of Mann, afterwards; although Sveinn had other interests in the area, since he is stated to have married the window of a Manx king. In the late 19th century, antiquary F.W.L. Thomas speculated that the memory of Ölvir may have been preserved in the Hebrides. Thomas stated that within the mythological history of the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis, the island clan of Macaulays were said to be the descendants of a man named Amhlaebh, {{who was one of the}} twelve sons, or near relations, of a man named Oliver, among whom Lewis was divided. This Oliver was said to have been the eldest son of the Norse king who was given the Isles and Highlands by a son of Kenneth MacAlpin, for his assistance in driving his own brother from Scotland. Thomas speculated that Oliver could represent Ölvir Rósta; meaning that he was the progenitor of the Macaulays.|$|E
5|$|However, Psittacosaurus may {{not have}} been entirely bipedal for its entire lifespan. Taking {{sections}} from the limb bones of 16 specimens of Psittacosaurus, ranging in age from less than a year old to ten-year old adults, Qi Zhao from the University of Bristol found that Psittacosaurus was probably secondarily bipedal. The infants' front limbs grew at faster rates than the hind limbs at between birth and three years of age. At the age of between four and six years, arm growth slowed and leg growth accelerated as the animal became mature. At this stage, Psittacosaurs would switch to a bipedal stance. These findings further reveal that the ancestor of Psittacosaurus was likely quadrupedal and eventually gained the ability to become bipedal as it evolved, with the young retaining the quadrupedal gait of the ancestor in question. These findings also lead to the hypothesis that many such dinosaur <b>families</b> <b>may</b> have evolved along this path {{at some point in their}} evolution.|$|E

25|$|Some {{communities}} or <b>families</b> <b>may</b> {{delay the}} celebration for reasons such as {{availability of a}} Shabbat during which no other celebration has been scheduled, or due to the desire to permit family {{to travel to the}} event.

25|$|According to Jewish law, the afikoman must be {{consumed}} before midnight, {{just as the}} Korban Pesach was eaten before midnight during {{the days of the}} Temple in Jerusalem.

5000|$|In {{biological}} classification, family (familia, plural [...] ) {{is one of}} {{the eight}} major taxonomic ranks; it is classified between order and genus. A <b>family</b> <b>may</b> be divided into subfamilies, which are intermediate ranks above the rank of genus. In vernacular usage, a <b>family</b> <b>may</b> be named after one of its common members; for example, walnuts and hickory trees belong to the family Juglandaceae, commonly known as the walnut family.|$|R

25|$|While some non-military <b>families</b> <b>may</b> {{share some}} of these same {{attributes}} and experiences, military culture has a much higher incidence and concentration of these issues and experiences in military families as compared to civilian populations, and by tightly-knit military communities that perceive these experiences as normal. Studies show that growing up immersed in military culture can have long-lasting effects on children, both in positive and also some negative ways.|$|E
25|$|In Finnish culture, nudism is {{considered}} to be a relatively normal way to live. It is not uncommon to see entire families spending time together naked. <b>Families</b> <b>may</b> be naked while bathing in a sauna, swimming in a pool, or playing on a beach, and it's not unusual to see children playing naked in a kindergarten or family yard for example. Nudity as a whole {{is considered}} less taboo than many other countries.|$|E
25|$|Johanna Nichols {{suggests}} that the northern <b>families</b> <b>may</b> be relatively recent arrivals from Maritime Southeast Asia, perhaps later replaced there by the spread of Austronesian. That could explain the typological difference between Pama–Nyungan and non-Pama–Nyungan languages, but not how a single family came to be so widespread. Evans {{suggests that}} the Pama–Nyungan family spread along with the now-dominant Aboriginal culture that includes the Australian Aboriginal kinship system. Dixon of course believes that the languages are not related, but merely a long-standing Sprachbund.|$|E

25|$|Living donor {{transplantation}} is {{a multidisciplinary}} approach. All living liver donors undergo medical evaluation. Every hospital which performs transplants has dedicated nurses that provide specific {{information about the}} procedure and answer questions that <b>families</b> <b>may</b> have. During the evaluation process, confidentiality is assured on the potential donor. Every effort is made to ensure that organ donation is not made by coercion from other family members. The transplant team provides both the donor and family thorough counseling and support which continues until full recovery is made.|$|E
25|$|The butsudan {{is passed}} from {{generation}} to generation, first son to first son and only those who have inherited the parental house and carried on the main line possess a butsudan. The butsudan serves as the family gathering place on special holidays, e.g., New Year's and Obon. Normally the butsudan receives offerings of incense, tea, water and cooked rice. During festivals the butsudan is lavishly adorned with offerings of pineapple, mango, apples, tangerines, exotic tropical fruits, sugar cane, and rice cakes. During these times, <b>families</b> <b>may</b> occasionally offer alcohol {{in the form of}} sake or awamori.|$|E
25|$|Canmore {{is a very}} {{difficult}} place to find affordable housing, and pet owners or <b>families</b> <b>may</b> have difficulty arranging accommodation. To alleviate the housing crunch, Canmore has pursued several affordable housing projects. In 2000, the Town of Canmore established the Canmore Community Housing Corporation (CCHC) to provide housing solutions for a healthy and balanced community. CCHC administers a Perpetually Affordable Housing (PAH) Program consisting of 41 ownership and 60 rental housing units at below-market purchase prices and rental rates. Mountain Haven Co-operative Homes Ltd. administers its own PAH development that provides 44 equity and non-equity (lease to own) units.|$|E
