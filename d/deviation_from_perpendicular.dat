Principally, it has been deduced that measurements performed at the nasal limbus tend to overestimate the angle width. Moreover, {{although the}} technique relies on the subjective assessment of the observed structures, {{it has been found}} that the results are not easily replicated and there was a high level of variability depending on the perception of the examiner. The technique also may be considered of inadequate scope, as it only provides an estimate of the anterior chamber angle (ACA) at the temporal limbus, in contrast with gonioscopy, which allows for a 360 degree view of the anterior chamber.

We show that under a field polarization which preserves certain symmetry elements of the molecule, the symmetry character of the initial wave function is conserved during its time-evolution.

However, a pilot study performed with individualized oblique-axial scans on supposedly rotated discs did not show disc rotation consistently. The aim of this study was the quantitative evaluation of disc rotation on a larger sample size, assessing the mediolateral disc geometry and position by the use of a reference system determined by the condylar long axis. METHODS: Eighty-five TMJs from 50 subjects were analyzed. One series of sagittal and 1 of 14 individualized oblique-axial magnetic resonance (MR) scans were taken for each joint. The dorsoventral disc position was diagnosed by means of the sagittal scans. The mediolateral disc width and position were then measured on every oblique-axial scan. The width and midline was computed for each disc and its <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> the <b>perpendicular</b> to the condylar long axis was calculated. Finally, a statistical analysis was performed to study whether the disc width and the direction of the disc midline varied between discs normally positioned and anteriorly displaced. RESULTS: The disc width varied significantly more within the anteriorly displaced discs than within the normal ones. The midline of the anteriorly displaced discs deviated more <b>from</b> the <b>perpendicular</b> to the condylar long axis than that of normally positioned discs and was mostly in a lateral direction. The disc midline also deviated more in the ventral than in the dorsal part of the disc. CONCLUSION: Most anteriorly displaced discs were laterally displaced and showed a larger width variation than normally positioned discs. This fact seems to indicate disc deformation...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional folding {{behavior}} of an elasto-viscous layer induced by transpression, and biaxial compression on the boundary is studied. The factors studied include the strain rate, elastic competency contrast, and viscous competency contrast. It {{was found that}} the influence of elastic competency contrast fades as the strain rate slows until finally folding behavior is completely controlled by viscous behavior. If biaxial compression is applied, induced folding along each principal stress direction is dependent. The resulting wavelength in any particular direction will not be affected by initial shortening applied in another direction. The final fold form is the supposition of fold forms in two individual directions. For transpression, the resulting fold axis may deviate <b>from</b> being <b>perpendicular</b> to the direction of boundary displacement. As the strain rate decreases, wavelength increases. The fold axis can be curved at slow strain rates. The directions of principal stress and the fold axis are nearly perpendicular to one another in most cases. However, for medium strain rates (˙ε = 10 - 13 ~ 10 - 14 sec- 1), the angle of <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> the mutual <b>perpendicular</b> direction may reach 20 degrees.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} experimental investigations {{related to}} the vortex dynamics in several high Tc superconductors. YIBa 2 Cu 307 - 6 (bulk granular, bulk textured, single crystals and thin films) and BSCCO (2223) (bulk) samples have been studied using dc and ac magnetization techniques {{to determine the effects}} of granularity, anisotropy, pinning strength and geometry. The samples have been characterized using electron microscopy, resistivity, ac susceptibility and dc magnetization measurements. The hysteresis in the ac susceptibility response has been compared for granular, melt textured Y BCO and BSCCO. We identify a crossover field HCO which identifies the boundary between inter and intra-granular response being dominant. The variation of HCO with ac field amplitude, frequency, temperature and field cooling effects corresponds to the behaviour expected from the variation of penetration depth ï¬². Differences in the hysteretic behaviour due to pinning are also identified. We have studied the suppression of the dc magnetization of melt textured and single crystal Y BCD sample in crossed ac and dc fields. Magnetization has been studied as a function of ac field amplitude, frequency, dc field sweep rate, time and orientation (hacII c,hac II ab - plane). We observe that the dc magnetization decreases linearly with ac amplitude but logarithmically with ac field frequency, in a swept field configuration. The rate of decrease (1 /M 0) (âˆ†M/âˆ†In f) is observed to be close to the flux creep rate and this variation has been explained quantitatively. Magnetization in crossed and uncrossed configuration obeys the logarithmic time variation in the long time domain. For short times, relaxation shows strong effects of frequency and relate the In f behavior and flux creep effects. These crossflux measurements confirm the homogenizing of the dc flux distribution due to the ac fields and the competing effect of the field sweep. The effects of thin film geometry on the critical state magnetization in crossed and uncrossed configurations have been studied for ultra thin Y BCO films in perpendicular geometry (H II c - axis). At high temperatures we obtained an asymmetric dc field sweep rate effect, with the moment being relatively unaffected by the sweep rate in the decreasing field branch. Relaxation measurements showed the same features, confirming that it is an artifact of asymmetric flux dynamics in ultra thin films, at high temperatures. <b>Deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>perpendicular</b> geometry reduce the effect of asymmetry. The dependence on temperature and orientation leads us to conclude that the asymmetry originates in the unique characteristics of the critical state for very thin films (T Â« A, where A is the penetration depth) in perpendicular applied fields and the effect of the field line curvature therein. We also report the effects of effectively crossed ac and dc fields on the dc magnetization of thin films in the perpendicular geometry. The data shows very strong suppression, indeed collapse of the hysteresis in small ac fields. The tanh (hac) dependence of the decrease has been explained quantitatively using the critical state model for ultra thin films...|$|R

Embryonic orientation of prolarvae is nonrandom; each embryo is oriented with its venter directed toward the ground. This orientation may facilitate aggregation of first instars.

This is the first recorded observation of this phenomenon in Pentatomoidea.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} a quantitative biomechanical evaluation method for contact forces exerted during a manual examination and treatment technique used in a learning environment. The evaluation was based on three-dimensional (3 D) force component data. METHODS: A hand-/palm-held computerized 3 D force component measuring system was used during a simple feedback experiment involving 20 second-year university students of physiotherapy who delivered 5 sets of graded perpendicular manual push forces on the sensor part of the system, which was placed on the padded surface of an examination/treatment table. In an effect study with a multiple time-series design, a randomly chosen subgroup of subjects received concurrent visual 3 D kinetic/dynamic force-time feedback. RESULTS: The students delivered graded perpendicular forces with good intrasubject consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient [3, 1]: mean, 0. 80; range, 0. 76 - 0. 88) but with poor intersubject consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient [2, 1]: mean, 0. 38; range, 0. 15 - 0. 74). A temporary performance improvement in forward-backward force direction <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> the <b>perpendicular</b> in the subgroup given feedback indicates that students are sensitive to feedback training. CONCLUSION: An evaluation tool using 3 D contact force component measurement enables the assessment of the overall magnitude of the manual contact force as well as its directional aspect. Compared with existing evaluations based on 1 -dimensional force components, this 3 D system allows for a more complete and, at the same time, more specific quantitative evaluation of the manual contact forces. Three-dimensional dynamic/kinetic augmented feedback has the additional potential of helping students and practitioners to improve their palpation and force delivery skills. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} and understand drift from field sprayers, a steady state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed. The model was developed in 3 D {{in order to increase}} the understanding of the causes of drift: a deviation in the wind direction cannot be captured by a 2 D approach, the wake behind a wind screen is not symmetrical, the effects of a changed nozzle orientation may not be symmetrical. The model's accuracy was validated with field experiments carried out according to the international standard ISO 22866. A field sprayer with a spray boom width of 27 in and 54 nozzles (Hardi ISO F 1 10 - 03 at 3 bar) was driving at 2. 22 m/s over a flat pasture. During the experiments the wind direction was perpendicular to the tractor track. The model explained the variation in drift replicates during each single field experiment through varying boom height (0. 3 - 0. 7 m), wind velocity (1. 3 - 2. 5 m/s), wind deviation (- 18 degrees to + 18 degrees) <b>from</b> the direction <b>perpendicular</b> to the tractor track and injection velocity of the droplets (17 - 27 m/s). Boom movements had the highest impact on the variations in drift values (deviations in drift deposits of 25 %), followed by variation in wind velocity (deviations in drift deposits of 3 %) and injection velocity of the droplets (deviations in drift deposits of 2. 5 %). Wind <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> the direction <b>perpendicular</b> to the tractor track had a reducing effect on the drift values (deviations in drift deposits of 2 %). Small variations in driving speed had little influence on drift values. Near drift (< 5 m) is predicted well by the model but the increased complexity compromised the predictions at greater distances. The model will be further developed in order to improve far drift prediction. Dynamic simulations will be performed and the model for turbulent dispersion will be optimized. The model did not require calibration. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
