The data available suggests that to reach maximum quality and productivity for brewing barley, <b>flat</b> <b>plowing</b> on Trifolium will allow farmers to reach 5 or more tons per hectare. Key words: brewing barley Malting barley Tillage Plowing Amylum Protein Yeast INTRODUCTION Soil tillage alone accounts for {{nearly half of the}} fuel Literature Review: In the Perm region podzolic soils have by optimal plow depths, number of tillage and the use of low reserves of natural organic matter and total nitrogen less energy-demanding techniques.

At insufficient application of organic and mineral Introduction of new tillage techniques (e. g. swivel fertilizers, {{as well as at the}} absence of legumes in the crop plow VN Plus LM 550 “Vogel and Noot”,) requires soi...|$|E

Classes were held {{for two and}} one-half years in local churches until the first academic building, later known as Old Central, was dedicated on June 15, 1894, on {{the southeast corner of}} campus, which at the time was <b>flat</b> <b>plowed</b> prairie. In 1896, Oklahoma A held its first commencement with six male graduates. The first Library was established in Old Central in one room shared with the English Department. [...] The first campus building to have electricity, Williams Hall, was constructed in 1900. With its turreted architecture it was referred to as the [...] "Castle of the Prairies"; It remained standing until 1969. One of the earliest campus buildings was also a barn, used as part of an agricultural experiment station, which was served by a large reservoir pond created in 1895. [...] The barn burned in 1922, but the pond, enlarged and remodeled in 1928 and 1943, is now known as Theta Pond, a popular campus scenic landmark. [...] In 1906, Morrill Hall was completed and became the principal building on campus. A fire gutted the building in 1914, but the outside structure survived intact, and the interior was reconstructed. The first dormitory for women was completed in 1911. It contained a kitchen, dining hall, some classrooms, and a women's gymnasium. [...] It is now the Bartlett Center for the Studio Arts and houses the Gardiner Art Gallery. By 1919 the campus included Morrill Hall, the Central Building, the Engineering Building (now Gundersen Hall), the Women's building, the Auditorium (replaced later by the Seretean Center for Performing Arts), the Armory-Gymnasium (now the Architecture Building) and the Power Plant.|$|R
