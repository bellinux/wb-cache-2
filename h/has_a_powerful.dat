5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> pen, {{and when}} he chooses can use expressive English. He evidently strives {{to be fair to}} friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he is much like many others in this respect. Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.|$|E
5|$|The beak is very distinctive. From {{the side}} the beak is broad and {{triangular}} but viewed from above it is narrow. The half nearest the tip is orange-red and the half nearest {{to the head}} is slate grey. There is a yellow chevron-shaped ridge separating the two parts and a yellow, fleshy strip {{at the base of}} the bill. At the joint of the two mandibles there is a yellow, wrinkled rosette. The exact proportions of the beak vary with the age of the bird. In an immature individual, the beak has reached its full length but it is not as broad as that of an adult. With time the bill deepens, the upper edge curves and a kink develops at its base. As the bird ages, one or more grooves may form on the red portion. The bird <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> bite.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} (Porphyrolaema porphyrolaema) is {{a species of}} bird in the cotinga family, Cotingidae. It {{is found in the}} western Amazon {{rainforest}} of South America; its range extends from southern Colombia south through eastern Ecuador and Peru and east through extreme northwestern Bolivia and into western Amazonian Brazil. It lives in the canopy or along the borders of humid forest throughout its range. The purple-throated cotinga is monotypic within the genus Porphyrolaema and has no known subspecies. It is one of the smaller cotinga species and expresses strong sexual dimorphism. Males have black upperparts with a bold white wingstripe and white edges to the tertial feathers and a white belly with some black barring on the rear flanks. The throat is a deep purple, giving the bird both its common and scientific names. Females are dark brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts, buffy cinnamon with black barring on the underparts, and rufous on the throat. The male <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> voice.|$|E

25|$|Despite having ruled {{over much}} of the ancient world, Cyrus the Great would design a tomb that depicts extreme {{simplicity}} and modesty when compared to those of other ancient kings and rulers. The simplicity of the structure <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> effect on the viewer, since aside from a few cyma moldings below the roof and a small rosette above its small entrance, there are no other stylistic distractions.|$|E
25|$|In medical research, DMSO {{is often}} used as a drug vehicle in in vivo and in vitro experiments. However, when a {{researcher}} is unaware of its pleiotropic effects, or when the control groups are not carefully planned, a bias can occur; an effect of DMSO can be falsely attributed to the drug. For example, even a very low dose of DMSO <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> protective effect against paracetamol (acetaminophen)-induced liver injury in mice.|$|E

These dogs were bred to hunt rabbits, and they are proficient at this task. These dogs need to be trained by owners who are consistent. They are affectionate and loving to those that care for them. Like all scent hounds they are happiest when on the trail of a good scent.|$|E
25|$|Whether or not aging {{directly}} affects women's sexual functioning during menopause {{is another}} area of controversy. However, many studies, including Hayes and Dennerstein's critical review, have demonstrated that aging <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> impact on sexual function and dysfunction in women, specifically {{in the areas of}} desire, sexual interest, and frequency of orgasm. In addition, Dennerstien and colleagues found that the primary predictor of sexual response throughout menopause is prior sexual functioning. This means {{that it is important to}} understand how the physiological changes in men and women can affect their sexual desire. Despite the seemingly negative impact that menopause can have on sexuality and sexual functioning, sexual confidence and well-being can improve with age and menopausal status. Furthermore, the impact that a relationship status can have on quality of life is often underestimated.|$|E

500|$|Before the game, {{the match}} was {{described}} by The New York Times as an [...] "important clash"; another source called it a [...] "tooth and toe nail event." [...] Georgia had the best line in the South, featuring four All-Southern players. No team scored through the Bulldogs' line all year. Georgia was in its second year under coach Herman Stegeman. Birmingham News sports editor [...] "Zipp" [...] Newman wrote weeks before the game, [...] "Stegeman <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> team {{and with all the}} regulars in the game, the team has a chance of going through the season undefeated unless it be Vanderbilt that stops her".|$|E

For many years, Holden & Fisher supplied custom-made toroidal transformers used in the amplifiers. The ones used in NAIT were rated 100 VA, but these have been progressively up-rated over the years, with consequent increases in power output: the entry-level [...] <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> 300 VA transformer for the delivery of 60 W of rated output.|$|E

[...] He weighs 155 pounds, is built low, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> pair of {{shoulders}} and his dashes are characterized by lightning speed." [...] Another pre-season account said he was [...] "a wonder as a line plunger and a wizard in the open field." [...] From the outset, considerable attention was paid to his unusual running style.

500|$|The Suffolk Punch {{tends to}} be shorter but more massively built than other British heavy draught breeds, such as the Clydesdale or the Shire, {{as a result of}} having been {{developed}} for agricultural work rather than road haulage.

[...] Legs are short and strong, with broad joints; sound, well-formed hooves; and little or no feathering on the fetlocks. [...] The movement of the Suffolk Punch is said to be energetic, especially at the trot. The breed tends to mature early, be long-lived, and is economical to keep, needing less feed than other horses of similar type and size. [...] They are hard workers, said to be willing to [...] "pull a heavily laden wagon till [...] dropped." ...|$|E
500|$|An elite athlete, Federer is an all-court, {{all-around}} player {{known for}} his speed, fluid style of play, and exceptional shot making. Federer mainly plays from the baseline but is also comfortable at the net, {{being one of the}} best volleyers in the game. He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful,</b> accurate smash and very effectively performs rare elements playing tennis, such as backhand smash and skyhook, half-volley and jump smash (slam dunk). David Foster Wallace compared the brute force of Federer's forehand motion with that of [...] "a great liquid whip", while John McEnroe has referred to Federer's forehand as [...] "the greatest shot in our sport." [...] Federer is also {{known for his}} efficient movement around the court and excellent footwork, which enables him to run around shots directed to his backhand and instead hit a powerful inside-out or inside-in forehand, one of his best shots.|$|E
500|$|As in most Westminster system parliaments, Australia's {{government}} is {{formed by the}} party enjoying {{the confidence of the}} lower House of Parliament, the House of Representatives. However, Australia's Parliament also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> upper house, the Senate, which must pass any legislation initiated by the House of Representatives if it is to become law. The composition of the Senate, in which each state has an equal number of senators regardless of that state's population, was originally designed to attract the Australian colonies into one Federation. The Constitution forbids the Senate to originate or amend a money bill, but places no limitation on the Senate's ability to defeat one. In 1970, Gough Whitlam, as Leader of the Opposition, had stated of a budget bill, [...] "Let me make it clear at the outset that our opposition to this Budget is no mere formality. We intend to press our opposition by all available means on all related measures in both Houses. If the motion is defeated, we will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate. Our purpose is to destroy this Budget and destroy the Government which has sponsored it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2004, {{she played}} the lead role of army wife Sandra Williams in Hum Kaun Hai?, a supernatural thriller. The film opened to a mixed {{critical}} reception, but Kapadia's performance received positive comments. Subhash K. Jha noted that she [...] "carries the film beyond where {{it would have been}} otherwise"; Rama Sharma of The Tribune wrote of her performance, [...] "Dimple lends all her charisma to help the script sail through dead ends. Whether she is scared or scolding children, she <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> presence." [...] 2005 saw Kapadia and Rishi Kapoor reunite as a lead couple for the third time after Bobby (1973) and Saagar (1985) in Pyaar Mein Twist. They starred as two middle-aged single parents who fall in love and later {{have to deal with the}} reaction of their children. The film generated mostly negative reviews, with several critics concurring that the chemistry between the lead pair is what makes the film watchable. In a two-star review, Khalid Mohamed called Kapadia [...] "a dream actress", but ultimately concluded, [...] "See this twisteroo if you must, only for the undiminished Kapoor-Kapadia chemistry." [...] Few people went to see the film; within two weeks it was declared a flop.|$|E

[...] MTV News wrote that [...] "Daddy" [...] {{is different from the}} other relationship songs on Dangerously in Love, and added that it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> message. By contrast, Allison Stewart of The Washington Post and Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times both called [...] "Daddy" [...] a [...] "creepy bonus track". Similarly, Spence D., writing for IGN Music stated that [...] "Daddy" [...] is not really worth uncovering, as it follows suit in terms of being [...] "a by-the-books contempo R rendition", and he commented that [...] "there is something oddly eerie about an attractive woman such as Beyoncé crooning the words 'I want my husband to be like my Daddy.'" [...] Mike Wass of the website Idolator called the song one of the [...] "duds" [...] on the album and added that it was a [...] "best forgotten ode to the superstar's father complete with stomach-churning lyrics like 'I want my husband to be like my daddy'". In 2014, Louis Virtel of the website HitFix reviewed the song negatively, calling it the worst on Dangerously in Love and describing its lyrics as [...] "seriously simplistic".
