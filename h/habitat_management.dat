5|$|Red deer have a stronghold on the moor {{and can be}} seen on quiet hillsides {{in remote}} areas, {{particularly}} in the early morning. The Emperor of Exmoor, a red stag (Cervus elaphus), was Britain's largest known wild land animal, until it was killed in October 2010. The moorland habitat is also home to hundreds of species of birds and insects. Birds seen on the moor include merlin, peregrine falcon, Eurasian curlew, European stonechat, dipper, Dartford warbler and ring ouzel. Black grouse and red grouse are now extinct on Exmoor, probably {{as a result of a}} reduction in <b>habitat</b> <b>management,</b> and for the former species, an increase in visitor pressure.|$|E

5|$|There {{is a kind}} of {{continuum}} {{with three}} semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression (backcrossing with one of the parent species), and hybrid swarms (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species).

Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within wildlife management and <b>habitat</b> <b>management.</b> Global climate change is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.|$|E
