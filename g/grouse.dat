5|$|The {{only part}} of the region that is {{predominantly}} given over to crops is the land around the Humber estuary, where the well-drained fens result in excellent quality land. The lowland Cheshire Plain is mostly given over to dairy farming, while in the Pennines and Cheviots grazing sheep play an important role not just in agriculture but also in land management more generally. Heather moorland in the Pennine uplands is home to driven <b>grouse</b> shooting from 12 August (the Glorious Twelfth) until 10 December every year. In the twentieth century, numbers of red <b>grouse</b> and black <b>grouse</b> in the area fell significantly, but improved gamekeeping practices have resulted in both species making a comeback in the region.|$|E
5|$|Hunting is {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the understory. The most common game species are ruffed <b>grouse,</b> eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. However, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the animals}} in the spruce-fir forest have ranges that extend into the balsam fir forest higher up. Warblers are abundant; more than ten species exist in this forest type. Other common birds include brown-capped chickadees, spruce <b>grouse,</b> and yellow-capped woodpeckers. Mammals include the red {{squirrel}} and the pine marten.|$|E

5|$|Public {{recreation}} {{activities include}} canoeing, birdwatching, and fishing.

Northern hardwood trees and ruffed <b>grouse</b> live in the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|Red deer have a stronghold on the moor {{and can be}} seen on quiet hillsides {{in remote}} areas, {{particularly}} in the early morning. The Emperor of Exmoor, a red stag (Cervus elaphus), was Britain's largest known wild land animal, until it was killed in October 2010. The moorland habitat is also home to hundreds of species of birds and insects. Birds seen on the moor include merlin, peregrine falcon, Eurasian curlew, European stonechat, dipper, Dartford warbler and ring ouzel. Black <b>grouse</b> and red <b>grouse</b> are now extinct on Exmoor, probably {{as a result of a}} reduction in habitat management, and for the former species, an increase in visitor pressure.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: to reveal the main population-ecological peculiarities of the <b>grouses</b> birds and to decode the ways of {{adaptation}} of species on this base under the conditions of Karelia. The main population-ecological peculiarities of the <b>grouses</b> birds have been revealed, and on this base the ways of adaptation of the species have been decoded under the Karelia conditions. The ecology of the <b>grouses</b> birds in Karelia has been studied; the methods of the nature use as for its number have been developed; the perspectives of the economy use and protection have been determinedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
50|$|The mires - {{that cover}} {{more than half}} of the park's area - are {{inhabited}} by black <b>grouses,</b> common cranes, whooper swans, wood sandpipers and northern willow <b>grouses.</b> The old-growth forests house hole nesters such as Eurasian pygmy owls, Ural owls, three-toed woodpeckers, red-breasted flycatchers and the Siberian flying squirrel.

5|$|The Phasianidae is {{a family}} of birds which {{consists}} of pheasants, partridges, <b>grouse,</b> turkeys, and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} polyphenism in willow <b>grouse</b> differs between Scottish and Scandinavian populations. In Scotland, <b>grouse</b> {{have two}} plumages (breeding and non-breeding), while in Scandinavia {{there is a}} third plumage, a white winter morph. The genetic basis for this is not in the melanin pigment system, and is probably due to regulatory changes. The behaviour of moulting females in springtime depends on their plumage state: they tend to sit on snow while they are mainly white, but choose the border between bare ground and snow when they have more dark feathers. They seem to be choosing the best compromise between camouflage and food quality.|$|E

5|$|The {{tinamous}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} ancient groups of bird.
