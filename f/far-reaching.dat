5|$|This {{fact is the}} {{beginning}} of Grothendieck's Galois theory, a <b>far-reaching</b> extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.|$|E
5|$|Historians Hitchcock and Downs {{emphasized}} the <b>far-reaching</b> {{effects of the}} ongoing depression, inflation, rapidly increasing commodity prices, and mass unemployment, {{as well as the}} failure of the strikers to appreciate that these conditions affected the employer as well as the employee.|$|E
5|$|Italy now {{effectively}} {{became an}} occupied country, as the Germans poured in troops. Italy's decision to switch sides created {{contempt for the}} Italians among both the Allies and Germans, which was to have <b>far-reaching</b> consequences.|$|E
5|$|A <b>far-reaching</b> {{generalization}} of addition of natural numbers is {{the addition of}} ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers in set theory. These give two different generalizations of addition of natural numbers to the transfinite. Unlike most addition operations, addition of ordinal numbers is not commutative. Addition of cardinal numbers, however, is a commutative operation {{closely related to the}} disjoint union operation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. His novels {{captured}} {{the ebb and flow of}} society, and he demonstrated the <b>far-reaching</b> impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 6th century AD Calakmul was {{assembling}} a <b>far-reaching</b> political alliance, activity that brought the city into conflict with the great city of Tikal. The influence of Calakmul extended deep into the Petén; king Tuun K'ab' Hix of Calakmul oversaw the enthronement of Aj Wosal to the rulership of Naranjo in 546. Another vassal of Tuun K'ab' Hix was taken captive by Yaxchilan {{on the banks of the}} Usumacinta River in 537.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral malaria {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{neurological}} disabilities in African children. Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have <b>far-reaching</b> socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi regime {{began to}} persecute Jews {{soon after the}} seizure of power. Hess's office was partly {{responsible}} for drafting Hitler's Nuremberg Laws of 1935, laws that had <b>far-reaching</b> implications for the Jews of Germany, banning marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans and depriving non-Aryans of their German citizenship. Hess's friend Karl Haushofer {{and his family were}} subject to these laws, as Haushofer had married a half-Jewish woman, so Hess issued documents exempting them from this legislation.|$|E
5|$|The flag {{consists}} of a gold torch that represents liberty and enlightenment; the rays around the torch represent their <b>far-reaching</b> influence. The nineteen stars represent Indiana's place as the nineteenth state to join the United States. The thirteen stars in the outer loop symbolize the original Thirteen Colonies, the five inner stars represent the next five states added to the Union, and the one large star above the torch represents Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{victory in}} the 2006 Gator Bowl had <b>far-reaching</b> effects for both the Hokies and the Louisville Cardinals. The win pushed Tech to 11–2 on the season, while the Cardinals' loss ensured they ended the 2005 season with a 9–3 overall record. The game itself {{provided}} more than $14million in economic benefit to the Jacksonville area as Louisville and Virginia Tech fans flocked to the region, spending money on food, hotel rooms, transportation, and entertainment.|$|E
5|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his position}} in 1240, Haakon focused on displaying the supremacy of the kingship, influenced by the increasingly closer contact with European culture. He started constructing several monumental royal buildings, primarily in the royal estate in Bergen where he built a European-style stone palace. He used a grand fleet with stately royal ships when meeting with other Scandinavian rulers, and actively sent letters and gifts to other European rulers; his most <b>far-reaching</b> contact was achieved when he sent gyrfalcons with an embassy to the Sultan of Tunis.|$|E
5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III, and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in <b>far-reaching</b> places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin.|$|E
5|$|Ap Bac had <b>far-reaching</b> {{consequences}} for the South Vietnamese government and the American involvement in Vietnam. The battle was a milestone for the Viet Cong. For individual Viet Cong soldiers, the battle demonstrated they could defeat nominally superior ARVN forces, well equipped as they were with up-to-date military hardware and significant support and funding from the United States. Militarily, the morale and confidence of Viet Cong commanders and soldiers, who had experienced serious setbacks in the previous year, were greatly boosted. Politically, the Viet Cong 261st and 514th Battalions were able to exploit the prestige gained from having inflicted disproportionate losses on the ARVN forces to exercise greater influence in their areas of operations.|$|E
5|$|As {{attachment}} theory {{offers a}} broad, <b>far-reaching</b> {{view of human}} functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within relational psychoanalysis and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns. In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and couple and family therapy. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy and emotionally focused therapy.|$|E
5|$|Countless {{results in}} number theory invoke the {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers, so the above choices have <b>far-reaching</b> consequences. For example, {{the fact that}} positive numbers have unique factorizations means that one can determine whether a number has an even or odd number of distinct prime factors. Since 1 is not prime, nor does it have prime factors, it {{is a product of}} 0 distinct primes; since 0 is an even number, 1 has an even number of distinct prime factors. This implies that the Möbius function takes the value , which is necessary for it to be a multiplicative function and for the Möbius inversion formula to work.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} {{perceived the}} threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the more radical Puritans though, who were pushing for <b>far-reaching</b> reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 Nuttin {{published}} his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 {{with the help}} of Hilde Sas. Because of the <b>far-reaching</b> implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying affective and cognitive processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Issued {{nine years}} after Harrison's death, the limited-edition release coincided with {{celebrations}} for Shankar's 90th birthday and was overseen by Harrison's widow, Olivia. Among the lavish packaging for the compilation, each disc appears inside enlarged, 8½-inch sleeves, and each {{copy of the}} set is individually numbered. An accompanying book contains a foreword by American composer Philip Glass, rare photographs documenting Shankar and Harrison's 35-year friendship, and commentary from both artists on the projects featured in the box set. While Collaborations presents {{only a portion of}} Shankar and Harrison's work together, music critics have recognised it as a successful representation of the <b>far-reaching</b> cultural legacy of their partnership.|$|E
5|$|Kansas' {{victory in}} the 2008 Orange Bowl had <b>far-reaching</b> effects for both Virginia Tech and Kansas as well as college {{football}} teams around the country. The victory allowed Kansas to finish its 2007 season with a final record of 121, while the loss brought Virginia Tech to a final record of 113. The game itself provided {{tens of millions of}} dollars of economic impact for the South Florida region, which attracted tens of thousands of visitors from both Virginia and Kansas. In Kansas, bars and liquor stores benefited from the game, as Jayhawks' fans stocked up on food and alcohol for the game.|$|E
5|$|Plutarch's {{account of}} the revolt {{suggests}} that the slaves simply wished to escape to freedom, and leave Roman territory by way of Cisalpine Gaul. Appian and Florus describe the revolt as a civil war, in which the slaves intended to capture the city of Rome itself. The Third Servile War had significant and <b>far-reaching</b> effects on Rome's broader history. Pompey and Crassus exploited their successes to further their political careers, using their public acclaim and the implied threat of their legions to sway the consular elections of 70 BC in their favor. Their subsequent actions as Consuls greatly furthered the subversion of Roman political institutions {{and contributed to the}} eventual transition of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The HIV {{pandemic}} {{has challenged}} communities and brought about social changes throughout the world. Opinions on sexuality are more openly discussed. Advice on sexual practices and drug use– which were once taboo– {{is sponsored by}} many governments and their healthcare providers. Debates on the ethics of provision and cost of anti-retroviral drugs, particularly in poorer countries, have highlighted inequalities in healthcare and stimulated <b>far-reaching</b> legislative changes. In developing countries the impact of HIV/AIDS has been profound; key organisations such as healthcare, defense and civil services have been severely disrupted. Life expectancy has fallen. In Zimbabwe, for example, life expectancy was 79 years in 1991 but by 2001 it had fallen to 39 years.|$|E
5|$|The Millennium Group is {{a fictional}} secret society {{featured}} in the crime thriller television series Millennium. Having begun life as a Christian sect {{at the end of}} the 1st century AD, the Group grew into a <b>far-reaching</b> network which, as the 3rd millennium approached, presented itself as a private investigative firm liaising with law enforcement organizations. Despite being fraught with internal schisms, the Group tried on several occasions to artificially instigate the end of the world as the year 2000 approached.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of OPEC marked {{a turning point}} toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play {{a prominent role in}} the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and OPEC's revenue and wealth, with long-lasting and <b>far-reaching</b> consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations; and generally when the production targets are reduced, oil prices increase, most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.|$|E
5|$|These {{ecological}} systems are always changing due to environmental factors. Geographic {{features such as}} the Western Flatwoods, Eastern Flatwoods, and the Atlantic Coastal Ridge affect drainage patterns. Geologic elements, climate, {{and the frequency of}} storms and fire are formative processes for the Everglades. They help to sustain and transform the ecosystems in the Shark River Valley, Big Cypress Swamp, coastal areas and mangrove forests. Ecosystems have been described as both fragile and resilient. Minor fluctuations in water levels have <b>far-reaching</b> consequences for many plant and animal species, and the system cycles and pulses with each change.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{victory in}} the ACC Championship Game had <b>far-reaching</b> {{sporting}} consequences for the 20072008 college football bowl season {{and in the future}} site of the ACC Championship Game. The 2007game injected approximately $10million into the Jacksonville economy. Thousands of hotel rooms were filled by fans traveling to the game, and the impact they created was larger than that of the previous year's game, which featured teams that had shorter distances to travel and whose fans had generated less demand for overnight accommodation. Despite the fact that fans spent more in 2007 than at any previous ACC Championship Game, poor ticket sales at the box office necessitated a move.|$|E
5|$|Working {{with his}} new partner Emma Hollis (Klea Scott), Black finds himself {{struggling}} to combat the <b>far-reaching</b> influence of the Millennium Group. Due to {{the workings of the}} Group, Black is framed for the death of a fellow agent, prompting his resignation from the FBI and fleeing Washington D.C. with Jordan; likewise, Hollis is convinced to abandon Black and work with the Group. Several months later, Black is able to work with FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to foil a last-ditch effort by the Group to bring {{about the end of the}} world; vindicated, he reunites with Jordan after the case.|$|E
5|$|After {{striking}} Tulagi, Yorktown rejoined with Lexington, {{and the two}} carriers {{engaged the}} rest of the Japanese forces involved in the Mo operation from 6–8 May in the Battle of the Coral Sea. In the battle, Lexington was sunk and Yorktown was damaged. The Japanese suffered Shōhō sunk, a fleet carrier heavily damaged, and heavy losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Fearing more damaging attacks from Allied land-based aircraft or warships and unable because of their aircraft losses to provide adequate air cover for their naval surface forces, the Japanese turned back from their planned assault on Port Moresby with the intention of trying again later. The next Japanese seaborne attempt to take Port Moresby, however, never happened, mainly because of their navy's defeat in June at the Battle of Midway. Instead, the Japanese decided to try to take Port Moresby in an ultimately unsuccessful overland attack along the Kokoda Track. The failure to take Port Moresby in May 1942 would have significant and <b>far-reaching</b> strategic implications, many of which involved the small Japanese naval base at Tulagi.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple—the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500years. While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the <b>far-reaching</b> effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.|$|E
5|$|After the uprising, Poland {{repressed}} Lithuanian {{cultural life}} in Sejny. Lithuanian schools in Sejny (which had some 300 pupils) and surrounding villages were closed. The local Lithuanian clergy were evicted, and the Sejny Priest Seminary relocated. According to Lithuanians, the repressions {{were even more}} <b>far-reaching,</b> including a ban on public use of the Lithuanian language and the closing of Lithuanian organizations, which had a total of 1,300 members. The New York Times, reporting on renewed hostilities a year later, described the 1919 Sejny events as a violent occupation by the Poles, in which the Lithuanian inhabitants, teachers, and religious ministers were maltreated and expelled. Polish historian Łossowski notes that both sides mistreated the civilian population and exaggerated reports to gain internal and foreign support.|$|E
5|$|By December 15, {{newspapers}} had attributed 286 deaths to the blizzard, including 54 in New York, 51 in New Jersey (later {{confirmed as}} 52), 26 in Pennsylvania, and 71 in the New England states. Fatalities {{related to the}} storm and associated cold snap were <b>far-reaching,</b> involving 23 states. A wide variety of factors contributed to the high death toll, including over-exertion, exposure to cold, transportation accidents, structural fires, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The storm caused some isolated power failures along its path. In north-central Virginia, telephone and electricity lines were damaged. The blizzard cut electricity to all of Newtown, Connecticut, though it was mostly restored within hours. In Rhode Island, Block Island and some inland towns were without power. Short-lived power outages affected southern New Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|Charles' abdication had <b>far-reaching</b> {{consequences}} in imperial {{diplomatic relations with}} France and the Netherlands, particularly in his allotment of the Spanish kingdom to Philip. In France, the kings and their ministers grew increasingly uneasy about Habsburg encirclement and sought allies against Habsburg hegemony from among the border German territories; they were even prepared to ally {{with some of the}} Protestant kings. In the Netherlands, Philip's ascension in Spain raised particular problems; for the sake of harmony, order, and prosperity, Charles had not oppressed the Reformation as harshly there as did Philip, and Charles had even had tolerated a high level of local autonomy. An ardent Catholic and rigidly autocratic prince, Philip pursued an aggressive political, economic and religious policy toward the Dutch, resulting in their rebellion shortly after he became king. Philip's militant response meant the occupation of much of the upper provinces by troops of, or hired by, Habsburg Spain and the constant ebb and flow of Spanish men and provisions over the Spanish road from northern Italy, through the Burgundian lands, into and from Flanders.|$|E
5|$|Crass {{have said}} that their musical {{influences}} were seldom drawn from rock, but more from classical music (particularly Benjamin Britten, on whose work, Rimbaud states, some of Crass' riffs are based), free jazz, European atonality and avant-garde composers such as John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Crass influenced the anarchist movement in the UK, the US and beyond. The growth of anarcho-punk spurred interest in anarchist ideas. The band have also claimed credit for revitalising the peace movement and the UK Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Others contend that they overestimated their influence, their radicalising effect on militants notwithstanding. Crass' philosophical and aesthetic influences on 1980s punk bands were <b>far-reaching,</b> although few mimicked their later free-form style (heard on Yes Sir, I Will and their final recording, Ten Notes on a Summer's Day). Their painted and collage black-and-white record sleeves (by Gee Vaucher) may have influenced later artists such as Banksy (with whom Vaucher collaborated) and the subvertising movement. Anti-folk artist Jeffrey Lewis's 2007 album, 12 Crass Songs, features acoustic covers of Crass material.|$|E
5|$|In early 1804, {{following}} a massacre of Serb chieftains by renegade Ottoman janissaries known as Dahis, the Serbs of the Pashalik rebelled. Karađorđe was unanimously elected {{to lead the}} uprising against the Dahis at an assembly of surviving chiefs in February 1804. Within six months, most of the Dahi leaders had been captured and executed by Karađorđe's forces, and by 1805, the final remnants of Dahi resistance had been crushed. Karađorđe and his followers now demanded <b>far-reaching</b> autonomy, a move which Sultan Selim interpreted as but the first step towards complete independence. Selim promptly declared jihad against the rebels and ordered an army to march into the Pashalik. The Ottomans suffered a string of defeats {{at the hands of}} Karađorđe's forces. By 1806, the rebels had captured all the major towns in the Pashalik, including Belgrade and Smederevo, and expelled their Muslim inhabitants. Burdened by the demands of the Russo-Ottoman War of 1806–1812, Selim offered to grant the Serbs extensive autonomy but Karađorđe refused in light of Russia's avowal to provide extensive aid to the rebels should they continue fighting.|$|E
5|$|Many viruses can be {{synthesised}} de novo ("from scratch") and {{the first}} synthetic virus was created in 2002. Although somewhat of a misconception, {{it is not the}} actual virus that is synthesised, but rather its DNA genome (in case of a DNA virus), or a cDNA copy of its genome (in case of RNA viruses). For many virus families the naked synthetic DNA or RNA (once enzymatically converted back from the synthetic cDNA) is infectious when introduced into a cell. That is, they contain all the necessary information to produce new viruses. This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies. The ability to synthesise viruses has <b>far-reaching</b> consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are available. , the full-length genome sequences of 3843 different viruses, including smallpox, are publicly available in an online database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.|$|E
5|$|Much of Havelock's {{work was}} devoted to {{addressing}} a single thesis: that all of Western thought is informed by a profound shift {{in the kinds of}} ideas available to the human mind at the point that Greek philosophy converted from an oral to a literate form. The idea has been very controversial in classical studies, and has been rejected outright both by many of Havelock's contemporaries and modern classicists. Havelock and his ideas have nonetheless had <b>far-reaching</b> influence, both in classical studies and other academic areas. He and Walter J. Ong (who was himself strongly influenced by Havelock) essentially founded the field that studies transitions from orality to literacy, and Havelock {{has been one of the}} most frequently cited theorists in that field; as an account of communication, his work profoundly affected the media theories of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan. Havelock's influence has spread beyond the study of the classical world to that of analogous transitions in other times and places.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{conflict}} was the ancient distrust, rivalry, and hostility between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the House of Habsburg, which {{had risen to}} the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor since 1438. Since the late 13th century, {{the members of the}} Swiss Confederacy had gradually taken control of territories that once had belonged to the Habsburg realm. The Swiss had attained the status of imperial immediacy, being subject only to the emperor himself, and not to any intermediate Princes or liege lords. This status granted them a <b>far-reaching</b> autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire, even more so as the emperor was a distant overlord. Before 1438, the empire and the emperor had been an antipole to the Habsburg dukes for the Swiss. Previous emperors had repeatedly supported the confederates in their struggles against the Habsburgs, whom they saw as strong rivals. They had confirmed the Imperial immediacy of the Swiss on several occasions; and the Swiss had succeeded in defending their privileged status against Habsburg dukes who had tried to regain their former territories.|$|E
