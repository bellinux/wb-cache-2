5|$|Newton (test plate) {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats {{at different stages of}} completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses <b>gently</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E
25|$|When {{feeding on}} flowers, this {{butterfly}} is unhurried, often spending {{a long time}} sitting on the same flower. When sitting it either spreads its wings or closes them over its back the hindwings covering the forewings to a large extent. Sometimes the butterfly will not sit, but rest <b>gently</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flower while feeding, while doing this, to maintain balance, it beats only its forewings while keeping the hindwings completely steady.|$|E
500|$|The novels leave {{open the}} nature and extent of Widmerpool's sexuality, an aspect on which critics have often speculated. Stephen McGregor of the Spectator {{describes}} him as [...] "impotent"; another commentator used the words [...] "sexual incompetent". At school he gets Akworth a fellow-pupil, expelled for sending a presumably compromising note to Peter Templer; afterwards, Jenkins and Stringham discuss Templer's belief that Widmerpool was motivated by sexual jealousy. A few years later, Jenkins recalls how Widmerpool recoiled when touched <b>gently</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arm by Berthe, a French girl encountered during the pair's summer sojourn at La Grenadi√®re, shortly after leaving school.|$|E

6000|$|There {{is sweet}} music here that softer falls [...] Than petals from blown roses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, [...] Or night-dews on still waters between walls [...] Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass; [...] Music that <b>gentlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spirit lies, [...] Than tir'd eyelids upon tir'd eyes; [...] Music that brings sweet sleep {{down from the}} blissful skies.
