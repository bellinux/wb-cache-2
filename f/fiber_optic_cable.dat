The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) opened a radar in 1996, followed by Svalbard Satellite Station in 1999 and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in 2008.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, a {{broadband}} utility {{seeking to}} lay <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cable</b> paid {{the town to}} pass through the former corridor. The town used part of its payment to pave the route and open it as a public rail trail in 1997. The creation of the trail was supported by a local Rotary club, which built a pavilion along the trail. The pavilion includes a donated antique caboose. While the trail originally ended at Route44–55, it was extended eastward between 2009 and 2010, intersecting Route9W and continuing to the Poughkeepsie Bridge. The extension was paid for by stimulus funding.|$|E

25|$|In September2011, the OPERA {{collaboration}} released calculations showing velocities of 17GeV and 28GeV neutrinos {{exceeding the}} speed of light in their experiments (see Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly). In November2011, OPERA repeated its experiment with changes so that the speed could be determined individually for each detected neutrino. The results showed the same faster-than-light speed. However, in February2012, reports came out that the results may have been caused by a loose <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cable</b> attached to one of the atomic clocks which measured the departure and arrival times of the neutrinos. An independent recreation of the experiment in the same laboratory by ICARUS found no discernible difference between {{the speed of}} a neutrino and {{the speed of light}}.|$|E

25|$|Since 1998, {{microband}} Asynchronous Transfer Mode {{technology has}} been used along the North–South Railway line to send television signals; 64 kbit/s transmission lines are leased from the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Corporation (VPTC).

25|$|On September 22, 2011, a {{preprint}} {{from the}} OPERA Collaboration indicated detection of 17 and 28 GeV muon neutrinos, sent 730 kilometers (454 miles) from CERN near Geneva, Switzerland to the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, traveling faster than light by a relative amount of 2.48×10−5 (approximately 1 in 40,000), a statistic with 6.0-sigma significance. On 17 November 2011, a second follow-up experiment by OPERA scientists confirmed their initial results. However, scientists were {{skeptical about the}} results of these experiments, the significance of which was disputed. In March 2012, the ICARUS collaboration failed to reproduce the OPERA results with their equipment, detecting neutrino travel time from CERN to the Gran Sasso National Laboratory indistinguishable from the speed of light. Later the OPERA team reported two flaws in their equipment set-up that had caused errors far outside their original confidence interval: a <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cable</b> attached improperly, which caused the apparently faster-than-light measurements, and a clock oscillator ticking too fast.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, {{scientists}} from the University of Hawaiʻi installed an ocean bottom observatory (OBO) on the summit of Lōʻihi Seamount.

40|$|Means {{have been}} {{developed}} for enabling <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cables</b> of the Laser Induced Breakdown Spectrometer instrument to survive ground operations plus the nominal 670 Martian conditions that include Martian summer and winter seasons. The purpose of this development was to validate the use of the rover external <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cabling</b> of ChemCam for space applications under the extreme thermal environments to be encountered during the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. Flight-representative <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cables</b> were subjected to extreme temperature thermal cycling of the same diurnal depth (or delta T) as expected in flight, but for three times the expected number of in-flight thermal cycles. The survivability of <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cables</b> was tested for 600 cumulative thermal cycles from - 130 to + 15 C to cover the winter season, and another 1, 410 cumulative cycles from - 105 to + 40 C to cover the summer season. This test satisfies the required 3 times the design margin that is a total of 2, 010 thermal cycles (670 x 3). This development test included functional optical transmission tests {{during the course of the}} test. Transmission of the <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cables</b> was performed prior to and after 1, 288 thermal cycles and 2, 010 thermal cycles.
