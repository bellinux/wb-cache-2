On high ground above the harbour, he built a wooden church consecrated to the Holy Trinity {{as well as a}} royal {{residence}} nearby. Although no traces of these buildings have been discovered, in 1997 archaeologists found the remains of Viking ships in the Isefjord, the oldest of which is dated to 1030. At the time, there were also two churches in the area: St Jørgensbjerg, an early stone church, and a wooden church discovered under today's St Ib's Church.

5|$|After {{securing}} {{additional financing}} from Eurimages and ARTE, Tarr used these and the Hungarian funds to undertake nine days of shooting on sets <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>built</b> {{at a cost}} of €2 million. The French funding was cross-financed for the shoot by T. T. Filmműhely. As funds were frozen however, the Corsican subcontractor Tanit Films (controlled by the film's then-executive producer Jean-Patrick Costantini), terminated their contract with Balsan and through legal action compelled the production to dismantle the sets and leave the shooting location. At that point, Ognon Pictures shut the production down and disassociated themselves from the film, and Tarr withdrew to Hungary to regroup.|$|E

5|$|Méliès's film studio, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>built</b> in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in 1897, was a greenhouse-like {{building}} with glass {{walls and a}} glass ceiling to let in as much sunlight as possible, a concept used by most still photography studios from the 1860s onward; it was built with the same dimensions as Méliès's own Théâtre Robert-Houdin (13.5×6.6m). Throughout his film career, Méliès worked on a strict schedule of planning films in the morning, filming scenes during the brightest hours of the day, tending to the film laboratory and the Théâtre Robert-Houdin in the late afternoon, and attending performances at Parisian theaters in the evening.|$|E

5|$|The {{trade was}} started by the New England {{businessman}} Frederic Tudor in 1806. Tudor shipped ice to the Caribbean island of Martinique, hoping {{to sell it to}} wealthy members of the European elite there, using an ice house <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>built</b> specially for the purpose. Over the coming years the trade widened to Cuba and Southern United States, with other merchants joining Tudor in harvesting and shipping ice from New England. During the 1830s and 1840s the ice trade expanded further, with shipments reaching England, India, South America, China and Australia. Tudor made a fortune from the Indian trade, while brand names such as Wenham Ice became famous in London.|$|E
5|$|After an {{earthquake}} in 1853, the reliquary enclosing {{an image of}} Nuestra Señora del Carmen (Our Lady of Mount Carmel), originally situated at the Mount Carmel chapel, {{was moved to the}} Santa María de la Cabeza castle, where Santos Berrizbeitia built a new chapel in 1912 to protect the image; it was later moved to St. Agnes Church. The ditch was filled in for construction of the Mount Carmel chapel and the deteriorated parapets were demolished. The original slopes and terraces present on Diaz Fajardo's 1737 map were probably also buried in the process. The chapel in the castle was the final resting place for Berrizbeitia; his remains, originally interred at Holy Trinity Cemetery (which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>built),</b> were exhumed and moved five years after his death.|$|E
