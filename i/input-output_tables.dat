With the input-output table, one can estimate the change in demand for inputs resulting from a change in production of the final good. The analysis assumes that input proportions are fixed; thus the use of input-output analysis is limited to rough approximations rather than prediction. Input-output was novel and inspired large-scale empirical work; in 2010 its iterative method was recognized as an early intellectual precursor to Google's PageRank.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{attempts}} to estimate a regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> for Selangor for 2000. Then, the regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> {{is used to}} analyse the production structures in Selangor. Design/Methodology/Approach – The regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> for Selangor is estimated by applying the RAS technique. Accordingly, under the homogeneity assumption of production structures and technologies between Selangor and Malaysia, the structure of Selangor’s inter-industry is estimated based {{on the structure of}} national inter-industry transactions. Findings – Results showed that Selangor has modest production structure and highly dependent on imports and exports. The inter-industry linkages analysis indicated that manufacturing, mining and quarrying, and government service sectors are the key sectors in Selangor, where these sectors have potential to stimulate growth in the economy. Originality/Value – This paper is a pioneer study {{for the construction of a}} regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> for Malaysia, especially for Selangor, by using a partial survey approach. For the purpose of planning, the regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> is an important economic tool because it compiles the whole demand and supply of production sectors in an economy.

However, due to limitations of data, such techniques have never been applied to China's regional economies. Fortunately, in 2003, China's Interregional <b>Input-Output</b> <b>Table</b> for 1987 and Multi-regional <b>Input-Output</b> <b>Table</b> for 1997 were published, making decomposition analysis of China's regional economies possible. This paper first estimates the interregional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> in constant price by using an alternative approach: the Grid-Search method, and then applies the standard input-output decomposition technique to China's regional economies for 1987 - 97. Based on the decomposition results, the contributions to output growth of different factors are summarized at the regional and industrial level. Furthermore, interdependence between China's regional economies is measured and explained by aggregating the decomposition factors into the intraregional multiplier-related effect, the feedback-related effect, and the spillover-related effect. Finally, the performance of China's industrial and regional development policies implemented in the 1990 s is briefly discussed based on the analytical results of the paper.

40|$|This {{is a basic}} {{introduction}} to the input-output analysis, which was founded by Vassilii Leontiev in the 1930 es. This explanation is based upon O’Connor and Henry (1975). 2 The <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> The general structure of an <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> {{is shown in figure}} 1. An <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> is divided into four quadrants: Intermediate demand Quadrant I represents flows of products, which are both pro-duced and consumed in the process of production of goods. These flows are called inter-industry flows or intermediate demand. Final demand Quadrant II contains data of final demand for the output of each pro-ducing industry, i. e. demand of non-industry consumers like households, gov-ernment or exports. Final demand is the demand for goods, which are not used to produce other goods (as opposed to intermediate demand). Primary inputs to industries These are inputs (e. g. raw materials) to producing in-dustries, which are not produced by any industry like imported raw materials. Primary inputs to direct consumption These are inputs (e. g. imported electricity), which are directly consumed, i. e. they are not used to produce other goods.

50|$|An {{industry}} value-chain is {{a physical}} representation of the various processes involved in producing goods (and services), starting with raw materials and ending with the delivered product (also known as the supply chain). It {{is based on the}} notion of value-added at the link (read: stage of production) level. The sum total of link-level value-added yields total value. The French Physiocrats' Tableau économique is one of the earliest examples of a value chain. Wasilly Leontief's <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables,</b> published in the 1950s, provide estimates of the relative importance of each individual link in industry-level value-chains for the U.S. economy.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{aggregate}} measures in the national accounts, notably including gross domestic product or GDP, perhaps the most widely cited measure of aggregate economic activity. Ways of breaking down GDP include as types of income (wages, profits, etc.) or expenditure (consumption, investment/saving, etc.). Measures of these are examples of macro-economic data. Such aggregate measures and their change over time are generally of strongest interest to economic policymakers, although the detailed national accounts contain a source of information for economic analysis, for example in the <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> which show how industries interact with each other in the production process.|$|E
5000|$|The matrix [...] {{integrates}} {{material flow}} data into input-output analysis. It {{allows us to}} allocate economy-wide material requirements to specific industries. With {{the help of the}} coefficients contained in the Leontief inverse , the material requirements can be allocated to domestic or foreign (exports) final demand. In order to consider variations in production structures across different economies or regions, national <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> are combined to form so-called multi-regional input-output (MRIO) models. In these models, the sum total of resources allocated to final consumption equals the sum total of resources extracted, as recorded in the material flow accounts for each of the regions.|$|E

This study introduces the first version of the UK waste <b>input–output</b> <b>table</b> {{that could be used to}} quantify both direct and indirect waste arisings across the supply chain. The proposed waste <b>input–output</b> <b>table</b> features 21 industrial sectors and 34 waste types and is for the 2010 time-period.

Results also reveal that the construction, mining and quarrying sectors have the highest waste generation rates, 742 and 694 tonne per £ 1 m of final demand, respectively. Owing to the aggregated format of the first version of the waste input–output, the model does not address the relationship between waste generation and recycling activities. Therefore, an updated version of the waste <b>input–output</b> <b>table</b> is expected be developed considering this issue.
