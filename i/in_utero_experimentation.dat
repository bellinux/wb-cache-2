40|$|Outcomes of Zika virus (ZIKV) {{infection}} in pregnant women vary from {{the birth of}} asymptomatic offspring to abnormal development and severe brain lesions in fetuses and infants. There are concerns that offspring affected <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> and born without apparent symptoms may develop mental illnesses. Therefore, animal models are important to test interventions against <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> infection and health sequelae in symptomatic and likely more widespread asymptomatic offspring. To partially reproduce <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> infection <b>in</b> humans, we directly inoculated selected porcine conceptuses with ZIKV. Inoculation resulted in rapid trans-fetal infections, persistent {{infection in}} conceptuses, molecular pathology in fetal brains, fetal antibody and type I interferon responses. Offspring infected <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> showed ZIKV <b>in</b> their fetal membranes collected after birth.

However, {{in order to establish}} <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> DTI as a clinical imaging tool, an independent comparison between macroscopic imaging and microscopic histology data in the same subject is needed. The present study aimed to cross-validate normal as well as abnormal <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> tractography results of commissural and internal capsule fibers in human fetal brains using postmortem histological structure tensor (ST) analysis. <b>In</b> <b>utero</b> tractography findings from two structurally unremarkable and five abnormal fetal brains were compared to the results of postmortem ST analysis applied to digitalized whole hemisphere sections of the same subjects. An approach to perform ST-based deterministic tractography in histological sections was implemented to overcome limitations <b>in</b> correlating <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> tractography to postmortem histology data. ST analysis and histology-based tractography of fetal brain sections enabled the direct assessment of the anisotropic organization and main fiber orientation of fetal telencephalic layers on a micro- and macroscopic scale, and validated <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> tractography results of corpus callosum and internal capsule fiber tracts. Cross-validation of abnormal <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> tractography results could be achieved in four subjects with agenesis of the corpus callosum and in two cases with malformations of internal capsule fibers. In addition, potential limitations of current DTI-based <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> tractography could be demonstrated in several brain regions. Combining the three-dimensional nature of DTI-based <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> tractography with the microscopic resolution provided by histological ST analysis may ultimately facilitate a more complete morphologic characterization of axon guidance disorders at prenatal stages of human brain development...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Transfer {{of genes}} <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> via the amniotic fluid was shown {{previously}} with recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV) {{to be highly}} efficient. Expression for over one year was demonstrated using reporter genes. In addition, it was shown previously that transgenes delivered by this method release protein into the general circulation. Given these results experiments were designed {{to test the hypothesis}} that <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> rAAV gene therapy could result in long term physiologic modification. Methods A rAAV recombinant expressing ciliary neurotrophic factor (cntf) and green fluorescent (gfp) in a polycistronic messenger was used to treat rat fetuses <b>in</b> <b>utero.</b> CNTF causes weight loss and decreased water consumption as a measurable physiologic effect. GFP was used as a marker of gene expression. Results <b>In</b> <b>utero</b> gene transfer with rAAV carrying human cntf and gfp resulted in long-term gene expression in rat. CNTF-specific physiologic effects of a decrease in weight and water intake were obtained. Expression of the GFP was documented in the treated animals at one year of age. Conclusion Given this data, <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> gene therapy with rAAV into multipotential stem cells resulted in long term systemic physiologic modification of the treated animals by the transgene product. <b>In</b> <b>utero</b> rAAV gene therapy potentially could be used for gene replacement therapy in metabolic disorders. </p...|$|R
