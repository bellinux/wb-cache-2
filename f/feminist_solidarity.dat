500|$|Manning's {{books are}} not easily {{classified}} {{as a part of}} the feminist canon. While Manning supported the rights of women, particularly equal literary fees, she had no sympathy for the Women's Movement, writing that [...] "hey make such an exhibition of themselves. None can be said to be beauties. Most have faces like porridge." [...] In Manning's books, the word [...] "feminine" [...] is used in a derogatory sense, and tends to be associated with female complacency, foolishness, artifice and deviousness, and fulfilment for women comes in fairly conventional roles of wife, mother and the private domain. Elizabeth Bowen remarked that Manning had [...] "an almost masculine outfit in the way of experience" [...] that influenced her writing about women and the war. Manning viewed herself not as a female writer, but as a writer who happened to be a woman, and early in her career she obscured her gender using a pseudonym and initials. Manning found it easier to create male characters, and in general her novels tend to minimise differences in gender, writing about people rather than women in particular. Harriet Pringle, for example, moves through processes of self-discovery and empowerment as an individual rather than in <b>feminist</b> <b>solidarity</b> with her sex. In Manning's The Doves of Venus (1960), based on Manning's friendship with Stevie Smith, female characters display [...] "the 1950s anger more often associated... with young men." [...] Treglown comments on how Manning's early books generally took a forthright approach to sex, often initiated by female characters. Her approach became more nuanced in later volumes, with a subtler depiction of sex, sensuality and sexual frustration in Fortunes of War. The Jungian critic Richard Sugg interpreted Manning's female characters as punishing themselves for breaching society's gender norms, including for having erotic feelings. In contrast, Treglown hypothesised that it reflected Manning's ongoing grieving for her stillborn child.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the ways}} in which the fields of gender studies, feminist theory and {{politics}} have grown and developed in Bosnia and Herzegovina over the last decade are largely unaccounted for in feminist scholarship, their lessons, insights and potentials are relevant for scholarship and politics that weaves through the traumatic knots of postcoloniality and biopolitics. This article looks at the politics of witnessing through a creative approach to losses and the potential politics of hope in such a context. It engages with several lines of inquiry through a dialogue of `local'/`global' feminist and postcolonial theory and practice, through subaltern lenses of transnational <b>feminist</b> <b>solidarities</b> and informed by the lessons of non-institutional public spaces of thinking, judging and acting as instances of vernacular cosmopolitanism in the field of cultural production within Bosnia. Continuously re-emerging postcolonial/biopolitical fractures, induced by the global/local political economy of capital and violence, also produce political (cultural/artistic/public) practices of witnessing which shake and reshuffle our quests for social and political transformation. Embracing them effectively is one of the most important lessons of Bosnian (postcolonial, post-war, post-communist...) ambivalences and forbearances. Such hopeful political navigation through injustices and injuries inflicted by global/local regimes of biopolitics and capital is fundamentally about reinvigorating the scholarship and politics of gender, witnessing, postcoloniality and trauma along creative feminist trajectories...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} question: What does Aztlán sound like? Informed by decolonialfeminist theory and sound studies concepts, I consider listening {{as a new}} praxis with which toremember complex narratives of belonging and citizenship against the assimilating force ofnational forms and political limits. This interdisciplinary research engages the idea of Aztlán, themythical homeland of the Nahuas, and the imagined solidarity it mobilized in 1960 s activism asa Chicana feminist concept {{with a history of}} generative interventions that challenge itsnationalist logic. Taking up the contested notion of Aztlán as historically marginalizing towomen and la joteria, I use a method of listening to “tune in” to multiple, heterogeneous, andalternate histories of Chicana/o belonging in the musical and literary soundscapes of GreaterMexico. This work explores the diverse audible markers of race, gender, sexuality, citizenshipand migration that circulate in the Chicana/o musical, literary, performance and new mediaobjects I examine. I argue that through the soundscape, Aztlán becomes a plural concept. “Sounding Aztlán” is organized as four linked discussions that test the portability of sound as anew interpretive method and epistemology for Chicana/o Studies, sound studies, and decolonialfeminism: Ch. 1, “Tuning In to Coalition: Listening to This Bridge Called My Back,” revisitsthe foundational feminist text, This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women ofColor. I think of Bridge as an artifact of coalition, a multiplicity of radical voices embodied inits very form. Just as the act of writing for women of color is connected to life, the stakes ofbeing heard are high. I claim that there is an aural dimension to Bridge beyond the textual thathas to do with perceptions of the sound and noise women of color make. Practicing a decolonialfeminist "listening," this chapter engages Bridge anew as a soundscape of coalition. Ch. 2,“Decolonial Feminist Soundscapes in Post 1980 s Chicana Literature,” and Ch. 3, “Soundtracks,Chicana Butches, and East L. A. : Verónica Reyes’s Chopper! Chopper! Poetry from BorderedLives and Raquel Gutiérrez’s The Barber of East L. A. ” posit that literature is noisy and thereforecalls for the reader to listen as a new mode of interpretation. The soundscapes in Chicana/o 2 narratives have not been fully engaged in prior readings of the poetry, fiction, and drama bySandra Cisneros, Luis Alfaro, Estella Gonzalez, Raquel Gutiérrez, and Verónica Reyes. I arguethat literature becomes a site for hearing creative sonics of subjectivity, coalition, and queerness. Against the dominant imaginary of Aztlán, <b>feminist</b> <b>solidarities,</b> decolonial <b>feminist</b> poetics,butch/femme histories, alternative music scenes, and East Los Angeles become audible in thesepost 80 s literary Chicana representations. Ch. 4, “Performing América On The National Stage,”examines a repertoire of three Chicana/o performances of “The Star Spangled Banner” bycontemporary pop/rock, mariachi, and banda musicians. I take Jimi Hendrix’s iconic 1969 performance at Woodstock as a jumping off point to explore how dissonant moments betweenthe visual and aural performance of nation captured on social media provide openings formultiple interpretations of citizenship. When the national anthem becomes part of the Chicana/orepertoire, what map of the Americas is sounded through these Chicano performances of thenational anthem? These performances highlight meaningful disruptions, tensions, resistances,and variations on the theme of América...|$|R

Here I reflect on the complicities and potentialities of two Toronto-based arts interventions: Dig In and the Dirty Plotz cabaret. I analyse an example of community based arts strategy that strived to ‘revitalise’ one disinvested Toronto neighbourhood. I also reflect on my experience performing drag king urban planner, Toby Sharp. Reflecting on these examples, I show how market-oriented arts policies entangle women artists in the cultivation of spaces of depoliticised feminism, homonormativity and white privilege. However, I also demonstrate how women artists are playfully and performatively pushing back at hegemonic regimes with the radical aesthetic praxis of cabaret. I maintain that bringing critical feminist arts spaces and cabaret practice into discussions about neoliberal urban policies uncovers sites of <b>feminist</b> resistance and <b>solidarity,</b> interventions that challenge violent processes of colonisation and privatisation on multiple fronts...|$|R

40|$|An {{articulation}} {{of any kind}} of global understanding of belonging, or ways of cosmopolitan life, requires a constant engagement with vulnerability, especially {{in a world that is}} so deeply wounded by subjugation, colonialisms and genocides. And yet discussion of the body, affect and corporeal politics from the margins are noticeably absent from contemporary liberal and Kantian models of cosmopolitan thought. This book explores the ways in which existing narratives of cosmopolitanism are often organised around European and American discourses of human rights and universalism, which allow little room for the {{articulation of}} an affective, embodied and subaltern politics. It brings contemporary understandings of cosmopolitan solidarities into dialogue with the body, affect and the persistent spectre of colonial difference. Race, ethnicity, sexuality and gender are all extremely important to these articulations of cosmopolitan belongings, and we cannot really speak of communities without speaking of embodiment and emotion. This text envisions new ways of articulating and conceptualising ‘corporeal cosmopolitanism’ which are neither restricted to a purely postcolonial paradigm, nor subjugated by European colonialism and modernity. It challenges the understanding of liberal cosmopolitan solidarities using decolonial, and <b>feminist</b> performances of <b>solidarity</b> as radical compassion, resistance, and love...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{traces the}} relationship between the cultural formations of 1980 s U. S. imperialism and the ascendance of neoliberal capitalism. Analyzing government documents, popular and literary fiction, movement memoirs and photography, and popular music, the dissertation argues that neoliberal discourses, logics, and affects were articulated by state and university representations of U. S. imperialism, {{as well as by the}} <b>feminist</b> and <b>solidarity</b> movement cultures that attempted to oppose the United States' overt and covert interventions in the Middle East, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The dissertation demonstrates how the university, the military, and the state reconfigured the materialist, anti-imperialist, and anti-racist imperatives of 1960 s and 1970 s movement cultural formations into fantasies of neoliberal recognition and tools for the production of neoliberal entrepreneurial subjectivities. But it also tracks how representations of U. S. imperialism provided resources for U. S. subjects to adjust affectively to new neoliberal dislocations and temporalities. Chapter 1 contends that sex radical memoirs by Kate Millet, Joan Nestle, Cherríe Moraga, and Samuel Delaney offered a vision of sexual solidarity politics that reinforced neoliberal arguments favoring economic privatization and apolitical citizenship. Chapters 2 and 3 show how these movement visions of desire and intimacy extended to the Caribbean and Central America, abetting U. S. imperialist violence and neoliberal economic transformations. I argue that Paule Marshall and Audre Lorde's cultural feminist attempts to reclaim a lost Caribbean heritage helped lay the affective groundwork for Grenada's neoliberalization, then examine how Central America solidarity movement culture, including fiction and photography by Barbara Kingsolver and Susan Meiselas, similarly naturalized neoliberal logics of privacy and intimacy. The second half of the dissertation turns to literary and popular culture, demonstrating how images and sounds of U. S. imperialism registered and soothed anxieties over new neoliberal economic conditions. Chapter 4 asserts that creative writing program fiction by Robert Olen Butler, Tobias Wolff, and Lorrie Moore mobilized the figure of the Vietnam veteran to offer readers a model for managing the volatility of post-Fordist capitalism. Chapter 5 contends that the pop/rock love-gone-wrong songs that scored the U. S. invasion of Panama offered a new genre of explanation for U. S. imperialism in the neoliberal age. 2018 - 04 - 04 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R

This study analyses the relationship between three central and intertwined episodes: the censorship of the book “The New Portuguese Letters” – written by Maria Isabel Barreno, Maria Teresa Horta and Maria Velho da Costa – the three authors’ trial and acquittance and the international <b>feminist</b> movement of <b>solidarity.</b> These events contributed for the birth of The MLM – Women’s Liberation Movement.

40|$|In west European countries, public {{debates on}} migration, integration, and {{diversity}} are informed by particular understandings of secularism and the secular society. In our increasingly diverse societies, {{so the story}} goes, it is needed to implement {{a certain type of}} secularism and/or support particular types of secular standpoints in order to maintain a certain status quo that guarantees security, democracy, and equality for all. Religion is often perceived and simultaneously constructed in opposition to the emancipation and equal rights of women. This dominant logic, in which secularism and religion are opposites, makes it difficult for women of diverse religious – cultural backgrounds to cooperate on an equal footing for a shared feminist cause. However, feminist politics and practices that cross religious – secular divides can and do take place. Feminist research has so far paid little attention to the actualities of this feminist border-crossing and the transformations it may engender in our current sociopolitical context. In this article, I aim to offer a consideration of <b>feminist</b> politics and <b>solidarity</b> crossing religious – secular divides in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking northern region of Belgium.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1970 s, Angela Davis visited Egypt, a trip {{she wrote about}} in her book Women, Culture, and Politics. This article uses Davis’s trip as a lens through which to {{approach}} the question of transnational <b>feminist</b> <b>solidarity</b> {{through the eyes of}} multiple generations of Egyptian feminists. It argues that the particular conditions in Egypt in the 1950 s through to 1970 s allowed for new international forms of solidarity focused on material conditions. This enabled Egyptian feminists to forge solidarity with women across the globe, Angela Davis included, who located gender oppression within the same structures, namely capitalism and imperialism. This type of solidarity was made possible by the particular political and economic context of the 1950 s– 1970 s, which differed radically from the eras preceding and following it, as well as the analysis that came out of this context, including a strong focus on capitalism and imperialism. Indeed the decline of this type of analysis can be located in the changes that occurred in Egypt in the 1970 s and 1980 s—following the shift to an open-market economy—that led to a decline in material analysis. This shift has had major effects on the ways in which Egyptian feminists imagined and put into practice forms of transnational <b>feminist</b> <b>solidarity.</b> By looking at Davis’s encounter with Egyptian feminists, this article demonstrates how practices that were built on a material analysis of gender allowed for solidarity to be created by making differences productive rather than merely divisive. ...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explore how}} the folk-rock music of Ani DiFranco has {{influenced}} the activist commitments, sensibilities, {{and activities of}} reproductive rights activists. My interest in the relation of popular music to social movements is informed {{by the work of}} Simon Frith (1987, 1996 a, 1996 b), Rob Rosenthal (2001), and Ann Savage (2003). Frith argues that popular music is an important contributor to personal identity and the ways that listeners see the world. Savage (2003) writes that fans develop a unique relationship with feminist/political music, and Rosenthal (2001) argues that popular music can be an important factor in building social movements. I use these arguments to ask what the influence of Ani DiFranco's music has been for reproductive rights activists who are her fans. I conducted in-depth interviews with ten reproductive rights activists who are fans of Ani DiFranco's music. All ten are women in their twenties and thirties living in Ontario or New York. Each has been listening to DiFranco's music for between two and fifteen years, and has considered herself a reproductive rights activist for between eighteen months and twenty years. I examine these women's narratives of their relationships with Ani DiFranco's music and their activist experience through the interconnected lenses of identity, consciousness, and practice. Listening to Ani DiFranco's music affects the fluid ways these women understand their identities as women, as <b>feminists,</b> and in <b>solidarity</b> with others. I draw on Freire's (1970) understanding of conscientization to consider the role that Ani's music has played in heightening women's awareness about reproductive rights issues. The feeling of solidarity with other (both real and perceived) activist fans gives them more confidence that they {{can make a difference in}} overcoming social injustice. They believe that Ani's music encourages productive anger, which in turn fuels their passion to take action to make change. Women use Ani's music deliberately for energy and encouragement in their continued activism, and find that it continues to resonate with their evolving identities as women, feminists, and activists. My study builds on those of Rosenthal (2001) and Savage (2003) by focusing on one artist and activists in one social movement. The characteristics of Ani DiFranco, her fan base, and the reproductive rights movement allow new understanding of the ways that female fans who are members of a female-dominated feminist movement interact with the music of a popular independent female artist...|$|R

The latter are briefly depicted through research results of analysis of women’s memory narratives - nurses and antiwar activists - whose subjectivities, experiences and gender positions, in their interaction, influenced construction of their narratives, differences, but also their relationship with the past...|$|E
40|$|This {{anthology}} injects women's voices into interreligious dialogue, {{which is}} all-too-often dominated by religiously authorized spokesmen, and questions {{the theory and}} practice of interreligious dialogue from feminist perspectives. The contributors speak from Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Christian and Muslim perspectives and reflect British, Dutch, German, Hungarian, Spanish, Slovene, Turkish and US American cultural contexts. While the European Society of Women in Theological Research (ESWTR) has {{for more than two decades}} negotiated its member's national, cultural and linguistic diversity quite successfully, the presence of diverse non-Christian religious communities in Europe has so far been marginalized. As the religious make-up of Europe is changing due to globalization, the discipline of theology must create ways to reflect, study and teach in a religiously pluralistic world. This book explores the possibilities of <b>feminist</b> <b>solidarity</b> in the midst of diversity and conflict by charting a pathway between acceptance of religious differences and rejection of patriarchal tenets within these religions...|$|E

The article addresses the different forms that gender mainstreaming takes, in different countries and different policy domains, in order to push forward the theoretical debates. Gender mainstreaming often draws on transnational processes, involving transnational networks and agencies and transformations of the discourse of universal human rights, challenging the traditional focus on national processes. These developments are facilitated {{by the rise of}} global processes and institutions, such as the UN. Tensions can arise as a result of actors seeking to mainstream quite different models of gender equality: based on equality through sameness; through equal valuation of difference; and through transformation. The intersection of gender with other complex forms of inequality has challenging implications for a primary focus on gender within gender mainstreaming. Nevertheless, certain forms of gender mainstreaming have, despite their evident weaknesses, provided a new basis for <b>feminist</b> <b>solidarity</b> and action at a global level. Gender mainstreaming is a leading-edge example of the potential implications of globalisation for gender politics...|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{workings}} of empathy, identification and solidarity across difference and argues that these represent urgent theoretical and political concerns for feminist politics today. It also points to the affective power of memory in political discourse, its potential to bolster identity, and its centrality to differentiation, all of which render the deployments of memory critical to understanding the politics of differentiation and belonging. These topics are addressed via a discussion of selected pro-immigrant discourses in the Republic of Ireland {{at the turn of}} the twenty-first century and how these discourses invoke the ethical potential in memorialising past emigration from Ireland. Three questions are addressed: first, what kinds of analogies are drawn between new immigration to Ireland in the present and a past marked by emigration? Second, what can the notion of a ‘repressed national memory of emigration’ contribute to the promotion of a critical multiculturalism and solidarity with immigrants? And finally, what can debates about difference and identification within feminist theory tell us about how ethnic, familial or national ties might ground or inhibit the development of an ethical relationship to the other? The article concludes with a discussion of the possibilities for <b>feminist</b> <b>solidarity</b> in contexts of the multicultural and the global...|$|E
40|$|Working Girl (Mike Nichols, 1988) {{offered a}} Hollywood {{narrative}} of one woman’s {{achievement in the}} workplace, through its account of secretary Tess McGill (Melanie Griffiths) impersonating her female boss and eventually winning a place in senior management. The film represents a popular feminism which is firmly sited in the emotional rather than the political sphere, eliciting a Cinderella narrative of the poor girl who makes good in the big city. Critical readings of the film have noted the derogatory account of Tess’s boss, Katherine Parker (Sigourney Weaver) and its skewed vision of <b>feminist</b> <b>solidarity</b> (Tasker 1998, Hallam 1993, Jones 1991). Framing the film as a Hollywood attempt to address the alleged outcomes of second wave feminism in the late 1980 s – women in management and in power – and working through a close analysis of the film’s emotive and triumphal ending, this paper re-examines this film as a fantasy of potential achieved and battles won. How does Working Girl look two decades after its original release; how does it deploy affect and what can it tell contemporary viewers about feminism and popular culture in the 1980 s and the 2010 s? In particular, how can we now read the ‘happy ending’ which depicts Tess in her own office, with her own secretary and a new life with a new partner (Harrison Ford), as the soundtrack proposes a ‘new Jerusalem’? This paper proposes that the rousing ending may be understood as more ambivalent than it first appeared, particularly when read through a retrospective lens. The fantasy of ‘escape’ and ‘liberation’ that such films offer should not simply be dismissed as bad faith but rather understood through what George Lipsitz calls ‘memory as misappropriation’ – {{as a means of}} negotiating feminist histories and desires...|$|E
