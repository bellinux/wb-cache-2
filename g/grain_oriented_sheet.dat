Especially circular magnetization is usually restricted to induction values of 1. 2 T, even if advanced feed-back systems are applied.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} core loss of {{electrical}} steel the vacuum arc ion plating technique {{has been used}} to deposit titanium nitride (TiN) layers on highly <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical steel <b>sheets.</b> The layer thickness, the stresses of layers and coated sheets and the achieved reduction in core losses have been measured as functions of coating duration and applied bias voltage. Well adhered layers with high compressive stress up to 6. 8 GPa have been produced. With increasing bias voltage the layer thickness decreases and the intrinsic stress of the layers increase. A further increase of bias voltage leads to a drop in stress due to thermal relaxation. In general, the tensile stress of the coated sheets rises with increasing layer thickness while the core loss of the coated material decreases with increasing tensile stress of the steel sheet and increasing bias voltage. The highest reduction of core loss {{has been found to be}} 28 % (from P- 1. 7 = 0. 86 W/kg for commercially coated HGO electrical steel sheet with glass film to 0. 62 W/kg for TiN coated material) and is due to the reduction of excess loss only...|$|R

40|$|Inductor or reactor or {{sometimes}} called as ‘Choke’ as per its intended situational assignment, {{is a basic}} magnetic component which is very useful for many fields {{and particularly in the}} fields of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Amongst its endless applications in the fields, inductors functions in the low frequency range such as the power system frequencies (i. e. 50 Hz, 60 Hz) are considered mainly in this research. Main concern {{of this paper is to}} popularize toroidal steel core inductor construction which is advantages in many aspects over the common other types of inductors such as EI laminated and C-Core constructions. Conventionally for toroidal silicon steel core inductors, cores are constructed with magnetically <b>Grain</b> <b>Oriented</b> Silicon Steel (GOSS). This paper describes a methodological approach to find out the suitability of magnetically Non <b>Grain</b> <b>Oriented</b> Silicon Steel (NGOSS) for the inductor core material. A comparative study is carried out selecting inductor designs made with <b>Grain</b> <b>Oriented</b> Silicon Steel (GOSS) and their corresponding Non <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> silicon steel (NGOSS) ones.

40|$|Characteristic {{features}} of microstructure in secondary recrystallized <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> silicon steel containing MnS and AIN have been investigated. Since secondary recrystallization is markedly influenced by inhibitors {{and a small}} amount of solute elements, transmission electron microscopy has been used to characterize changes of the morphology of inhibitors by tin addition. The onset temperature of secondary recrystallization of the silicon stcel is shown to be decreased by tin addition. Also tin addition tends {{to reduce the size of}} inhibitors, MnS and AIN, and thereby appears to reduce the size of primary recrystallized grains. These effects of tin addition on microstructure are consistent with the fundamental idea that reduction of the size of primary recrystallized grains generally decreases the onset temperature of the secondary recrystallization.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the copper content, initial structure, and scheme of {{treatment}} on the magnetic properties of an ultra-thin <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical steel has been investigated. In the material with copper and an initial sharp texture, the nucleation of new grains upon primary recrystallization is connected with deformation twins; in the samples without copper and with copper and diffuse texture, it is connected predominantly with shear bands and transition bands. Upon heating {{at a rate of}} ∼ 0. 004 K/s, the temperature of primary recrystallization in the copper-bearing samples is considerably higher than in the copper-free material. Upon heating at a rate of ∼ 4 K/s the appearance of new grains occurs almost simultaneously for all of the studied samples. In the samples with copper and initial sharp texture after annealing at 1050 C, {{a significant part of the}} volume is occupied by grains that had undergone normal grain growth; in the samples without copper and with copper and diffuse texture, anomalous growth is hardly observed at all. To obtain high final magnetic properties of the ultra-thin <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical steel produced by the Littmann method, it has been suggested to use an <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical steel with 0. 5 % Cu that exhibits the diffuse orientation of grains as the workpiece. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Localised {{magnetic}} flux density, magnetising field and power loss {{are believed to}} distribute non-uniformly in <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical steel. Understanding {{of the causes of}} their variation can help reduce the overall power loss of the material. In this investigation, magnetic domain observation was often used in the study of domain configuration and crystal orientation of the test specimens. Methods of domain observation have been studied and compared in order to select the appropriate method for different parts of the investigation and to improve the understanding of the image observed. A less destructive local loss measurement sensor has been built for the measurement of localised flux density, magnetising field and power loss. The sensor was tested and evaluated specifically for the measurement of localised magnetic power loss of the high permeability <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical steel. The results obtained from local loss scanning measurements indicated that localised flux density and magnetising field can vary substantially in <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical steel under AC magnetisation of 50 Hz. The variation of localised flux density has been found mainly resulted by grain misorientation and local grain arrangement. The transverse component of flux density was detected and has been found increases with increasing grain misorientation. The variation of localised magnetising field has been found mainly influenced by the localised demagnetising field due to formation of free magnetic poles at grain boundaries. It has been proved that both flux density and magnetising field have strong influence on the distribution of localised power loss. The study of the effect of domain refinement on distribution of localised flux density showed that domain refinement by means of ball scribing on one surface of <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical steel can improve the uniformity of distribution of flux density. However, results also inferred that excessive scribing in a confined area can cause obvious uneven distribution of flux density {{in the direction of the}} specimen’s thickness...|$|R

A simulation-based methodology is introduced for computing correlation functions of microstructure attributes marked by the extreme value microstructure-scale fatigue indicator parameters. Multiple statistically representative microstructure volumes simulated using a crystal plasticity constitutive model coupled with the FEM are used to characterize these extreme value marked correlation functions. By comparing these marked correlation functions to traditional correlation functions sampled from the bulk material, the interacting microstructure attributes important to the extreme value response are identified.
