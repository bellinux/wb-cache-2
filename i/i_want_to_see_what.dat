I don't want to go by what everyone else sees – <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> is actually going on, and share in {{the reaction of the}} characters {{at the same time as}} them". However, by the twelfth episode, he said that the scene in which Victor cries was the proof he wanted: [...] "If the kiss is the initial spark, and the rings the visible sign of love, then the tears are proof that you don't want it to end. I have been saying all the time that what I wanted was text rather than subtext – but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off." ...|$|E

The Rockies promoted Pérez to triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox {{at the end of}} the 1995 season with the intention of bringing him up to the major leagues the next year. In fact, although Pérez was invited to 1996 spring training, he spent most of year with the Sky Sox and was not called up until the end of August, making his major league debut on August 31. In his season with the Sky Sox, his batting average had improved to [...]316.

Metcalfe explained that Mercedes did not [...] "feel guilt at all - she just wants Riley back and she'll {{do whatever it takes}} to get him". Metcalfe believed that it was easy for Mercedes to lie; [...] "hence why she does it so much and so well!" [...] Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry if she needed to, [...] "especially if it will benefit her". Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to hate her character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, [...] "I hope I've done a good job and people still feel sorry for her". She said that [...] "the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of tweets saying, 'I feel so sorry for Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee is being a bitch'". Metcalfe said that she was surprised by the fans' strong reaction. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick also said that Mercedes [...] "gets away with blue murder [...] and yet there's so much love for that character". Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Mercedes would get her comeuppance for framing Mitzeee, saying: [...] "there most definitely will be a comeuppance. With the stabbing, she did it so coolly and lied about it so easily - that can't last forever". Smithwick explained that Mercedes is [...] "driven by her insecurities. She thinks she loves Riley and will do what it takes to win him. That's what it's about...winning. Mitzeee crossed her - she is dispensable but Riley...well, Riley is the prize. Mercedes Fisher usually gets what she wants and men usually fall in line with her. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens when they don't..." ...|$|E
