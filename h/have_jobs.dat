The city has more than two million visitors every year.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not <b>have</b> <b>jobs.</b> Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E

5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women <b>have</b> <b>jobs</b> in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E

Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy.|$|E
5|$|During Mao's rule (1949–1976), Chinese {{women were}} needed for their manual labor for farming and for urban industrialization. To {{compensate}} for their hard work, they were provided {{access to education}} and politics. The Chinese government supported women's education. The percentage of girls attending school was 96.2% compared to below 20% before the People's Republic (1949). The Chinese government has tried to decrease {{the number of women}} illiterates while promoting adult and vocational schools. The percentage number of illiterates has gone down from 90% in 1949 and 32% from 1993. In the first 30 years of Communist rule women's discrimination was decreasing, but they did not <b>have</b> <b>jobs</b> that had real decision-making power.|$|E

In the inner-city wards of Aston and Washwood Heath, the figure is higher than 30%. Two-fifths of Birmingham's population live in areas classified as in the 10% most deprived parts of England, and overall Birmingham is the most deprived local authority in England in terms of income and employment deprivation.

The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip.

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of firefighter: wholetime and retained. Wholetime firefighters work {{full-time}} in the fire service. Retained firefighters are on call for long periods (at least 70 hours a week) to respond to incidents. They are paid a salary for the time they spend on call and a greater amount for each incident they respond to, on average 2 or 3 per week. Many <b>have</b> <b>jobs</b> outside of the fire service. Large town fire stations have wholetime crews, while small rural ones are usually staffed only by retained firefighters. Voluntary firefighters are now rare: the only voluntary units now in operation are the Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade and the Borth Voluntary Fire Unit (near Aberystwyth, Wales).|$|E
25|$|Causes include {{previous}} joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and inherited factors. Risk {{is greater}} {{in those who}} are overweight, have one leg of a different length, and <b>have</b> <b>jobs</b> that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis {{is believed to be}} caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests occasionally used to either support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which is primarily an inflammatory condition, in osteoarthritis, the joints do not typically become hot or red.|$|E
25|$|Most {{countries}} {{provide a}} variety of services to assist homeless people. These services often provide food, shelter (beds) and clothing and may be organized and run by community organizations (often {{with the help of}} volunteers) or by government departments or agencies. These programs may be supported by the government, charities, churches and individual donors. Many cities also have street newspapers, which are publications designed to provide employment opportunity to homeless people. While some homeless <b>have</b> <b>jobs,</b> some must seek other methods to make a living. Begging or panhandling is one option, but is becoming increasingly illegal in many cities. People who are homeless may have additional conditions, such as physical or mental health issues or substance addiction; these issues make resolving homelessness a challenging policy issue.|$|E
