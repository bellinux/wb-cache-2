5|$|Stephen {{responded by}} {{promptly}} moving south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle. Stephen then {{agreed to a}} truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the agreement are not known, but the results were that Matilda and her household of knights were released from the siege and escorted to the south-west of England, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. The reasons for Matilda's release remain unclear. Stephen may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was in his own best interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, seeing Robert, rather than Matilda, as his main opponent {{at this point in}} the conflict. Arundel Castle was also considered almost impregnable, and Stephen may have been worried that he risked tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; Stephen had a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.|$|E
25|$|Who Would <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> is a {{historical}} romance. Writing during the nineteenth century, Ruiz de Burton drew upon the classical tradition and European influence. However, her use of realism and naturalism distinguishes this novel from other historical romances at the time.|$|E

[...] He said his old aunt had some stories about Chantry House being haunted, and <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> incumbent on her to hate the Winslows, but he <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> all nonsense, and such stories were much better forgotten.

25|$|Conventions of domesticity in {{the nineteenth}} century {{reinforced}} the idea that women should remain at home to look after the family. Who Would <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> does not follow the typical romance of domesticity because it introduces women from the domestic sphere into political and public spheres. The novel is situated during a time of modernization in the United States during which the home was transformed. The novel also parodies mid-nineteenth-century family life.|$|E
25|$|Mary's life between 1534 and her sister's {{execution}} on 19 May 1536 {{is difficult}} to trace. There is no record of her visiting her parents, and {{no evidence of any}} correspondence with, or visits to, her sister Anne or her brother George when they were imprisoned in the Tower of London. Like their uncle, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, she may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> wise to avoid association with her now-disgraced relatives.|$|E
25|$|Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and His Majesty the King of the French, {{taking into}} {{consideration}} the existence in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands) of a government capable of providing for the regularity of its relations with foreign nations, <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> right to engage, reciprocally, to consider the Sandwich Islands as an Independent State, and never to take possession, neither directly or under the title of Protectorate, or under any other form, of {{any part of the}} territory of which they are composed.|$|E

25|$|María Ruiz de Burton's Who Would <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> (1872) was {{the first}} novel to be written in English by a Mexican living in the United States. After a long period in which Ruiz de Burton's work was almost {{completely}} unknown, the novel was rediscovered by critics interested {{in the history of}} Chicano literature, and republished to acclaim in 1995. Yet Ruiz de Burton's life was not particularly typical of the Mexican-American experience, as she married a prominent US officer, Captain Henry S. Burton, {{in the aftermath of the}} Mexican–American War. The novel reflects her ambiguous position between the Californio elite and the Anglo-Saxon majority of the United States.|$|E
25|$|One theory {{provided}} by Herodotus is that Leonidas sent away {{the remainder of}} his men because he cared about their safety. The King would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> wise to preserve those Greek troops for future battles against the Persians, but he knew that the Spartans could never abandon their post on the battlefield. The soldiers who stayed behind were to protect their escape against the Persian cavalry. Herodotus himself believed that Leonidas gave the order because he perceived the allies to be disheartened and unwilling to encounter the danger to which his own mind was made up. He therefore chose to dismiss all troops except the Thebans, Thespians and helots and save the glory for the Spartans.|$|E
25|$|Ruiz de Burton uses {{irony and}} satire to mock American {{political}} discourses and practices by ridiculing socio-political {{structures of the}} period. Using a variety of rogues, who have pretentious and comical names, Ruiz de Burton represents the vices of nineteenth-century middle-class society. The preachers, Mr. Hackwell and Mr. Hammerhard, the neighbors, the Cackles, and other political figures in Who Would <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> are unmasked to break down ideological myths of American political rhetoric by contrasting {{the expectations of the}} nation with the reality of their actions. American expectations include promoting civil virtue and acting against corruption. However, Mr. Hackwell, the primary religious figure in the novel, schemes to increase his wealth in order to satisfy his ravenous greed. The Cackles clan represents Northern politicians who are only motivated by self-interest. Ruiz de Burton implies that the national practice of self-deception, misrepresentation and secrecy are deeply rooted in the American character, though very rarely revealed. Juxtaposed to this satire of American life are the virtues of the good and beautiful Lola.|$|E

500|$|Louise, however, {{proved to}} be good at the job: Victoria wrote shortly afterwards: [...] "She is (and who would some years ago <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it?)</b> a clever dear girl with a fine strong character, unselfish and affectionate." [...] However, when Louise {{fell in love with her}} brother Leopold's tutor, the Reverend Robinson Duckworth (14 years her senior), between 1866 and 1870, the Queen reacted by dismissing Duckworth in 1870. He later became Canon of Westminster Abbey.|$|E
500|$|Jagger told Stephen Schiff in a 1992 Vanity Fair profile: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to}} be rebellious in those days; I was just being me. I wasn't trying to push the edge of anything. I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from {{suburbia}} who sings in this band, but someone older might <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and {{where are we going}} if this is music?... But all those songs we sang were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were tame." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} September, with Leopold's recovery, {{the family}} moved back to central London, to lodgings in Thrift Street (later 20 Frith Street), Soho. These lodgings were located {{conveniently}} close to several concert rooms, and to the residences of both J.C Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. Bach, a son of Johann Sebastian Bach, soon became a family friend; Nannerl later recalled Bach and the eight-year-old Wolfgang playing a sonata together, taking turns to play a few bars individually, and that [...] "anyone not watching would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was played by one person alone". There is no record that the Mozarts met Abel, but Wolfgang knew his symphonies, perhaps {{through the medium of}} the annual Bach-Abel concert series, and was much influenced by them.|$|E

500|$|Lauren Faust, the then-executive producer, {{expressed}} {{appreciation for}} show's adult fans on her deviantArt page. Faust {{had not expected}} men without children to watch it, but said, [...] "The fact that they did {{and that they were}} open-minded and cool enough and secure in their masculinity enough to embrace it and love it and go online and talk about how much they love it—I'm kind of proud." [...] Of her surprise to the unexpected fandom, Faust said, [...] "From the messages I've received, these episodes have lifted spirits, brought parents and kids together, changed perspectives and inspired the most unlikely of people in the most unlikely of places. Who would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> from a show about candy colored ponies?" ...|$|E
500|$|Gibson {{wrote that}} McCool [...] "did not quite {{come to terms}} with the West Country". He went on: [...] "He missed the sunshine. 'There's no winter,' he said, 'and the beer's better. And the f------ off-spinners don't turn.' I think an {{additional}} reason was that he found some difficulty in accepting the conventions of English cricket as it was then. There was a Somerset committee member, who liked and admired him, and would greet him with, 'Morning, McCool'. That committee member was seeking to be courteous. He would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> pompous to say 'Mr McCool', and impertinent to say 'Colin'. But it infuriated Colin. He thought it a reflection on his status. He would have preferred something like 'Hi, Col, you old bastard.' The worlds were too far apart." ...|$|E
500|$|There is {{a charter}} {{allegedly}} issued by Domhnall to Paisley Abbey, {{found in the}} cartulary of that abbey. In this charter Domhnall is given no title, instead merely described by his genealogy: Douenaldus filius Reginaldi filii Sumerledi, [...] "Domhnall, son of Raghnall, son of Somhairle". This charter is thought by some historians to be spurious, mainly because the witness list and wording of the charter are, {{in the words of}} Alex Woolf, [...] "suspiciously similar" [...] to those in a genuine charter of Domhnall's son Aonghus Mór. Presumably, the explanation is that the monks of Paisley Abbey at some later stage may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> in their interest to replicate Aonghus Mór's charter in order to add the authority of the founder of Clan Donald to their land rights.|$|E

500|$|December 1967 {{also saw}} the release of Their Satanic Majesties Request (UK No. 3; US No. 2), which {{received}} unfavourable reviews and was widely regarded as a poor imitation of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Satanic Majesties had been recorded in difficult circumstances while Jagger, Richards and Jones were dealing with their court cases. The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions. The split was amicable, at least publicly, but in 2003 Jagger said: [...] "The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating {{and that we were}} being childish. It was not a great moment really – and I would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> wasn't a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew's job." ...|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley wrote [...] "Maurice" [...] for Laurette Tighe on 10 August 1820. Shelley's journal {{for that}} day notes: [...] "Thursday 10—Write a story for Laurette—Walk on the mountain—Le Buche delle Fate —The weather is warm & delightful". Claire Clairmont and Laurette had spent Laurette's {{birthday}} together in Pisa and the following day on the coast with Mary Shelley; this excursion may have inspired the story, {{which may have been}} a birthday present. Shelley suggested that her father, philosopher William Godwin, publish Maurice as part of his Juvenile Library, but he refused. He may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was too short or that it too closely resembled a story by Caroline Barnard entitled The Fisher-boy of Weymouth that he had just published in 1819. In his article on [...] "Maurice", L. Adam Mekler suggests that Godwin may also have rejected the story because of the [...] "strong biographical parallels" [...] with the history of the Shelleys and the Godwins.|$|E
500|$|Particularly {{after his}} fastball slowed, Young relied upon his control. Young was once quoted as saying, [...] "Some may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was {{essential}} {{to know how to}} curve a ball before anything else. Experience, to my mind, teaches to the contrary. Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time. The curve is merely an accessory to control." [...] In addition to his exceptional control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury. For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Young was in his leagues' top ten for innings pitched; in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games. By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in spring training. [...] "I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it", said Young, [...] "and there wasn't any use wasting them." [...] Young once described his approach before a game: ...|$|E
