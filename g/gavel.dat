50|$|The actors sing, {{accompanied}} by musical instruments {{such as a}} small three-stringed lute or pipa.Pingtan artists also use fans, <b>gavels</b> and handkerchieves as performance props.

5|$|Many {{politicians}} {{with strong}} personalities {{and a powerful}} attachment to the institution of Congress are reputed still to roam the halls of Congress long after their deaths. The shades of Representative Joseph Cannon (R-Ill. and Speaker from 1903 to 1911) and Rep. Champ Clark (D-Mo. and Speaker from 1911 to 1919) are claimed to occasionally return to the dark chamber of the House of Representatives after midnight and, after a loud rap from a <b>gavel,</b> resume the strong, angry debates they once had in life. Members of the United States Capitol Police have claimed to have seen Senator (and from 1852 to 1854, Representative) Thomas Hart Benton sitting at a desk in National Statuary Hall, although {{it has not been}} used as a legislative chamber since 1857. Steve Livengood, chief tour guide for the United States Capitol Historical Society, says he has seen the ghost of former Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) near Mills' former office late at night. Pierre Charles L'Enfant, although not a politician, was a brevet Major during the American Revolutionary War who served with George Washington at Valley Forge. In 1791, L'Enfant was appointed architect and planner of the new city of Washington in the District of Columbia. Although L'Enfant submitted grandiose plans for the new capital city, his plans were never fully adopted and President Washington dismissed him. L'Enfant spent {{much of the rest of}} his life attempting to wrest a monetary payment from Congress, and he died in poverty in 1825. Eyewitnesses, however, claim to have seen his spirit walking through the Capitol, head down, murmuring to himself, with the plans for the capital city tucked under his arm.|$|E

25|$|The {{signal to}} start and stop trading was not always a bell.

After the NYSE changed to its present location at 18 Broad Street in 1903, the gong was switched to the bell format that is currently being used.|$|E

25|$|Senate {{procedure}} depends {{not only}} on the rules, but also on a variety of customs and traditions. The Senate commonly waives some of its stricter rules by unanimous consent. Unanimous consent agreements are typically negotiated beforehand by party leaders. A senator may block such an agreement, but in practice, objections are rare. The presiding officer enforces the rules of the Senate, and may warn members who deviate from them. The presiding officer sometimes uses the <b>gavel</b> of the Senate to maintain order.|$|E

25|$|Hen Comb has {{no direct}} {{topographical}} link with Mellbreak to the east, the two parallel ridges being separated by the wet valley of Mosedale. The head of Mosedale curves westward around {{the summit of}} Hen Comb, its source being at Floutern Tarn. This long slender pool has a grim quality in most conditions, being sandwiched between Floutern Crag and an embankment of giant boulders. Great Borne and Starling Dodd rise to the south. The western boundary of the fell is formed by Whiteoak Beck which, like Mosedale Beck, joins the outflow of Loweswater. Across the valley are <b>Gavel</b> Fell and Blake Fell, while its marshy source at Whiteoak Moss lies just below Floutern Cop.|$|E
