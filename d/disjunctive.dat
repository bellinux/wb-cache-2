2500|$|The {{somewhat}} inconsistent use of dots {{above and}} below the words as <b>disjunctives</b> is closely similar to that found in Syriac texts. [...] Kahle also notes some similarity with the punctuation of Samaritan Hebrew.|$|R
2500|$|Minor <b>disjunctives</b> are pazer gadol, shalshelet gedolah, azla legarmeh (looking like qadma) and mehuppach legarmeh (looking like mahpach): all {{of these}} except pazer are {{followed}} by a pesiq. [...] Mehuppach without a pesiq sometimes occurs {{at the beginning of}} a stich.|$|R
2500|$|Babylonian Biblical manuscripts {{from the}} Geonic period contain no cantillation {{marks in the}} current sense, but small Hebrew letters are used to mark {{significant}} divisions within a verse. [...] Up to eight different letters are found, depending {{on the importance of}} the break and where it occurs in the verse: these correspond roughly to the <b>disjunctives</b> of the Tiberian system. [...] For example, in some manuscripts the letter tav, for tevir (break), does duty for both Tiberian tevir and zaqef. [...] In general there are no symbols for the conjunctives, though some late manuscripts use the Tiberian symbols for these. [...] There is also no equivalent for low-grade <b>disjunctives</b> such as telishah gedolah: these are generally replaced by the equivalent of zaqef or revia.|$|R
25|$|This is true equally of {{the system}} used for the Torah and the systems used for the other books. It {{appears to be a}} relic of the Babylonian system, which also {{recognised}} only eight types of <b>disjunctive</b> and no conjunctives.|$|E
25|$|The Babylonian {{system uses}} cantillation {{similarly}} to the Tiberian system. The oldest manuscripts (which use the simple system) mark only <b>disjunctive</b> accents, do not write the accent over the stressed syllable, {{and do not}} mark mappiq, while later manuscripts do.|$|E

25|$|One may now ask: How many {{possible}} judgments are there? Kant believed {{that all the}} possible propositions within Aristotle's syllogistic logic are equivalent to all possible judgments, and that all the logical operators within the propositions are equivalent to the moments of the understanding within judgments. Thus he listed Aristotle's system in four groups of three: quantity (universal, particular, singular), quality (affirmative, negative, infinite), relation (categorical, hypothetical, <b>disjunctive)</b> and modality (problematic, assertoric, apodeictic). The parallelism with Kant's categories is obvious: quantity (unity, plurality, totality), quality (reality, negation, limitation), relation (substance, cause, community) and modality (possibility, existence, necessity).|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{extend the}} refined {{operational}} semantics of the Constraint Handling Rules language {{to support the}} implementation of different search strategies. Such search strategies are necessary to build efficient Constraint Logic Programming systems. This semantics is then further refined {{so that it is}} more suitable as a basis for a trailing based implementation. We propose a source to source transformation to implement breadth first search in CHR(Prolog) : CHR with Prolog as the host language. Breadth first is chosen because it exhibits the main difficulties in the implementation of search strategies, while being easy to understand. We evaluate our implementation and give directions for future work. 1 Introduction &quot;Algorithm = Logic + Control &quot; is a famous quote by Robert Kowalski, implyinga separation between the declarative meaning of a program and its operational behavior. The latter consists of choosing the order in which different conjunctivesand <b>disjunctives</b> are processed. In the context of Constraint Logic Programming, the order of the conjunctives is handled by scheduling and the order of disjunc-tives by search. In this paper we focus on the latter...|$|R

25|$|Following {{the success}} of The 400 Blows, Truffaut {{featured}} <b>disjunctive</b> editing and seemingly random voice-overs in his next film Shoot the Piano Player (1960) starring Charles Aznavour. Truffaut has stated {{that in the middle}} of filming, he realized that he hated gangsters. But since gangsters were a main part of the story, he toned up the comical aspect of the characters and made the movie more attuned to his liking. Even though Shoot the Piano Player was much appreciated by critics, it performed poorly at the box office. While the film focused on two of the French New Wave's favorite elements, American film noir and themselves, Truffaut never again experimented as heavily.|$|E
25|$|Evans & Treisman (2005) {{proposed}} a hypothesis that humans rapidly detect <b>disjunctive</b> sets of unbound features of target categories {{in a parallel}} manner, and then use these features to discriminate between scenes that do or do not contain the target without necessarily fully identifying it. An {{example of such a}} feature would be outstretched wings {{that can be used to}} tell whether or not a bird is in a picture, even before the system has identified an object as a bird. Evans & Treisman propose that natural scene perception involves a first pass through the visual processing hierarchy up to the nodes in a visual identification network, and then optional revisiting of earlier levels for more detailed analysis. During the 'first pass' stage, the system forms a global representation of the natural scene that includes the layout of global boundaries and potential objects. During the 'revisiting' stage, focused attention is employed to select local objects of interest in a serial manner, and then bind their features to their representations.|$|E

40|$|Active faults of the Hangay-Hentiy tectonic saddle {{region in}} Central Mongolia are studied by space images interpretation, relief analysis, {{structural}} methods and tectonic stress reconstruction. The study {{results show that}} faults activation during the Late Cenozoic stage was selective, and a cluster pattern of active faults is typical for the study region. Morphological and genetic types and the kinematics of faults in the Hangay-Hentiy saddle region are related {{the direction of the}} ancient inherited structural heterogeneities. Latitudinal and WNW trending faults are left lateral strike-slips with reverse or thrust component (Dzhargalantgol and North Burd faults). NW trending faults are reverse faults or thrusts with left lateral horizontal component. NNW trending faults have right lateral horizontal component. The horizontal component of the displacements, as a rule, exceeds the vertical one. Brittle deformations in fault zones do not conform with the Pliocene and, for the most part, Pleistocene topography. With some caution it may be concluded that the last phase of revitalization of strike slip and reverse movements along the faults commenced in the Late Pleistocene. NE trending <b>disjunctives</b> are normal faults distributed mainly within the Hangay uplift. Their features are more early activation within the Late Cenozoic and the lack of relation to large linear structures of the previous tectonic stages.   According to the stress tensor reconstructions of the last phase of deformation in zones of active faults of the Hangay-Hentiy saddle using data on tectonic fractures and fault displacements, it is revealed that conditions of compression and strike-slip with NNE direction of the axis of maximum compression were dominant. Stress tensors of extensional type with NNW direction of minimum compression are reconstructed for the Orkhon graben.   It is concluded that the activation of faults in Central Mongolia in the Pleistocene-Holocene, as well as modern seismicity were controlled mainly by additional horizontal compression in the SW direction, which was associated with convergence of the Indian subcontinent and Eurasia. The influence of the asthenosphere flow in the SE direction at the base lithosphere is an additional factor facilitating strike-slip deformation of the crust in the study area and a possible explanation of divergent movements in the Baikal Rift, as well as the SE movement of the Amur plate. The Eastern Hangay crust is deformed under extension associated with a dynamic impact of the local mantle anomaly on the lithosphere. The boundary between the Amur plate and the Mongolian block (according to [Zonenshain, Savostin, 1979]) is fragmentary expressed in the tectonic structure. It represents a rim part of the deformation zone, embracing the Mongolian block and the adjacent uplifts of the Mongolian Altai, Tuva and Eastern Sayan. Along the boundary, compressive and transpressive strain occurred in the Pleistocene-Holocene. </p...|$|R
