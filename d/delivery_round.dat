5000|$|A {{long string}} of [...] "faced" [...] letters (i.e. turned to allow the address to be read) is {{presented}} to a keyboard operator at a coding desk, who types the postcodes onto the envelopes in coloured phosphor dots. The associated machine uses the outward codes in these dots to direct bundles of letters into the correct bags for specific delivery offices. With a machine knowledge of the specific addresses handled by each postal walk at each office, the bundles can be further sorted using the dots of the inward sorting code so that each <b>delivery</b> <b>round</b> receives only its own letters. This feature depends upon {{whether or not it}} is cost effective to second-sort outward letters, and tends to be used only at main sorting offices where high volumes are handled. When postcodes are incomplete or missing, the operator reads the post town name and inserts a code sufficient for outward sorting to the post town where others can further direct it. The mail bags of letter bundles are sent by road, air or train, and eventually by road to the delivery office. At the delivery office the mail that is handled manually is inward sorted to the postal walk that will deliver it, and it is then [...] "set in", sorted into the walk order that allows the deliverer the most convenient progress in the round.

Much of family practice now routinely uses computerised medical record (CMR) systems, these systems being linked at varying levels to laboratories and other care providers. CMR systems {{have the potential to}} support care. OBJECTIVE: To achieve a consensus among an international panel of health care professionals and informatics experts about the role of informatics in the delivery of patient-centred, coordinated, and quality-assured care. METHOD: The consensus building exercise involved 20 individuals, five general practitioners and 15 informatics academics, members of the International Medical Informatics Association Primary Care Informatics Working Group. A thematic analysis of the literature was carried out according to the defined themes. RESULTS: The first round of the analysis developed 27 statements on how the CMR, or any other information system, including paper-based medical records, supports care <b>delivery.</b> <b>Round</b> 2 aimed at achieving a consensus about the statements of round one. Round 3 stated that there was an agreement on informatics principles and structures that should be put in place.

CONCLUSIONS: The panel had a strong agreement about the core concepts and structures that should be put in place to support high quality care. However, this agreement evaporated over statements related to implementation. These findings reflect literature and personal experiences: whilst there is consensus about how informatics structures and processes support good quality care, implementation is difficult...|$|E

It considers the potential environmental savings {{from the use of}} alternative forms of collection and delivery over traditional delivery methods for failed home deliveries. With a spreadsheet carbon audit model, carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions for a failed delivery are calculated {{on the basis of a}} typical van home <b>delivery</b> <b>round</b> of 120 drops and 50 -mi (80 -km) distance. Three first-time delivery failure rates (10 %, 30 %, and 50 %) are assessed. The additional CO 2 from a second delivery attempt increases the emissions per drop by 9 % to 75 % (depending on the delivery failure rate). The vast majority (85 % to 95 %) of emissions emanating from a traditional failed delivery arise not from the repeat van delivery but from the personal travel associated with the customerâs collecting a missed redelivery from the carrierâs local depot. A range of collectionâdelivery points (CDPs) (supermarkets, post offices, railway stations) were all found to reduce the environmental impact of this personal travel. Post offices (currently operating a CDP system through the U. K. Royal Mailâs Local Collect service) yielded the greatest savings, creating just 13 % of the CO 2 produced by a traditional collection by car from a local depot. Overall, the research suggests that the use of CDPs offers a convenient and more environmentally friendly alternative to redelivery and customer collection from a local parcel depo...|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{detection}} of a morbidly adherent placenta (MAP) {{in the first}} trimester is rare. Risk factors such as multiparity, advanced maternal age, prior cesarean delivery, prior myomectomy, placenta previa, or previous uterine evacuation place patients at a higher risk for having abnormal placental implantation. If these patients have a first trimester missed abortion and fail medical management, {{it is important that}} providers have a heightened suspicion for a MAP. Case. A 24 -year-old G 4 P 3003 with 3 prior cesarean <b>deliveries</b> underwent multiple <b>rounds</b> of failed medical management for a missed abortion. She had a dilation and curettage that was complicated by a significant hemorrhage and ultimately required an urgent hysterectomy. Conclusion. When patients fail medical management for a missed abortion, providers need to assess the patientâs risk factors for a MAP. If risk factors are present, a series of specific evaluations should be triggered to rule out a MAP and help further guide management. Early diagnosis of a MAP allows providers to coordinate a multidisciplinary treatment approach and thoroughly counsel patients.

Group members could work as generalists (all group members self-feed to obtain fuel and deliver cargo; e. g. food items for offspring, non-food items such as building materials) or as specialists (collect only fuel, or only cargo). Mathematical method: We developed a simple analytical model to investigate conditions favouring these basic alternatives. Key assumptions: We assumed that natural selection favours mechanisms that maximize the delivery rate of cargo, fuel being important only in so far as it enables the work of the delivery of cargo to be supported. Conclusions: The model shows that this division of labour boosts the aggregate rate of cargo <b>delivery</b> when the <b>round</b> trip time a provisioner saves by not having to forage for its own fuel more than offsets the required allocation of group members to exclusive fuel collection. We note that groups with this provisioning division of labour are common in social insects, but appear absent among vertebrates. Several hypotheses may explain this marked difference.

It has already reached the required technology readiness level of 5. As of 2008, the {{cased ammunition}} has been tested {{for a wide range}} of operating temperatures, and it has had over 9000 rounds fired (approximately 6500 rounds of Spiral 1 ammunition, and over 2000 of Spiral 2). The second spiral version of the cased ammunition produced a 33% weight reduction (falling just short of the program goal), while the ongoing development of the third spiral of cased ammunition has achieved a roughly 40% reduction. The third spiral is also 30% smaller than standard ammunition. The improvement by the third spiral of cased ammunition over the second spiral was achieved partially by compacting and consolidating the propellant (thereby allowing a smaller cartridge case and round). Having reached a sufficient technology readiness level, the Spiral 2 ammunition is being prepared for a contracted 2000 <b>round</b> <b>delivery.</b> The cased ammunition has shown itself as a virtually risk free option, with present and potential ability grounded in success.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{communication}} literature currently focuses {{primarily on}} improving physicians' verbal and non-verbal behaviors during the medical interview. The Four Habits Model is a {{teaching and research}} framework for physician communication {{that is based on}} evidence linking specific communication behaviors with processes and outcomes of care. The Model conceptualizes basic communication tasks as "Habits" and describes the sequence of physician communication behaviors during the clinical encounter associated with improved outcomes. Using the Four Habits Model as a starting point, we asked communication experts to identify the verbal communication behaviors of patients that are important in outpatient encounters. Methods We conducted a 4 -round Delphi process with 17 international experts in communication research, medical education, and health care <b>delivery.</b> All <b>rounds</b> were conducted via the internet. In round 1, experts reviewed a list of proposed patient verbal communication behaviors within the Four Habits Model framework. The proposed patient verbal communication behaviors were identified based on a review of the communication literature. The experts could: approve the proposed list; add new behaviors; or modify behaviors. In rounds 2, 3, and 4, they rated each behavior for its fit (agree or disagree) with a particular habit. After each round, we calculated the percent agreement for each behavior and provided these data in the next round. Behaviors receiving more than 70 % of experts' votes (either agree or disagree) were considered as achieving consensus. Results Of the 14 originally-proposed patient verbal communication behaviors, the experts modified all but 2, and they added 20 behaviors to the Model in round 1. In round 2, they were presented with 59 behaviors and 14 options to remove specific behaviors for rating. After 3 rounds of rating, the experts retained 22 behaviors. This set included behaviors such as asking questions, expressing preferences, and summarizing information. Conclusion The process identified communication tasks and verbal communication behaviors for patients similar to those outlined for physicians in the Four Habits Model. This represents an important step in building a single model that can be applied to teaching patients and physicians the communication skills associated with improved satisfaction and positive outcomes of care. </p...|$|R
