50|$|As Las Vegas boomed, {{more recent}} {{buildings}} tended to {{take inspiration from}} a variety of styles. The Clark County Government Center has a red sandstone exterior invoking a desert motif. The Smith Center for the Performing Arts, opened in 2012, is a more modern example of Art Deco design.

40|$|The health {{promotion}} field is often criticized for focusing on lifestyle change while ignoring contextual forces that influence health. Social ecological models recognize indi-viduals as embedded within larger social systems {{and describe the}} interactive characteristics of individuals and environments that underlie health outcomes (Sallis, Owen, & Fisher, 2008; Stokols, 1992). More than 20 years ago, an issue of this journal was dedicated to the exploration of an ecological model <b>for</b> <b>health</b> promotion. <b>Building</b> {{on the work of}} Urie Brofenbrenner (1977), who had previously articulated a multilevel framework, McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, and Glanz (1988) offered five levels of influence specific to health behavior: intrapersonal factors, interper-sonal processes and primary groups, institutional factors, community factors, and public policy...|$|R

50|$|On 31 July 1965, a new Lady Musgrave Maternity Ward {{was opened}} on {{land to the}} north of North Street, {{acquired}} by the hospital for the planning of this new wing.

The application of the AgBB evaluation scheme to other types of building materials is expected in the near future. Therefore, exemplary investigations for typical lacquer systems were carried out according to the AgBB scheme. The scheme evaluates the VOC/SVOC emissions after 3 and 28 days.

40|$|AbstractDue to {{a growing}} concern towards issues of {{sustainability}} and sustainable development as well as resource scarcity {{there is a need}} for increased local cultivation. Cold climate conditions in Sweden make greenhouses necessary for the cultivation of many species. In order to increase the sustainability of greenhouse production processes water cycles should be nearly closedloop cycles. To demonstrate this in practice the Berga Greenhouse project under development by the Centre <b>for</b> <b>Health</b> and <b>Building</b> at the Royal Institute of Technology is used to provide a visionary example. Through precipitation data and a water budget analysis a water reclamation rate of 85 % was determined in order to bring the facility to water neutral status. On site water treatment through the use of ecological engineering was analyzed through the use of a multiple-case study of three prevalent technologies (Living Machines®, Organica Water, and Solar Aquatics™) which determined that Living Machines® was the most appropriate technology based upon factors related system performance and footprint...|$|R

50|$|Since the David H. Murdock Research Core Laboratory, the North Carolina State University Plants <b>for</b> Human <b>Health</b> <b>building</b> and the UNC Chapel Hill Nutrition Research Institute {{first opened}} in 2008, the LabCorp Biorepository and the Rowan-Cabarrus Biotechnology and Nurse Training Center have opened on campus. In 2012, the {{headquarters}} of the Cabarrus Health Alliance, the regional public health authority, opened. In summer 2013, a 60,000 square foot Class A medical office building will open with Carolinas Healthcare System as the main tenant. A 1,500 square-foot speculative laboratory with flexible space that can house one to three companies was announced in November 2012 and a second space is in the planning stages, both labs are in the core lab building. The city of Kannapolis is planning a new city hall and police station on the North Carolina Research Campus on land given to them by David H. Murdock. The new building will also expand the campus’ available meeting and conference space. In all, the campus has close to 900,000 square feet built out.Additional opportunities for partnering organizations and campus growth include additional wet lab, medical and office space and a wellness center, conference center, retail corridor and residential housing adjacent to campus.|$|R

40|$|Shifts in economics, demographics, and {{lifestyle}} in America have lead {{to changes in}} this country 2 ̆ 7 s urban landscape. Rural and urban populations have migrated toward the suburbs and concentrated metro areas, leaving holes in the urban fabric of small and midsized cities. Often these empty spaces become drivers of blight, crime, and discouragement in the community. The goal of the Grow Pods Project is to transform the negative of vacant urban lots into an opportunity <b>for</b> improving <b>health,</b> <b>building</b> community, and encouraging positive growth. As a tool for integrating the food system directly into the urban context, this project addresses the need for innovative solutions to the complex issues of city land use. Grow Pods aim to help communities redirect a trajectory of decline toward a future that {{is focused on the}} health and wellbeing of the urban environment and {{the people who live in}} it. Transformation and transportability are intrinsic features of the design, in acknowledgement of the necessity for any component of a contemporary city in flux to be dynamic enough to reinvent itself within its evolving context. The Grow Pod project is focused on the South End Neighborhood of Springfield, MA, a city whose population and industrial base has decreased since much of its infrastructure was designed. Located in the fertile Connecticut River Valley, it is also in a region with a rich agricultural history...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: Recognize {{the domains}} of health {{promotion}} core competencies in the training process of adolescents carried out by nursing students. Method: Qualitative and descriptive study, which used the theoretical methodological contribution Developing Competencies and Professional Standards <b>for</b> <b>Health</b> Promotion Capacity <b>Building</b> in Europe (CompHP), carried out with 14 nursing students. Results: There were four domains: Enable Change; Mediate through Partnership; Communication; and Leadership. These domains came from the interest and commitment of adolescents in intersectoral partnership, the use of communication techniques, {{and the role of}} facilitator to catalyze learning and empowerment. Conclusion: There were some domains of core competency in the training of adolescents, suggesting that nursing students act as <b>health</b> promoters. Challenges <b>for</b> Nursing are the implementation of a theoretical contribution of CompHP in undergraduate and ongoing training to carry out health promotion action...|$|R
