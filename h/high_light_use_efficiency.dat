40|$|Aims Our {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} threshold effects of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and soil mass water content (Wm) on photosynthetic and physiological parameters of Prunus sibirica, and understand the adaptability of P. sibirica to light and soil moisture conditions. We determined optimal Wm and PAR for P. sibirica to maintain higher net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and water use efficiency (WUE). Methods Using CIRAS- 2 portable photosynthesis system, we measured Pn, transpiration rate (Tr), WUE and other photosynthetic and physiological parameters of three-year-old P. sibirica under different soil moisture conditions. Important findings Pn, Tr and WUE of P. sibirica had the critical response to soil moisture content and PAR. With increases in Wm (6. 5 %– 18. 6 %), the light compensation point decreased and light saturation point, apparent quantum yield and maximum Pn increased. When Wm was about 18. 6 %, the low and <b>high</b> <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> of P. sibirica was maximal. The index of Pn, Tr obviously increased with increasing Wm (9. 2 % to 18. 6 %), but Pn, Tr decreased when Wm was too high or low. When PAR ranged from 800 to 1 200 μmol·m– 2 ·s– 1, Pn and WUE were higher and the light saturation points of Pn and WUE were from 983 to 1 365 μmol·m– 2 ·s– 1. These indicated that P. sibirica possessed higher adaptability to light conditions. Based on photosynthetic and physiological parameters, the soil water availability and productivity of P. sibirica were classified and evaluated. For P. sibirica woodland, 22. 3 % were low productivity and middle WUE, 20. 5 %– 22. 3 % was middle productivity and low WUE, 9. 2 %– 12. 9 % of Wm was middle productivity and middle WUE and 12. 9 %– 20. 5 % of Wm was high productivity and high WUE.

The results showed that the leaf photosynthetic rate and WUE of Z. jujuba had a significant response to MWC and PAR.

Snow fences were used to increase the accumulation of snow on a subarctic permafrost mire in northern Sweden. By measuring reflected photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) the effect of snow thickness and associated delay of {{the start of the}} growing season was assessed in terms of absorbed PAR and estimated gross primary production (GPP). Six plots experienced increased snow accumulation and six plots were untreated. Incoming and reflected PAR was logged hourly from August 2010 to October 2013. In 2010 PAR measurements were coupled with flux chamber measurements to assess GPP and <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the plots. The increased snow thickness prolonged the duration of the snow cover in spring. The delay of the growing season start in the treated plots was 18 days in 2011, 3 days in 2012 and 22 days in 2013. Results show higher PAR absorption, together with almost 35 % <b>higher</b> <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency,</b> in treated plots compared to untreated plots.

40|$|The high-energy {{consumption}} of plant factory {{is the biggest}} issue for its rapidly expanding, especially for the lighting electricity, which have been solved {{to a large extent}} by light-emitting diodes (LED). However, remarkable potentiality in energy saving remains to be further investigated. In this study, an optical system applied just below LED was designed. The effects of the system on growth and photosynthesis of butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. capitata) were examined, and the performances of the optical improvement on energy saving were evaluated by comparison with the traditional LED illumination mode. The irradiation patterns used were LED with zoom lenses (Z-LED) and conventional non-lenses LED (C-LED). Seedlings in both treatments were exposed to the same light environment during the entire growth period. The improvement saved over half of the light source electricity, while lower the temperature of Z-LED prominently. Influenced by this, the photosynthesis sharply decreased and further caused reduction in plant yield and nitrate content, while exhibited no negative effects on morphological parameters and photosynthetic pigment contents.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} can {{be increased}} either by increasing the production per m 2 or by reducing the energy input per m 2, e. g. by reducing temperature set-points in the greenhouse. So far, in Dutch glasshouse tomatoes energy efficiency was almost exclusively raised by yield increases. To study the role of tomato breeding in this production increase, yield and underlying components of 7 cultivars released between 1950 and 2002 were studied. Furthermore, variation in temperature response between cultivars was studied. In three experiments yield and biomass production of in total 11 cultivars were evaluated at two temperature regimes (17 / 15 °C and 21 / 19 °C day/night temperature set-points). Breeding {{has resulted in a}} remarkable increase in production. Under current conditions, yield of modern cultivars was on average 40 % higher than yield of `Moneymaker¿, released in 1950. This increase in production resulted from a <b>higher</b> <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Although the fraction of assimilates partitioned to the fruits showed small differences between cultivars, this trait was not related to year of release. Furthermore, more recently introduced cultivars produced larger fruits rather than more fruits.

40|$|Beyond their undeniable role, {{nowadays}} we {{also must}} look to seagrass beds as endangered environments with urgent monitoring and conservation needs. In {{the present study}} Z. noltii photochemical performance of under different stages of development/recovery was assessed and its results applied {{in the development of}} a photochemical stress index (PSI) to classify and efficiently assess the physiological condition of seagrass beds. In order to investigate deeper into this metabolic network the JIP-test was applied, allowing to identify the reasons underlying the first signs of stress. Less developed beds low connectivity between PS II antennae leading inevitably to an impairment of the energetic transport. Associated to this also the quinone pool showed severe depletion both in number and function. Alongside the Kstep presence in the Kautsky curve points to severe damage at donor side of the PS II, where the Oxygen Evolving Complexes (OECs) are located. All these negative impacts increase the quantum yield of the nonphotochemical reactions in stressed/less developed seagrass beds. In sum, more developed beds show proportionally <b>higher</b> <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiencies</b> promoted by a higher number of oxidized reaction centres coupled with an enhanced capacity in using the generated electron potential and relatively lower energy dissipations. Coupling all the photochemical into an Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR) approach, a photochemical stress index (PSI) was produced.

40|$|During {{the winter}} 2014 - 2015 a {{research}} was conducted at a commercial rose nursery {{to learn more about}} the influence of a special lamp light spectrum on the production and quality of the rose Avalanche. A “hybrid” lighting system was installed with 103 µmol /m 2 s PAR from High Pressure Sodium and from Valoya LED lamp G 1 in two different intensities: 57 or 103 µmol /m 2 s PAR. Compared with the conventional installation of the company (191 micromol SON-T), the spectrum of the hybrid installation allowed, depending on the intensity of the added LED, a 7. 2 % to 9 % <b>higher</b> <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> (LUE) by the crop.

Valoya is already working on this improvement. The performed plant measurements (SPAD, bud temperature, photosynthesis, leaf area, etc.) do not contribute to explain this positive effect. More research about the effects of light colour on the rose production is needed. Remaining questions are if other rose varieties react the same to the combined spectrum, if the crop can grow more compact in winter when there is more blue in the spectrum, and if a larger proportion of far-red light could make the flowers even heavier, with a larger flower bud.

Here, we studied 9 -year time-series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on a network of 16 stands in fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations in São Paulo State, Brazil. We aimed to examine the relationships between NDVI time-series spanning entire rotations and stand structural characteristics (volume, dominant height, mean annual increment) in these simple forest ecosystems. Our second objective was to examine spatial and temporal variations of <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> for wood production, by comparing time-series of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (APAR) with inventory data. Relationships were calibrated between the NDVI and the fractions of intercepted diffuse and direct radiation, using hemispherical photographs taken on the studied stands at two seasons. APAR was calculated from the NDVI time-series using these relationships. Stem volume and dominant height were strongly correlated with summed NDVI values between planting date and inventory date. Stand productivity was correlated with mean NDVI values. APAR during the first 2 years of growth was variable between stands and was well correlated with stem wood production (r 2 = 0. 78). In contrast, APAR during the following years was less variable and not significantly correlated with stem biomass increments. Production of wood per unit of absorbed light varied with stand age and with site index. In our study, a better site index was accompanied both by increased APAR during the first 2 years of growth and by <b>higher</b> <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> for stem wood production during the whole rotation.

40|$|The {{cultivated}} strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) in {{the northeastern}} United States has seen limited improvement in yield over the past century. Narrow germplasm diversity has been suggested to be a possible limitation and has resulted in evaluation of the progenitor species: F. chiloensis and F. virginiana for desirable characteristics. One of the possible avenues explored to improve the productivity of the cultivated strawberry {{is to increase the}} photosynthetic capacity through the use of F. chiloensis which has a high photosynthetic capacity. Previous research has relied exclusively on gas exchange data to quantify photosynthetic capacity; however, due to the complexity of regulatory processes that influence gas exchange it is difficult to identify the basis of the different gas exchange rates observed. Evaluation of the strawberry cultivar 'Jewel' and the two progenitor species was conducted to determine the basis of the observed differences in photosynthetic capacity. Results of this research suggest that the high photosynthetic capacity of F. chiloensis may be a based on <b>higher</b> <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency,</b> determined by chlorophyll fluorescence, and increased activity of key enzymes of the Calvin Cycle. As these photosynthetic parameters are based on gene expression, these higher rates may be genetically heritable. In order to determine the most effective use of the wild species to improve the cultivated strawberry, a field study of cultivars released during the last century was established to evaluate changes in horticultural and physiological characteristics that have occurred and to identify possible limitations to productivity. Results indicated that limited changes have occurred in carbon allocation patterns and photosynthetic characteristics and suggest that there may be opportunity to increase the productivity through altering carbon allocation patterns and increasing fruit number. The lack of change in photosynthesis suggests that improving photosynthetic capacity of the cultivated strawberry may lead to increased productivity. Further research evaluating hybrids of F. chiloensis and the cultivated strawberry may allow us to better exploit this characteristic...|$|R

40|$|Intracanopy {{lighting}} is a recently developed supplementary lighting technique for high-wire grown vegetable production in greenhouses where {{a part of}} the lamps is mounted within instead of above the canopy. A potentially <b>higher</b> yield <b>using</b> intracanopy <b>lighting</b> compared with top-lighting, is based on three assumptions: (1) increased light-absorption by the crop; (2) a <b>higher</b> photosynthetic <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> due to a more homogeneous vertical light distribution; (3) a preserved photosynthetic capacity of leaves deeper in the canopy. We used an explanatory crop model to quantify the relative importance of these assumptions for a cucumber crop during an experiment in winter in the Netherlands (Trouwborst et al., 2010). Photosynthesis and yield data of this intracanopy lighting experiment with light-emitting diodes (34 % of supplemental PAR) in combination with top-lighting (66 % of supplemental PAR) were used to parameterise our model. In that study intracanopy lighting did not result in an increased yield compared with 100 % top-lighting due to extreme leaf curling and a lower dry matter partitioning to the fruits. Our model predicted an 8 % increase in fruit yield for the intracanopy lighting treatment if there were to be no leaf curling and no lower dry matter partitioning. This increase can be largely explained by the change in light distribution and light absorption. The model further revealed unexpectedly large consequences of the lower dry matter partitioning to the fruits whereas the negative effect of leaf curling was small. The direct effect of a greater Amax at deeper canopy layers was slightly positive. The last however might have indirectly caused the greater partitioning to the leaves as the greater Amax was associated with a preserved leaf mass per area. Solutions for this problem are discussed. Our explanatory model allowed us to disentangle the interacting effects of intracanopy lighting on fruit yield.

40|$|Key words: Cucumis sativus, intracanopy lighting, {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs), light distribution, light interception, light quality, photosynthesis, photosynthetic acclimation Assimilation lighting is a production factor of increasing importance in Dutch greenhouse horticulture. Assimilation lighting increases production levels, improves product quality and opens possibilities for year round production. As a drawback, this <b>use</b> of assimilation <b>lighting</b> increases energy inputs and CO 2 -emission. Intracanopy lighting (with LEDs) {{is a technique}} to enhance the <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> by changing the position of (a part of) the lamps from above to within the canopy of greenhouse grown crops. Intracanopy lighting (IL) firstly reduces reflection and transmission losses of the supplemental lighting on crop level. These losses are high in traditional top-lighting systems, hence IL yields a <b>higher</b> <b>light</b> absorption on crop level. Secondly, IL creates a more homogenous vertical light distribution which can result in <b>higher</b> <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> The aim of {{present study was to}} obtain insights in photosynthetic acclimation in response to irradiance level and spectrum in the framework of the applicability of LEDs as light source for intracanopy lighting in indeterminate growing vegetable crops. Intracanopy lighting may vary in (1) position within the crop, in (2) irradiance level and in (3) spectrum. Leaves deeper in the canopy are older. If leaf age negatively affects the photosynthetic capacity (Amax), then potential positions of IL-lamps reduce. By growing tomato plants horizontally so that irradiance was similar for all leaves from 0 - 70 days old, it is concluded that during the normal life-span of tomato leaves in cultivation, irradiance and not ageing is the most important factor affecting Amax. In winter, natural irradiances are low so that new developing leaves acclimate to low irradiances. Later on in their life time these leaves could be exposed to higher irradiances owing to IL. The question arose if cucumber leaves which develop under low irradiance can acclimate to a moderate irradiance. Acclimation of photosynthesis occurred within 7 days but photosynthesis at moderate irradiance and Amax did not reach to that of leaves developed under moderate irradiance. This reveals the importance of photosynthetic acclimation during the leaf developmental phase for crop productivity in scenarios with realistic, moderate fluctuations in irradiance that leaves can be exposed to. By growing plants under seven different combinations of red and blue light, blue light is shown to have both a qualitative and a quantitative effect on leaf development. Only leaves developed under red light (0 % blue) displayed a dysfunctional photosynthetic operation (“red light syndrome”), which was largely alleviated by only 7 % blue. Quantitatively, leaf responses to an increasing blue light percentage resembled responses associated with an increase in irradiance. Leaves developed under red light exposed to a mixture of red and blue (RB) completely recovered within 4 days after exposure to RB-light but remained limited in other leaf parameters, showing limitations in plasticity due to constraints arising from the prior leaf development. Leaves developed under RB also revealed the “red light syndrome” within 7 days of red illumination. Lastly, the effects of intracanopy lighting with LEDs on the production and development of a cucumber crop was investigated in winter. In the IL-treatment, LEDs supplied 38 % of the supplemental irradiance within the canopy; the remaining 62 % was supplied as top lighting by High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) lamps. The control was 100 % top lighting (HPS lamps). Intracanopy lighting resulted in a greater Amax for leaves at deeper canopy layers but did not increase total biomass or fruit production. This was partly due to a reduced light interception caused by extreme leaf curling, which counteracted the expected <b>higher</b> <b>light</b> absorption by the crop, and partly to a lower dry matter partitioning to the fruits, and thus a greater dry matter partitioning to the leaves compared to the control. The effect of these factors on fruit yield was quantified using a explanatory crop model. Model calculations revealed a large negative effect on the fruit yield due to the greater partitioning to the leaves, whereas the negative effect of leaf curling was small. The effect of a greater Amax at deeper canopy layers was slightly positive. The last however might have indirectly caused the greater partitioning to the leaves as the greater Amax was associated with a preserved leaf mass per area.  ...|$|R

SIF was determined by application of the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) Principal to above-canopy spectra acquired with an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) Fieldspec spectroradiometer (3. 2 nm resolution with 1. 2 nm sampling interval). SIF retrievals were made at the two atmospheric oxygen (O 2) absorption features {{that occur in the}} {{chlorophyll fluorescence}} (ChlF) region (660 - 780 nm). These telluric features are 02 V, the broader and deeper feature centered at 760 nm, but located on the shoulder of the far-red ChlF peak at 740 nm; and 023, a narrow feature centered at 688 nm that is positioned near the red ChlF peak at 685 nm. Supporting, coincident leaf level fluorescence, reflectance, photochemical and other measurements were also made. At the leaf level, these measurements included in situ photosynthetic capacity (Pmax) and light adapted total chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs') collected at steady state under <b>high</b> <b>light</b> and controlled chamber conditions (e. g., temperature, PAR, humidity, and COz); optical properties (reflectance, transmittance, absorptance); chlorophyll and carotenoid content; specific leaf mass; carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content; fluorescence emission spectra at multiple excitation wavelengths; the ChlF contribution to red (R) and far-red (FR) reflectance; fluorescence imagery; and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs). The tree species examined were tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraczflua L.), and each had been provided four levels of N augmentation (0, 19, 37, and 75 kg Nhectare seasonally) to simulate atmospheric deposition from air pollution. Whole-plant SIF measurements of these species were compared with SIF estimates derived using FluorMOD, a radiative transfer model that includes fluorescence properties of foliage, when provided with our supporting measurements. Simulated values for SIF were also compared with similar estimates made over three years for corn (Zea mays L) crops under N treatments (20, 50, 70, and 140 kg Nhectare) and with corn and pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) plants provided dimethyl urea (DCMU, 0 and 5 x 10 " M) which were grown in pots and grouped in artificial canopies for spectral measurements. For near-surface measurements of healthy and stressed vegetation, red SIF retrieved at 688 nm (023) varied between 2 - 7 mW/m(exp 2) /nm/sr while far-red SIF retrieved at 760 nm (O 2 A) varied between 0. 5 and 4. 0 mW/m(exp 2) /nm/sr.

This modelling approach would avoid the complications that are involved in using me- teorological data as constraints for a fixed maximum LUE. However, no unifying model predicting LUE across climate zones and time based on MODIS PRI has been published to date. This study evaluates the effectiveness with which MODIS-based PRI can be used to estimate ecosystem <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> at study sites of different plant functional types and vegetation densities. The objective is to examine if known limitations such as dependence on viewing and illumination geometry can be overcome and a single PRI-based model of LUE (i. e. based on the same reference band) can be applied under a wide range of conditions. Fur- thermore, this thesis examines the effect of using different fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (faPAR) products on the in-situ LUE used as ground truth and thus on the whole evaluation exercise. The conclusion of this study is that estimating LUE at site-level based on PRI reduces uncertainty compared to the approaches relying on a maximum LUE reduced by minimum temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Despite the advantages of using PRI to estimate LUE at site-level, a universally applicable <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> model based on MODIS PRI could not be established. Models that were optimised for a pool of data from several sites did not perform well...|$|R

This limited understanding is partly {{a result of the}} challenges associated with in situ flux studies. Tower-based carbon dioxide eddy covariance (EC) systems are installed in only a few mangrove forests worldwide and the longest EC record from the Florida Everglades contains less than 9 yr of observations. A primary goal {{of the present study was}} to develop a methodology to estimate canopy-scale photosynthetic <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> in this forest. These tower-based observations represent a basis for associating CO 2 fluxes with canopy <b>light</b> <b>use</b> properties, and thus provide the means for utilizing satellite-based reflectance data for larger-scale investigations. We present a model for mangrove canopy <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> utilizing the enhanced green vegetation index (EVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) that is capable of predicting changes in mangrove forest CO 2 fluxes caused by a hurricane disturbance and changes in regional environmental conditions, including temperature and salinity. Model parameters are solved for in a Bayesian framework. The model structure requires estimates of ecosystem respiration (R E) and we present the first-ever tower-based estimates of mangrove forest R E derived from night-time CO 2 fluxes. Our investigation is also the first to show the effects of salinity on mangrove forest CO 2 uptake, which declines 5 % per each 10 parts per thousand (ppt) increases in salinity. <b>Light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> in this forest declines with increasing daily photosynthetic active radiation, which is an important departure from the assumption of constant <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> typically applied in satellite-driven models.

Typically, the model parameters, such as the maximum <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency,</b> are either set to a universal constant or to land class dependent values stored in look-up tables. In this study, we employ the machine learning technique support vector regression to explicitly relate the model parameters of a <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> model calibrated at several FLUXNET sites to site-specific characteristics obtained by meteorological measurements, ecological estimations and remote sensing data. A feature selection algorithm extracts the relevant site characteristics in a cross-validation, and leads to an individual set of characteristic attributes for each parameter. With this set of attributes, the model parameters can be estimated at sites where a parameter calibration is not possible due to the absence of eddy covariance flux measurement data. This will finally allow a spatially continuous model application. The performance of the spatial extrapolation scheme is evaluated with a cross-validation approach, which shows the methodology to be well suited to recapture the variability of gross primary production across the study sites...|$|R

Using a kinetic model and literature-derived experimental data from wild type Chlorella sorokiniana, the productivity and competition of wild type cells and antenna size mutants were simulated. Cultivation was simulated in an outdoor microalgal raceway pond production system which was assumed to be limited by light only. Light conditions were based on a Mediterranean location (Tunisia) and a more temperate location (the Netherlands). Several wild type contamination levels were simulated in each mutant culture separately to predict the effect on the productivity over the cultivation time of a hypothetical summer season of 100 days. The simulations demonstrate a good potential of antenna size reduction to increase the biomass productivity of microalgal cultures. However, it was also found that after a contamination with wild type cells the mutant cultures will be rapidly overgrown resulting in productivity loss. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> (LUE) {{models are}} widely used to {{simulate}} gross primary production (GPP). However, {{the treatment of the}} plant canopy as a big leaf by these models can introduce large uncertainties in simulated GPP. Recently, a two-leaf <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> (TL-LUE) model was developed to simulate GPP separately for sunlit and shaded leaves and has been shown to outperform the big-leaf MOD 17 model at six FLUX sites in China. In this study we investigated the performance of the TL-LUE model for a wider range of biomes. For this we optimized the parameters and tested the TL-LUE model using data from 98 FLUXNET sites which are distributed across the globe. The results showed that the TL-LUE model performed in general better than the MOD 17 model in simulating 8 [*]day GPP. Optimized maximum <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> of shaded leaves (εmsh) was 2. 63 to 4. 59 times that of sunlit leaves (εmsu). Generally, the relationships of εmsh and εmsu with εmax were well described by linear equations, indicating the existence of general patterns across biomes. GPP simulated by the TL-LUE model was much less sensitive to biases in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) input than the MOD 17 model. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the proposed TL-LUE model has the potential for simulating regional and global GPP of terrestrial ecosystems, and it is more robust with regard to usual biases in input data than existing approaches which neglect the bimodal within-canopy distribution of PAR.

To better understand forest productivity, studies at the stand scale need to be coupled with tree level evaluations of the production ecology (the assessment of wood production as a function of crown light absorption and <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency).</b> The soil clay content (_ 20 % to _ 40 %), topography and historical land use of the experimental site generated a natural gradient in productivity.

We investigated the hypothesis that dominant trees (the 20 % largest) are more productive than non-dominant trees (the 20 % smallest) as a result of greater light absorption and <b>light</b> <b>use</b> efficiency; and that with increasing productivity across plots, dominant trees would show larger increases in <b>light</b> <b>use</b> and <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> in comparison to non-dominant trees.

The smallest trees contained 7. 2 % of the leaf area as compared to the largest trees (3. 0 m 2 versus 41. 7 m 2), and they absorbed only 6. 7 % as much light (2. 2 versus 32. 8 GJ year_ 1). The smallest trees grew at about 4. 7 % of the rate of the largest trees, which is a smaller percentage than the difference in absorbed photosynthetically active radiation; therefore the <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> was lower for the smallest trees (0. 75 kg GJ_ 1 versus 1. 03 kg GJ_ 1).
