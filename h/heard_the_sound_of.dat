5|$|Abu-Jamal did {{not make}} any public {{statements}} about Faulkner's murder until May 2001. In his version of events, he claimed that {{he was sitting in}} his cab across the street when he heard shouting, then saw a police vehicle, and <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> gunshots. Upon seeing his brother appearing disoriented across the street, Abu-Jamal ran to him from the parking lot and was shot by a police officer. Abu-Jamal's brother William Cook, who had been stopped by the police officer, did not testify or make any statement until April 29, 2001. At that time {{he said that he had}} not seen who had shot Faulkner.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended its way through the mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|Just after midday, the 21st Panzer Division {{received}} {{permission to}} attack the landings. Luck ordered the 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment, east of the River Orne, towards the bridges. The column was quickly spotted, and engaged {{for the next two}} hours by Allied artillery and aircraft causing heavy losses. The 1st Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment and the 100th Panzer Regiment, attacking from west of the canal, had more success reaching the beaches between the British landing area of Sword and the Canadian Juno. At 13:30, the men at the bridges <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> bagpipes, played by Bill Millin of the 1st Commando Brigade. As the commandos arrived, they crossed the bridges and joined the rest of 6th Airborne Division defending the eastern perimeter. Some of the tanks accompanying the commandos moved into Bénouville to reinforce its defences, while others crossed the bridges with the commandos. At 15:00, a boat loaded with German infantry approached from Caen. It was engaged with the anti-tank gun manned by number One Platoon, hit in the stern by the second round fired and then retreated back toward Caen.|$|E
60|$|As D'Arnot {{watched the}} spot where the body had entered <b>the</b> tree he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> {{movement}} there.|$|R
60|$|Another day passed quietly, {{and then}} {{during the night}} <b>the</b> watch <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> blows with axes, and of falling trees.|$|R
60|$|Saluting, he too {{passed away}} into the dark, and {{presently}} I <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> spear-blades striking together and of rifles being cocked.|$|R
5|$|Zieten {{then decided}} to pull back his forces towards the village of Fromentières. There, Zieten was joined by Generals Kleist and Kapsevitch, who, having <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the guns, had begun to move their {{respective}} Army Corps in that direction, coming from Champaubert. The French also moved forward, with Marmont's two divisions (Lagrange and Ricard) in pursuit of Zieten, {{along the road to}} Fromentières. Marmont was now supported on his left by General Grouchy, who had just arrived on the field of battle with the divisions of Saint-Germain and Doumerc, moving past the village of Janvilliers, in order to cut off Zieten's retreat. Further French reinforcements were now available, this time on Marmont's right: the division of Leval, who had been steadily moving up the valley of the Petit Morin river, in a bid to outflank the Prussians. With the French Imperial Guard artillery now also deployed and firing at them, Zieten's Prussians drew back in good order, and formed in squares to fend off Grouchy's cavalry. Towards 2 o'clock in the afternoon, after assessing the situation, Blücher realised that he was facing Napoleon himself and thus decided to immediately withdraw. He ordered all of his forces to retreat through Champaubert and directed a part of his artillery to safety, towards Étoges.|$|E
25|$|Xun Xu was {{in charge}} of music arrangement. Some of the pieces he {{arranged}} became widespread. He once <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a cowbell ringing and thought of using cowbells as an instrument to fine tune musical pieces.|$|E
25|$|On 11 February 1858, Soubirous {{went with}} her sisters Toinette and Jeanne Abadie to collect some {{firewood}} and bones in order to buy some bread. After taking off her shoes and stockings to wade through the water near the Grotto of Massabielle, she said she <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> two gusts of wind (coups de vent) but the trees and bushes nearby did not move. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move.|$|E
6000|$|... "Physician," [...] {{said the}} {{officer of the}} Guard as I went through the gates, [...] "what passes yonder in the Monument? Methought I <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> death." ...|$|R
60|$|Leaving the stateroom {{they were}} in, {{they went out}} on deck and began to untie the houseboat. While they were doing so they <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> two horses approaching.|$|R
60|$|As {{he moved}} {{cautiously}} along {{the stone floor}} the loud barking of the little black dog, kept by the watchman, told that his sharp ears had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> his steps.|$|R
25|$|Murray met no {{resistance}} at Whalers Gate, {{but as he}} approached Waireka he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> rapid firing towards the coast. He entrenched his men and opened fire on the Kaipopo pā with a rocket tube. The gunfire Murray heard was being exchanged between about 200 Māori warriors—who, armed mostly with double-barrel shotguns and some rifles, were firing from the cover of bush and flax in the river gully—and the militia and Volunteers, who had retreated {{to the safety of}} the farmhouse of settler John Jury. Most of the battle took place on the flat farm land below the pa.|$|E
25|$|Infuriated {{that his}} orders were being defied and a golden {{opportunity}} was being lost, Bragg issued new orders for Hindman to attack early September 11. Cleburne, who was not sick as Hill had claimed, cleared the felled timber from Dug Gap and prepared to advance when he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> Hindman's guns. By this time, however, Baird's division had reached Negley's, and Negley had withdrawn his division to a defensive position {{just east of the}} crossroads. The two Union divisions then withdrew to Stevens Gap. Hindman's men skirmished with Baird's rear guard, but could not prevent the withdrawal of the Union force.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Broughton returned, about 25 minutes later, Bessie Smith was in shock. Time passed {{with no sign}} of the ambulance, so Hugh Smith {{suggested}} that they take her into Clarksdale in his car. He and Broughton had almost finished clearing the back seat when they <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a car approaching at high speed. Smith flashed his lights in warning, but the oncoming car failed to stop and plowed into his car at full speed. It sent his car careening into Bessie Smith's overturned Packard, completely wrecking it. The oncoming car ricocheted off Hugh Smith's car into the ditch on the right, barely missing Broughton and Bessie Smith.|$|E
60|$|Goro {{was nearly}} gone when <b>the</b> apes <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{approach}} {{through the trees}} of the two they awaited, and presently Tarzan, followed by Taug, swung into a nearby tree.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{so long to}} be able to talk to you again; all {{the others}} come and visit me, but I have only <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> your {{footsteps}} as you pass by." ...|$|R
60|$|A <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> {{footsteps}} broke <b>the</b> hush. They {{could see}} a figure on the path below. It stopped, seemed to consider, vanished. They <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> groping hands, of a creaking door, of uncertain feet on the stairs.|$|R
25|$|At {{some point}} during August and September, Sadie and Wyatt may have become friends and perhaps more seriously involved. Writer Alan Barra {{suggests}} that Behan and Earp knew of their mutual attraction to the same woman before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, which {{may have contributed to}} their animosity. Josephine is quoted in I Married Wyatt Earp as saying that on October 26, 1881, the day of the shootout at the O.K. Corral, she was at her home when she <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> gunfire. Running into town {{in the direction of the}} shots, Josephine was relieved to see that Wyatt was uninjured.|$|E
25|$|Despite Sheridan's later {{criticism}} of Warren for moving slowly and his removal of Warren from command the next day, when {{at the end}} of the Battle of White Oak Road Warren <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the distant battle receding toward Dinwiddie Court House, he sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett's brigade of Griffin's division to reinforce Sheridan intending that Bartlett attack Pickett's flank. Moving cross country, Bartlett's men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau's farm, just east of Crump Road. Since it was dark when Bartlett's men reach Gravelly Run, they did not try to cross but engaged the Confederates on the other side with sniper fire. The dark night hid the size of Bartlett's force from close scrutiny.|$|E
25|$|At {{approximately}} 11:40 (09:40 UTC), Auvinen {{entered the}} school's ground-floor main hallway at Jokela High School, having missed his first lesson. He encountered {{a student in}} the corridor and killed him at 11:42, then moved to the lavatories. Soon after, other students found the victim's body, but assumed he was rendered unconscious from a bump to his head. Other students <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> gunshots, but did not recognise them. At the lavatories, Auvinen fatally shot two more students, prompting the school nurse to call emergency services. After shooting and killing a student outside the lavatory, Auvinen ran after the nurse, caught up to her, and fatally shot her and another student at 11:46.|$|E
60|$|At a {{distance}} <b>the</b> young soldier <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> footsteps, and he rightfully surmised that Barringford was continuing his journey forward, {{with the rest}} of the rangers. Soon <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> died away and all became as silent as the grave.|$|R
60|$|As {{the girl}} turned to bid them good night, {{she thought that}} she saw a shadowy form moving in the {{darkness}} beyond them, and almost simultaneously she was sure that she <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> stealthy movement in the same direction.|$|R
6000|$|Presently, {{through the}} open door of <b>the</b> smoking-room, we <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> {{energetic}} splashings, mingled with the inarticulate groans of the miserable Gumbo. Moore could not sit still, but kept pacing the room, smoking fiercely. Presently Peter came to the door-- ...|$|R
25|$|The next morning, either June 17 or 18, {{the band}} of about 30 Native Americans {{returned}} to their hidden positions and awaited the settlers. When the settlers awoke, Brigham and Phillips went onto the porch of Ament's cabin where they conversed for a few minutes, failing to notice the moccasin tracks around the property. Phillips {{decided to go to}} his cabin, about a half mile (.8km) from Ament's property, to finish a letter to his parents. Brigham, intending to accompany Phillips, entered his cabin for a moment, and once inside he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> musket fire outside. Phillips, mortally wounded, fell to the ground, struck by two musket balls. The band of raiding Native Americans immediately descended upon him with their tomahawks.|$|E
25|$|While Warren's V Corps led by Griffin's {{division}}, {{with help}} from Miles's division of Humphrey's II Corps, turned the Battle of White Oak Road into a Union victory, Sheridan had to save his imperiled troopers who were hard pressed as the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House ended for the day. The Confederates won the day on March 31 at Dinwiddie Court House by pushing the Union cavalry into a tight position. But when Warren <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the distant battle receding toward Dinwiddie Court House, he sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett's brigade of Griffin's division to reinforce Sheridan and attack Pickett's force on its flank. Since it was dark when Bartlett's men reach Gravelly Run, they {{did not try to}} cross but engaged the Confederates on the other side with sniper fire.|$|E
25|$|As Hohenlohe neared Boitzenburg on the 27th, he met Graf von Arnim who {{notified}} {{him that}} he had collected supplies for the hungry soldiers at his manor, the Schloss Boitzenburg. Unfortunately, when the Prussians arrived around 2:00 PM they found that Milhaud's cavalrymen got there first and were pillaging the estate. It took Hohenlohe's advanced guard three hours to drive Milhaud's brigade out of the town. In the meantime, Murat <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the battle and hurried north with Grouchy's dragoons. South of Boitzenburg at Wichmannsdorf, Hohenlohe's right flank guard blundered into Grouchy's column. Three regiments of French dragoons drove the Prussian Gensdarmes Cuirassier Regiment # 10 against a marsh and forced its surrender. But without infantry, Murat was unable to halt Hohenlohe's column from hurrying past toward Prenzlau.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not until}} he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> {{preparation}} for departure that he left the skeleton's tent, and then, with Mr. Stubbs clasped tightly to his breast, he hurried over to the wagon where Old Ben was nearly ready to start.|$|R
60|$|The lads {{were still}} some {{distance}} from the college grounds when they <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> horns and rattles. Then they beheld a glimmer of light down by the river bank. Soon the light brightened until it covered a goodly portion of the sky.|$|R
60|$|Bridge and {{his companions}} <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> a swift and short pursuit {{followed}} by voices, one masterful, the other frightened and whimpering; and a moment afterward the girl reappeared dragging a boy with her--a wide-eyed, terrified, country boy who begged and blubbered to no avail.|$|R
25|$|Within {{minutes of}} {{speaking}} with Custer, Pennington <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> firing, {{followed by the}} appearance of a staff officer who told him that Merritt had sent Pennington's brigade into the attack. Custer said he must be mistaken and rode off. Pennington headed for the front only to find that his brigade in fact had attacked, faltered and was pulling back in confusion. In his after action report, Pennington said the failure to maintain contact with Fitzhugh's brigade, the removal of Capehart's division from his left and the fact his men were running out of ammunition caused the retreat. With Pennington's brigade no longer on his left, Devin had to pull his division back. While the Union forces regrouped, Devin supplied Pennington's men with more ammunition and the Union attack was resumed. After renewing their attack, Pennington's brigade fell back again but Devin's division continued their attack against Steuart's and Wallace's brigades.|$|E
25|$|On 23 May, Ambert and Saint-Cyr <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> gunfire {{and rode}} out to investigate. They {{discovered}} that the Army of the Rhine was under assault to the east. Saint-Cyr convinced Ambert {{that it was time}} to withdraw, since it was likely that their own lines would soon be attacked in force. Before anything more could be done, the Prussian attack materialized. Saint-Cyr successfully managed the retreat of the forward elements behind the Lauter River. Then Ambert determined to retreat in two columns, personally taking the left column while Saint-Cyr led the right column. Möllendorf planned to envelop and capture Ambert's division entirely, sending out Kleist's division to head off the French retreat. A flying column under Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher was sent to cut the link between the two French armies but this effort failed. The French were favored by the terrain in which the roads to the rear went through narrow passages, difficult for a pursuer to follow.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman {{guns from}} No.1 redoubt on Canrobert's hill fired on the Russians at around 06:00 – the Battle of Balaclava had begun. Lucan {{despatched}} Captain Charteris to inform Raglan that the redoubts were under attack. Charteris arrived at around 07:00, but {{those at the}} British headquarters had already <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the guns. Lucan himself rode quickly back towards Kadikoi to confer with Sir Colin Campbell, commander of the Balaclava defences. The two men agreed {{that this was not}} another Russian feint, but an attack in force with the intention of taking the British base. Campbell prepared his 93rd Highlanders to meet the enemy, whilst Lucan returned to the cavalry. Leaving the Light Brigade where it stood, Lucan led the Heavy Brigade towards the redoubts, hoping his presence might discourage any further Russian advance on Balaclava. Realizing his show of strength had little impact, however, Lucan led the Heavies back to their original position alongside the Light Brigade. The Ottoman forces were left to face the full force of the Russian assault almost alone.|$|E
60|$|As {{the hand}} that Hal was fervently kissing was {{withdrawn}} from him he sank upon his face, weeping as one heartbroken. He scarce <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> mounting and <b>the</b> trampling of feet, and when {{he raised his head}} he was alone, the woods and rocks were forsaken.|$|R
60|$|One day, however, as {{they were}} returning, they saw {{a cloud of dust}} in <b>the</b> distance, and <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> drums and fifes playing a joyous tune. Kenton drew the old mare behind the bank of a high hedge, and the boys watched eagerly through the hawthorns.|$|R
60|$|The road {{terminated}} suddenly {{upon the}} beach. The {{man and the}} girl scrambled up a little shingly mound. When at last Winifred <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> their approach, they were already {{between her and the}} house. Any attempt at escape was useless. She came a few steps toward them.|$|R
