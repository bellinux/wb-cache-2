500|$|Actress {{and model}} Sherri Stoner {{served as the}} {{performance}} model for Belle, providing live-action reference for the animators as they drew the character. Belle's tendency to constantly brush her hair {{away from her face}} was also inspired by both Stoner and O'Hara. [...] "I was constantly <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> little quirky things that they would catch," [...] O'Hara told The Guardian. The animators also incorporated O'Hara's eyes, cheekbones {{and the way in which}} she raises her eyebrow into Belle's face. O'Hara felt that Belle originally looked [...] "too perfect," [...] likening the character's appearance to actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Angelina Jolie. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Solomon observed inconsistencies in Belle's appearance, writing, [...] "The prettiest and liveliest Belle waltzes with Beast in his marble ballroom and weeps over his body before he's transformed into the Prince" [...] while [...] "The Belle who receives the library from Beast has wider-set eyes and a more prominent mouth than the noticeably slimmer Belle who sings 'Something There'".|$|E
500|$|Brosnan left Ireland on 12 August 1964 and was {{reunited with}} his mother and her new husband, William Carmichael, now living in the Scottish village of Longniddry, East Lothian. Carmichael took Brosnan to see a James Bond film for the first time (Goldfinger), at the age of 11. Later moving back to London, Brosnan was educated at Elliott School, a state {{comprehensive}} school in Putney, southwest London, now known as Ark Putney Academy. Brosnan has spoken about the transition from Ireland to England and his education in London; [...] "When you go to a very large city, a metropolis like London, as an Irish boy of 10, life suddenly moves pretty fast. From a little school of, say, seven classrooms in Ireland, to this very large comprehensive school, with over 2,000 children. And you're Irish. And they make you feel it; the British have a wonderful way of <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> I had a certain deep sense of being an outsider." [...] When he attended school, his nickname was [...] "Irish".|$|E
500|$|Ortved—using {{interviews}} with writers Bob Kushell and Brent Forrester and Mirkin's assistant Charleen Easton—describes Mirkin as an [...] "outsider" [...] on the show, with the writing staff, at least initially, divided {{with respect to}} Mirkin's comedy and leadership style. Forrester described the latter as [...] "a little bit dictatorial". Mirkin conducted the show's writing sessions in one room, rather than splitting the writers into two groups, as later showrunners would do, and often worked late into the night. Some praised Mirkin's leadership, including Appel, who felt that [...] "the shows were great under him." [...] Others criticised him, including Kushell, who clashed with Mirkin over the episode [...] "A Star is Burns", a crossover with The Critic. In 2004, Mirkin stated that he [...] "really wasn't at all intimidat to join [...] crew", because he [...] "had worked with and written with" [...] many of his fellow writers previously and concluded that, [...] " [...] this show {{in a direction that}} is more personal to me. I did that, had a great time <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> everyone was very receptive to that." [...] Mirkin's era and style of humor are popular amongst the show's fans.|$|E

500|$|The ten song D-A-D-D-A-D {{concept was}} {{eventually}} abandoned with Pryce stating [...] "we don't like constraining ourselves and if you've got a concept, you're <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> <b>And</b> {{we had some}} other really nice tunes so we just chose the best songs". According to Rhys the only plan the group stuck to {{was to make a}} [...] "more coherent" [...] record: [...] "In the past ... we'd put ideas kind of side by side, and on this record we wanted all those sounds to be more blended". Following arguments over the track listing of previous album Rings Around the World, after a [...] "lot of songs" [...] were recorded necessitating four months worth of discussions about which tracks to leave off the record, the group recorded just 16 largely acoustic based songs during the sessions for Phantom Power. Rhys's initial batch of songs were augmented by, among others, the Huw Bunford penned [...] "Sex, War & Robots", the first time the guitarist had had one of his songs included on a Super Furry Animals album and also {{the first time he had}} sung lead vocals for the group, [...] "Slow Life", which grew out of an electronic piece of music keyboardist Cian Ciaran had been working on for several years and [...] "The Piccolo Snare" [...] which was partly written in the studio.|$|E
500|$|R {{singer and}} friend Brandy {{said about the}} late singer [...] "She came out before Monica and I did, she was our inspiration. At the time, record {{companies}} {{did not believe in}} kid acts and it was just inspiring to see someone that was winning and winning being themselves. When I met her I embraced her, I was so happy to meet her." [...] Rapper Drake said that the singer has had the biggest influence on his career. He also has a tattoo of the singer on his back. Solange Knowles remarked on the tenth anniversary of her death that she idolized Aaliyah and proclaimed that she would never be forgotten. Adam Levine, the lead vocalist of the pop rock group Maroon 5, remembers that listening to [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of his then-band Kara's Flowers. Erika Ramirez, associate editor of Billboard.com, said at the time of Aaliyah's career [...] "there weren't many artists using the kind of soft vocals the ways she was using it, and now {{you see a lot of}} artists <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> finding success," [...] her reasoning for Aaliyah's continued influence on current artists. She argued that Aaliyah's second album One in a Million was [...] "very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R sounds that they produced", referring to collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott and that the sound, which [...] "really stood out" [...] at its time, was being replicated.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, Lamarr {{learned that}} {{radio-controlled}} torpedoes, {{which could be}} important in the naval war, could easily be jammed, thereby causing the torpedo to go off course. With the knowledge she had gained about torpedoes from her first husband, she thought of creating a frequency-hopping signal {{that could not be}} tracked or jammed. She contacted her friend, composer and pianist George Antheil, to help her develop a device for <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> he succeeded by synchronizing a miniaturized player-piano mechanism with radio signals. They drafted designs for the frequency-hopping system, which they patented. Antheil recalls: ...|$|E

2500|$|David Amram, {{first met}} Woody Guthrie in 1956. [...] In his {{report of the}} 2005 WoodyFest he remembers that meeting: [...] "Ever since that day we first met, I have always hoped that someday I would {{get the chance to}} go to Okemah, but with my crazy {{schedule}} I never had the opportunity to do so. When I was invited to the festival, I realized that I would be finally be able to see his hometown, and be able to meet his sister, her husband and his remaining old friends from long ago who were still living there. By <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> by playing music and spending time with people who were also natives of Okemah, I knew that I would be able to understand Woody and his work in a deeper way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, Velásquez began {{focusing}} on {{national and international}} companies in addition to local growers. [...] "It {{was a big mistake}} to go after individual farmers," [...] he said, [...] "instead of {{focusing on}} the large corporations. [...] We spent a lot of years <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> it was a mistake." [...] From 1970 to 1983, Velasquez implemented a long-term strategy to build public support for the farmworkers, publicizing the discrimination, low wages, and often appalling working conditions they faced. In 1976, workers at a tomato cannery in Warren, Indiana, struck over the employer's tactic of overrecruiting workers in order to force down wages. The workers spontaneously barricaded themselves inside the cannery, refusing to allow the perishable crop inside until their grievances had been addressed. The workers asked FLOC to intervene. A federal district court issued an injunction requiring that the workers vacate the premises, but they refused. Although nearly all the workers were arrested, there was extensive publicity about the strike, the employer's overrcruitment tactic, the low wages and unsanitary conditions the workers suffered, {{and the use of the}} Immigration and Naturalization Service to intimidate workers and avoid paying them (through deportation proceedings). Velásquez later said the tomato cannery strike helped improve FLOC's negotiating and worker mobilization skills and provided a trial run for the union's dealings with large corporations.|$|E
