40|$|The New Holland mouse (Pseudomys novaehollandiae) {{was first}} {{recorded}} at Wilson’s Promontory in 1972 in heathland vegetation, {{but has not}} been located in this habitat subsequently. The species was not trapped again until 1993 when it was found in calcarenite <b>dune</b> <b>woodland</b> on the Yanakie Isthmus. The aims {{of this study were}} to assess the population dynamics and habitat use of the species in this dune habitat. Mark-recapture trapping was conducted at three sites from 1999 to 2002. One site was located on low (0 - 5 m), flat sand dunes and open swales, another on medium (5 – 10 m) vegetated dunes, and the third on high (20 m) steep vegetated dunes. The three sites had not been burnt for 30 to 50 years. The abundance of P. novaehollandiae was related to understorey vegetation density and differences in population densities on the sites are likely {{to be related to the}} primary succession stages on the sand dunes, rather than fire history. The maximum density (24 ha- 1) recorded at one site was very high compared to other Victorian populations, however this was followed by a substantial decline in numbers within the year. At another site a small population declined to extinction. Populations on the isthmus are thus capable of achieving high densities but may decline quickly. Rainfall patterns may have affected the population fluctuations, but further research is required to elucidate fully the factors involved in the long-term dynamics of this species...|$|E

40|$|In coastal dunes, {{landscape}} changes are a rule, {{rather than an}} exception. This paper gives an overview of changes in landscape and vegetation {{with a focus on}} the past century. The history of dunes is characterised by phases of sand drift, alternated with geomorphological stability. The historical development of <b>dune</b> <b>woodland</b> during these stable phases has been documented for sites all over Europe. Vegetation reconstructions of historical open dune habitats however is very difficult due to limited preservation of fossil remains. People have drastically altered coastal dune landscapes through centuries of exploitation and more recently development of the coast. Historical land use has generally pushed vegetation back into a semi-natural state. During roughly the past century a tendency of increasing fixation and succession is observed on coastal dunes throughout northwest Europe. Six causes of change are discussed. 1) Changes in land use, mainly abandonment of agricultural practices, have {{led to the development of}} late successional stages such as scrub and woodland. 2) Crashing rabbit populations due to myxomatosis in the 1950 s caused vigorous grass growth and probably stimulated scrub development. 3) A general tendency of landscape fixation is observed due to both natural and anthropogenic factors. 4) Eutrophication, mainly due to atmospheric nitrogen deposition is clearly linked to grass encroachment on acidic but also on some calcareous dunes. 5) The impact of climate change on vegetation is still unclear but probably lengthening of growing season and maybe enhanced CO 2 concentrations have led to an acceleration of succession. 6) A general anthropogenisation of the landscape occurs with rapid spread of non-native species as an important consequence. The reconstruction of a natural reference landscape is considered largely unattainable because of irreversible changes and the long tradition of human impact, in many cases since the development of the dunes. Two contradictory elements need reconciliation. First, the general acceleration of succession and scrub and woodland development in particular is partly caused by a decreased anthropogenic interference in the landscape and deserves more appreciation. Second, most biodiversity values are largely linked to open, early succession dune habitats and are threatened by the same tendency. Apart from internal nature management, in which grazing plays an important part, re-mobilisation of stable, senescent dunes is an important challenge for dune management. ...|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the spread of Armillaria root rot in {{eucalypt}} forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged. Armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps, using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years. In one case reported in Ovens, Victoria, the disease was spread to blueberry plants (Vaccinium species) via buried fragments of infected Eucalyptus that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting. In individual forest stands, fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees—a discontinuous distribution. Large-scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species.

40|$|Extract] Mangroves and {{intertidal}} habitats {{represent the}} interface between aquatic and terrestrial environments (Macnae 1966). Characteristic assemblages of vertebrate fauna derived from both these sources utilise {{a wide variety of}} different habitats within these coastal areas, though few species become specialised to the use any one terrestrial environment (e. g. mangroves) as primary habitat (Hutchings and Saenger 1987). Though mangroves are a notable and prominent habitat type in northern tropical coastal zones, mosaics of mudflats, seagrasses, salt-marsh, beach <b>dunes,</b> <b>woodlands</b> and closed forest habitats generally the norm. As a consequence, diverse fauna communities representing terrestrial and aquatic life-histories are supported in these environments, representing a variety of vertebrate fauna taxa (Hutchings and Saenger 1987; Kutt 1997). Given the general significance of mangal mosaics as a coastal habitat in Australia (Galloway 1982) and the biological interest in these communities (see Clough 1882 and Field and Dartnell 1987), examination of the vertebrate fauna of these habitats is very poor (Hutchings and Recher 1982), with the exception of sea and shore-birds (Hutchings and Saenger 1987). In Australia there is estimated to be approximately 11, 600 km 2 of mangroves; second only to Indonesia in southeast Asia/Australasia (Galloway 1982). Australian mangrove ecosystems are, according to Davie (1987) "very significant because, with minor and localised exceptions, they are not being destructively exploited". Australian mangroves have their greatest plant species richness in north-eastern Queensland, with about 25 mangrove species in the Hinchinbrook to Cairns area, and 28 species north of the Daintree River (Davie 1987; Hutchings and Saenger 1987; Lovelock 1993). The diversity and extent of mangroves in northern Australia is not surprising given the belief that mangroves are thought to have evolved and originated in northern or western Australia (Mepham 1983). The basic driving force behind estuarine ecosystems is the primary productivity contributed by riparian, wetland, salt marsh, mangroves and seagrasses communities. This productivity, based on plant detritus and benthic microflora and intertidal crustaceans, provides the cornerstone of energy pathways or food webs that support the vertebrate fauna assemblages at higher trophic levels (TIMP 1992). There are two stages where productivity enters an ecosystems: from a primary source, where photosynthesis converts radiant energy into plant material, and from a secondary source, where the plant material is converted by chains of organisms to higher trophic levels in the food web (TIMP 1992). The majority of productivity in estuarine wetlands is contributed by mangroves, seagrass beds and saltmarshes (Hutchings and Saenger 1987). The remainder is provided by phytoplankton, benthic diatoms and benthic and epithetic algae within the estuarine and nearshore waters (Hutchings and Saenger 1987). It has also been suggested that chemotrophs, active in the anaerobic high organic content muds fringing mangrove and seagrass areas, enrich the productivity of these environments. Terrestrial sources, such as beach <b>dune</b> shrublands and <b>woodlands,</b> would also ontribute plant and detritus (Hutchings and Saenger 1987). Estuarine energy systems follow a general pattern: particulate organic matter (mangrove litter, microflora, phytoplankton, seagrasses, epiphytic algae) is consumed by microbes (bacteria), vertebrates (dugongs, green turtles, fish) and macro and microinvertebrates (polychaetes, gastropods, crustaceans, larvae), which in turn are consumed by predatory animals at higher trophic levels (polychaetes, crabs, fish, wading birds, crocodiles). Primary and secondary productivity or energy can be exported out of the estuarine systems by migration of animals and tidal flushing (Hutchings and Saenger 1987) ...|$|R

The fungus has also been reported to infect Nothofagus species in Argentina, and Pinus radiata in Chile.Armillaria luteobubalina uses [...] "an elaborate, sophisticated aeration system" [...] that enables it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the rhizomorphs, helping it thrive in low-oxygen environments. When grown in culture, the mycelium develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust. This tissue is hydrophobic and resistant to becoming waterlogged. Rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so-called [...] "air-pores" [...] near the perforations. These gas spaces connect the atmosphere with the central canal of the rhizomorph, to facilitate diffusion of oxygen and satiate the organism's high oxygen requirement during growth. This aeration system is thought to be an important factor in the organism's pathogenicity, allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps, where conditions may be hypoxic. The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern, so that they split or bifurcate at various intervals. Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than Armillaria species whose rhizomorphs branch monopodially (where lateral branches grow from a main stem). Although the structure of A. luteobubalina rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions, the soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify the absorptive surface of peripheral hyphae in response to the presence of nutrient-rich soil.|$|R
