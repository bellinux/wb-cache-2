Different {{equipments}} such as fire extinguisher, axes and cutting equipment are used to fight against <b>fire.</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>fighting</b> vehicle {{is being used to}} transport firefighters to the scene as well as transport the <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> equipments. The <b>fire</b> fighter is still facing the risk of fire hazard because they still need to go near to fire scene. To reduce the fire fighter risk during fire incident, a <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> mobile robot is designed. <b>Fire</b> <b>fighting</b> mobile robot is a remote controlled machine that replace fire fighter to perform <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> task. The application of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> mobile robot is able to reduce the direct contact of fire fighter to the fire hazards.
