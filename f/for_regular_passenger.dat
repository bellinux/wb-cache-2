500|$|Even though Tryvandsbanen had {{prepared}} the Frognerseteren–Tryvandshøiden Line for an upgrade to double tracks, no {{action was taken}} due to a shortage of money. The line was therefore unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>regular</b> <b>passenger</b> service, and Tryvandsbanen considered it to be useless. The tracks from Tryvandshøiden station to a point some [...] ahead of Frognerseteren station were removed in 1939.

2500|$|However, the Grand Trunk Western {{used some}} steam power <b>for</b> <b>regular</b> <b>passenger</b> trains until 1961, the last {{instance}} of this occurring unannounced on trains 56 and 21 in the Detroit area on 20 September 1961 with 4-8-4 6323, {{one day before}} its flue time expired. The last steam-powered standard-gauge regular freight service by a class 1 railroad was on the isolated Leadville branch of the Colorado and Southern (Burlington Lines) 11 October 1962 with 2-8-0 641. Narrow-gauge steam was used for freight service by the Denver and Rio Grande Western on the [...] run from Alamosa, Colorado to Farmington, New Mexico via Durango until service ceased on 5 December 1968. The Union Pacific is the only Class I railroad in the US to have never completely dieselised, at least nominally. It has always {{had at least one}} operational steam locomotive, Union Pacific 844, on its roster. Some US shortlines continued steam operations into the 1960s, and the Northwestern Steel and Wire mill in Sterling, Illinois, continued to operate steam locomotives until December 1980. Two surviving sections of the Denver and Rio Grande Western's Alamosa to Durango narrow-gauge line mentioned above, now operating separately as the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad and the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, continue to use steam locomotives and operate as tourist railroads.|$|E
