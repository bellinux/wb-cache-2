500|$|Räikkönen was demoted to from fifth to eighth {{place for}} causing the final lap {{collision}} with Bottas and scored only four points rather than ten, and this secured the constructors championship for Mercedes. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso {{was given a}} five-second penalty for exceeding track limits, promoting Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen to tenth. When asked about the collision with Bottas {{at the press conference}} for the following United States Grand Prix, Kimi Räikkönen remained unregenerate, saying: [...] " [...] hasn't changed. There were some discussions. I would still do it tomorrow again, that doesn't change the story." [...] Bottas took a different viewpoint, saying: [...] "I don't think it was a racing incident. I didn't see anyone there and I was in front, and then suddenly someone <b>hits</b> <b>me.</b> I should be on the podium, but I'm here with zero points instead. That's just disappointing." ...|$|E
500|$|Mars' {{music has}} been noted for {{displaying}} {{a wide variety of}} styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, rock, reggae, R, soul, and hip hop. His debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, a pop record, is influence by these genres. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including dance, rock reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different than the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song [...] "Gorilla" [...] caused a controversy in Australia. Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, reflect [...] "feel-good", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour. Mars' third album, 24K Magic, is significantly influence by R, soul music and funk. Lyrically, the album involve themes of money and sex. Mars has explained his writing process: [...] "I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', inspiration <b>hits</b> <b>me</b> always unexpectedly: on a plane, when I'm out or just before I go to bed. An idea will suddenly come to my mind, and sometimes I manage to turn it into lyrics the next day. Sometimes it'll take me one year to get something real out of it. You can’t force creativeness." ...|$|E
