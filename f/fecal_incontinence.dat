5|$|The pudendal nerve is {{the main}} nerve of the perineum.

If damaged, most commonly by childbirth, lesions may cause sensory loss or <b>fecal</b> <b>incontinence.</b> The nerve may be temporarily blocked {{as part of an}} anaesthetic procedure.|$|E

5|$|Bowel: bowel {{problems}} affect around 70% of {{the patients}}, with around 50% {{of the patients}} suffering from constipation and up to 30% from <b>fecal</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects from drugs used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and <b>fecal</b> <b>incontinence.</b> The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E

25|$|Non {{surgical}} {{measures to}} treat internal intussusception include pelvic floor retraining, a bulking agent (e.g. psyllium), suppositories or enemas to relieve constipation and straining. If there is <b>incontinence</b> (<b>fecal</b> leakage or more severe FI), or paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor (anismus), then biofeedback retraining is indicated. Some researchers advise that internal intussusception be managed conservatively, compared to external rectal prolapse which usually requires surgery.|$|R
5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and <b>fecal</b> <b>incontinence,</b> vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E

40|$|Background &amp; Aim: Routine {{episiotomy}} {{is often}} considered unnecessary. Episiotomy {{is associated with}} short- and long-term morbidities such as suturing, possible bleeding, infection, urinary and <b>fecal</b> <b>incontinences,</b> and dyspareunia. It has also adverse effects on self-esteem and mother-infant bonding. This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of perineal massage during second stage of labor on perineal outcome among nulliparous women. Methods &amp; Materials: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial. At 38 - 42 weeks of gestation, nulliparous women expecting normal vaginal delivery of a singleton were asked to join the study. Two hundred and four women were randomly allocated into the intervention and control groups. Participants signed the consent forms. In the intervention group, during the pushing time in the second phase of labor, the midwife inserted two fingers inside the vagina and used a sweeping motion gently to stretch the perineum. The control group received routine care. The rates of episiotomy and laceration were calculated. Results: In the intervention group, the rate of intact perineum, episiotomy, and laceration were 43. 5 %, 16. 5 %, and 40 %, respectively and in the control group, they were 2. 4 %, 80 % and 17. 6 %, respectively (P&lt; 0. 001). In the intervention group, the first- and second-degree lacerations were 28. 2 % and 11. 8 %, respectively; but, the third and fourth degree lacerations were not seen. In the control group, first, second, and third degree lacerations were 4. 7 %, 7. 1 %, and 5. 9 %, respectively (P&lt; 0. 001). The fourth degree laceration was not seen. The mean duration of the second stage of labor in the intervention and control groups were 40. 06 &plusmn; 20. 74 and 51. 06 &plusmn; 21. 23 minutes, respectively (P= 0. 003). The Mean of the first minute Apgar score was 8. 51 &plusmn; 0. 76 and 8. 73 &plusmn; 0. 60 in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The mean of the five minute Apgar score was 9. 58 &plusmn; 0. 62 and 9. 78 &plusmn; 0. 47, respectively (P= 0. 102). Conclusion: This study showed that perineal massage reduces the rate of episiotomy and the degree of lacerations in the second stage of labor.

Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the problems in the families of disabled children. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 352 disabled children residing in rehabilitation centers of Kashan during 2007 - 8. A census was conducted in families of the children through an interview and a questionnaire. Moreover, some demographic characteristics (e. g. family attitude, and problems related to disabilities) were evaluated and analyzed using the descriptive statistics. Results: Among 352 cases, 234 (66. 6) were male and most of them (36. 1) aged 10 - 19 years. The mean age of children was 24. 2 Â± 18. 5 years. Ninety-seven percent of mothers were housewives 52 mentally disabled 15. 6 physically disabled and the remaining both mentally and physically disabled. Almost one-third of the families had more than one disabled children. The most frequent disabilities were associated with behavioral disorders, facial paralyses, limb deformities, <b>fecal</b> and urinary <b>incontinence,</b> running off at the mouth and convulsion, respectively. Most children were dependent on their adults in feeding, dressing and playing. In addition, the most important problems of the children were <b>fecal</b> and urinary <b>incontinence,</b> impairment in social adaptation with healthy children, verbal communication, recognizing individuals and also financial problems. Moreover, a significant relationship was seen between the severity of physical disability and gender (P= 0. 001).

25|$|The assumed {{mechanism}} of <b>fecal</b> <b>incontinence</b> in rectal prolapse {{is by the}} chronic stretch and trauma to the anal sphincters {{and the presence of}} a direct conduit (the intussusceptum) connecting rectum to the external environment which is not guarded by the sphincters.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Radiation {{proctitis}} is a troublesome {{complication of}} pelvic irradiation for malignancy. One common and occasionally serious complication is rectal bleeding. Therapeutic options for this condition are limited. This study was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} usefulness of argon plasma coagulation (APC) {{in the treatment of}} rectal bleeding due to radiation proctitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients referred for treatment of rectal bleeding due to radiation proctitis were offered APC during flexible sigmoidoscopy. Data were collected retrospectively to assess patients' response to treatment. Patients were asked to score overall well-being, bleeding, <b>fecal</b> urgency, <b>incontinence,</b> and stool frequency. Transfusion requirements and nadir hemoglobin before and after treatment were also recorded. Matched data were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: Rectal bleeding improved significantly after treatment with APC (median pre-treatment score = 3, median post-treatment score = 1; P< 0. 001). Transfusion requirements ceased in three patients who had previously been anemic. Hemoglobin levels increased from a mean of 108 g/l to 133 g/l in 13 patients. In addition, other parameters of bowel function, including urgency, incontinence, and stool frequency, improved significantly after treatment. Two patients developed rectal strictures after therapy, but these were asymptomatic and treated with rectal dilation. No other complications were observed. CONCLUSION: APC improved patient well-being and significantly reduced rectal bleeding in patients with radiation proctitis. Transfusion requirements were also reduced. APC is useful and safe in patients in whom radiation proctitis is refractory to other treatments...|$|R
