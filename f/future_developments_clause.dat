30|$|In most models, future land-use {{changes are}} {{forecasted}} based on past development patterns. In fact, they modeled {{the continuity of}} urban land-use changes based on past expansion process such as urban sprawl. But in this paper, we used infill development pattern for analyzing this pattern in <b>future</b> <b>development.</b> So, the main advantage of this research compared with other studies is, {{in addition to the}} modeling of urban development based on past trends and warning of <b>future</b> <b>development</b> problems for planners and decision makers, we used a new approach to urban <b>future</b> <b>development.</b> In fact, this study also highlights the problems of the PDP and suggests a new method and strategy for control of urban <b>future</b> <b>development</b> modeling using smart growth based on infill development.|$|R

The matching degree of the curriculum and the students’ <b>future</b> <b>development</b> largely affects the future competitiveness of students and students’ satisfaction with the school specialty. Based on industrial engineering specialty of Nanchang University, this article applies fishbone diagram to analyze the direction of students’ <b>future</b> <b>development,</b> and uses questionnaire to collect students’ preference of the <b>future</b> <b>development,</b> and analyzes the collecting data by AHP (analytical hierarchy process). Combining {{with the weight of}} the direction of <b>future</b> <b>development</b> and the importance of courses, we find a new combination of curriculum and a plan of rearrangement. By comparing the results with the existing curriculum program, we ultimately find a more scientific way to rearrange the curriculum...|$|R
