500|$|Jabbari Weekes of Exclaim! said, [...] "A {{majority}} of My Name Is My Names sounds are wrapped in minimalistic saran wrap that allows Pusha T's cold delivery to flourish, with more abstract drug references than a paranoid dealer over a tapped phone line." [...] Reed Jackson, writing for XXL, stated, [...] "Certain songs, like the trap house anthem [...] "No Regrets" [...] or the early-2000s-sounding [...] "Let Me Love You," [...] are entertaining, but don’t have the inventiveness or {{excitement of the}} album’s other tracks. With MNIMN standing at a lean 12 songs, these missteps are hard to gloss over. Regardless, Pusha T accomplishes a lot here, crafting a record that is big in concept but is still rooted in the longstanding hip-hop tradition that lyricism is king." [...] Brandon Soderberg of Spin said, [...] "Don't tell King Push, but My Name Is My Name bears a weird resemblance to Drake's Nothing Was the Same: <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> deeply considered collection of top-shelf beats and uncompromising-though-still-pop-enough raps that justifies the fairly awful personalities driving it, which, depending on your tolerance for wounded narcissism and a complete lack of insight, is either fascinating or frustrating." ...|$|E

Brown, commented on Combat Controllers in a May 2011 {{interview with the}} publication, The Year in Special Operations 2011-2012 Edition, stating: [...] "During this kind of warfare the USAF combat controller [...] guys really carried an incredible load. During the opening days in Afghanistan, we deployed some SF teams without a CCT, {{and the difference between}} those that had controllers and those that didn’t was dramatic. Quite frankly no one wants to go to war without them. They are admired, capable, and requested at a rate far greater than we could ever provide. Their efforts were critical {{in the early days of}} OEF and still are. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> force [...] true impact on the battlefields around the world will never be known or appreciated. They are absolutely phenomenal." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1948 he {{went further}} away from his {{previous}} views on segregation when supporting {{the recommendations of the}} Fagan Commission that Africans should be recognised as permanent residents of White South Africa and not only temporary workers that really belonged in the reserves. This was in direct opposition to the policies of the National Party that wished to extend segregation and formalise it into apartheid. There is however no evidence that Smuts ever supported the idea of equal political rights for blacks and whites. However <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> quote by Smuts: [...] The Fagan Commission did not advocate the establishment of a non-racial democracy in South Africa, but rather wanted to liberalise influx controls of Africans into urban areas in order to facilitate the supply of African labour to the South African industry. It also envisaged a relaxation of the pass laws that had restricted the movement of Africans in general.|$|E

2500|$|Ellipsometry {{can also}} be done as imaging {{ellipsometry}} by using a CCD camera as a detector. This provides a real time contrast image of the sample, which provides information about film thickness and refractive index. Advanced imaging ellipsometer technology operates {{on the principle of}} classical null ellipsometry and real-time ellipsometric contrast imaging. [...] Imaging ellipsometry is based on the concept of nulling. [...] In ellipsometry, the film under investigation is placed onto a reflective substrate. [...] The film and the substrate have different refractive indexes. [...] In order to obtain data about film thickness, the light reflecting off of the substrate must be nulled. [...] Nulling is achieved by adjusting the analyzer and polarizer so that all reflected light off of the substrate is extinguished. [...] Due to the difference in refractive indexes, this will allow the sample to become very bright and clearly visible. The light source consists of a monochromatic laser of the desired wavelength. A common wavelength that is used is 532nm green laser light. [...] Since only intensity of light measurements are needed, almost any type of camera can be implemented as the CCD, which is useful if building an ellipsometer from parts. [...] Typically, imaging ellipsometers are configured in such a way so that the laser (L) fires a beam of light which immediately passes through a linear polarizer (P). [...] The linearly polarized light then passes through a quarter wavelength compensator (C) which transforms the light into elliptically polarized light. [...] This elliptically polarized light then reflects off the sample (S), passes through the analyzer (A) and is imaged onto a CCD camera by a long working distance objective. The analyzer <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> polarizer identical to the P, however, this polarizer serves to help quantify the change in polarization and is thus given the name analyzer. [...] This design is commonly referred to as a LPCSA configuration.|$|E
