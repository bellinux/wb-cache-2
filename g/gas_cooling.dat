The main emphasis is put on a problem with oversized <b>gas</b> <b>cooler,</b> which occurs during low ambient temperatures (in winter), and is a root of unstable operation of the whole system. Furthermore, possible solutions to this problem are depicted, among them are: division and cut-down of <b>gas</b> <b>cooler</b> s surface, application of bypassing valve to the <b>gas</b> <b>cooler,</b> triggering fresh air inside supermarket s airhandling-unit (AHU), and utilization of air shutters to the <b>gas</b> <b>cooler.</b> Subsequently, a simulation in a heat exchanger modelling computer program hXSIM (the Heat Exchanger Simulator) of the <b>gas</b> <b>cooler</b> split and increased subcooling is depicted.

2500|$|A more {{successful}} feedback model was first presented by Andrew King at the University of Leicester in 2003. In King's model, feedback occurs through momentum transfer, rather than energy transfer {{as in the}} case of Silk & Rees's model. [...] A [...] "momentum-driven flow" [...] is one in which the <b>gas</b> <b>cooling</b> time is so short that essentially all the energy in the flow is in the form of bulk motion. In such a flow, most of the energy released by the black hole is lost to radiation, and only a few percent is left to affect the gas mechanically. King's model predicts a slope of α=4 for the M–σ relation, and the normalization is exactly correct; it is roughly a factor c/σ ≈ 103 times larger than in Silk & Rees's relation.|$|E

The use of CO 2 in heat pump dryers is feasible if operating temperatures are appropriate. In heat pump dryers working with CO 2 {{according to the}} transcritical cycle, {{one of the most}} important operating conditions is optimum <b>gas</b> <b>cooler</b> inlet pressure, which gives the maximum coefficient of performance (COP). In this study, a model was developed by using MATLAB software for heat pump tumble dryer working with CO 2. The model was validated by experimental data taken from existing literature.

50|$|Buffer <b>gas</b> <b>cooling,</b> {{resistive}} cooling, {{and laser}} cooling are techniques to remove energy from ions in a Penning trap. Buffer <b>gas</b> <b>cooling</b> relies on collisions between the ions and neutral gas molecules that bring the ion energy closer {{the energy of}} the gas molecules. In resistive cooling, moving image charges in the electrodes are made to do work through an external resistor, effectively removing energy from the ions. Laser cooling can be used to remove energy from some kinds of ions in Penning traps. This technique requires ions with an appropriate electronic structure. Radiative cooling is the process by which the ions lose energy by creating electromagnetic waves by virtue of their acceleration in the magnetic field. This process dominates the cooling of electrons in Penning traps, but is very small and usually negligible for heavier particles.|$|E

50|$|Buffer gas loading {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} for use in cooling paramagnetic atoms and molecules at ultra-cold temperatures. The buffer gas most commonly used in this sort of application is helium. Buffer <b>gas</b> <b>cooling</b> can be used on just about any molecule, as long as the molecule is capable of surviving multiple collisions with low energy helium atoms, which most molecules are capable of doing. Buffer <b>gas</b> <b>cooling</b> is allowing the molecules of interest to be cooled through elastic collisions with a cold buffer gas inside a chamber. If there are enough collisions between the buffer gas and the other molecules of interest before the molecules hit the walls of the chamber and are gone, the buffer gas will sufficiently cool the atoms. Of the two isotopes of helium (3He and 4He), the rarer 3He is sometimes used over 4He as it provides significantly higher vapor pressures and buffer gas density at sub-kelvin temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Cooling these ion beams, {{particularly}} radioactive ion beams, {{has been}} shown to drastically improve the accuracy and sensitivity of mass measurements by reducing the phase space of the ion collections in question. Using a light neutral background gas, typically helium, charged particles originating from on-line mass separators undergo a number of soft collisions with the background gas molecules resulting in fractional losses of the ions’ kinetic energy and a reduction of the ion ensemble’s overall energy. In order for this to be effective however, the ions need to be contained using transverse radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ) electric fields during the collisional cooling process (also known as buffer <b>gas</b> <b>cooling).</b> These RFQ coolers operate on the same principles as quadrupole ion traps and {{have been shown to be}} particularly well suited for buffer <b>gas</b> <b>cooling</b> given their capacity for total confinement of ions having a large dispersion of velocities, corresponding to kinetic energies up to tens of electron volts.
