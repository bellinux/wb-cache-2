500|$|On March 12, 2015, Disney officially {{announced}} that a feature-length sequel to Frozen was in development with Buck and Lee returning as directors, and Del Vecho returning as producer. In a May 2015 interview, Buck said, [...] "We have lots of things to figure out {{but at least we}} <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going." [...] In March 2016, Bell stated that voice recording for the film was due to start later in the month, but in September of that same year, she retracted her earlier comments as mistaken and explained that she had been working instead on other Frozen projects such as the upcoming holiday special. In April 2017, Disney {{announced that}} the sequel would be released on November 27, 2019.|$|E
500|$|An {{unidentified}} {{crew member}} asked Powers, {{one of the}} students, for his compass reading. Powers replied: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> We must have got lost after that last turn." [...] Cox then transmitted; [...] "This is FT-74, plane or boat calling 'Powers' please identify yourself so someone can help you." [...] The response {{after a few moments}} was a request from the others in the flight for suggestions. FT-74 tried again and a man identified as FT-28 (Taylor) came on. [...] "FT-28, this is FT-74, what is your trouble?" [...] "Both of my compasses are out", Taylor replied, [...] "and I am trying to find Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I am over land but it's broken. I am sure I'm in the Keys but I don't know how far down and I don't know how to get to Fort Lauderdale." ...|$|E
2500|$|By daybreak {{the twins}} were {{approaching}} the sacred mountain called [...] [...] They saw smoke rising from the ground, {{and saw that it}} came from an underground chamber with a ladder extending. [...] When they looked down into the entrance they saw an old woman sitting before a small fire. [...] It was , Spider Woman. [...] "Enter, [...] (my sons)," [...] she said in a raspy voice. [...] "Who are you and why do you walk on Atiin diyinii, the trail of the rainbow?" [...] The boys entered. [...] "We do not know who we are, and we do not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going," [...] said the twins. [...] "We are fleeing for our lives." [...] "You must tell me more," [...] said Spider Woman. [...] ", Changing Woman, is our mother, and we flee , the Alien Monsters," [...] said the boys. [...] "You are welcome here, and you can learn much from me," [...] said Spider Woman. [...] "But you must tell me more." [...] "We are yátashkii, raised without a father," [...] the twins said. [...] "Perhaps our father is a round cactus. [...] We follow the Holy Trail because the monsters will destroy us if they can." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Tobin {{wrote in}} The Jewish World Review that [...] "Rosenfeld {{is careful to}} specify that {{questioning}} policies of Israeli governments {{is not the same}} as being anti-Israel, let alone anti-Semitic. But he has the bad manners to point out that those who aggressively question Israel's right to have any government or to defend itself against those who seek to destroy it are, at best, unwitting allies of a growing anti-Jewish movement.... For this, Rosenfeld and his sponsors at AJC have been treated to the sort of public tar and feathering that is usually reserved only for the troglodyte denizens of the far-right." [...] Tobin concludes [...] "in recent years, it is the supporters of Israel who are becoming pariahs in intellectual circles, not its critics. For all the talk of 'martyrdom' on the part of people like Tony Judt, the fact is, they have not suffered one bit for pot shots at Israel or their sneers at those who stand up for Zion. If we want to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> headed, we need only look to Britain, where in intellectual and artistic circles it has gotten to the point where it may no longer be possible to identify as a Jew without also disavowing any support for Israel." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{suggestion of}} unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area {{appeared in a}} September 17, 1950, article published in The Miami Herald (Associated Press) by Edward Van Winkle Jones. Two years later, Fate magazine published [...] "Sea Mystery at Our Back Door", a short article by George X. Sand covering the loss of several planes and ships, including the loss of Flight 19, a group of five US Navy Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers on a training mission. Sand's article {{was the first to}} lay out the now-familiar triangular area where the losses took place. Flight 19 alone would be covered again in the April 1962 issue of American Legion magazine. In it, author Allan W. Eckert wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying, [...] "We are entering white water, nothing seems right. We don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> the water is green, no white." [...] He also wrote that officials at the Navy board of inquiry stated that the planes [...] "flew off to Mars." [...] Sand's article was the first to suggest a supernatural element to the Flight 19 incident. In the February 1964 issue of Argosy, Vincent Gaddis' article [...] "The Deadly Bermuda Triangle" [...] argued that Flight 19 and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the region. The next year, Gaddis expanded this article into a book, Invisible Horizons.|$|E
2500|$|Kunle Afolayan {{wanted a}} story {{set in a}} small community; he had writers submit scripts before he got to meet Tunde Babalola who {{eventually}} wrote the script for the film. The script was initially submitted with the title Dust, mainly because the story {{is set in a}} very dusty town. Even though Afolayan didn't want to do big budget projects at the time, he knew he had no choice, as he wanted to interpret the writer's vision adequately because it is a [...] "national film with a universal appeal". He expressed that he liked the story of October 1 because it is a period piece, which he had never done before and [...] "it is also significant to the present state of Nigeria". As a result, he decided to explore the film by adding his own ideas to the subsequent drafts of the script. In an interview, Afolayan pointed out that October 1 is not just an entertainment film, but also informative: [...] "For the older generation, especially those who were part of independence, {{they will be able to}} see themselves in this film. For the younger generation it's a platform for many of them who don't know the story of Nigeria". He also stated that: [...] "We want the younger generation to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> coming from and the older generation to see if we are moving in the right direction".|$|E

60|$|We went up {{a little}} side-turning past a bunch of poor houses towards a steep little lane between banks. And before <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{in the thick of}} the public lavatory. In these villages, as I knew, there are no {{sanitary}} arrangements of any sort whatever. Every villager and villageress just betook himself at need to one of the side-roads. It is the immemorial Italian custom. Why bother about privacy? The most socially-constituted people on earth, they even like to relieve themselves in company.|$|R

6000|$|The encounter, however, {{had taken}} time, and now Ben called upon his {{companion}} to stop running. [...] "We want to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> running to first," [...] he said. [...] "Listen." ...|$|E
5000|$|They {{definitely}} caught us by surprise. I {{think they}} had been on patrol, or had been scrambled, and {{when they saw the}} smoke from the train they <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> and attacked out of the cloud. The Spitfire XIV is definitely better than the Me 109, as I could do a better climbing turn even with my drop tanks still on! ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was dressed}} in a light-gray skirt and jacket, and her white hat had a long, gray quill which waved back over the rim, giving her the jaunty air of a yacht under reefed sail.

Be patient, and above all things remember, Lillian, that {{you are no longer}} a child," [...] replied my lady, rather disturbed by her daughter's enthusiastic praises of Paul.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now, Captain." [...] McCoy {{lowered the}} glasses from his eyes. [...] "That's Resolution Island. We are forty miles beyond Hao Island, {{and the wind}} is in our teeth." ...|$|E

40|$|It's all a {{question}} of story. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> in trouble just now because <b>we</b> [...] . <b>are</b> in between stories.

It shaped our emotional attitudes, provided us with life purposes, and energized action. It consecrated suffering and integrated knowledge. We awoke in the morning and <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> <b>We</b> could answer the questions of our children [...] [But now the old story] is no longer effective. Yet we have not learned the new story...|$|R
60|$|And we go home, and we dine in {{the company}} of Britons, at the {{comfortable}} Hotel du Parc, and we have bought a novel apiece for a shilling, and every half-hour the sweet carillon plays the waltz from Dinorah in the air.

60|$|As {{a matter}} of course he <b>was</b> curious to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> bound, and when he asked {{questions}} concerning our purpose we lads would have put him off with evasive replies, believing Hiram desired to keep secret that which we would do, therefore was our surprise great when Griffin made a clean breast of the whole scheme, even going into details so far as lay in his power.|$|R
60|$|By {{the end of}} January {{our food}} was near its end. The pork was entirely gone, and we used the barrel for {{catching}} and storing rainwater. Not many pounds of beef remained.

Captain Nicholl frankly admitted that after sixty-three days of dead reckoning he did not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were.</b>|$|R
60|$|We join'd our Comrades, {{with a great}} Deal of Ease, {{about three}} Days afterwards, for we march'd but softly, and they lay by for us: The Night before we went on Board, we made them a Signal by Fire, as we had {{appointed}} to let them <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> and that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> at Hand; so they sent their Boat and fetch'd us off, and we embark'd without any Notice taken by the Rest.|$|R
