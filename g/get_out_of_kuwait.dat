Iraqi forces continue to push through Kuwait and eventually Ranjit's mansion is broken into, but {{his wife and child}} manage to escape to his office. Ranjit convinces his friends to work together, and they set up a makeshift camp for some 500 Indians with Major Khalaf's permission. Amrita urges Ranjit to use his leverage to extricate his own family but Ranjit, who ordinarily would have just looked out for himself, appears to have a change of heart. He decides to stay and help the other Indians <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The first {{reason why}} we bombed the highway coming north <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> is {{because there was a}} great deal of {{military}} equipment on that highway, and I had given orders to all my commanders that I wanted every piece of Iraqi equipment that we possibly could destroy. Secondly, this was not a bunch of innocent people just trying to make their way back across the border to Iraq. This was a bunch of rapists, murderers and thugs who had raped and pillaged downtown Kuwait City and now were trying to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country before they were caught.|$|R

50|$|Iraq's {{invasion}} <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990 {{resulted in}} its government-in-exile, the US, Saudi Arabia, and most Persian Gulf states to sever relations with Baghdad and joining the United Nations coalition that drove Iraqi forces <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> during the Persian Gulf War. Iraq's refusal to implement United Nations Security Council resolutions and continued threats toward Kuwait {{have resulted in}} relations remaining cool.|$|R

5000|$|Belief logic symbols, when {{combined}} with imperative logic, allow beliefs and desires to be expressed. The notation [...] is used for beliefs ("You believe A") and [...] for desires ("You desire A"). In formal ethics, desire is taken in a strong sense when the agent of the belief {{is the same as}} the agent of the imperative. The following table shows the different interpretations for [...] depending on the agent and the tense of the imperative:This strong interpretation of desires precludes statements such as [...] "I want to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed (right now), but I don't act to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed". It does not, however, preclude [...] "I want to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed (right now), but I don't <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed". Perhaps I act to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed (make my best effort), but can't for some reason (e.g. I am tied down, my legs are broken, etc.).|$|R
