50|$|This {{collector}} is very responsive - {{in the sun}} it {{heats up}} rapidly and the air inside starts to convect. If the collector were to be directly connected to the building using a hole near the floor and a hole near the ceiling an <b>indirect</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> system would be created. One problem with this that, like Trombe walls, the heat would radiate back out at night, and a convection current would chill the room during the night. Instead, the air movement can be stopped using automatic dampers, {{similar to those used}} for ventilating foundation spaces in cold climates, or plastic film dampers, which work by blocking air flow in one direction with a very lightweight flap of plastic. The addition of the damper makes the design an efficient isolated solar gain system.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} recent {{interest}} in the utilization of the large amounts of surface area on skyscrapers to improve their overall energy efficiency. Because skyscrapers are increasingly ubiquitous in urban environments, yet require large amounts of energy to operate, there is potential for large amounts of energy savings employing passive solar design techniques. One study, which analyzed the proposed 22 Bishopsgate tower in London, found that a 35% energy decrease in demand can theoretically be achieved through indirect solar gains, by rotating the building to achieve optimum ventilation and daylight penetration, usage of high thermal mass flooring material to decrease temperature fluctuation inside the building, and using double or triple glazed low emissivity window glass for direct solar gain. <b>Indirect</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> techniques included moderating wall heat flow by variations of wall thickness (from 20 to 30 cm), using window glazing on the outdoor space to prevent heat loss, dedicating 15-20% of floor area for thermal storage, and implementing a Trombe wall to absorb heat entering the space. Overhangs are used to block direct sunlight in the summer, and allow it in the winter, and heat reflecting blinds are inserted between the thermal wall and the glazing to limit heat build-up in the summer months.|$|E
50|$|In direct <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> systems, the {{composition}} and coating of the building glazing can also be manipulated to optimise the greenhouse effect, while its size, position and shading {{can be used to}} optimise <b>solar</b> <b>gain.</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>gain</b> can also be transferred to the building by <b>indirect</b> or isolated <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> systems.|$|R
40|$|To date {{powerful}} dynamic energy simulation {{tools are}} available. These, however, {{require a lot}} of input and the large output has to be filtered to select relevant results for the early design phase. In consequence, early design decisions regarding energy efficiency are in practice often based on the architect’s experience or intuition. In this research a simplified approach is proposed to estimate the heating energy demand, based on the Dynamic Equivalent Degree-day method (DEq°d). Moreover, as most architects think in a graphical way, the results of simulation runs with a whole range of parameters done beforehand are used to visualise via a parallel coordinate representation the effect of different parameters upon energy use. In this representation different parameters can be visualised or not in an interactive graphical way such as the building compactness, insulation level, the effective use of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gains,</b> internal gains (including occupancy schedule and activities), and global ventilation strategies. As the approach consists of a speedy analysis, based on a limited set of input parameters, it could support architects in designing energy efficient buildings from the sketch design phase onwards. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, many tools have been {{developed}} to support design decisions related to energy efficient buildings. However, these energy simulation tools are complex and require too detailed input data to be appropriate for use in the sketch design stage. Architects and designers hence often take energy related design decisions based on their own experiences or intuition. This paper proposes a simple tool to estimate the energy consumption in the sketch design stage which can, in a later design stage, be linked to a dynamic simulation tool. Furthermore, this study proposes the use of visualisation methods by architects to improve the integration of energy simulations in the sketch design stage. The proposed simple energy estimation tool is based on the " dynamic Equivalent Heating Degree Day Method (dynamic EHDD) ". Relevant sketch design parameters identified are thermal compactness, insulation level, effective use of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>solar</b> <b>gains,</b> internal gains including occupant presence and activities, and ventilation strategies. In order to develop in-depth simulations, the tool is linked to the dynamic energy simulation software " EnergyPlus " to be used during the detailed design stage.

It is expected that energy demand visualisation can improve the integration of energy efficient design into the architectural process from the sketch design stage onwards. In addition, visualisation is a powerful communication tool for architects to share information and ideas with other architects, engineers, stakeholders and users towards realising Nearly Zero Energy Buildings.

It gives the possibility to obtain three different flux modes. A manual device mounted at the output of the collector permits to obtain the licking mode, the crossing mode or the mixed mode. The system has showed a change of more than 8 °C on different trays in crossing mode case, compared to the licking mode (which is closed to the natural drying), where this difference is almost zero. The entire equipment is built using local materials helps to achieve a temperature ranging from 40 ° C to 69 ° C in the drying chamber for each mode of airflow drying on each tray.

40|$|This report {{examines}} how the 27 cooled labs at NOCS which experience the most passive <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> {{can be better}} shaded from the sun. The objective is to greatly reduce the cooling load in these labs and hence electricity consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases. Cooling load can also be reduced by minimising heat from equipment and especially low-temperature freezers. Seven plates, on levels 1, 4 and 6, contain labs which have SE and SW outward-looking aspects i. e. away from the courtyards. The SE-facing labs may experience <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> in the mornings whereas the SW-facing labs may experience <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> throughout the working day. Currently <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> is reduced {{by the use of}} double glazing, internal solar-control films and/or various types of internal blinds. To further reduce <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> it is recommended that external solar-control films and brise soleil (fixed external shades) are installed while possibly retaining the blinds.

Multilayer ETFE panels are used to improve single membrane systems performances, reducing thermal losses, {{by the use of}} an air gap between two or more ETFE foils, generally serigraphed or surface treated to reduce <b>solar</b> <b>gains.</b> Surface temperatures and global solar radiation strongly affects mean radiant temperature (MRT), and comfort perceived by a user facing a transparent envelope as well as <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> strongly influences primary energy use for cooling in summer conditions.

This paper discusses the current implementation of the shading calculation in the passive house verification method.
