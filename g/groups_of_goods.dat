40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} has suggested that cognitive abilities {{may play a role in}} individual differences in speech processing. The present study took advantage of a widespread linguistic phenomenon of sound change to systematically assess the relationships between speech processing and various components of attention and working memory in the auditory and visual modalities among typically developed Cantonese-speaking individuals. The individual variations in speech processing are captured in an ongoing sound change–tone merging in Hong Kong Cantonese, in which typically developed native speakers are reported to lose the distinctions between some tonal contrasts in perception and/or production. Three <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> participants were recruited, with a first <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> perception and production, a second <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> perception but poor production, and a third <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> production but poor perception. Our findings revealed that modality-independent abilities of attentional switching/control and working memory might contribute to individual differences in patterns of speech perception and production as well as discrimination latencies among typically developed speakers. The findings not only have the potential to generalize to speech processing in other languages, but also broaden our understanding of the omnipresent phenomenon of language change in all languages.

50|$|These {{data from}} the Consumer Expenditure Survey are used {{in a number of}} {{different}} ways by a variety of users. One important use of the survey is for the periodic revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Bureau uses survey results to select new market baskets of goods and services for the CPI every two years, to determine the relative importance of CPI components, and to derive new cost weights for the market baskets. Working with the U.S. Census Bureau, Consumer Expenditure Survey data are used to calculate thresholds for the Supplemental Poverty Measure. The US Department of Agriculture uses Consumer Expenditure information in estimating the cost of raising children. Market researchers find the data useful in analyzing the demand for <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services. The data allow them to track spending trends of different types of consumer units. Government and private agencies use the data to study the welfare of particular segments of the population, such as those consumer units with a reference person aged 65 and older or under age 25, or for low-income consumer units. Economic policymakers use the data to study the impact of policy changes on the welfare of different socioeconomic groups. Researchers use the data in a variety of studies, including those that focus on the spending behavior of different family types, trends in expenditures on various expenditure components including new types of goods and services, gift-giving behavior, consumption studies, and historical spending trends.|$|E

30|$|Besides inflation, {{we focus}} on a battery of {{economic}} and labor variables, mostly by scrutinizing regional data, and conclude that they converge as well, mainly throughout our second period of analysis—with {{the exception of the}} real GVA per capita, which converges faster in the first period. These variables’ convergence at the geographic level is likely to have contributed to inflation’s convergence. Delving deeper into that analysis, our multivariate analysis highlights the role of unemployment, the costs of some non-wage input factors, the degree of competition and the services share in GVA. All the signs found on the coefficients are plausible, in terms of the Phillips curve, the non-wage price pressure, the disinflationary competition and sectoral specialization patterns—given the problems and rigidities of the goods and labor markets in Spain. However, the negative sign of the coefficient on real GVA per capita growth does not support the validity of the Balassa–Samuelson effect. A fundamental additional assessment undertaken, only possible for the second period, as the necessary data start in 1992, centres on the weightings given to the CPI’s <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services across Spanish provinces. We arrive at a very robust outcome: those weightings clearly tend to converge. That is, the shopping basket in the Spanish provinces has become more homogenous over the second period of our analysis. Finally, when we disaggregate provincial CPI-based inflation rates into province-level inflation rates of the 12 COICOP <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services, we find that, {{with the exception of the}} Communications group involving mainly non-tradables, all the other <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services appear to exhibit a high degree of convergence among pairs of inflation rates across provinces. This indicates that convergence in provincial inflation rates is widespread across COICOP <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services, irrespective of the tradables/non-tradables distinction.|$|E

Such variations, {{at the individual}} level, are exhibited by different patterns of perception and production. Recent studies have suggested individual differences in cognitive abilities as important sources of variability in speech processing. Yet, how different aspects of speech processing are associated with different components of cognitive abilities remains unclear. The present study aims to systematically assess the relationships between tone processing and various components of attention and working memory in the auditory and visual modalities among normal Cantonese-speaking individuals using a series of published tools. The individual variations in tone processing are captured in an on-going sound change – tone merging in Hong Kong Cantonese, in which normal native speakers are reported to lose the distinctions between tonal contrasts in perception and/or production. Three <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> participants have been identified, with one <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> perception and production of the six contrastive tones in Cantonese, a second <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> perception but poor production and a third <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> production but poor perception.

30|$|Yilmazkuday (2013) tackles a more {{disaggregated}} {{analysis of}} regional inflation, {{in the line}} of the works related to the Balassa–Samuelson literature. He works with ten main CPI groups for each region, distinguishing between groups concentrated on tradable and non-tradable components (period 1994 – 2004). In this study a break in Turkish inflation is captured in 2002, and in 2001 for the cross-sectional standard deviation of regional inflation rates. This author distinguishes between a pre-inflation targeting period and an inflation targeting period (which coincides with a flexible exchange rate) starting from January 2002. As in our study, Pesaran (2007 a)’s methodology is used, among other techniques—Arestis et al. (2014) also use that technique, but applied to countries’ inflation. As acknowledged by Yilmazkuday (2013), the results of this work require further study since during the inflation targeting period the CPI groups with relatively tradable components have diverged from each other, while the non-tradable groups have converged to each other. Caraballo and Usabiaga (2009 c) share some elements of the disaggregated study of Yilmazkuday (2013) in their analysis of Spanish and Andalusian inflation. Finally, in the present study we can state that when we disaggregate provincial CPI-based inflation rates into province-level inflation rates of the 12 COICOP <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services over the 1994 – 2015 period, we are able to uncover some interesting patterns. With the exception of the Communications group involving mainly non-tradables, all the other <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services appear to exhibit a high degree of convergence among pairs of inflation rates across provinces.
