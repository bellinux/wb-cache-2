5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but <b>it</b> <b>delivers</b> energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving the}} radial gates {{on the main}} channel, water flows to canals which are smaller and can carry less water. Flow {{regulators}} divert water on canals to distribution canals. Just like radial gates and sluice gates, flow generators can stop water flow if necessary. Distribution canals are the last step as far as engineers are concerned. <b>It</b> <b>delivers</b> water to different sections of large fields, pretty much an artificial river.|$|E

Diesel-oil mud is typically mixed with up to 40% brine water. Due to health, safety and environmental concerns, Diesel-oil mud is often replaced with vegetable, mineral, or synthetic food-grade oil-base drilling fluids, although diesel-oil mud is still in widespread use in certain regions.|$|E
25|$|Since 1992 the {{university}} has run a widening access programme, originally called the Centre for Lifelong Learning. Now called the Foundation Centre, <b>it</b> <b>delivers</b> courses at both Durham City and Queens campus, Stockton on Tees. The centre provides access to Durham degrees for mature students who show academic promise but do not hold the traditional entry requirements, and international students who may require an extra year of study to bring {{them up to the}} expected standard. The Centre runs a range of courses which cover specific academic disciplines and key skills. For the 2013–14 admissions cycle, 153 students took up offers of places in the programme.|$|E
25|$|B {{subunits}} of the AB5 toxins {{have the}} affinity towards binding glycan which {{some type of}} tumors seem to possess making it an easy target. One example is that of StxB which specifically binds with CD77 which shows expression {{on the surface of}} cancerous cells such as colon, pancreas, breast, and many more. Once StxB targets a cancerous cell, <b>it</b> <b>delivers</b> the A subunit of the toxin which eventually kills the cancerous cell. Yet another method is by using ER stress-inducing drugs which have been tested in mice to show positive synergistic responses. This is accomplished through fusion of epidermal growth factor(EGF) with SubAB's A subunit. Cancer cells that express receptors for EGF will then experience SubAB toxicity.|$|E

25|$|The Sorting Hat {{has shown}} the ability to conjure the Sword of Gryffindor from under its brim, as shown on two instances. Both times {{it is used to}} kill snakes; in Chamber of Secrets, it {{provides}} the sword to Harry to kill the Basilisk, and in Deathly Hallows, <b>it</b> <b>delivers</b> the sword to Neville. Dumbledore makes it clear in Chamber of Secrets that only a true Gryffindor can summon the sword in this fashion. In Deathly Hallows the Sorting Hat is set on fire by Voldemort, although it appears the hat was not destroyed, as Neville was able to draw the Sword of Gryffindor from it immediately after and behead Voldemort's snake Nagini. In the epilogue at the end of Deathly Hallows, the Hat's survival is confirmed, as Harry tells his youngest son that the Hat would take his preference into consideration.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{ecosystems}} need groundwater, of course. Some terrestrial ecosystems – for example, {{those of}} the open deserts and similar arid environments – exist on irregular rainfall and the moisture <b>it</b> <b>delivers</b> to the soil, supplemented by moisture in the air. While there are other terrestrial ecosystems in more hospitable environments where groundwater plays no central role, groundwater is in fact fundamental {{to many of the}} world’s major ecosystems. Water flows between groundwaters and surface waters. Most rivers, lakes, and wetlands are fed by, and (at other places or times) feed groundwater, to varying degrees. Groundwater feeds soil moisture through percolation, and many terrestrial vegetation communities depend directly on either groundwater or the percolated soil moisture above the aquifer for at least part of each year. Hyporheic zones (the mixing zone of streamwater and groundwater) and riparian zones are examples of ecotones largely or totally dependent on groundwater.|$|E
25|$|Many {{plants have}} flowers {{and these are}} the sexual organs of those plants. Flowers are usually hermaphroditic, {{producing}} both male and female gametes. The female parts, {{in the center of a}} flower, are the pistils, each unit consisting of a carpel, a style and a stigma. One or more of these reproductive units may be merged to form a single compound pistil. Within the carpels are ovules which develop into seeds after fertilization. The male parts of the flower are the stamens: these consist of long filaments arranged between the pistil and the petals that produce pollen in anthers at their tips. When a pollen grain lands upon the stigma on top of a carpel's style, it germinates to produce a pollen tube that grows down through the tissues of the style into the carpel, where <b>it</b> <b>delivers</b> male gamete nuclei to fertilize an ovule that eventually develops into a seed.|$|E

25|$|The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) is an {{independent}} professional association for civil engineers and a charitable body which exists to deliver benefits to the public. Based in London, ICE has over 90,000 members, of whom three quarters {{are located in the}} United Kingdom, while the rest are located in more than 150 countries around the world. ICE supports the civil engineering profession by offering professional qualification, promoting education, maintaining professional ethics, and liaising with industry, academia and government. Under its commercial arm, <b>it</b> <b>delivers</b> training, recruitment, publishing and contract services. As a professional body, ICE is committed to support and promote professional learning (both to students and existing practitioners), managing professional ethics and safeguarding the status of engineers, and representing the interests of the profession in dealings with government, etc. It sets standards for membership of the body; works with industry and academia to progress engineering standards and advises on education and training curricula.|$|E
25|$|Copper is {{imported}} into cells through the cell wall by the plasma {{membrane transport protein}} known as Copper Transporter 1, or Ctr1. Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B in the liver or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the trans-Golgi network to the proteins dopamine beta-monooxygenase, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, lysyl oxidase, and tyrosinase, depending on the cell type. CCS is the copper chaperone for the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase that protects cells against reactive oxygen species; <b>it</b> <b>delivers</b> copper in the cytoplasm and intermitochondrial space. Cox17 delivers copper to mitochondria to cytochrome c oxidase via the chaperones Cox11, Sco1, and Sco2. Other copper chaperones may exist and might include metallothionein and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Genetic and nutritional studies have illustrated the essential nature of these copper-binding proteins.|$|E
