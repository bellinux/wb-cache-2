50|$|The timber {{is not of}} much {{importance}} commercially, and is {{not found}} anywhere in great quantity. Macoun considered it more durable {{than that of the}} other elms, and better suited for railway ties, fence-posts, and rails, while Pinchot recommended planting it in the Mississippi valley, as it grows fast in youth, and could be utilized for fence-posts when quite young, since the sapwood, if thoroughly dried, is quite as durable as the heartwood.

40|$|There {{appear in}} the wood of Entandrophragma, beside the basic <b>interlocked</b> <b>grain,</b> local minute {{undulations}} of grain the manifestation of which are checkered figures, either slanting or horizontal, on the radial face of boards. In reference to the model the slanting checkered figure is interpreted {{as the result of}} sudden appearance in the cambium of a wave of orientational tendency (morphogenetic wave) of relatively short wavelengths and stabilized amplitude from the moment of its appearance, moving vertically. This wave induces undulations in the arrangement of cambial initials. The undulation pattern also moves, however, its rate is half that of the morphogenic wave rate. The amplitude of the undulations oscillates between a maximal value and null which means that in successive wood layers there is wavy grain alternating with straight grain. The horizontal checkered figure may be explained by a local shift of the prase by one half of the period of the morphogenic wave of relatively long wavelengths underlying the <b>interlocked</b> <b>grain</b> formation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the usability of different dynamic moduli of elasticity and wood density for {{the prediction of}} mechanical properties - static modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture - in samples with grain deflection from the longitudinal direction. Five tropical hardwoods (Afzelia bipindensis, Intsia bijuga, Millettia laurentii, Astronium graveolens and Microberlinia brazzavillensis) with different grain characteristics were used for this purpose. The fiber deflection {{was caused by the}} presence of <b>interlocked</b> <b>grain</b> or the working process. The three nondestructive techniques used in this study - longitudinal and flexural resonance method and ultrasound method - provided higher values of modulus of elasticity than the static bending test, but close correlation was observed between these variables. The weakest correlation was found for the ultrasound method which is probably caused by its measuring mechanism. The prediction of the modulus of rupture is less accurate when the dynamic modulus of elasticity is compared with the static modulus of elasticity; on the other hand, it was still good in comparison with the density model, which is inapplicable when grain deflection occurs in wood. In the wood of Zebrano where the <b>interlocked</b> <b>grain</b> was strongly developed, almost all of the correlation coefficients showed the lowest values and the prediction of modulus of rupture by nondestructive techniques was unsatisfactory...|$|R

We utilize network optimization algorithms (max-flow/min-cut) to determine the minimum surface formation energies and surfaces for intergranular fracture in 3 D polycrystals.

The 3 D fracture area is larger than projected from 2 D systems.
