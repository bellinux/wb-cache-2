5000|$|Ayanah Moor (born 1973, Norfolk, Virginia, United States) is an American {{conceptual}} artist {{working in}} print, video, mixed media, and performance.

[...] "I think <b>I</b> have always <b>been</b> sensitive {{to the need to}} self-define, because black people in America have historically been affected by the ways in which others have defined them.
