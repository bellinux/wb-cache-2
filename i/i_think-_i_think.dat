40|$|Some days I {{read that}} we at HEFCE are funding 1, 000 s of Intellectual Property (IP) managers. Who are {{managing}} around £ 56 M in licensing income. <b>I</b> <b>think-</b> outrageous. But then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{of the diversity}} of our universities and colleges, of their subjects and of their partners in society and the economy. And then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> – hang on, are these all focussed so intently on Intellectual Property that they need 1, 000 s of specialist IP managers? Clearly not – as this report from the Centre for Business Research, University of Cambridge and PACEC consultants describes. The report tries to capture the wide range of engagements between higher education and societies and the economy – and the support in place for research translation, development of human capital, soft networks, provision of facilities and civic and community outreach. Such engagements generated at least £ 2. 25 Bn in total value for the economy and society in 2007 - 08. Not that we at HEFCE or HEI leaders and managers should be complacent. HEFCE provides around 2 % of its funds from Government to help HEIs support their engagements with the wider world. This complements project support from such as Research Councils and Regional Development Agencies. We all need to maximise efficiency and effectiveness, both i...|$|R
5000|$|James Swindal {{suggests}} that Kompridis {{has not taken}} more recent work of Habermas' fully into account, but that nonetheless, [...] "this is a book {{that needed to be}} written" [...] because [...] "Habermas’s critique of disclosure was at times narrow and short-sighted. But as Habermas is now rethinking some of these shortcomings, Kompridis gives him - and indeed all critical theorists - ample resources" [...] for a better balance between disclosure and procedural thinking. Similarly, Dana Villa writes that [...] "Kompridis argues—persuasively, <b>I</b> <b>think—</b> that contemporary critical theory would do well to abandon its insistence that communicative rationality is the quasi-transcendental core of democratic legitimacy" [...] and rethink its suspicion of world disclosure.|$|R
40|$|Thanks to the Association of American Colleges and Universities, I have {{recently}} been given the wonderful opportunity to direct a project that brings together both regional and specialized accreditors to reflect {{on some of the}} challenges to American higher education as they busy themselves with revising their standards and processes. It {{seems to me that we}} have some grounds for being optimistic about the “little house,” as we’re calling undergraduate colleges, but there will be two or three intermediate steps in reaching that conclusion. The first challenge, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I’ve learned, is to be very clear about the difference between earning a degree and getting credentialed in something or other. The major difference between these two, as very well explained by Judith Eaton at CHEA, is general education. So, secondly, degree programs will be more what they ought to be and thus perhaps more successful the more they emphasize general education and a major together, rather than the major alone. That will require (third step) a highly integrated approach to student outcomes, curriculum design, and faculty responsibility. Finally, there will result a deeper and wider appreciation for those institutions that can do this best. And <b>I</b> <b>think—</b> to mix the metaphors shamelessly—that undergraduate colleges definitely have a leg up on this approach to higher education...|$|R
40|$|My {{thesis is}} based on a research. In my {{dissertation}} I am going to compare the ways English and Hungarian children use computers. My assumption is that the computer is less used for learning or getting information in Hungary than in England. I assume that both countries’ children use the computer for keeping contact, chatting and playing games. We know that more developed computers require skilled users. <b>I</b> <b>think-</b> it will be proven that Hungarian students own less developed tools; consequently they have less knowledge in the field of Computer Science. Hungarian learners are less familiar with Information Technology while the computer is used widely among English students. This essay tries to find the reasons and analyze the data of my survey. régi képzésangol nyelv és irodalom szakos tanár (távoktatás...|$|R

According to Wright:It was decided to shoot tho Cup scene first. A grey — Fitz Merv, <b>I</b> <b>think—</b> won the handicap which was to represent {{the race for the}} Sydney Cup, after making a brilliant run in the straight {{from the rear of the}} field. This was a tiny stroke of luck for the producer who thereupon secured a grey horse to be used right through the picture, and when he was seen winning the Cup in the final scene the fans went crazy with delight.

He had become cinematographer for the Australian Film Syndicate after Lacey Percival left the company to join the Australian Photo-Play Company.|$|R
40|$|Good Morning! We {{can look}} forward to an {{exciting}} week and, more importantly, through our delibera-tions and debates, to making contributions to public policy and political action which will improve the effectiveness ot public health programmes. That is obviously a tall order. but certainly not out of pro-portion to the stature of this audience. The World Health Organization and the Pan Ainerican Health Organization are pleased to be sponsors of this coin-ference and are glad to join with the many oLher sponsors who are such distinguished actors in the arena of public health. I will not try to keep you in suspense about whether or not <b>I</b> <b>think</b> discase elimination and eradi-cation are potcntially effective public health strate-gies. in case any ot you were wondering. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they certainly can bc effective. And while <b>I</b> <b>think-</b> they have a number ot especially attractive attributes as strategies. I see them as part of a continuum of strat-egies bounded on one side by global disease eradica-tion- that is, zero cases and zero risk of cases, and on the other by disease control- tlat is, a reduction in cases by sonie defined amount. Inteirmediarv straL-egies would include disease elimination (zero cases but willi continuing risk) and our famous WHO term. elinination of the disease as a public lhealth problem (reduction ot cases below what is consid-ered to be a public health risk) So. given my general support. I would likc to direct my remarks to some aspects of these strategies which can bc summarized by three quotaLions: (1) For if the trinmpet give an uncertain souind, who shall prepare himself to the bartle?

30|$|I {{will say}} that I {{had a lot of}} anxiety about going into the testing center in second semester, the first time, because I had overheard several of our {{students}} in our class say exactly what you just stated, that it does not prepare you for the real world and there were several comments made in second semester about those ‘special’ people who went to the testing center. And it was hurtful in the moment, but I came to the realization that I’m here for me, that I am here for my success, Jacob’s {{not going to do it}} for me (pointing to Jacob), Emerson’s not going to do it for me (pointing to Emerson). Nobody at this table is going to help me to get to where I need to be and pass the N-CLEX and go to work. It’s on me.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a product of a two month's visit- my first- which I paid to Brazil this summer. 1 I went with the {{intention}} of finding a good site for future fieldwork on Afro-Brazilian cults. Last year I started work on a theoretical paper on these cultB, which I had hoped would lead to a D. Phil. But one result of my visit is that I have decided to limit my research solely to the theoretical paper. In Brazil I spent 2 t weeks. in Rio, eleven days in Salvador, 2 weeks in Recife and one week in Fortaleza and Sao Luis. One of the most unexpected features. of the trip was to discover how deeply anthropologists were involved in the cults they study. The most interesting example of this was in Salvador. So while this paper draws on all my experience (i. e. from other places as well), I shall concentrate on Salvador as the special case. Salvador does have many unique features, and it is perhaps unfair to generalize too widely from it. But there are many lessons- <b>I</b> <b>think-</b> that can be learned about Brazil and about anthropology from the involvement o...|$|R
