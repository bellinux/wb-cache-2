25|$|The {{success of}} torture porn, and its boom during {{the mid to}} late 2000s, led to a cross over into genres other than horror. This became evident with the release of many crime thrillers, {{particularly}} the 2007 film <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> Killed Me starring Lindsay Lohan, and the 2008 film Untraceable, starring Diane Lane and Billy Burke. The British film WΔZ, starring Stellan Skarsgård and Selma Blair, and its US counterpart Scar, starring Angela Bettis and Ben Cotton continued to facilitate this hybrid form of torture porn, which was also to a lesser degree, evident in films such as Rendition (2007) starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Law Abiding Citizen (2009), and Unthinkable (2010) starring Samuel L. Jackson.|$|E

25|$|On April 2011, Hatfield {{announced}} her intention {{to work on}} a new album via fan-funding platform website PledgeMusic, from which she asked for her fans to help fund the project in exchange for personal artwork and memorabilia ranging from posters, CDs, demos, one of Juliana's First Act guitars (used during the recording sessions) and even locks of her hair. The project also included donations for the Save a Sato foundation to which Hatfield is a major contributor. Fan response was enthusiastic, going over 400% from the original project cost. The album was originally going to be titled Speeches Delivered to Animals and Plants, in reference to a passage in the John Irving novel The World According to Garp, but later Hatfield herself changed it for the title There's Always Another Girl, in reference to a song in the album of the same name she'd written as a defense for Lindsay Lohan after watching her flop <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> Killed Me.|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Moran first won {{election}} to the United States House of Representatives, defeating five-term Republican incumbent Stan Parris. During the campaign, Parris, referring {{to the issue of}} the Gulf War, said, [...] "The only three people <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> support Saddam Hussein's position are Moammar Gadhafi, Yasser Arafat, and Jim Moran." [...] Moran angrily responded by saying that Parris was [...] "a deceitful, fatuous jerk", and that he wanted [...] "to break his nose". Moran's well-financed campaign also focused on Parris' opposition to abortion. Moran upset Parris, winning by 7.1 percent. He was sworn into office in January 1991.|$|E
500|$|In early January 2007, {{production}} {{on the film}} <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> Killed Me was put on hold when Lohan underwent appendix surgery. Lohan admitted herself to the Wonderland Center rehabilitation facility for a 30-day stay, though she continued shooting the film, returning to the facility at night.

The film premiered in July 2007 to what Entertainment Weekly called [...] "an abysmal $3.5million."

500|$|Chloe is {{characterized}} as a [...] "dynamic fashion guru" [...] by Global BC and a [...] "bad girl" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Hendrickson expressed her happiness in playing a [...] "manipulative" [...] character who takes advantage of people. She said, [...] "I get to play, not only this edgy, spicy kind of character, but she's actually pretty funny too, so it's nice to bring some humor into it as well." [...] Chloe is a [...] "bitchy" [...] stylist who is hired at Jabot Cosmetics as a fashion consultant. Explaining her initial portrayal of Chloe, Hendrickson stated, [...] "I {{was the one who}} wanted to make her edgy and funny. Most of the people <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> are in the fashion business are a little bitchy. I wanted to make Chloe interesting, instead of just playing her like some girl who was putting on fancy clothes. There was no conflict there. The writers definitely gave me that in the writing, and I tweaked it a little. They seemed to enjoy it. Each day, Chloe kept getting funnier and bitchier." [...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of Jabot whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight. So [...] starts to give [...] a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in her face that either she doesn't fit into things or they have to make things larger for her, etc." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2008, Lohan {{made her}} first screen {{appearance}} since <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> Killed Me, on ABC's television series Ugly Betty. She guest starred in four episodes as Kimmie Keegan, an old schoolmate {{of the protagonist}} Betty Suarez. Articles about Lohan have appeared in various men's magazines. She was voted No. 10 {{on the list of}} [...] "100 Sexiest Women" [...] by readers of FHM in 2005, No.13 in 2006, No.30 in 2007, and No.41 in 2008, while Maxim placed her third on its [...] "Hot 100" [...] list in 2006 and first in 2007. Lohan has been the face of Jill Stuart, Miu Miu, and Dooney & Bourke, as well as the 2008 Visa Swap British fashion campaign. She was also the face of Italian clothing company Fornarina for its Spring/Summer 2009 campaign. Lohan has a long-lasting fascination with Marilyn Monroe going back to when she saw Niagara during The Parent Trap shoot. In the 2008 Spring Fashion edition of New York magazine, Lohan re-created Monroe's final photo shoot, known as The Last Sitting, including nudity, saying that the photo shoot was [...] "an honor." [...] The New York Times critic Ginia Bellafante found it disturbing, saying [...] "the pictures ask viewers to engage in a kind of mock necrophilia.... the photographs bear none of Monroe's fragility." [...] In 2008, Lohan launched a clothes line, whose name 6126 was designed to represent Monroe's birth date (June 1, 1926). The line started with leggings, before expanding to a full collection, covering 280 pieces [...] In April 2009, Lohan released a self-tanning spray under the brand name Sevin Nyne in collaboration with Sephora. In September 2009, Lohan became an artistic adviser for the French fashion house Emanuel Ungaro. A collection by designer Estrella Archs with Lohan as adviser was presented in October, receiving a [...] "disastrous" [...] reception, according to Entertainment Weekly and New York. Lohan left the company in March 2010.|$|E
500|$|Baseball {{experts and}} sportswriters {{consider}} Hornsby {{to be one}} of the greatest hitters of all time. His lifetime batting average of [...]358 is only exceeded by Ty Cobb's career mark of [...]367. He won seven batting titles in total, a feat tied or exceeded by only five players (Cobb (11 or 12, depending on the source), Tony Gwynn (8), Honus Wagner (8), Rod Carew (7), and Stan Musial (7)). Hornsby led the National League in slugging percentage nine times, a record that still stands. He also hit more home runs, drove in more runs, and had a higher batting average than any other National League player during the 1920s, which makes him one of four players in baseball history (along with Honus Wagner, Ted Williams, and Albert Pujols) to win a decade [...] "triple crown". He hit a career total of 301home runs and was the first National League player to hit 300. His 264home runs as a second baseman was a major league record for that position until Joe Morgan surpassed him in 1984. Hornsby was also a very consistent hitter whether he was playing at home or on the road. His lifetime home batting average was [...]359, and his lifetime away batting average was [...]358. Ted Williams, who had the highest career batting average since Hornsby, said that Hornsby was the greatest hitter for power and average in baseball, and Frankie Frisch said of him, [...] "He's the only guy <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> could hit [...]350 in the dark." [...] Hornsby also holds second place on the unofficial major league record list of [...] "consecutive games with two or more hits" [...] with 13games, first place honors going to Count Campau's 15-game streak. Hornsby is only the second right-handed batter in history to hit over [...]400 three times and is considered, according to the Los Angeles Times, to be the greatest right-handed hitter in history. He led the National League in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and total bases every year from 1920 to 1925. He is one of only two players (the other being Ted Williams) to win the batting Triple Crown more than once, but only Hornsby batted [...]400 on both occasions.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Frank {{responded to}} what he called [...] "wholly {{inaccurate}} efforts by Republicans to blame Democrats, and [...] in particular" [...] for the subprime mortgage crisis, which {{is linked to the}} financial crisis of 2007–2009. He outlined his efforts to reform these institutions and add regulations, but met resistance from Republicans, with the main exception being a bill with Republican Mike Oxley that died because of opposition from President Bush. The 2005 bill included Frank objectives, which were to impose tighter regulation of Fannie and Freddie and new funds for rental housing. Frank and Mike Oxley achieved broad bipartisan support for the bill in the Financial Services Committee, and it passed the House. But the Senate never voted on the measure, in part because President Bush was likely to veto it. [...] "If it had passed, that would {{have been one of the}} ways we could have reined in the bowling ball going downhill called housing," [...] Oxley told Frank. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote that Frank [...] "is the only politician <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> has argued that we needed tighter rules that intentionally produce fewer homeowners and more renters." [...] Once control shifted to the Democrats, Frank was able to help guide both the Federal Housing Reform Act (...) and the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (...) to passage in 2007. Frank also said that the Republican-led Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 and removed the wall between commercial and investment banks, contributed to the financial meltdown. Frank stated further that [...] "during twelve years of Republican rule no reform was adopted regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2007, a few months after I became the Chairman, the House passed a strong reform bill; we sought to get the [...] administration's approval to include it in the economic stimulus legislation in January 2008; and finally got it passed and onto President Bush's desk in July 2008. Moreover, [...] "we were able to adopt it in nineteen months, and we could have done it much quicker if the [...] administration had cooperated." ...|$|E
