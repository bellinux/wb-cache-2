5|$|Following the Rangers' defeat, he {{announced}} his retirement from the NHL on 4 May 2009, {{at the age of}} 35.

By announcing his retirement early in the off-season, Näslund forfeited a $2million buyout from the Rangers, which would have counted against the team's salary cap for the following season had he waited until he was formally bought out. Näslund retired from the NHL second among all-time Swedish players with 395 goals (behind Mats Sundin's 564; he retired the same year). His 869 points ranked fifth, while his 1,117 games played ranked fourth.|$|E

Following Soviet assent on 30 August 1958 to the one-year moratorium, the three countries conducted a series of tests in September and October. At least 54 tests were conducted by the US and 14 by the Soviet Union in this period. On 31 October 1958 the three countries initiated test-ban negotiations (the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Tests) and agreed to a temporary moratorium (the Soviet Union joined the moratorium shortly after this date). The moratorium would last for close to three years.|$|E
