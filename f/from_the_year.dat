5|$|The first {{attestation}} of the Latin term {{is attributed}} to a charter of Duke Trpimir <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 852.

The oldest preserved stone inscription is the 9th-century Branimir Inscription found near Benkovac, where Duke Branimir is styled as Dux Cruatorvm. The inscription is not believed to be dated accurately, but is likely to be from during the period of 879–892, during Branimir's rule.|$|E
5|$|The legendary traditions {{may also}} be in {{connection}} with the establishment of a trans-Carpathian frontier mark by the Hungarian monarchy, with its capital at Câmpulung, probably in {{the last decade of the}} 13th century.

5|$|After {{spending}} the offseason hunting with Smoky Joe Wood, Coveleski {{returned to the}} Indians in 1921, and throughout the season, the Indians battled the Yankees for first in the American League.

Coveleski pitched 315 innings in 1921, matching his career high <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> before, and had a 23–13 record and a 3.37 ERA. The following season, Coveleski married Frances Stivetts, the sister of his late wife.

Supernaturals first season averaged about 3.81million American viewers. According to Special Forces Soldier Master Sergeant Kevin Wise at a 2007 Supernatural convention, the DVDs most requested by armed forces personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan were the first two seasons of the series.|$|E
5|$|As {{the week}} goes on, {{the people in}} the cabin are running out of food, while Satoru is {{subjected}} to multiple attempts on his life by an unknown assailant. As days pass, Satoru notices that he can see the same lunar phase at SPHIA and at the cabin and that both areas are surrounded by a body of water. It is revealed that the Yuni in the cabin is <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 2012, while the Yuni at SPHIA is from 2011. Satoru finds a locked room in the basement of SPHIA, where he encounters a man named Enomoto, monitoring the facility through cameras. Enomoto tells Satoru that it is not consciousnesses that are transferred but the entire area within a 110-metre radius that is transported across time and space, with their consciousnesses left behind. Satoru attempts to destroy the facility, and Enomoto tries to stop him. A set of transfers occur, and Enomoto is killed by someone using Satoru's body.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla {{was born}} in Lugdunum, Gaul (now Lyon, France), on 4April 188 to Septimius Severus and Julia Domna. He had a {{slightly}} younger brother, Geta, who would briefly rule as co-emperor alongside him. Caracalla's father, Septimius Severus, appointed Caracalla joint Augustus and full emperor <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 198 onwards. His brother Geta was granted the same title in 210. In 202 Caracalla was forced to marry the daughter of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, Fulvia Plautilla, a woman whom he hated, though for what reason is unknown. By 205 Caracalla had succeeded in having Plautianus executed for treason, though he had probably fabricated {{the evidence of the}} plot himself. It was then that he banished his wife, whose later killing might have been carried out under Caracalla's orders.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{work began}} in August 1898, {{although}} the BS was continuing {{to develop new}} route plans. The bill for 1899, published on 22 November 1898, requested more time for the construction works and proposed two extensions to the railway and a modification to part of the previously approved route. The first extension, like the NC's plan <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> before, was to branch from the already-approved route under Park Crescent, but then followed a more northerly route than the NC, running under Regent's Park to cross the park's Outer Circle between Chester Road and Cumberland Gate where a station was to be constructed. The route then followed Cumberland Street West (now Nash Street), Cumberland Market, Cumberland Street East and Edward Street (both now Varndell Street), before ending at a station under Cardington Street {{on the west side}} of Euston station.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his growing}} {{national}} fame, Dow continued to face opposition at home. Both Dow and his opponents engaged in anonymous newspaper campaigns against the other, often making personal attacks alongside political arguments. For the 1852 municipal election, the Democrats nominated Albion Parris, {{a former governor}} and United States Senator, to run against Dow. While the Democrats rallied behind their candidate, Dow's vigorous enforcement of prohibition divided his party, and in two wards the Whigs ran an anti-Dow ticket instead. On election day, Dow slightly increased his vote total <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> before, with 1496, but Parris outpolled him, bringing in 1900 votes. Although the Whigs controlled voter registration at the time, Dow blamed his loss on illegal voting by Irish immigrants.|$|E

Inductees and other former NWA wrestlers are seated at tables with fans to provide an intimate atmosphere. Although most people honored by the hall attend the dinner and induction ceremony, some are inducted posthumously and others are unable to attend for medical reasons.|$|E
