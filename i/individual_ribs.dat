The model was used to study rib cage mechanics in two scolioses, one with a 43 [deg] and the other with a 70 [deg] Cobb angle. Scoliotic rib cage deformities were quantified by parameters measuring the rib cage lateral offset, rib cage axial rotation, rib cage volume and rib distortion.

Some studies suggest that these factors do not operate {{in the same way}} at the upper (ribs 1 – 5) and lower thorax (ribs 6 – 10) during postnatal growth, but it is unknown if the ontogenetic thoracic changes are produced by morphological changes of the ribs (intrinsic rib factors) or by external factors related to costal joints (extrinsic rib factors). Material and methods: To clarify these questions, we applied 3 D geometric morphometrics of landmarks and sliding semilandmarks (N[*]=[*] 20 /rib) to 280 <b>individual</b> <b>ribs</b> (1 – 10) of Homo sapiens comprising the entire human ontogeny and growth simulations were carried out. Results: PCA shows that intrinsic rib factors (rib torsion and axial rib curvature) are ontogenetic factors of variability that contribute to configuring the adult thorax shape. Moreover, growth simulations and regression slopes suggest that the upper thorax unit is comprised by ribs 1 – 7 and the lower unit at least by ribs 8 – 10. Discussion: These results suggest anatomical constraints for ontogenetic rib variation, since ribs 1 – 7 (true ribs) are directly linked to the sternum. Moreover, these results are supported by functional anatomy because pulmonary kinematics would influence the upper unit and diaphragmatic kinematics would influence the lower one. Our findings are relevant not only to understanding how changes at <b>individual</b> <b>ribs</b> contribute to the adult thorax morphology, but also to the development and evolution of the modern human rib cage.

40|$|The {{coupling}} {{between the}} ribs and the lung in dogs increases with increasing rib {{number in the}} cranial part of the rib cage and then decreases markedly in the caudal part. The hypothesis was raised that this non-uniformity is primarily related to differences between {{the areas of the}} lung subtended by the different ribs, and in the current study we tested this idea by assessing the effects of passive lung inflation. Thus, by causing a descent of the diaphragm, inflation would expand the area of the lung subtended by the caudal ribs and improve the coupling between these ribs and the lung. The axial displacements of the ribs and the changes in airway opening pressure (DeltaP(ao)) were measured in anaesthetized, pancuronium-treated, supine dogs while loads were applied in the cranial direction to <b>individual</b> <b>rib</b> pairs at functional residual capacity (FRC) and after passive inflation to 10 and 20 cm H(2) O transrespiratory pressure. In agreement with the hypothesis, inflation caused an increase in DeltaP(ao) for ribs 9 and 10. The most prominent alteration, however, was a marked decrease in DeltaP(ao) for ribs 2 - 8; at 20 cm H(2) O, DeltaP(ao) for these ribs was only 30 % of the value at FRC. Additional measurements indicated that this decrease in DeltaP(ao) results partly from the increase in diaphragmatic compliance but mostly from the reduction in outward rib displacement. This alteration in the pattern of rib motion should add to the decrease in muscle length to reduce the lung expanding action of the external intercostal muscles at high lung volumes.

The objectives of this work were: (1) develop a method and quality assurance guidelines for the analysis of marine lipid classes, (2) use the method to investigate the seasonal variability in polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and lipids in a contaminated and reference population of ribbed mussels (Gukensia demissus), and (3) examine the variability in lipid class composition and PCBs in <b>individual</b> <b>ribbed</b> mussels along a pollution gradient. ^ The method developed demonstrated that lipid classes can be analyzed quantitatively with Iatroscan® TLC-FID. Samples need to be analyzed immediately after homogenization due to the rapid degradation of total lipid and lipid classes. A laboratory intercalibration verified the accuracy of the method and identification of the lipid classes. During the seasonal study, no significant relationship was observed between the PCB concentrations and total lipid; however, there was a significant relationship between total PCB and total triacylglycerol concentration at the contaminated site. The most significant difference between sites was that significantly higher total lipid, total nonpolar and triacylglycerol concentrations were observed in the contaminated population. To normalize PCBs or study their affects in animals with low lipid concentrations, it is desirable to measure lipid classes. At a minimum, total lipid should be separated into nonpolar and polar fractions. ^ Along a pollution gradient, variability in the measured parameters was greatest at the site with median PCB concentrations. The sample number needed to examine any population varied and should be assessed prior to beginning any field study. Studies with deployed and indigenous ribbed mussels showed that the acetone mobile polar lipid (AMPL) increases significantly when animals are deployed and may be an indicator of stress. Blue (Mytilus edulis) and ribbed mussels have similar lipid classes; however, blue mussels accumulate more PCBs at lower water-temperatures demonstrating that PCB bioaccumulation is dependent on other factors than lipid concentration. ...|$|R

40|$|Typically, {{aircraft}} {{roll control}} {{is accomplished by}} simultaneously moving ailerons together and in opposite angular direction. Nevertheless, throughout the flying range, more particularly in cruise conditions, it is highly desirable to increase aircraft aerodynamic performance by a differential control of the lift distribution over the wing span. Recent European design studies concerning morphing devices, such as the Clean Sky multifunctional flap or the SARISTU trailing edge device, have largely proved the potential of novel aircraft structural systems, aiming at adaptively modify the wing structural shape to reduce the induced drag penalty associated with off-design flight conditions. In particular, wing camber variation was achieved through adaptive wing trailing edges because of the highly associated L/D ratio enhancements. Such projects proved also the aileron region {{to be the one}} where higher cruise benefits could be achieved by local camber variations. Following the enthusiastic results, achieved with the Adaptive trailing edge device, a new challenge has been faced up. The former configuration did in fact refer to the standard position of the flap, leaving apart the aileron region. There are several reasons to leave that part unchanged. The most relevant may be associated {{to the fact that the}} aileron has a critical function in the aircraft flight and its collapse could lead to dramatic failures. The investigated configuration would have lied over an extended region of the aileron instead than a limited part, as in the case of a flap, characterised by a large chord. As a direct consequence, the available volumes are reduced and the installation of integrated actuators could have been a problem. Finally, the aeroelastic response of the device is critical as well and its strong modification should have been deeply studied. On the other hand, the studies on the ATED showed as the region, farer from the root, gave a more significant contribution to the aerodynamic behaviour. So, it was really interesting to investigate the possibility to extend the adaptive trailing edge technology to the aileron region. The occasion was given by a joint Italian/Canadian research activity fostered by the Consortium de Recherche et d’Innovation en Aerospatiale au Quebec (CRIAQ). The activity aimed at realising a full-scale demonstrator of a wing section in the tip region for investigating the capability of wing box and trailing edge morphing device, to ensure a certain level of flow control and aerodynamic performance variations, respectively. The first issue was in charge of the Canadian team (ETS, NRC, Thales Aerospace, Bombardier AS), while the Italian group (University of Naples and CIRA) aimed at realising a device for the aileron camber control. The enlisted problems were all evident at the very first approach. Volume limitation forced the designers to follow a different strategy. Instead of having a couple of actuators acting on each rib, the architectural layout was specialised per each single bay. At the aileron root this possibility was maintained, while the more external two bays were commanded by a single actuator. In other words, the last two segments were made of two slave and a master ribs, driven by a single actuator. Calculation showed as this configuration was able to maintain the specified loads. Aeroelastic studies confirmed the reliability of the device, in sense that the selected architecture was demonstrated to be safe in the design flight conditions. The adaptive aileron finally maintained the original capability while ensuring morphing characteristic. This target was accomplished by realising a device with two separate motor system. The first, acting on the main aileron shaft, to preserve its characteristic dynamic response for flight control. The second, acting on the rib, implemented the searched camber variations to follow the aerodynamic necessities related to fuel consumption. Another relevant point concerns the skin. In order to check the possibility of skipping the need of implementing a compliant solution, a heavy and sophisticated element, the single hinged blocks were properly shaped to slide one into the other like a meniscus. This solution was however strongly correlated to manufacture tolerances and the assembly precision, because small deviation could have had a significant impact on the kinematic performance. As usual, vantages and disadvantages try to compensate each other. The innovative device can be considered as a system with augmented capabilities aimed at working in cruise, by means of symmetric deflection, to obtain a near optimum wing geometry enabling optimal aerodynamic performance. The approach, including underlying concepts and analytical formulations, combines design methodologies and tools required to develop such an innovative control surface. A major difficulty in the development of morphing devices is to reach an adequate compromise between high load-carrying capacity to withstand aerodynamic loads and sufficient flexibility to achieve the target shapes. These targets necessitate the use of innovative structural and actuation solutions. When dealing with adaptive structures for lifting surfaces, the level of complexity naturally increases as a consequence of the augmented functionality of the designed system. In specific, an adaptive structure ensures a controlled and fully reversible transition from a baseline shape to a set of different configurations, each one capable of withstanding the associated external loads. To this aim, a dedicated actuation system shall be designed. In addition, the adopted morphing structural kinematics shall demonstrate complete functionality under operative loads. Such a morphing device wants to augment the former device by adapting local wing camber shape and lift distribution through a quasi-static deflection, its excursion ranging into few unit of degrees, positive and negative. In a morphing aircraft design concept, the actuated system stiffness, load capacity and integral volumetric requirements drive flutter, strength and aerodynamic performance. Design studies concerning aircraft flight speed, manoeuvre load factor and actuator response provide sensitivities in structural weight, aeroelastic performance and actuator flight load distributions. Based on these considerations, actuation mechanism constitutes a very fundamental aspect for adaptive structures design because the main prerequisite is to accomplish variable shapes within the physical constraints established by the appropriate actuation arrangement. This thesis addresses the design of a morphing aileron with a specific focus on the structural actuation system sizing and integration while the structural sizing was under Unina responsibility. Particular focus is given to the numerical validation of the entire aileron integrated with the actuation leverage by means of FE model and experimental tests campaign. The aileron actuation system is driven by load bearing servo-electromechanic rotary actuator in a distributed and un-shafted arrangement which combine load carrying and actuation capacities. The use of electro-mechanical actuators is coherent with a “more electric approach” for next-generation aircraft design. Such an actuation architecture allows the control of the morphing structure by using a reduced mass, volume, force and consumed power with respect to conventional solutions. Benefits are obvious. No hydraulic supply buses (easier to maintain and store without hydraulics leaks), improved torque control, more efficiency without fluid losses and elimination of flammable fluids. In addition, it is potentially possible to move <b>individual</b> <b>ribs</b> either synchronously or independently to different angles (twist) in order to enhance aerodynamic benefits during flight. On the other side, actuators susceptibility to jamming may represent the most important drawback that can be tested and prevented by means of an iron bird facility. Finally, the realised system was assembled onto a wing model and tested in a wind tunnel at the National Research Council (NRC) facilities in Ottawa (CAN). On the same model, the adaptive wing box was also installed. The adaptive aileron device proved its functionality in real flow conditions and the main aerodynamic results are herein presented and widely described. The developed device has a lot of further potentialities, that will be object of further works and publications and that are currently explored by the authors: for instance, by giving it a large bandwidth, it could be used as an additional load alleviation device for the outer wing in order to reduce peak loads for gusts. Moreover it can be tailored for active load control distribution in order to modify spanwise lift distribution obtaining a reduced wing root bending moment; in such a manner a lightweight design can be assessed...|$|E

Autor također Andrijiću pripisuje dva do sada neprepoznata djela iz korčulanske katedrale: sakristiju i grobnicu biskupa Malumbre. The article {{tries to}} explain the {{extraordinary}} importance for Dalmatian art in general, and for architecture in particular, of Marko Andrijić, {{the greatest of all}} the master builders and sculptors of Korčula. He left his best achievements in the cathedral of his home town: the ciborium above the high altar and the top storey of the bell tower which, together with Marko 2 ̆ 7 s last work, the campanile of the Franciscan church in Hvar, became the model for a whole series of Dalmatian Renaissance and baroque church towers. A few architectural and sculptural works in the cathedral of Korčula which have not been recognized as works of Andrijić are ascribed to his opus. The construction of the campanile of the cathedral in Korčula dragged on through the whole first half of the fifteenth century, when the work stopped until the completion of the church. The sturdy lower part of the tower was built in the romanesque tradition. On 13 February 1481 Marko Andrijić signed a contract for the construction of the top part of the campanile. It was a combination of three basic architectural elements: -The main element is the octagonal loggia with pillars which carry the dome consisting of thin stone slabs grooved into diagonal stone ribs. -A narrow passage with a stone balustrade which Marko succeeded in creating around the loggia, above the 70 centimetres wide wall. -A lantern on top of the dome with eight slender pillars which continue the lines of the ribs. The structure of the top section of the Korčula belfry is particularly interesting. It is essentially a gothic skeletal structure in which each element has a clearly determined function. Also gothic is the requirement that the structure should be as light as possible. The profile of specific elements should be the smallest possible, utilizing the fabric almost to the ultimate limit of strength. However, because well-known elements were used in a completely new manner, we can define the structure as being in the mixed gothic-Renaissance style, which is usually used to describe Dalmatian decorative sculpture of this period. The dome is smooth within, while on the outside rounded ribs mark the edges. The segments of the dome consist of thin slabs (only 8 centimetres thick!) which are joggled together, and tongued and grooved into the <b>ribs.</b> <b>Individual</b> elements are so thin that they needed to be additionally fastened by means of copper cramps. These cramps, which tie together all the slabs and all the segments of the ribs, ensure the behaviour of the dome as a three-dimensional shell. Metal cramps take all tensile stresses, stone is loaded only in compression (which means that its bearing capacity is used to the maximum), and only vertical load is transmitted to the structural elements below the dome. A very satisfactory structural action of the loggia is thus achieved. We can {{go so far as to}} say that Marko, besides the knowledge acquired in his father 2 ̆ 7 s workshop, from his own experience as stone cutter and master builder, and from his study of buildings in his homeland and in Italy (his work in Venice was documented in 1473 and 1474, and in Mantua in 1478), was inspired by 223 Korčula 2 ̆ 7 s shipbuilding tradition. In the upper part of Andrijić 2 ̆ 7 s campanile there are a great number of carpentry-style joints between stone elements. ***** The dome of the Korčula campanile, built between 1481 and 1483, and the dome of the cathedral of Šibenik which was erected a little later by Nicolo di Giovanni Fiorentino to the design of his predecessor Juraj Dalmatinac (Giorgio da Sebenico), have a very similar basic structural concept: a combination of stone ribs tongued and grooved with thin slabs. Because we cannot evaluate exactly the responsibility of each of the two master builders for the structural idea, because the activity of Marko Andrijić falls between theirs, and because we know that Juraj and Nicolo came to Korčula to purchase stone for the building of Šibenik cathedral, it is to be supposed that the builders of Korčula and of Šibenik influenced each other. A comparison of the two buildings leads to the conclusion that Andrijić resolved most of formal and structural problems more successfully than Nicolo Fiorentino. Andrijić achieved the transition from the square to the octagonal plan by the use of a balustrade which "softens" the clash of the two geometrical forms. In Šibenik the change from the cubic base to the octagonal drum is straightforward. In Korčula the octagonal structural plan was followed through systematically: the eight pillars of the loggia continue into the eight ribs of the dome, and into the eight columns of the lantern. In Šibenik, on the other hand, each side of the drum is composed of two bays, so that only the angle pilasters have the logical structural continuation in the dome ribs, while those in the middle carry only the cornice. The lantern of the campanile in Korčula is a more successful crown to the composition than the finial on top of the dome in Šibenik, where a lantern could be expected both for formal and functional reasons - to let in light and air. The slabs of the dome in Korčula are joggled in such a way that the thickness of the dome is the same throughout, and its surface smooth within and without, while in Sibenik the joints are emphasized by the thicker lower edges of the slabs, a detail which added to the complexity of the construction. In the structural system of the dome in Korčula two kinds of stress - compression and tension - are opposed by two adequate materials: stone (slabs and ribs) and copper (cramps). In Šibenik the same material - stone- resists both kinds of stress. This can be described as structural "integrity", but it created a number of difficulties which were resolved by the use of a sophisticated system of grooves and stone wedges in the ribs. ***** Although there are some campanili with elements similar to those in Korčula, we find the distinctive combination of an octagonal domed loggia with a passageway and a stone balustrade only in the small Apulian town of Soleto. The tower, with the later parish church next to it, was built at the end of the fourteenth century by Francesco Colaci, but the upper section received its present shape only during its baroque restoration, when it was completely remodelled. The closest we can get to the campanile in Korčula is in two. Renaissance imaginary views kept in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence. The first of these is an engraving dated about 1475 and attributed to Bramante, while the authorship 224 of a drawing dated somewhat later has previously been ascribed to Peruzzi and more recently to Vasari. For the time being the question of whether the campanili depicted in these two vedute were real or imaginary "ideal" buildings remains open. ***** About twenty years after having built the campanile in Korčula, Marko erected the tower of the Franciscan church in Hvar. This time he was able to make the design for the complete building, not only for the upper part. Although he repeated the traditional concept of a square prism, lightened by the use of openings which increase towards the top, Andrijić articulated the mass of the building in a new way. Apart from the common string courses between the storeys, he introduced them also at the level of the capitals of the columns in the bays. The height of the storeys increases towards the top, which adds to the slenderness of the tower. It seems natural that at the beginning of the sixteenth century Andrijić abandoned the abundant gothic decoration which covered his campanile in Korčula. On the tower in Hvar he introduced Renaissance details, like the balustrade of classical simplicity and the attic below the dome. Apart from the gradual opening up of the wall mass, the slenderness and the visual ascent of the campanile were achieved by the increase in height of the storeys, which was carried out in a very subtle way. The proportions of individual storeys were derived from the square (1 : 1), from the golden section rectangle (0 = [J s+t l I 2) and from descendant rectangles (2 I 0, 2 I 3 0, 3 I 4 0, 4 I 50). the proportions of the lesser elements (bays, division of storeys by string courses) also belong to the same family. The relation between the proportions of the storeys, i. e. the increase in height of each single storey was obtained in a different way. The starting proportions are those of a square. The height of the second storey is achieved by the addition of the thickness of the string course to the height of the first storey, and the height of the third storey by adding to the second storey the thickness of two string courses. The height of the fourth storey is again obtained by the addition of the thickness of only one string course. In this way the increase in height of storeys is very slow, almost imperceptible, and the string courses are involved in the proportional scheme of the whole. We can say that the architect borrowed the method used by a sculptor who takes into consideration the view from below and elongates the upper parts of his sculpture to counterbalance perspective shortenings. The Franciscan bell tower is the first in the line of four campanili in Hvar which were erected in the same style. It seems quite certain that Andrijić 2 ̆ 7 s tower of the Franciscan church was the model for the builders of the cathedral belfry, and that it indirectly influenced the design of the campanili of the churches of St Mark and of|$|R
