25|$|Most {{developing}} countries have abundant renewable energy resources, including solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy, and biomass, {{as well as}} the ability to manufacture the relatively labor-intensive systems that harness these. By developing such energy sources {{developing countries}} can reduce their <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oil</b> and natural gas, creating energy portfolios that are less vulnerable to price rises. In many circumstances, these investments can be less expensive than fossil fuel energy systems.|$|E
25|$|Nicaragua is {{the country}} in Central America with the lowest {{electricity}} generation, {{as well as the}} lowest percentage of population with access to electricity. The unbundling and privatization process of the 1990s did not achieve the expected objectives, resulting in very little generation capacity added to the system. This, together with its high <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oil</b> for electricity generation (the highest in the region), led to an energy crisis in 2006 from which the country has not fully recovered yet.|$|E
25|$|Changing price {{conditions}} favored {{conservation and}} {{alternative sources of}} industrial energy. Although the investment costs were high, many energy-intensive industries successfully reduced their <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oil</b> during the late 1970s and 1980s and enhanced their productivity. Advances in microcircuitry and semiconductors in the late 1970s and 1980s led to new growth industries in consumer electronics and computers, and to higher productivity in pre-established industries. The net result of these adjustments was to increase the energy efficiency of manufacturing and to expand knowledge-intensive industries. The service industries expanded in an increasingly postindustrial economy.|$|E

25|$|Following the 1979 {{energy crisis}} {{resulting}} from the Iranian Revolution of that year, Robert Muldoon, the Prime Minister between 1975 and 1984, instituted an economic strategy known as Think Big. Large scale industrial plants were established based on New Zealand's abundant natural gas. A new range of products for export such as ammonia, urea fertilizer, methanol and petrol were produced and with greater use of electricity (with the electrification of the North Island Main Trunk railway) with the goal that this would reduce New Zealand's <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oil</b> imports.|$|E

Daybreaker lyrics were written by Carter and Tom Searle, who focused on political and [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes. Carter described [...] "Devil's Island" [...] as [...] "one of the hardest songs to write" [...] because of the prominence of its theme of rioting. Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, [...] "With money firmly ingrained into our global society we really need to look to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution". Carter said [...] "Black Blood", which was included on the re-release, is about the oil industry, society's strong <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oil</b> and the way [...] "short term profit is the only thing these people think about, instead of the longevity of what we really could do and how we could stabilize what's really {{going on in the world}} right now".|$|E
2500|$|Due to its ethanol fuel production, Brazil has {{sometimes}} {{been described as a}} bio-energy superpower. Ethanol fuel is produced from sugar cane. Brazil has the largest sugar cane crop in the world, and is the largest exporter of ethanol in the world. [...] With the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian government initiated in 1975 the Pró-Álcool program. The Pró-Álcool or Programa Nacional do Álcool (National Alcohol Program) was a nationwide program financed by the government to phase out all automobile fuels derived from fossil fuels [...] in favour of ethanol. The program successfully reduced by 10 million the number of cars running on gasoline in Brazil, thereby reducing the country's <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oil</b> imports.|$|E

[...] On December 1, 2009, McClintock first spoke of the Fortuño administration proposal, during the 33rd Miami Conference on the Caribbean & Central America, that a Caribbean Basin electric grid be developed to reduce the region's [...] "addiction to oil", as he called it.|$|E
2500|$|Airbus {{has joined}} Honeywell and JetBlue {{in an effort}} to reduce {{pollution}} and <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oil.</b> They are trying to develop a biofuel that could be used by 2030. The companies propose supplying almost one third of the world's aeroplane fuel needs without affecting food resources. Algae is viewed as a possible alternative energy source because it absorbs carbon dioxide during its growth, and because its use will not affect food production. However, algae and other vegetation-based fuels are still just experiments, and fuel-bearing algae has been expensive to develop. [...] Airbus recently operated the first alternative fuel flight on a mixture of 60% kerosene and 40% gas to liquids (GTL) fuel in one engine. It did not cut carbon emissions, but it was free of sulphur emissions. Alternative fuel was able to work properly in Airbus' aeroplane engine, demonstrating that alternative fuels should not require new aeroplane engines. This flight and the company's long term efforts are considered big strides towards environmentally friendly aeroplanes.|$|E
2500|$|A high {{proportion}} of primary commodities in national exports significantly {{increases the risk of}} a conflict. A country at [...] "peak danger", with commodities comprising 32% of gross domestic product, has a 22% risk of falling into civil war in a given five-year period, while a country with no primary commodity exports has a 1% risk. When disaggregated, only petroleum and non-petroleum groupings showed different results: a country with relatively low levels of dependence on petroleum exports is at slightly less risk, while a high level of <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oil</b> as an export results in slightly more risk of a civil war than national dependence on another primary commodity. The authors of the study interpreted this as being the result of the ease by which primary commodities may be extorted or captured compared to other forms of wealth; for example, it is easy to capture and control the output of a gold mine or oil field compared to a sector of garment manufacturing or hospitality services.|$|E
