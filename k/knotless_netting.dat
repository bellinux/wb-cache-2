5000|$|Different weaving {{patterns}} can be {{used for}} different kinds of netting. Depending {{on the use of the}} textile, size of the holes in the net will vary. Weaving patterns, opposed to knitting patterns, are more often used for <b>knotless</b> <b>netting.</b> Jason Mills states that, as there are no knots used to produce this kind of netting, it is usually less sturdy and movable. Each strand, when used for a <b>knotless</b> <b>netting</b> weave, can sometimes be coated before being woven to ensure more durability. If a weave is coated after being woven it can show to be more durable when exposed to heat or pressure- depending on the type of coat ...|$|E
5000|$|A bilum is {{a string}} bag {{made by hand}} in Papua New Guinea. The bag {{can be made by}} a process known as looping or <b>knotless</b> <b>netting</b> [...] or by crocheting. Traditionally, the string used was handmade, {{normally}} from plant materials. Now, however, many people who can afford to do so make their bilums from store bought yarn and string.|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{materiality}} cannot simply {{focus upon}} {{the characteristics of}} objects but must engage in the dialectic of people and things’ (Meskell 2005, 4). A number of researchers {{have looked at the}} significance of the properties of cloth to understand their suitability to environment and function. This research is a good basis and has potential to be developed further. In this paper I investigate the physical, chemical and aesthetic properties of linen, wool and lime bast fibres and <b>knotless</b> <b>netting,</b> woven textiles and twining as fibres and cloth structures that were used to make cloth from the Neolithic to Bronze Age in the Alpine region of Europe. Through these results I look at examples of how these cloth types may have been used and valued in these societies...|$|E
50|$|For a cricket net, the netting is {{the most}} {{important}} component. The net is usually manufactured in a synthetic polymer such as polyethylene, this is a hard wearing and relatively economic material. Prior to the mid-1990s nets were often made from nylon, however after the significant spikes in crude oil prices it was no longer viable to use nylon. The net will be black in colour or occasionally green. The mesh size of the net will be 50mm and will commonly have a twine diameter ranging from 1.8mm - 3.0mm. Cricket nets are supplied from a <b>knotless</b> or knotted <b>netting</b> - {{as a rule of thumb}} knotted nets are considered to be superior. It is important to understand that twine thickness of knotted and <b>knotless</b> <b>nets</b> are not directly comparable as breaking strengths of knotted nets are higher than knotless. A good standard cricket net will be UV stabilised and rot proof. For people who construct their own cricket cage, the netting is the only component which they need to purchase from a specialist supplier. Cricket netting is seamed at the edges to stop netting fraying. These seams are usually a 6mm cord sewn into the netting where it meets a cage or end. Canvas blinkers can be added to offer privacy and to reduce net wear. Also partial canvas skirts of 0.5m (at the lower portion of the netting) are added to prevent animal damage at night from creatures walking into netting and chewing out of it.|$|R
40|$|Trap nets were {{designed}} and constructed to capture steelhead smolts (Salmo gairdneri) {{that had been}} stocked as fry in two coastal streams of British COlumbia. The traps were fabricated from <b>knotless</b> nylon <b>netting</b> material and had a horizontal screening section to cope with fluctuations in water flow and debris. The nets were suspended from cables from which they could be detached easily for cleaning or during extreme flows. The trap nets were used in flows of approximately 2. 4 to 18. 0 m 3 /s on Lynn Creek and from 3. 4 to 14. 0 m 3 /s on the Englishman River. Both nets remained operational nets remained operational at flows of approximately 10 m 3 /s. In efficiency tests, 78. 1 and 54. 7 % of the steelhead smolts released above the trap nets were captured in the Lynn Creek and the Englishman River traps, respectively. The nets were an effective and inexpensive means of fishing these streams. They provide and easily cleaned, large screening area and can be modified for other locations...|$|R
40|$|A {{traditional}} codend (40 mm diamond mesh) and {{an experimental}} codend (40 mm square mesh) made of 2. 6 mm diameter <b>knotless</b> PA <b>netting</b> were tested {{on a commercial}} trawl net on a sandy-muddy bottom (~ 70 m depth) of the Adriatic sea {{in order to assess}} the size selectivity of European hake (Merluccius merluccius) and the reduction of the discards in a demersal multi-species trawl fishery. The catch was sorted as target species and bycatch and the selectivity with respect to European hake was investigated using the covered codend method. The square-mesh codend allowed a reduction of about 37 % of the fraction discarded at sea. The mean catch obtained with the experimental codend was lower than that obtained with the traditional codend (about 14 kg per haul) but the short-term economic losses were low (~ 12 %). The square-mesh codend was also more selective than the traditional codend, giving the juveniles of European hake a good chance of escape: the mean selection length (L 50) was 7. 60 cm in DM and 12. 98 cm in SM. Moreover, the mesh configuration did not affect the gear’s performance. Thus, the square-mesh codend could be an easy, inexpensive and useful solution for a more sustainable management of the resources in Adriatic multi-species fishery...|$|R
40|$|By-catches of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) below {{legal size}} (44 cm total length) in the {{seasonal}} pelagic longline fisheries for haddock {{off the coast}} of Finnmark, northern Norway, are often high. The small fish are torn off the hook at the vessel side by means of a crucifier or a gaff and returned to the sea. It is generally thought that most of the discarded haddock die. An investigation to quantify this mortality was done in the season for this fishery in 1997. The undersized haddock that were torn off the longline hook were recaptured by gently catching them in a dip net as they reached the sea surface. Survival of haddock torn off by means of crucifier alone was compared to haddock torn of the hook by means of a gaff. The fish were transferred in tanks onboard a vessel to holding pens made of small meshed <b>knotless</b> <b>netting</b> floating at the surface. They were visually monitored for 7 - 11 days. The control group consisted of haddock fished with clean hooks without barbs and gently released by hand. At the end of the observation period the live and dead fish were examined for external damage. The experiment showed a total mortality of 39 % for fish that had been torn off by means of a crucifier, and 53 % mortality of fish released by means of a gaff. The mortality of the control group was 9 %. The injuries of the fish were also analysed...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this PhD project {{was to develop a}} method for {{non-linear}} strength analysis of net structures applied in the aquaculture and fishing industries, e. g. net cages and trawls. The work focused on the aquaculture net cage, which was applied in experiments and analyses, and included research to establish knowledge within material properties and failure modes of traditional netting materials for aquaculture. It was chosen to focus on tensile properties and to study elastic and plastic behaviour, fracture, creep behaviour and cod bite damage. The project consisted of three main activities: tensile testing of netting materials, studies and testing of cod bite damage and resistance, and structural analysis of aquaculture net cages. Net cages are built as a system of ropes and netting. They are designed to transfer and carry all major forces through the ropes. Loads from current, waves, weights and handling induce forces in the net cage, which must be dimensioned to withstand this. Analyzing an aquaculture net cage is both complex and time consuming due to non-linear effects, detailed geometry and dynamic loads. The behaviour of the net cage is dominated by very large deformations and displacements, and materials with non-linear properties. There is a need for verified analysis methods and specific guidance on how to reduce the complexity of a net cage analysis. In order to perform a strength analysis of a net cage, it is crucial to know the material properties of the netting material. Traditionally, the material property of major interest for the aquaculture industry has been the tensile breaking strength of netting (mesh) and ropes, and comparatively little focus has been on their detailed stiffness properties and general behaviour prior to fracture. A new test method was established to determine the uniaxial tensile properties of <b>knotless</b> <b>netting</b> materials. It was applied on a variety of netting materials and stress-strain relations were developed. Data on temporary creep properties, recovery of strain post creep and post creep tensile properties of a selection of Raschel knitted netting materials was presented. Post creep tensile testing showed that the length and force at break were not significantly affected by the creep load history. Cod farmers have reported that cod interact with the cage netting through biting and thereby create wear and tear. The nature of the cod bite attack on traditional, multifilament netting materials was described based on studies of cod interaction with traditional <b>knotless</b> <b>netting</b> and resulting fracture damage on netting fibres. Field experiments were performed, subjecting panels of netting to cod bite in commercial cod cages. In addition, a test method was developed to simulate damage on traditional netting from cod bite, and a prototype bite-jig was designed and assembled. It was concluded that netting materials for cod aquaculture must be resistant to cod bite or be repellent or uninteresting for cod. A method for numerical analysis of net cages in constant uniform current was developed and verified for limited solidity, deformations and current velocities. Various new designs for aquaculture net cages were presented and compared to a traditional net cage with regard to stresses in the netting material and deformation of the net cage.

40|$|Abstract The flow {{characteristics}} through and around a net panel {{have been investigated}} through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and measurements. A finite volume approach was used for solving the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations combined with a k–ε turbulence model for describing the flow. For computational efficiency, the net was modeled as a sheet of porous media rather than {{a large number of}} cylinders connected by knots. The model resistance coefficients needed for the porous media equations were found by optimizing the fit between computed lift and drag forces on the net panel and lift and drag measured in tow tank experiments. Lift and drag acting on a flat panel of <b>knotless</b> nylon <b>net</b> (2. 8 mm twine thickness and 29 mm mesh size) stretched on a frame were measured at different speeds and angles of attack, and fluid velocity was recorded in the region behind the net. The optimization process used to obtain the best fit porous media coefficients was simplified through the use of an analytical model. Final comparisons between CFD predictions and measurements of lift and drag coefficients and velocity reduction behind the net panel were made for two of the speeds and angles of attack. The agreement between measured and modeled data was good with a mean normalized absolute error of 6. 2 %...|$|R
30|$|Fishing {{for live}} medium sized Scombrids was {{performed}} during the Australian summer and autumn months, between December and May, when large schools of pelagic fish migrate through the Sunshine Coast region in QLD, Australia. Rod and line fishing was {{the method of}} choice, using artificial lures (mainly metal slugs, 10 – 20  g), that were cast towards the surface of feeding schools. Medium-light spinning rods and reels were used, spooled with a 20  lb Dacron braid line and a 3  m long 25  lb fluorocarbon leader. The lures varied in size (35 – 60  mm) and in colour (reflecting white/blue/silver), to specifically match the baitfish that the fish were feeding upon. Single barbless hooks and long nosed pliers were used to ensure easy and fast release of the fish into the tubes when caught and to minimise handling and potential injury to the fish. Feeding schools were visualized by presence of tern and seagull flocks that were feeding on bait fish schools. Feeding fish were approached carefully {{in order to avoid}} any disturbance to the fish and the bait; specifically, the boat was positioned upwind a feeding school and then the engine was idled, so that the boat would drift quietly towards the feeding fish. Once in casting range (10 – 20  m), lures were cast towards the fish and quickly retrieved. Hooked fish were brought to the surface as soon as possible, landed using a “fish friendly”, <b>knotless</b> rubber <b>net</b> (Environet, Shimano) or a PVC sling lubricated with water based gel, unhooked while maintaining minimal contact with the skin of the fish and placed head first in the tuna tubes.|$|R
