50|$|Edge {{thinning}} is {{a technique}} used to remove the unwanted spurious points on the edges in an image. This technique is employed after the image has been filtered for noise (using median, Gaussian filter etc.), the <b>edge</b> <b>operator</b> has been applied (like the ones described above) to detect the edges and after the edges have been smoothed using an appropriate threshold value.This removes all the unwanted points and if applied carefully, results in one pixel thick edge elements.|$|E

Contrary to Grimson and Hildreth's results, our results of the Laplacian edge detector on a noisy test checkerboard image are also not as good as the second directional derivative <b>edge</b> <b>operator.</b> We conclude by discussing a number of open issues on <b>edge</b> <b>operator</b> evaluation.

The commonly used edge detection methods are the Roberts <b>edge</b> detection <b>operator,</b> Sobel <b>edge</b> detection <b>operator,</b> Prewitt <b>edge</b> detection <b>operator,</b> Canny <b>edge</b> detection <b>operator,</b> Laplace <b>edge</b> detection <b>operator,</b> and so on. However, the traditional method of edge detection has some drawbacks in time and complexity, so this paper uses CA to detect the image edge.|$|R
30|$|Among other <b>edge</b> <b>operators</b> used we have: the {{morphological}} gradient [34], the high-order and variable-order total variation [35], and the Mumford-Shah Green function [36] and fractal geometry-based methods [37].|$|R
30|$|In this section, some {{existing}} <b>edge</b> <b>operators</b> or detectors are reviewed. Edge detection is {{an important}} field in image processing and an effective edge detector is expected to reduce {{a large amount of}} data, while keeping most of the important features contained in an image. These operators are usually categorized as the gradient-based edge detectors [18 – 20], segmentation-based <b>edge</b> <b>operators</b> [21, 22] and the transform-based <b>edge</b> <b>operators</b> [23, 24]. The first category of edge detectors are mostly based on either first-order gradient operators or second-order operators, sometimes called Laplacians. According to [20], although higher orders are more accurate compared with first-order operators, it is relatively sensitive to noise when extracting relatively more information. For example gradient-based <b>edge</b> detection <b>operators,</b> such as the Roberts, Sobel, and Prewitts, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) and their improvements [25 – 30] uses 2 -D linear filters to process vertical and horizontal edges separately in order to approximate the first-order derivative of pixel values of an image. The work of [19] also presents a classified and comparative study of <b>edge</b> detection <b>operators.</b> In the study, the Canny operator proved to be better than LoG experimentally while LOG was better than Prewitt and Sobel in handling noisy images. A 2 -D gamma distribution in the work of [18] demonstrated the efficiency of their method but, however, suffered from the drawback of big time complexity {{as a result of the}} constructed masks.|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{evaluation}} of edge detectors, based on the average risk of a decision, is discussed. The average risk is a performance measure well-known in Bayesian decision theory. Since edge detection {{can be regarded as}} a compound decision making process, the performance of an edge detector is context dependent. Therefore, the application of average risk to edge detection is non-trivial. The paper describes a method to estimate the probabilities on a number of different types of (context dependent) errors. A weighted sum of these estimated probabilities represents the average risk. The weight coefficients define the cost function. The method is suitable, not only for the comparison of edge operators, but also for the determination of the weaknesses and strengths of a certain <b>edge</b> <b>operator.</b> This is demonstrated with some well-known <b>edge</b> <b>operator...</b>|$|E

The three <b>edge</b> <b>operators</b> compared are Sobel, Canny and the under-publicized phase-based Kovesi-Owens operator. The Kovesi-Owens operator has the distinct advantage that it uses one pre-selected set of parameters and can work across almost any type of scene, where as other operators require parameter tuning. The results from our comparison show that the Kovesi-Owens operator is the most robust of the three, and can get decent results, even under weak illumination and varying gradients in the images...|$|R

40|$|A novel <b>edge</b> <b>operator</b> is {{introduced}} based on steerable asymmetric linear filters consisting of radial wedge segments. An intensity profile {{is computed by}} averaging intensity values along a radial wedge segment as it "sweeps " about a small circular neighborhood. The "steerability " of the filters allows for interpolation of a continuous profile function for n discretely sampled postions of the radial wedge segments.

This paper introduces the basic paradigm of using asymmetric filters for low-level image processing tasks and shows how this approach is utilized to design a novel <b>edge</b> <b>operator</b> (the Radial InTensity Edge, or RITE, operator). Features of the RITE operator include: (1) a mathematically simple algorithm with comparable performance to the well-known gradient-based Deriche operator; (2) better performance at points where several edge...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} fuzzy-based {{approach}} to edge detection in gray-level images. The proposed fuzzy edge detector involves two phases — global contrast intensification and local fuzzy edge detection. In the first phase, a modified Gaussian membership function is chosen to represent each pixel in the fuzzy plane. A global contrast intensification operator, containing three parameters, viz., intensification parameter t, fuzzifier fh and the crossover point xc, {{is used to}} enhance the image. The entropy function is optimized to obtain the parameters fh and xc using the gradient descent function before applying the local <b>edge</b> <b>operator</b> in the second phase. The local <b>edge</b> <b>operator</b> is a generalized Gaussian function containing two exponential parameters, a and fi. These parameters are obtained by the similar entropy optimization method.

30|$|X-ray wood {{nondestructive}} testing {{is an effective}} method for accessing to internal information of wood. Comparing with other conventional wood {{nondestructive testing}}, such as appearance judgment, acoustic emission testing, ultrasonic testing, microwave testing, and stress wave testing, this method can acquire distinct wood internal structure images by an X-ray imaging system. Through the wood images, the positions of wood defects can be easily identified; the scales of the defects can be roughly estimated. Furthermore, we can make use of computer technology to automatically extract wood defects information from the images for automatically identifying defects characteristics such as areas, types, and severity, which can help making the optimal sawing solution. However, extracting accurate defects information depends on the accurate boundary detection. There are many edge detection algorithms. Most previous edge detection algorithms used first-order derivative operators such as the Sobel <b>edge</b> <b>operator</b> [1, 2], the Roberts <b>edge</b> <b>operator,</b> and the Prewitt <b>edge</b> <b>operator</b> [3]. If a pixel point is on the boundary, its neighborhood will be a zone of transition. The Laplacian operator [4] is a second-order derivative operator and is used to detect boundary at locations of the zero crossing. The Canny operator [5, 6], another gradient operator, is used to determine a class of optimal filter for different types of boundaries. All these operators detect boundary points by gray gradient change of the image pixels in the neighborhood; the disadvantage of these methods are sensitive to noise.|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} optimal stack {{filtering}} {{has been used}} in the difference of estimates (DoE) approach to the detection of intensity edges in noisy images. In this paper, the DoE approach is modified by imposing a symmetry condition on the data used to train the two stack filters. Under this condition, the stack filters obtained are duals of each other. Only one filter must therefore be trained; the other is simply its dual. This new technique is called the symmetric difference of estimates (SDoE) approach. The dual stack filters obtained under the SDoE approach are shown to be comparable. This allows the difference of these two filters to be represented by a single equivalent <b>edge</b> <b>operator.</b> This latter result suggests that an <b>edge</b> <b>operator</b> can be found by directly training a (possibly nonpositive) Boolean function to be used on each level of the threshold decomposition architecture.
