5|$|A fairly strong easterly {{wind had}} been blowing for three days; {{on the evening}} of the third day, the mosquitos arrived, flying high, about <b>fifty</b> <b>feet,</b> and looking like a cloud of mist over Carancahua Bay. At the ranch, they set {{everything}} on fire that had blood in it, and all work was suspended by unanimous consent...little or nothing was done for nearly five days; by this time the main body had passed, though plenty remained to make everything uncomfortable for about two weeks. This migration was from east to west and the line was about three miles wide.|$|E

Paul {{played a major role}} in amending Miami's city code to block the construction of buildings within <b>fifty</b> <b>feet</b> of the shore.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the quality}} of his {{maritime}} illustrations, Coggins was invited by publisher Doubleday to provide artwork for a children's book about the U.S. Navy; the author being Fletcher Pratt, the well known military historian. Coggins was invited to participate in Pratt's Naval Game, based on a wargame developed by Fred T. Jane involving dozens of tiny wooden ships, built {{on a scale of one}} inch to <b>fifty</b> <b>feet.</b> These were spread over the floor of Pratt's apartment and their maneuvers were calculated via a complex mathematical formula. The result of Pratt and Coggins's first collaboration, published in 1941, was Fighting Ships of the U.S. Navy, a volume that described in text and illustrated in full color every class of ship in the Navy.|$|E

5|$|Following the crew's post-sleep activities, {{they went}} to work {{performing}} the rendezvous operations that included burning the orbiter's engines to refine the approach to the Hubble telescope. Following some delays due to communications issues, Altman and Johnson ("Ray-J") guided the orbiter within <b>fifty</b> <b>feet</b> of the telescope. McArthur successfully grappled Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope was safely berthed in the payload bay of Atlantis. Later in the day, Grunsfeld and Feustel (Drew), along with Good ("Bueno") and Massimino ("Mass") worked on preparing for the next day's spacewalk, gathering tools and checking out the suits and equipment {{that would be used}} during the EVA.|$|E

25|$|The {{bridge was}} built to guard the East Gate of Khazad-dûm. It {{narrowly}} spanned a deep chasm built under the high arches common in Khazad-dûm. This gave the bridge powerful defensive value, for if an enemy were to breach the East Gate of Khazad-dûm, he {{would be forced to}} cross the span of the Bridge (some <b>fifty</b> <b>feet)</b> in single file line, exposing the crossing enemy to the arrows of the Dwarven defenders.|$|E
25|$|The Leptocleididae {{radiated}} {{during the}} Early Cretaceous. These were rather small forms that, despite their short necks, {{might have been}} more closely related to the Plesiosauridae than to the Pliosauridae. Later in the Early Cretaceous, the Elasmosauridae appeared; these were among the longest plesiosaurs, reaching up to fifteen metres (<b>fifty</b> <b>feet)</b> in length due to very long necks containing as many as 76 vertebrae, more than any other known vertebrate. Pliosauridae were still present as is shown by large predators, such as Kronosaurus.|$|E

There are scenes of non-recognition between the principal characters and a threat of incest; but after all these vicissitudes, father, son and mother are reunited at the end.|$|E
25|$|The Cookstown {{extension}} {{included two}} massive engineering features. One was the eight-span masonry bridge which carried the line <b>fifty</b> <b>feet</b> above the River Main just outside Randalstown and the other, {{a few miles}} further on, was a lattice bridge with a swing section across the River Bann near its outflow from Lough Neagh. Nevertheless, Dargan was {{able to carry out}} the work on the Cookstown extension speedily and the line was deemed to be ready for a Board of Trade inspection on 13 October 1856.|$|E

Petrelis pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge and received three years probation.

25|$|Rip {{currents}} are water {{channels that}} flow {{away from the}} shore. Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current {{appears to be an}} area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or <b>fifty</b> <b>feet.</b> However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.|$|E
25|$|The {{pillars of}} Ashoka are {{a series of}} columns {{dispersed}} throughout the northern Indian subcontinent, and erected by Ashoka during his reign in the 3rd century BCE. Originally, there must have been many pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive. Averaging between forty and <b>fifty</b> <b>feet</b> in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds of miles, to where they were erected. The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient Delhi. The wheel represents the sun time and Buddhist law, while the swastika stands for the cosmic dance around a fixed center and guards against evil.|$|E

25|$|The Indians were poised with cavalry on both flanks, their center {{comprising}} infantry with War Elephants {{which were}} heavily armored and were strapped {{on with a}} castle-like howdah on their back carrying a trio of archers and javelin hurlers towering among or before them in equal intervals of <b>fifty</b> <b>feet</b> to defend the vulnerable flanks. All of the War-Elephants were equipped with fire-hardened leather and quilted armor for protection while their foreheads and trunks bore steel-plates to defend against enemy arrows. The Pauravan Army itself was dressed in flamboyantly hued outfits wearing steel helmets, bright scarves and baldrics wielding axes, lances and maces. King Porus, seated atop the tallest War Elephant selected from his elephant corps, himself was not mounted on Howdah, as he wore a remarkable chain mail armor and hence had no need of the additional protection of a tower.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant to {{orders to}} gather {{information}} before going to Cochinchina, Peacock sails for Manila by way of Long Island and Crokatoa, where hot springs found {{on the eastern side}} of the islands one hundred and <b>fifty</b> <b>feet</b> from the shore boiled furiously up, through many fathoms of water. Peacocks marine chronometers proving useless, she threads the Sunda Strait by dead reckoning. Diarrhea and dysentery were prevalent among the crew from Angier to Manila. After a fortnight there, cholera struck, despite the overall cleanliness of the ship. Peacock lost seven men; many who recovered died of other diseases. No new case of cholera occurred after she got under way 2 November 1833 for Macau. Within two leagues of Lamma Island or Wanshan Archipelago, she takes aboard a maritime pilot after settling on a fee of thirteen dollars and a bottle of rum.|$|E
25|$|State Route 85 roughly {{marks the}} {{northern}} {{boundary of the}} town, although a few pockets of homes to its North are included. Highway 9 (Los Gatos-Saratoga Road) from the coast terminates at Highway 17. Downtown Los Gatos, the area on and around Santa Cruz Avenue and Main Street, {{is located in the}} southwest quadrant of town. A left exit on northbound Highway 17 becomes the south end of South Santa Cruz Avenue, leading into downtown. The area around Los Gatos Boulevard, east of Highway 17, is much more typically suburban than downtown, with medium-sized shopping centers clustered at major intersections of the multilane boulevard. Although the town has generally a quiet setting, its principal noise generators are State Route 17 and Los Gatos Boulevard. Sound levels within one hundred and <b>fifty</b> <b>feet</b> of Los Gatos Boulevard exceed 60 CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level), a generally unacceptable range for residential living.|$|E
