5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the <b>early</b> <b>Church,</b> however. St. Jerome, an <b>early</b> <b>Church</b> writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that the mere fact that St. Jerome responded to the idea {{is a testament to the}} belief's pervasiveness.|$|E
5|$|The Churches of Christ {{generally}} {{combine the}} lack of any historical evidence that the <b>early</b> <b>church</b> used musical instruments in worship and the belief that there is no scriptural support for using instruments in the church's worship service to decide that instruments should not be used today in worship. Churches of Christ have historically practiced a cappella music in worship services.|$|E
5|$|A leading {{historian}} of the <b>early</b> <b>church,</b> Chadwick was appointed Regius Professor at both the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. He was a noted supporter of improved relations with the Roman Catholic Church, and a leading member of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC). An accomplished musician, having studied music to degree level, he took a leading part in the revision and updating of hymnals widely used within Anglicanism, chairing {{the board of the}} publisher, Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd., for twenty years.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower of}} the church was built in 1738, and the rest in 1744, {{incorporating}} fabric from an <b>earlier</b> <b>church</b> on the site. From a 17th-century description, {{it is probable that}} the <b>earlier</b> <b>church</b> was Norman in style.|$|R
50|$|The {{local church}} is {{dedicated}} to Saint Valentine. It was built between 1854 and 1857 {{on the site of}} an <b>earlier</b> <b>church</b> and has a triple nave. The belfry from the <b>earlier</b> <b>church,</b> dating to 1728, is preserved.|$|R
50|$|The oldest part of {{the church}} is the tower, dating from about 1200. The tower {{originally}} belonged to an <b>earlier</b> <b>church</b> building from the 12th century, the nave and choir of which was replaced with the current building circa 1250. The sculptured choir portal originally also belonged to the <b>earlier</b> <b>church.</b>|$|R
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{scientific}} fame, Newton's {{studies of the}} Bible and of the <b>early</b> <b>Church</b> Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{years of}} heavy promotion, the Deseret {{alphabet}} was never widely adopted. This reluctance was {{partly due to}} prohibitive costs; the project had already cost the <b>early</b> <b>church</b> $20,000, with $6,000 going to Pratt as remuneration for his transcription effort {{and most of the}} rest going to cutting metal type featuring the new alphabet and printing costs. In 1859, Parley P. Pratt estimated that the cost of supplying all Utah Territory schoolchildren with suitable textbooks would cost over US$5,000,000.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} <b>early</b> <b>church</b> {{settlement}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was comparatively successful and well-endowed, {{it is unlikely}} that significant building work was done. The clas church would continue to reflect a strong Celtic form for many years. But even though St Augustine, first Archbishop of Canterbury, failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and Dumnonia {{at the beginning of the}} seventh century, the influence of the western church was to begin to be gradually felt. However, even then, the tendency in west Wales was to build larger and larger single cell churches, rather than adopt the newly fashionable basilican design.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{memorials}} within the church, including several retrieved from <b>earlier</b> <b>churches</b> on the site. There {{is also a}} cedar Bishop's throne which could also be from an <b>earlier</b> <b>church.</b> The sanctuary arch is flanked by marble Corinthian columns. A simple marble altar sits within the half domes space of the sanctuary.|$|R

5|$|In 1899, Pope Leo XIII {{declared}} him a Doctor of the Church. He is {{the only}} native of Great Britain to achieve this designation; Anselm of Canterbury, also a Doctor of the Church, was originally from Italy. Bede was moreover a skilled linguist and translator, and his work made the Latin and Greek writings of the <b>early</b> <b>Church</b> Fathers much more accessible to his fellow Anglo-Saxons, which contributed significantly to English Christianity. Bede's monastery had access to an impressive library which included works by Eusebius, Orosius, and many others.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} classify the Gospel of the Hebrews {{as one of}} {{the three}} Jewish–Christian gospels, along with the Gospel of the Nazarenes and the Gospel of the Ebionites. Others suggest that these three titles may have been referring to one and the same book. All are known today only from fragments preserved in quotations by the <b>early</b> <b>Church</b> Fathers. The relationship between the Jewish–Christian gospels and a hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel remains a speculation.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{divide the}} {{ministry}} of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of Satan. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in , his first disciples, who will eventually form {{the core of the}} <b>early</b> <b>Church,</b> encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes the Sermon on the Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses, as well as the calming of the storm, the feeding of the 5,000, walking on water {{and a number of other}} miracles and parables. It ends with the Confession of Peter and the Transfiguration.|$|E

5|$|Symeon often {{taught that}} all {{followers}} of Christ {{could have the}} direct experience of God, or theoria, just as the <b>early</b> <b>church</b> fathers experienced and taught. In that context he frequently described his own experiences of God as divine light. He preached to his monks {{that the way to}} God's grace was through a life of simplicity, asceticism, sanctity, and contemplation, which was also the doctrine of the hermits and monks known as the Desert Fathers. In addition, Symeon placed great emphasis on putting oneself under the complete guidance of a spiritual father.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} {{dedicated}} to Saint Decuman who {{is thought to have}} died here around 706. An <b>early</b> <b>church</b> was built near Daw's Castle and a new church was erected in the 15th century. It has several tombs and monuments to Sir John Wyndham and his family who were the lords of the manor. Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner which was written in the area is commemorated by a statue on the harbourside.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Constantine {{established}} {{a precedent for}} {{the position of the}} emperor as having great influence and ultimate regulatory authority within the religious discussions involving the early Christian councils of that time, e.g., most notably the dispute over Arianism. Constantine himself disliked the risks to societal stability that religious disputes and controversies brought with them, preferring where possible to establish an orthodoxy. His influence over the <b>early</b> <b>Church</b> councils was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity; what proper worship and doctrines and dogma consisted of was for the Church to determine, {{in the hands of the}} participating bishops.|$|E
50|$|The present {{church was}} built in the 13th century and is {{believed}} to have replaced an <b>earlier</b> <b>church</b> within the manor of Landimore.

The font may have been salvaged from the <b>earlier</b> <b>church</b> which was abandoned because of the encroaching sea.|$|R

5|$|Western Christianity, {{particularly}} {{through its}} monasteries, {{was a major}} factor in preserving classical civilisation, with its art (see Illuminated manuscript) and literacy. Through his Rule, Benedict of Nursia (c.480–543), {{one of the founders of}} Western monasticism, exerted an enormous influence on European culture through the appropriation of the monastic spiritual heritage of the <b>early</b> <b>Church</b> and, with the spread of the Benedictine tradition, through the preservation and transmission of ancient culture. During this period, monastic Ireland became a centre of learning and early Irish missionaries such as St Columbanus and St Columba spread Christianity and established monasteries across continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{also found}} time to {{contribute}} to the administration of the wider university, serving on the Hebdomadal Council, as a Delegate of Oxford University Press, as one of the curators of the Bodleian, and as Pro-Vice-Chancellor 1974–5. It was during this period that he began to participate in the discussions of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC); {{he was a member of}} the commission 1969–81 and again 1983–90. his early Evangelical sympathies having been tempered over time, helped by his friendship with Edward Yarnold, Master of Campion Hall. He was a master of the Anglican approach of producing statements capable of a range of interpretations to enable common ground to be reached, this worked well for simpler historical differences, but did not always impress the Roman Catholic members of the commission when it came to questions of ecclesiology and church authority. He was also able to use his historical background to put forward summaries of <b>early</b> <b>church</b> positions on a variety of subjects, and he had a true desire to establish consensus on the basis of the principles revealed by this research. Although his scholarly output suffered from the pressures on his time, he was editor of Oxford Early Christian Texts (from 1970), and was able to work on two major monographs, Priscillian of Avila: the occult and the charismatic in the <b>early</b> <b>Church</b> (published 1976) and Boethius: the consolations of music, logic, theology and philosophy (published 1981). The second of these in particular allowing him to draw on the full range of his interests.|$|E
5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>church</b> {{buildings}} may originally {{have been}} wooden, like that excavated at Whithorn, but of those for which evidence survives from this era are basic masonry-built churches, beginning {{on the west}} coast and islands and spreading south and east. Early chapels tended to have square ended converging walls, similar to Irish chapels of this period. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings.|$|E

5|$|In this respect, Traherne's work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the abounding joy and mysticism found {{in the works of}} William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne's introduction of a child's viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated in the literature of this time. His poems frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the <b>early</b> <b>Church</b> Fathers for his concept of Man and human nature. Little mention is made of sin and suffering in the works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and some critics have seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).|$|E
5|$|Not all of {{the monks}} were {{attracted}} by Symeon's zealous approach. Symeon attempted to reform the Byzantine monasteries, where monks had become subservient to the emperor and had acquired large holdings of property, libraries, and art. His writings and teachings were aimed at returning the monasteries to their traditional role in the <b>early</b> <b>church,</b> urging the monks {{to take up a}} life of simplicity, asceticism, purity of heart, and constant prayer. The strict monastic discipline for which Symeon aimed upset several monks in the monastery. Symeon also took a more emotional approach to worship, suggesting that a monk shouldn't take the sacrament without tears. The introduction of vegetarian meals, along with other unique practices to instill discipline and humility, also caused some displeasure among the monks.|$|E
5|$|Other {{influential}} 2nd century authors include Juvenal and Pliny the Younger, {{the latter}} of whom {{was a friend of}} Tacitus and in 100 delivered his famous Panegyricus Traiani before Trajan and the Roman Senate, exalting the new era of restored freedom while condemning Domitian as a tyrant. Juvenal savagely satirized the Domitianic court in his Satires, depicting the Emperor and his entourage as corrupt, violent and unjust. As a consequence, the anti-Domitianic tradition was already well established {{by the end of the}} 2nd century, and by the 3rd century, even expanded upon by <b>early</b> <b>Church</b> historians, who identified Domitian as an early persecutor of Christians, such as in the Acts of John.|$|E
