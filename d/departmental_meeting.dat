40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to provide for the {{improvement}} of instruction in the secondary schools of Saudi Arabia. To fulfill this goal, the study was designed to accomplish three tasks: 1) describe the nature, scope and effectiveness of the current system of teacher evaluation; 2) determine the attitude of the Saudi educators toward the existing system; 3) develop a new system and propose it for evaluating secondary school teachers in Saudi Arabia. Literature relating to the model of evaluation, criteria used in evaluating teachers, role of personnel involved in teacher evaluation, and processes and instruments used in evaluating teachers was reviewed. Letters to some of the Saudi educational authorities were sent in order to obtain information about the present system of teacher evaluation, and to acquire any studies that have been conducted in the area of teacher evaluation. A questionnaire was sent to Saudi administrators and teachers now studying at American universities. The {{purpose of the}} questionnaire was to obtain information relating to the procedure used in evaluating secondary school teachers in Saudi Arabia, to elicit their judgments of the effectiveness of the present system, and to obtain their recommendations for developing the present system of teacher evaluation. Most of the literature that was received from Saudi Arabia indicated a negative reaction toward the present teacher evaluation system. Also the answers and comments of most of the respondents to the questionnaire statements revealed a general dissatisfaction with the present evaluation system. The proposed design was based upon the review of literature, interviews with American school personnel, suggestions from respondents to the questionnaire, participation in part of the activities of the staff development program at Ball State University, consultation with some experts in the field of teacher evaluation, review of some evaluation instruments used in evaluating teachers at different school systems in Indiana, and the review of most of the material now used for evaluating secondary school teachers in Saudi Arabia. The evaluation model described the expected role of the supervisor, the building principal, the department chairman, the peer teachers, the students, and the teacher being evaluated in teacher evaluation. Also the model defined the criteria which should be used in the teacher evaluation program. The suggested procedure for evaluation was illustrated under the listed activites: 1. An introductory conference. The main purpose of this conference, which is managed by the supervisor, is to explain the general outline and the procedure evaluation process. 2. Departmental meetings. The chairman of the department is in charge of running these meetings. The common technique of conducting a <b>departmental</b> <b>meeting</b> in general and the technique followed at the first <b>departmental</b> <b>meeting</b> in specific are clarified. 3. Field work or the cycle of evaluation. This section is concerned with the procedure to be followed in the teacher evaluation. The procedure of evaluation includes the following activities:a) Setting goals and objectives. The teacher with the help of the department chairman writes the behavioral or instructional objectives of the course in general and of each unit in specific. b) Data collection. The data about the teacher being evaluated is collected from various sources and by different techniques such as classroom observation, teacher self-evaluation and student and peer questionnaires. c) Analysis of data. The department chairman and the teacher analyze the information collected by classroom observation and questionnaires. The purpose of the data analysis was defined. After the data analysis the department chairman writes the evaluation report. The evaluation of the department chairman and the end-of-the year evaluation were included in the model. Recommendations related to the application of the model and to the betterment of the teaching-learning process were formulated. Appendices include material in Arabic. Thesis (D. Ed...|$|E

40|$|Background. This study {{aimed to}} explore how {{critical}} and acceptable practice are defined in anaesthesia and how this influences the discussion and reporting of adverse incidents. Method. We conducted workplace observations of, and interviews with, anaesthetists and anaesthetic staff. Transcripts were analysed qualitatively for recurrent themes and quantitatively for adverse events in anaesthetic process witnessed. We also observed <b>departmental</b> audit <b>meetings</b> and analysed meeting minutes and report forms. Results. The educational value of discussing events was well-recognized; 28 events were discussed at <b>departmental</b> <b>meetings,</b> of which 5 (18 %) were presented as ‘critical incidents’. However, only one incident was reported formally. Our observations of anaesthetic practice revealed 103 minor events {{during the course of}} over 50 anaesthetic procedures, but none were acknowledged as offering the potential to improve safety, although some were direct violations of ‘acceptable’ practice. Formal reporting appears to be constrained by changing boundaries of what might be considered ‘critical’, by concerns of loss of control over formally reported incidents and by the perception that reporting schemes outside anaesthesia have purposes other than education. Conclusions. Despite clear official definitions of criticality in anaesthesia, there is ambiguity in how these are applied in practice. Many educationally useful events fall outside critical incident reporting schemes. Professional expertise in anaesthesia brings its own implicit safety culture but the reluctance to adopt a more explicit ‘systems approach’ to adverse events may impede further gains in patient safety in anaesthesia...|$|R

40|$|The study {{explored}} {{the roles of}} a subject coordinator in improving teachers 2 ̆ 7 classroom practices in a private secondary school in Karachi, Pakistan.

The {{purpose of the study}} was to explore the processes of a subject coordinator, on how she performs her responsibilities and activities. The study was conducted with one subject coordinator, Shakila (pseudonym) and two teachers: Nina (pseudonym) and Saima (pseudonym). The data were gathered through different data collection tools like interviews (unstructured and semi-structured), observations of Shakila 2 ̆ 7 s practices, for example, during her classroom teaching, the planning sessions and <b>departmental</b> <b>meetings</b> Conducted on Fridays, as well as document analysis, where teachers 2 ̆ 7 lesson plans, reflective journals, students 2 ̆ 7 homework note books, school timetable and TORS of the coordinator were analyzed.

The findings of the study revealed that Shakila plays a number of roles aimed at improving teachers 2 ̆ 7 classroom practices. The roles were found to be doing classroom observations, giving constructive feedback, facilitating planning and <b>departmental</b> <b>meetings,</b> monitoring students 2 ̆ 7 and teachers 2 ̆ 7 progress, communicating with teachers, mentoring by helping teachers in the lesson planning, helping teachers to enhance their pedagogical content knowledge and helping them in classroom management.

30|$|This frame also {{emphasizes}} the importance of incentives and support in the process of change. Tenure and promotion are some of the strongest motivators for faculty, so what is valued in those processes will largely drive faculty behavior. It is also possible for departments to provide modest incentives to promote engagement in a change effort: a summer stipend, travel award, or service credit. These incentives do not carry nearly the weight of tenure, but they are still valuable because they signal departmental support of an effort. If a department is unwilling to commit any resources to an effort, it is unclear if any proposed changes will actually be taken up. Incentives and rewards structures can also be implemented in ways that sustain ongoing change processes. For instance, public acknowledgements or rewards for innovative teaching contribute to a culture of continual improvement; stipends for scholarship of teaching and learning can make it worthwhile and normative for instructors to attend closely to issues in their own classroom; and including discussion of teaching in <b>departmental</b> <b>meetings</b> contributes to normalizing conversations about instruction.|$|R
