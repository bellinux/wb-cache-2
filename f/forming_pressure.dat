40|$|The {{formwork}} pressure {{exerted by}} freshly mixed concrete {{is one of}} the most important considerations in ensuring the safety of construction in the field. The formwork pressure also affects the quality of concrete structures, determining the final shape of concrete members. Previous studies on the <b>form</b> <b>pressure</b> mostly investigated the intrinsic material effect.

40|$|International audienceOne {{obstacle}} to {{increased use of}} self-consolidating concrete (SCC) in cast-in-place applications is a fear of high, lateral formwork pressure. The literature has repeatedly shown that pressures far lower than hydrostatic can be obtained, but still a widespread concern of high pressure exists. Several models for predicting the lateral pressure when casting SCC have been developed. A number of experts representing these models gathered in Stockholm, Sweden {{to carry out a}} field evaluation. Eight instrumented wall elements with various geometries were cast with SCC using different mix designs as well as various casting rates. Pressure transducers were used to determine the lateral pressure. All necessary parameters for the respective models were characterized simultaneously by the participants using samples taken from the same batch. Results show a wide range of <b>form</b> <b>pressures,</b> and the evaluation of the ten included models reveals that all of them predict the lateral <b>form</b> <b>pressure</b> satisfactorily...|$|R

50|$|For large parts, {{explosive}} hydroforming {{can generate}} the <b>forming</b> <b>pressure</b> by simply exploding a charge above the part (complete with evacuated mold) which is {{immersed in a}} pool of water. The tooling can be much cheaper than what would be required for any press-type process. The hydroforming-into-a-mold process also works using only a shock wave in air as the pressuring medium. Particularly when the explosives are close to the workpiece, inertia effects make the result more complicated than forming by hydrostatic pressure alone.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a third-order Chapman-Enskog {{analysis}} of the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for multiphase flow is performed for the first time. The leading terms on the interaction force, consisting of an anisotropic and an isotropic term, are successfully identified in the third-order macroscopic equation recovered by the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), and then new mathematical insights into the pseudopotential LB model are provided. For the third-order anisotropic term, numerical tests show that it can cause the stationary droplet to become out-of-round, which suggests the isotropic property of the LBE needs to be seriously considered in the pseudopotential LB model. By adopting the classical equilibrium moment or setting the so-called "magic" parameter to 1 / 12, the anisotropic term can be eliminated, which is found from the present third-order analysis and also validated numerically. As for the third-order isotropic term, when and only when it is considered, accurate continuum <b>form</b> <b>pressure</b> tensor can be definitely obtained, by which the predicted coexistence densities always agree well with the numerical results. Compared with this continuum <b>form</b> <b>pressure</b> tensor, the classical discrete <b>form</b> <b>pressure</b> tensor is accurate only when the isotropic term is a specific one. At last, {{in the framework of}} the present third-order analysis, a consistent scheme for third-order additional term is proposed, which can be used to independently adjust the coexistence densities and surface tension. Numerical tests are subsequently carried out to validate the present scheme. Comment: 27 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Self-compacting {{concrete}} (SCC) offers {{rational and}} fast casting process since it merely {{has to be}} poured, or pumped, into the formwork without any compaction work needed. But this can be {{at the cost of}} high <b>form</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, reported results show that SCC can act thixotropically, i. e., build up a structure at rest, and this can reduce the <b>form</b> <b>pressure</b> considerably. Thus, in order to utilise the favourable possibilities to increase effectiveness without risking form collapses, the need arises for deeper and broader understanding of the mechanisms behind this thixotropic behaviour. Methodologies have been developed for the characterisation and measurement of the structural build-up at rest, both for the fluid (micro mortar) phase and the concrete itself. Hypotheses state that thixotropic mechanisms originate within the colloidal domain and, thus, motivate studies on the fluid phase comprising this domain. The stress-strain methodology is based on the hypothesis stating that the magnitude of the structure is represented by the maximum elastic stress the fresh material can withstand before the structure breaks. An instrumented steel tube is used to simulate various casting heights and rates. Results show that both micro mortar and SCC are thixotropic and this behaviour is influenced by every measure taken influencing the interparticle colloidal forces. The time-dependent structural build-up of SCC is a function of an irreversible structure (slump-loss) and a reversible, thixotropic structure. There is apparently a threshold value of the structural build-up necessary to reach before obtaining any significant <b>form</b> <b>pressure</b> reduction. Housing SCC´s, with W/C = 0. 58, show low degree of structural build-up and pressure decrease while civil engineering SCC´s can show the opposite, but this often at the cost of slump-loss. Recommendations are presented and for the nearest future, suggesting a conservatism regarding design of formwork systems when SCC is used. If the behaviour of a SCC is known it should be used to optimise the formwork. If not, calculating with hydrostatic pressure should be done or the knowledge missing should be gained by using this methodology. A third option is given and this is to monitor the <b>form</b> <b>pressure</b> in real time using sensors. QC 2010081...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—During {{the last}} few years, several sheet {{hydroforming}} processes have been introduced. Despite the advantages of these methods, they have some limitations. Of the processes, the two main ones are the standard hydroforming and hydromechanical deep drawing. A new sheet hydroforming die set was proposed that has the advantages of both processes and eliminates their limitations. In this method, a polyurethane plate {{was used as a}} part of the die-set to control the blank holder force. This paper outlines the Taguchi optimization methodology, which is applied to optimize the effective parameters in forming cylindrical cups by the new die set of sheet hydroforming process. The process parameters evaluated in this research are polyurethane hardness, polyurethane thickness, <b>forming</b> <b>pressure</b> path and polyurethane hole diameter. The design of experiments based upon L 9 orthogonal arrays by Taguchi was used and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to analyze the effect of these parameters on the <b>forming</b> <b>pressure.</b> The analysis of the results showed that the optimal combination for low <b>forming</b> <b>pressure</b> is harder polyurethane, bigger diameter of polyurethane hole and thinner polyurethane. Finally, the confirmation test was derived based on the optimal combination of parameters and it was shown that the Taguchi method is suitable to examine the optimization process...|$|E

This paper discusses the influence of the <b>forming</b> <b>pressure</b> and coupler concentration on the mechanical behavior of glass fiber reinforced polypropylene composite laminates. The Design of Experiments’ (DOE) full factorial approach was adopted for conducting the composite laminate fabrication experiments. The thermoplastic composite laminates were fabricated in a hot compression molding machine, using the film stacking technique. This is an innovative approach to develop thermoplastic composite laminates, using the available low cost raw materials, instead of high end prepreg materials. As per the ASTM standard, the tensile and flexural tests were carried out, in order to evaluate the influence of the parameters on the mechanical behavior of the composite laminates. The Tensile and flexural strengths of the thermoplastic composite laminates were the responses measured to identify the most influencing parameter. The experimental results show that the increase in <b>forming</b> <b>pressure</b> and coupler concentration initially increases both the mechanical properties, and then decreases the properties of the composite laminates. Compared to the coupler concentration, the <b>forming</b> <b>pressure</b> greatly improves both the tensile and flexural properties.
