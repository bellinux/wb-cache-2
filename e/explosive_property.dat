60|$|It may {{be thought}} that this form of {{causation}} requires us to admit {{an exception to the}} doctrine that the conditions of a phenomenon—the antecedents required for calling it into existence—must all be found among the facts immediately, not remotely, preceding its commencement. But what we have arrived at is not a correction, it is only an explanation, of that doctrine. In the enumeration of the conditions required for the occurrence of any phenomenon, it always has to be included that objects must be present, possessed of given properties. It is a condition of the phenomenon explosion that an object should be present, of one or other of certain kinds, which for that reason are called explosive. The presence of one of these objects is a condition immediately precedent to the explosion. The condition which is not immediately precedent is the cause which produced, not the explosion, but the <b>explosive</b> <b>property.</b> The conditions of the explosion itself were all present immediately before it took place, and the general law, therefore, remains intact.|$|E
50|$|Season one {{revolves}} around Noah's adventures in Haven. As he brings {{more and more}} animals from the past to inhabit Haven and continues to jump {{back and forth through}} North Col, Haven, and the past before the Nemesis Comet hit, he attracts attention from the Triumvirate in North Col and the Shadow Master in Haven. This causes a chain of events that reveal the true identity of the Shadow Master (in itself a plot twist), and his goal to acquire enough thunderstone to become immortal. Noah and company devise a plot to destroy the core of the Nemesis Comet which was recently discovered by the Shadow Master, to prevent him from gaining absolute control over Haven. They destroy it using its <b>explosive</b> <b>property</b> by combining it with huge amounts of salt and igniting it. The Shadow Master is killed as he approaches the supply of thunderstone, watching his life's work become terminated. Tao's true nature is also revealed, and his minions flee and become no more.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the typical}} {{problems}} of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the <b>explosive</b> <b>property</b> of the parser and this is aggravated in an Intelligent Language Tutoring System (ILTS) because the grammar is unconstrained and admits even more analyses. NLP applications frequently incorporate techniques for selecting a preferred parse. Computational criteria, however, are insufficient for a pedagogic system because the parse chosen will possibly result in misleading feedback for the learner. Preferably, the analysis emphasizes language teaching pedagogy by selecting the sentence i. nterpretation a student most likely intended. In the system described in this paper, several modules are responsible for selecting the appropriate analysis and these are informed by the Student Model. Aspects in the Student Model play an important pedagogic {{role in determining the}} desired sentence interpretation, handling multiple errors, and deciding on the level of interaction with the student...|$|E

40|$|In the experiment, {{nanoparticles}} of 35 [*]nm Al and 100 [*]nm Al powders, respectively, formed particles {{with average}} sizes of 161 [*]nm and 167 [*]nm in agglomeration. The characteristics of dust cloud explosions {{with the two}} powder sizes, 35 [*]nm and 100 [*]nm, revealed considerable differences, as shown here: (dp/dt) max- 35 [*]nm = 1254 [*]bar/s, (dp/dt) max- 100 [*]nm = 1105 [*]bar/s; Pmax- 35 [*]nm = 7. 5 [*]bar, Pmax- 100 [*]nm = 12. 3 [*]bar, and MEC- 35 [*]nm = 40 [*]g/m 3, MEC- 100 [*]nm = 50 [*]g/m 3. The reason of Pmax- 35 [*]nm value is smaller than Pmax- 100 [*]nm {{may be due to}} agglomeration. From an analysis of the explosive residue, the study found that nanoparticles of 35 [*]nm Al powder became filamentous strands after an explosion, where most of 100 [*]nm Al nanoparticles maintained a spherical structure, This may be because the initial melting temperature of 35 [*]nm Al is 435. 71 °C, while that for 100 [*]nm Al is 523. 58 °C, higher by 87. 87 °C. This study discovered that <b>explosive</b> <b>property</b> between the 35 [*]nm Al and 100 [*]nm Al powders after agglomeration were different...|$|E

However, it is known from work more recent than the above-mentioned 1919 tests that the [...] "less than 60% nitrate = safe" [...] criterion is inaccurate; in mixtures containing 50% nitrate, any explosion of the mixture is confined to a small volume around the initiating charge, but increasing the proportion of nitrate to 55-60% significantly enhances the <b>explosive</b> <b>properties</b> and creates a mixture whose detonation is sufficiently powerful to initiate detonation in a surrounding mixture of a lower nitrate concentration which would normally be considered minimally explosive. Changes in humidity and density also significantly affect the <b>explosive</b> <b>properties.</b>|$|R
