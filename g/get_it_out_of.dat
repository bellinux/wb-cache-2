If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
25|$|When {{a player}} makes a move {{such that the}} opponent's only {{remaining}} royal (king or prince) could be captured on the following move, the move is said to give check; the king or prince {{is said to be}} in check. If a player's king or prince is in check and no legal move by that player will <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> check, the checking move is also mate, and effectively wins the game.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{the most}} {{extensive}} restoration took place to the dome during {{the era of the}} Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1915 (1333/1334AH). To facilitate crowd control, the building housing the Zamzam was moved away from its original location, to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way of the Tawaf, when millions of pilgrims would circumambulate the Kaaba. The water of the well is now pumped to {{the eastern part of the}} mosque, where it was made available in separate locations for men and women.|$|E

500|$|Vašek expresses his confusions in a short, sad song ("I can't <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my head"), but is {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} a travelling circus. The Ringmaster introduces the star attractions: Esmeralda, the Spanish dancer, a [...] "real Indian" [...] sword swallower, and a dancing bear. A rapid folk-dance, the skočná, follows. Vašek is entranced by Esmeralda, but his timid advances are interrupted when the [...] "Indian" [...] rushes in, announcing that the [...] "bear" [...] has collapsed in a drunken stupor. A replacement is required. Vašek is soon persuaded to take the job, egged on by Esmeralda's flattering words ("We'll make a pretty thing out of you").|$|E
500|$|Edward Foss {{described}} him as [...] "one {{of the most successful}} advocates of his day", something linked more to his [...] "extraordinary talent" [...] at cross-examination than his knowledge of the law; Garrow once told a witness before a case that [...] "you know a particular fact and wish to conceal it – I'll <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you!" [...] Lord Brougham, who regularly opposed him in court, wrote that [...] "no description can give the reader an adequate idea of this eminent practitioner's powers in thus dealing with a witness". Lemmings notes Garrow as not only a formidable advocate but also the [...] "first lawyer to establish a reputation as a defence barrister".|$|E
500|$|With Annie, it is different. The two of {{them have}} fun making a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. He met her playing tennis doubles with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk led her to offer him first a ride up town and then {{a glass of wine}} on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild {{exchange}} of trivial personal data is revealed in [...] "mental subtitles" [...] as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annie's singing audition for a night club ("It Had to be You"). He suggests they kiss first to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way. After their lovemaking that night, Alvy is [...] "a wreck", while she relaxes with a joint.|$|E

500|$|The {{composition}} and {{setting of the}} scene where Smithers and Dr. Hibbert discuss Mr. Burns' health is partially inspired by a scene from Citizen Kane where Kane talks to his wife Susan Alexander after she attempts suicide. Otto is heard humming [...] "Iron Man" [...] by Black Sabbath. The ghostwriter Mr. Burns hires mentions that he wrote [...] "Like Hell I Can't". The title is a play on Sammy Davis, Jr.'s autobiography Yes, I Can. Homer mistells the story of [...] "Androcles and the Lion", instead referring to it as [...] "Hercules and the Lion". A mural in the post office resembles Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. Burns's line about getting [...] "A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present" [...] is similar to lines used in Dr. Seuss books. The scene where Homer dictates the angry letter to Mr. Burns, and the scene where he and Bart attempt to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the mailbox, are inspired by the Honeymooners episode [...] "Letter to the Boss".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} Black Eye deal with sexual and abuse topics: [...] "Nothing you will likely {{hear on the}} radio", Rootes explained. The song [...] "Hypersonic", named after the best-selling {{vibrator}} in England, celebrates the joys of vibrator use. The title track, [...] "Black Eye", is about domestic violence. Rootes remarked: [...] "When I was frowing up, my dad was really violent. I knew it was something I had to write a song about – to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my system." [...] The song inspired the album cover, which depicts a cat holding a mouse in its jaw. Rootes explained that the mouse's black eye represents a moment of serenity before it dies. Similarly, the song [...] "Scream" [...] deals with rape issues, while [...] "Dirty Old Bird" [...] is about spousal abuse. The track [...] "Technicolour Yawn" [...] is about the unpleasant effect of a hangover, [...] "Psychofudge" [...] is about drug usage, and [...] "Cheap" [...] deals with one's loss of virginity and the subsequent feel of becoming [...] "sort of cheap and common." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-1984, Madonna met {{producer}} Nile Rodgers at the Power Station studios (now Avatar Studios) in New York. Rodgers initially did {{not want}} Madonna to record [...] "Like a Virgin", as {{he felt that the}} lyric 'like a virgin' was not a terrific hook; according to him it was not an all-time catch phrase. Rogers dismissed the song after hearing the demo, which he thought sounded [...] "really stupid and retarded". Later, Rodgers had second thoughts: [...] "It's weird because I couldn't <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my head after I played it, even though I didn't really like it. It sounded really bubble-gummy to me, but it grew on me. I really started to like it. [...] But, my first reaction to it was, 'This is really queer.'" [...] Rodgers credits Madonna with recognizing the song's potential. He later said: [...] "I handed my apology to Madonna and said, 'you know... if it's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days, it must be something. So let's do it.'" [...] Hence the song was finally recorded. Steinberg reflected on the recording process and commented that: ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Segall, the track, [...] "She Dont Care", [...] "is one of {{the more}} intense songs. Its about someone, but its more about being brutal.

"Somebody threw {{a handful}} o' flour in poor Cooper's face {{a couple of}} hours ago," [...] said Mr. Jenkins, {{watching}} him closely, [...] "and while he was <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his eyes they upset him and made off with his helmet and truncheon. I just met Brown and he says Cooper's been going on like a madman." ...|$|R
500|$|Kitty Empire of The Observer {{also thought}} that it shares {{similarities}} with [...] "Fighter". She cited the Björk song {{of the same name}} as another influence, due to its [...] "emotional territory" [...] Robert Copsey for Digital Spy described the song as [...] "nothing we haven't heard from her before, but there's an urgency to it that suggests Christina needed to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her system", while Matthew Horton of Virgin Media wrote that Aguilera sounds as though she is declaring war. Michael Gallucci for PopCrush was critical of the song, writing that it sounds like a Cher disco song which features Aguilera [...] "overworking" [...] her vocal cords. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly found the song's message to be confusing and did not understand who exactly Aguilera is supposed to be rising up against on the song, writing [...] "She hollers 'And we're gonna rise up.../ For every time you wronged me/ Well, you're gonna face an army, army of me.' Which begs the question: Rise up against whom? Is the whole world really out to get her, or is this just an excuse to wear camouflage hot pants?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Invading My Mind" [...] {{received}} generally positive acclaim {{from music}} critics. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly awarded the song a B+ rating, stating that: [...] "Remember when {{the thought of}} Jennifer Lopez releasing good music was as likely as a sequel to Angel Eyes? Well, our bad. The American Idol judge shot up the charts with the cheesetastic Ibiza chant On the Floor. Now she unites with Gaga pal RedOne for this appropriately named piece of pop pleasure: Once the club banger hits your ears, good or bad, you won't be able to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your head." [...] Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, gave a positive review of the song, stating that between [...] "On the Floor" [...] and [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] Lopez is [...] "really made a glittery return to her extreme club/"Waiting for Tonight" [...] roots". She continued by stating: [...] "Sure, ' Mind' may be shallower than the kiddie pool, {{but this one is}} up from the first second... and never goes down". Monica Herrera from Billboard stated that on [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] RedOne and Lady Gaga bring the [...] "hit potential", while Lopez [...] "brings the heat". She continued by stating that the song is an [...] "irresistible '80s euphoria and release".|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{chose the}} most {{complicated}} scene, with the most dancers and choreography in the classic style of musical theater, to accompany an 18-second song ("The Mustard") [...] "to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way" [...] for more personal numbers later in the episode. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com considers this [...] "brilliant because it frees even people who hate musicals to settle into the story without getting hung up on the genre's conventions". The musical styles span from a jaunty 1950s sitcom arrangement of the Buffy theme in the opening credits—the only episode in the series to begin without the normal version of the theme song and full cast roll, signifying a genre shift—to Anya's hard-rock version of [...] "Bunnies". Whedon assigned Emma Caulfield the rock-opera format because Caulfield often sang {{in such a way}} to him on the set. Spike's [...] "Rest in Peace" [...] is also a rock song, which Whedon wrote after completing the episode's first song, Tara's [...] "Under Your Spell", a contemporary pop song with radio-play potential. Xander and Anya's duet—the most fun to shoot but difficult to write, according to Whedon—is inspired by Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers comedies as evidenced by the silken pajama costumes and art deco apartment setting. Musically, the song uses influences from Ira Gershwin, a Charleston rhythm, and jazz-like chord slides. Giles' [...] "Standing" [...] is a ballad to Buffy that she does not hear, unlike the songs revealing truths elsewhere in the episode. Whedon shot the scene so that Giles moves in real time while Buffy works out in slow motion, to accentuate Giles' distance from her. Buffy's not hearing his song was intentional; Whedon explained, [...] "You can sing to someone in musicals and they can never know how you feel or how much you love them, even if they're standing right in front of you".|$|E

50|$|Originally, {{typewriters}} {{were very}} costly machines which one {{tried to protect}} from dust or accidents. They were also very ungainly or even ugly to those unfamiliar with them, and getting them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight was useful for aesthetic reasons.

Once they had realized their music changed {{and wanted to be}} taken more seriously, [...] "Rainbow Butt Monkeys" [...] became [...] "Finger Eleven". The name Finger Eleven comes from an earlier version of the song [...] "Thin Spirits" [...] from the album Tip.

60|$|Well, {{the first}} great English game is this playing at counters. It differs from the rest in that it appears always to be {{producing}} money, while every other game is expensive. But it does not always produce money. There's a great difference between 'winning' money and 'making' it; a great difference between <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> another man's pocket into ours, or filling both. Collecting money {{is by no means}} the same thing as making it; the tax-gatherer's house is not the Mint; and much of the apparent gain (so called), in commerce, is only a form of taxation on carriage or exchange.|$|R
