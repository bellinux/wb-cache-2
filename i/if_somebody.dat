On many occasions, the result would show that the person had carried out logging or washing of dirty things in the forest, and the family or person concerned would have to ask the Dongba priest to hold the ritual near where the activity had taken place, and apologise to the nature god Shu.|$|E

However, the Flutter experiences some engine problems and crash lands on Kattelox Island. From there, the Casketts {{try to find a way}} to repair their ship. However, when the pirates the Bonnes attack Kattelox's city with giant mechanical weapons, Mega Man decides to stop them. Once Mega Man is able to defeat each member individually, Kattelox's mayor, Amelia, tells Mega Man the Bonnes are searching for the island's secret treasure and that it is said <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> obtains it, a great disaster will befall the island. Amelia asks Mega Man to explore the island's ruins in order to investigate it. With a refractor found in a ruin, Roll and Mega Man are able to repair the Flutter, allowing them to find a cave to continue exploring the island. While exploring the cave, Mega Man activates the Main Gate, a dungeon where he should be able to find the reason why Reaverbots from the island are being activated. Before being able to enter into the Main Gate, Mega Man once again confronts the Bonnes who, after being defeated once again, decide to let Mega Man enter the Main Gate, hoping he will bear the brunt of the work then planning to steal the treasure from him afterward.|$|E

500|$|Susan Hill herself did {{not like}} some of the changes that Kneale had made to The Woman in Black. It has been {{observed}} that Kneale on some occasions operated a double-standard with adaptations; being unhappy when others made changes to his stories, but willing to make changes to stories he was adapting into script form. Referring to The Woman in Black adaptation, the writer and critic Kim Newman noted that: [...] "He was very offended at the notion of Susan Hill using the name of Kipps from HG Wells as the hero of The Woman in Black, and so he decided not to use it and to change the hero's name to Kidd. I'm sure <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> thought that Quatermass was a silly name and changed it, he'd be furious!" [...] However, Kneale's adaptations were by no means always unpopular with the original author. In 1991, a four-part version he wrote of Kingsley Amis's novel Stanley and the Women, met with approval from the original author, with Amis regarding it as the most successful adaptation of any of his work.|$|E

500|$|Diane Keaton {{has stated}} that Annie Hall was her {{favorite}} role and that the film meant everything to her. When asked if being most associated with the role concerned her as an actress, she replied, [...] "I'm not haunted by Annie Hall. I'm happy to be Annie Hall. <b>If</b> <b>somebody</b> wants to see me that way, it's fine by me". Costume designer Ruth Morley, working with Keaton, created a look which had an influence on the fashion world during the late-70s, with women adopting the style: layering oversized, mannish blazers over vests, billowy trousers or long skirts, a man's tie, and boots. The look was {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Annie Hall look". Some sources suggest that Keaton herself was mainly responsible for the look, and Ralph Lauren has often claimed credit, but only one jacket and one tie were purchased from Ralph Lauren for use in the film. Allen recalled that Lauren and Keaton's dress style almost did not end up in the film. [...] "She came in," [...] he recalled in 1992, [...] "and the costume lady on Annie Hall said, 'Tell her not to wear that. She can't wear that. [...] It's so crazy.' And I said, 'Leave her. She's a genius. Let's just leave her alone, let her wear what she wants.'" ...|$|E
500|$|A special {{interview}} with Ohkawa and Kiichiro Sugawara, Clamp's editor from the Weekly Shōnen Magazines Editorial Department, took {{place after the}} story of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle had progressed past the arc from Ōto Country. Ohkawa has stated that the group is very conscious {{of the fact that}} Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle is the title in Shōnen Magazine with the youngest readership and that it is their very first foray into the shōnen demographic. Thus, the members of Clamp ensure that they employ a drawing style and dialogue appropriate for young male audiences; the manga incorporates furigana that makes reading Japanese easier. To aid in this effort, the group holds conferences with Sugawara where they discuss the plot. Ohkawa stated during the interview that the only time the story significantly changed was during Country of Jade arc; It went from a [...] "horror story with vampires" [...] to a [...] "detective mystery". Following the story in the Piffle Country, Clamp aimed to make the series darker and more complex, resulting in it receiving elements previously seen in other of their series. The Shura Country's story was written to introduce the idea that a dead person cannot be revived even <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> travels back to the past and changes history. This theme would be further explored later in the story.|$|E
500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website stated that Eve was the [...] "beautiful and compassionate town doctor" [...] who was enjoying a successful career; [...] she {{was described as}} an altruist by John Berlau of The Atlas Society. Ross initially saw the character as easy to play, calling her [...] "everyone's best friend, and the town doctor, and a great mother". The actress had a more difficult time when Eve began behaving in morally questionable ways to protect secrets about her past. She felt that the change in Eve's character made the role challenging on an emotional level, comparing the experience to [...] "getting a jail sentence and you're expected {{to go along with}} it without any explanation" [...] or [...] "the gods messing with somebody with no reason but to mess with them". When asked to describe Eve in three words, Ross responded that she was a [...] "contradiction inside an enigma". Playing Eve, she said, was [...] "as <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> came and told you that your closest friend is doing abominable things". Ross appreciated Eve's characterization as a human being who was not portrayed as completely good or bad and had admirable qualities as well as faults. She later connected Eve's shame of her past life with Julian and inability to tell her family to Lavinia Kingsley's regrets about her youth in the 2002 comedy film The Banger Sisters.|$|E

2500|$|McCartney was {{the first}} to agree with Epstein's ideas, believing it was due to Epstein's RADA training.

According to McCartney, [...] "The gigs went up in stature and though the pay went up only a little bit, it did go up", and that the group was [...] "now playing better places".

Another improvement was that the group was now far more organised; having a single concert diary in which to record bookings, rather than using whoever's diary was to hand.|$|R
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> showed up at your door and said, [...] "Hey, we want to give you this weapon you used to murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the truth}} of the {{accounts}} has been disputed by some historians; in 1984, Malcolm Brown and Shirley Seaton concluded that there were probably attempts to play organised matches which failed due to the state of the ground, but that the contemporary reports were either hearsay or refer to [...] "kick-about" [...] matches with [...] "made-up footballs" [...] such as a bully-beef tin. Chris Baker, former chairman of The Western Front Association and author of The Truce: The Day the War Stopped is also sceptical, but says that although there is little hard evidence, the most likely place that an organised match could have taken place was near the village of Messines: [...] "There are two references to a game being played on the British side, but nothing from the Germans. <b>If</b> <b>somebody</b> one day found a letter from a German soldier who was in that area, then we would have something credible." [...] In fact, there is a German reference. Leutnant Kurt Zehmisch of Germany's 134th Saxons Infantry Regiment said that the English [...] "brought a soccer ball from their trenches, and pretty soon a lively game ensued. How marvelously wonderful, yet how strange it was". In 2011, Mike Dash concluded that [...] "there is plenty of evidence that football was played that Christmas Day—mostly by men of the same nationality, but in at least three or four places between troops from the opposing armies".|$|E
500|$|Bostic's {{physical}} {{style of play}} was respected by his peers: Lester Hayes said Raider tight end Todd Christensen is the best receiving tight end and that [...] "The only guy I've ever seen cover Todd is my son, Keith Bostic...Bostic's the only guy I've ever seen pulverize him. I mean he really pulverized him. I call Bostic and Frank Minnifield (Cleveland cornerback) my sons, my sons of dirt." [...] Hayes meant that Bostic and Minnifield played a {{physical style}}, just like Hayes. [...] Bostic {{is known as a}} big hitter blessed with athletic ability. [...] He combined strength and speed to play his physical style according to Ozzie Newsome: [...] "He's as strong as any linebacker and can run like any of the guys on the corner." [...] Bostic earned the nickname [...] "Batman" [...] for his style of play. [...] Instead of instructing his team to elect captains, Glanville instructed his team to [...] "...pick the three toughest guys. <b>If</b> <b>somebody</b> throws a grenade into a room, they're the ones who'll jump on it." [...] Bostic was the player chosen from the Oilers' defense. [...] Although much is made of his strength and toughness, it should also be mentioned that he once collared Tony Dorsett from behind in a footrace. [...] At one point in Bostic's career, while Glanville was still defensive coordinator, the Oilers considered moving him to cornerback because of his speed.|$|E
