5|$|On 15 December 1961, {{an empty}} {{coaching}} stock train {{was in a}} rear-end collision with a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> at Conington, Huntingdonshire. Locomotive No. 60078 Night Hawk was hauling a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> that ran into the wreckage. A third <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> then ran into the wreckage.|$|E
5|$|In January 1885, a London and North Western Railway express {{passenger}} train {{collided with a}} <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> near Stoke-on-Trent. One person was killed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1946, {{locomotive}} No. 502 was hauling a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> that overran signals and was derailed by trap points at Wallers Ash, Hampshire.|$|E
50|$|<b>Freight</b> <b>trains</b> are {{operated}} between Tosu and Nabeshima. High-speed <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> {{make three}} round trips {{a day from}} Tosu Freight Terminal to Nabeshima. The electric locomotive used is the Class ED76. <b>Freight</b> <b>trains</b> only arrive and depart from Nabeshima station.|$|R
50|$|<b>Freight</b> <b>trains</b> {{pass through}} Manchester city centre, {{unusual for a}} city centre rail network. Two <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> per hour pass through Manchester to Trafford Park and no {{alternative}} route exists. <b>Freight</b> <b>trains</b> using passenger routes through Manchester was raised in Parliament in 2002.|$|R
25|$|However, {{these plans}} have been {{complicated}} by the desire of Network Rail to reopen the South Staffordshire Line {{for the use of}} <b>freight</b> <b>trains,</b> which last used the route in 1993. Various proposals have been put forward as to how trams and <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> could coexist on the same corridor, early proposals involved trams and <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> using different tracks. But since 2008 Centro has favoured the use of tram-trains, which can share the tracks with <b>freight</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 14 December 1880, a {{passenger}} train overran signals {{and ran into}} the rear of a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> south of Preston. Four people were slightly injured.|$|E
5|$|On 16 January 1920, a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> {{collided}} with a light engine near Preston due to errors by {{the driver of the}} light engine and a signalman.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April 1870, an {{excursion}} train {{collided with}} a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> due to a pointsman's error. There were no injuries.|$|E
40|$|We analyse {{maintenance}} cost data for Swedish railway infrastructure {{in relation to}} traffic volumes and network characteristics, and separate the cost impact from passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>trains.</b> Lines with mixed passenger and freight traffic, and dedicated freight lines are analysed separately using both log-linear and Box-Cox regression models. We find that for mixed lines, the Box-Cox specification is preferred, while a log-linear model is chosen {{in the case of}} dedicated freight lines. The cost elasticity with respect to output is found to be higher for passenger <b>trains</b> than for <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> in the case of mixed lines. The cost elasticity for <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> on dedicated lines is higher than for <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> on mixed lines. From a marginal cost pricing perspective, <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> on mixed lines are currently over-charged, while passenger trains on mixed lines and <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> on dedicated lines are under-charged...|$|R
40|$|Many {{lines in}} Sweden have mixed traffic, with both {{passenger}} and <b>freight</b> <b>trains.</b> In contrast to passenger <b>trains,</b> <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> can deviate significantly from their timetable. This study evaluates {{the effect of}} modelling <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> running ahead as well as behind schedule. In previous Swedish studies <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> have been modelled as being on time or delayed. RailSys is used to simulate {{a section of the}} Southern Main Line and a fictive double-track line. Simulation results are compared to data from real train operation. Results show that <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> can be modelled in a more realistic way. This can improve simulation analysis of freight operations. TSC import 2156 2013 - 01 - 15.

50|$|While European <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> are {{normally}} one-man operated, the larger North American <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> are almost exclusively manned by an engineer {{as well as}} a conductor.|$|R
5|$|On 23 November 1871, a {{passenger}} train and a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> collided at Water Lane Junction. One person {{was killed and}} fifteen people were injured, twelve seriously.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1895, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train {{collided with a}} <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> due to {{the driver of the}} freight misreading signals.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November 1873, a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> {{ran away}} and {{collided}} with some wagons {{that were being}} shunted and was derailed.|$|E
50|$|Local <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> {{also served}} the Barras goods yard and through <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> from the {{northeast}} via Stainmore and Tebay to Barrow-in-Furness also passed through the station.|$|R
50|$|Most British <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> are One Man or Driver Only Operated, certain <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> do have Guards {{on board}} for {{operational}} or safety reasons (such as DRS Nuclear Trains).|$|R
50|$|After {{the closing}} of the gap to the former West Germany after reunification, between 1991 and 1994 the line saw altered traffic flows and the last spike in freight traffic. Up to eight heavy <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> ran daily on the north-south link. Since then <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> run only when required, for example, <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> to {{transport}} timber between Erfurt and Grimmenthal.|$|R
5|$|On 8 November 1866 a {{light engine}} {{collided}} with a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> near Preston. Both trains were derailed.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1945, {{locomotive}} No. 6231 Duchess of Atholl was hauling {{an express}} passenger train which overran signals and {{collided with a}} <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> that was being shunted at , Dumfriesshire. Two {{people were killed and}} three were injured.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 1858, a {{passenger}} train and a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> {{were in a}} head-on collision near Preston due to the passenger train passing a signal at danger. Two passengers were injured.|$|E
50|$|In the {{timetable}} of 1979/80, 300 passenger, 250 <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> and 100 other trains operated through Würzburg station on weekdays. About 60 passenger and 50 <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> were shunted at the station.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, the Munich-Rosenheim {{line was}} used by up to 150 <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> on weekdays. Approximately 50 of these <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> run {{on the line from}} Munich to Salzburg and {{continue}} towards Turkey, Greece, Ljubljana and Trieste. But the line from Munich to Kufstein is served by about 100 <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> daily. These trains run mostly from Munich East marshalling yard to Verona (Brenner traffic) and are operated by TX Logistik.|$|R
50|$|The depot is {{the oldest}} train station on the west coast. The track {{in front of the}} depot is the former Southern Pacific, {{currently}} Union Pacific, Coast Line, and also UP's Newhall Yard, where <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> are made up and change crews. Both passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> pass the depot. They include Caltrain, the Altamont Commuter Express, the Amtrak Capitol Corridor, the Amtrak Coast Starlight, and various UP <b>freight</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
5|$|A public {{unveiling}} {{took place}} at Union Station in Chicago on October 11, 1979, followed by a short trip over the Burlington Northern Railroad to Lisle. The following day, the Shawnee had the dubious distinction of the first Superliner accident, a minor collision with an Illinois Central Gulf Railroad <b>freight</b> <b>train.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Simpsons win {{a trip to}} Delaware, Homer {{refuses to}} pay a $5 airport tax for his flight. After Homer violates the Anti-Fist Shaking Law, the family jumps onto a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> where they meet a singing hobo who tells them three stories.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Leif Hoste, Peter Van Petegem and Vladimir Gusev were disqualified for riding {{through a}} closed train {{crossing}} 10km before the finish and {{just ahead of}} an approaching <b>freight</b> <b>train.</b> Fabian Cancellara won and Tom Boonen and Alessandro Ballan were given the remaining places on the podium.|$|E
30|$|The {{addition}} of the <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> to the system has been done so without interfering with the passenger system. The passenger trains therefore control where <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> {{can be added to}} the system during the day.|$|R
5000|$|Of 23 <b>freight</b> <b>trains,</b> {{which were}} marshalled {{in the early}} 1930s on weekdays at the Bavarian station, and 25 <b>freight</b> <b>trains,</b> which were disbanded there, the {{following}} operations among others ran over the Engelsdorf-Tabakmühle junction section: ...|$|R
50|$|On some {{lines in}} {{southern}} England, speed limits for passenger trains {{are higher than}} for <b>freight</b> <b>trains,</b> because the electric multiple units (EMUs) on those lines are capable of slowing down {{much more quickly than}} <b>freight</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
5|$|In February 2000, {{a tree in}} the Adventureland section {{fell onto}} the DRR's Holiday Red <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> while it was in motion, {{damaging}} the awnings and their supports on the gondolas as well as knocking off the cupola {{on top of the}} caboose before the train came to a stop. No injuries occurred {{as a result of this}} accident.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945, {{with the}} Soviet army approaching, the Germans decide to flee, taking 60,000 inmates on a death march to {{concentration}} camps in Germany. Eliezer {{and his father}} are marched to Gleiwitz {{to be put on}} a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> to Buchenwald, a camp near Weimar, 350 miles (563km) from Auschwitz.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February 1949, a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> became divided at , London. The rear portion {{was able}} to run back and cross from the down slow line to the down fast line due to a signalman's error. Locomotive No. 60107 Royal Lancer was hauling a parcels {{passenger}} train that collided with the wagons.|$|E

5000|$|In 1871 {{a pair of}} <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> ran on the Kaiserslautern - Münster route. In addition, {{there was}} a [...] "supplemental” pair of <b>freight</b> <b>trains,</b> which served only the larger {{stations}} between Kaiserslautern and Münster such as Winnweiler. The stop at Winnweiler station always took more than ten minutes. Towards {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century, <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> on the Kaiserslautern - Bingerbrück and Kaiserslautern - Bad Münster routes served the station.|$|R
50|$|Often the Ae 4/8 worked <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> to Zürich and Winterthur. During {{its last}} years of service the {{locomotive}} was used for Basel - Zürich - Winterthur services, and then commuter trains around Olten and <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> around Solothurn.|$|R
