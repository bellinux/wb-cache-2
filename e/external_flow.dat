50|$|<b>External</b> <b>flows</b> {{during the}} period being {{analyzed}} complicate the performance calculation. If <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> are not taken into account, the performance measurement is distorted: a flow into the portfolio would cause this method to overstate the true performance, while flows out of the portfolio would cause it to understate the true performance.|$|R
5000|$|Other methods {{exist to}} {{compensate}} for <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> when calculating investment returns. Such methods are known as [...] "money-weighted" [...] or [...] "dollar-weighted" [...] methods. The time-weighted return {{is higher than the}} result of other methods of calculating the investment return when <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> are badly timed - refer to Example 4 above.|$|R
50|$|The only {{sensible}} {{answer to}} the example above is that the holding period return is unambiguously 1 percent. This means the start date should be adjusted to {{the date of the}} initial <b>external</b> <b>flow.</b> Likewise, if the portfolio is empty {{at the end of the}} period, the end date should be adjusted to the final <b>external</b> <b>flow.</b> The end value is effectively the final <b>external</b> <b>flow,</b> not zero.|$|E
50|$|Suppose {{that the}} {{portfolio}} is valued immediately after each <b>external</b> <b>flow.</b> The {{value of the}} portfolio {{at the end of}} each sub-period is adjusted for the <b>external</b> <b>flow</b> which takes place immediately before. External flows into the portfolio are considered positive and flows out of the portfolio are negative.|$|E

50|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the problem of}} <b>external</b> <b>flows,</b> consider the following example.|$|R
50|$|Note {{also that}} the simple Dietz method is a special case of the Modified Dietz method, in which <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> are assumed to occur at the {{midpoint}} of the period, or equivalently, spread evenly throughout the period, whereas no such assumption is made when using the Modified Dietz method, and the timing of any <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> is taken into account.|$|R

50|$|The time-weighted method {{differs from}} other methods of calculating {{investment}} return {{only in the}} particular way it compensates for <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> - see below.|$|R
50|$|The time-weighted {{return is}} a measure of the {{historical}} performance of an investment portfolio which compensates for <b>external</b> <b>flows.</b> <b>External</b> <b>flows</b> are net movements of value which result from transfers of cash, securities or other instruments, into or out of the portfolio, with no simultaneous equal and opposite movement of value in the opposite direction, as in the case of a purchase or sale, and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio, such as interest, coupons or dividends.|$|R
50|$|Internal and <b>external</b> <b>flow</b> {{can also}} {{classify}} convection. Internal flow {{occurs when a}} fluid is enclosed by a solid boundary such when flowing through a pipe. An <b>external</b> <b>flow</b> occurs when a fluid extends indefinitely without encountering a solid surface. Both {{of these types of}} convection, either natural or forced, can be internal or external because they are independent of each other. The bulk temperature, or the average fluid temperature, is a convenient reference point for evaluating properties related to convective heat transfer, particularly in applications related to flow in pipes and ducts.|$|E
5000|$|To {{compensate}} for an <b>external</b> <b>flow</b> [...] into the portfolio {{just before the}} valuation [...] {{at the end of}} the period, adjust the portfolio's final value [...] by subtracting [...] The return is: ...|$|E
50|$|To measure returns net of fees, {{allow the}} value of the {{portfolio}} to be reduced by the amount of the fees. To calculate returns gross of fees, compensate for them by treating them as an <b>external</b> <b>flow,</b> and exclude accrued fees from valuations.|$|E
50|$|The {{modified}} Dietz {{method is}} a measure of the ex post (i.e. historical) performance of an investment portfolio in the presence of <b>external</b> <b>flows.</b> (<b>External</b> <b>flows</b> are movements of value such as transfers of cash, securities or other instruments in or out of the portfolio, with no equal simultaneous movement of value in the opposite direction, and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio, such as interest, coupons or dividends.) To calculate the modified Dietz return, divide the gain or loss in value, net of <b>external</b> <b>flows,</b> by the average capital over the period of measurement. The result of the calculation is expressed as a percentage return over the holding period. The average capital weights individual cash flows by the amount of time from when those cash flows occur until the end of the period.|$|R
5000|$|A {{refinement}} {{of the simple}} Dietz method is the modified Dietz method, which takes available information on the actual timing of <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> into consideration.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been great {{advances}} in the modeling of unsteady friction in transient flows. It is likely that in the near future, unsteady friction models will be applied to practical, real-life problems. However, the practical use of unsteady friction models requires justification. Issues which require exploration include: i) under what conditions are unsteady friction effects large enough to warrant {{the use of an}} unsteady friction model; and ii) for what applications is the use of unsteady friction highly important? This thesis investigates the relative importance of unsteady friction in pipe systems with <b>external</b> <b>flows.</b> <b>External</b> <b>flows</b> represent any inflow/outflow elements in a pipe system, such as demands, leaks, or branching subsystems. Energy-based investigations, performed with a quasi-two-dimensional, unsteady friction, transient flow model, show that in general, unsteady friction is highly important for small <b>external</b> <b>flows,</b> but negligible for large <b>external</b> <b>flows.</b> The result for small <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> shows that for pipes with small leaks, unsteady frictional effects may be larger than leak-induced effects. This shows that transient-based leakage detection techniques should consider unsteady friction. The damping rate leak detection method, which was originally derived assuming quasi-steady friction, is investigated with unsteady friction effects included. The investigation shows that the method still works when unsteady friction is important, as long as an unsteady friction model is used to determine the frictional dissipation rate of the system. The damping rate method was originally derived under highly restrictive assumptions, which are difficult to satisfy in practice. These assumptions are systematically relaxed, and the method is found to remain valid as long as the initial flow perturbation is rapid and impulsive, and the pipe system is a simple reservoir-pipe-valve setup...|$|R
50|$|The {{modified}} Dietz {{method has}} the practical {{advantage over the}} true time-weighted rate of return method, in that the calculation of a modified Dietz return does not require portfolio valuations at each point in time whenever an <b>external</b> <b>flow</b> occurs. The {{internal rate of return}} method shares this practical advantage with the modified Dietz method.|$|E
5000|$|Note that {{if there}} is an <b>external</b> <b>flow</b> {{occurring}} {{at the end of the}} overall period, then the number of sub-periods [...] matches the number of flows. However, if there is no flow at the end of the overall period, then [...] is zero, and the number of sub-periods [...] is one greater than the number of flows.|$|E
50|$|In fluid mechanics, <b>external</b> <b>flow</b> {{is such a}} flow that {{boundary}} layers develop freely, without constraints {{imposed by}} adjacent surfaces. Accordingly, there will always exist a region of the flow outside the boundary layer in which velocity, temperature, and/or concentration gradients are negligible. It {{can be defined as}} the flow of a fluid around a body that is completely submerged in it.|$|E
50|$|The example {{above is}} {{corrected}} if the start date is {{adjusted to the}} end of the day on 30 December, and the start value is now 8.1m HKD. There are no <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> thereafter.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, melting {{effect on}} mix ed {{convective}} heat transfer from a porous vertical plate with uniform wall {{temperature in the}} liquid-saturated porous medium with aiding and opposing <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> is numerically examined at steady state. The resulting boundary value problems (BVPs) are comprehensively solved by Runge-Kutta-Gill method and Newton's iteration for similarity solutions. As shown in the results, for aiding and opposing <b>external</b> <b>flows,</b> it is all found {{that the rate of}} convective heat transfer at the interface of solid and liquid phases is reduced with increasing melting strength. Additionally, the melting phenomenon decreases the thermal boundary layer regions of mixed convection in a porous medium. With melting effect, the heat transfer rate is also shown to be asymptotically approaching the forced or free convection as the value of Gr/Re approaches the limits of zero and infinity for aiding external flow; and the criteria for pure forced and mixed convection from an isothermal vertical flat plate in porous media with aiding and opposing <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> are established in melting process.

50|$|Taylor’s 1966 {{solution}} to internal and <b>external</b> <b>flow</b> of a sphere induced by an electric field {{was the first}} to provide an argument that accounted for pressure induced by fluid flow both inside the droplet and in the external fluid field. Unlike some of his contemporaries, Taylor argued that surface tension and a uniform internal pressure could not balance the spatially varying normal stress on a droplet interface that was resulted from the presence of a steady, uniform electric field. He posited that in order for a droplet interface to remain in a non-deformed state in the presence of an electric field, there must be fluid flow {{both inside and outside the}} droplet interface. He developed a solution for the internal and <b>external</b> <b>flow</b> field using a streamfunction approach similar to that of creeping flow past a sphere. Taylor confirmed the validity of his solution by comparing it to images from flow visualization studies that observed circulation both inside and outside the droplet interface.|$|E

5000|$|To {{compensate}} for external flows, the overall time interval under analysis {{is divided into}} contiguous sub-periods at each point in time within the overall time period whenever there is an <b>external</b> <b>flow.</b> In general, these sub-periods will be of unequal lengths. The returns over the sub-periods between external flows are linked geometrically (compounded) together, i.e. by multiplying together the growth factors in all the sub-periods. (The growth factor in each sub-period is equal to 1 plus the return over the sub-period.) ...|$|E
50|$|If {{there are}} no <b>external</b> <b>flows,</b> then all these methods (time-weighted return, {{internal}} rate of return, Modified Dietz Method etc.) give identical results - {{it is only the}} various ways they handle flows which makes them different from each other.|$|R
50|$|It {{is based}} on the {{assumption}} that all <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> occur at the half-way point in time within the evaluation period (or are spread evenly across the period, and so the flows occur on average at the middle of the period).|$|R
5000|$|The simple Dietz {{method is}} a {{variation}} upon the simple rate of return, which assumes that <b>external</b> <b>flows</b> occur {{either at the}} beginning or {{at the end of}} the period. The simple Dietz method is somewhat more computationally tractable than the internal rate of return (IRR) method.|$|R
