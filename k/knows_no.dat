Tangaballi catches Rahul as he tries to leave, but the villagers help them escape again. Meena persuades Rahul to {{disperse}} his grandfather's ashes and travels with him to Rameswaram, where they complete the rites. On their way back, Rahul realises that he has fallen in love with Meena, and does not tell her where they are going.

500|$|Slant Magazines writer Ed Gonzalez {{suggested}} that the Slant staff in large part disliked the film: [...] "Our contempt for The Revenant <b>knows</b> <b>no</b> limits." [...] Gonzalez unfavorably compared Iñárritu's work to Terrence Malick's 2005 film The New World. In the official review, Slant writer Jaime N. Christley wrote: [...] "The Revenant [...] a misery-fest that plants its narrative flags as carelessly as a Roland Emmerich blockbuster, guaranteeing us a viewing experience almost as arduous as the trials depicted on screen, before reaching a conclusion that's sealed the moment audiences first meet the key players. After an obligatory false calm, The Revenants proper opening scene is a show-stopping massacre at a fur-trapper's campsite. It's {{the kind of thing}} Howard Hawks would have handled—and did, in The Big Sky—in under 90 seconds, with mostly off-camera particulars and minimal effects, but González Iñárritu forces it to resemble the Normandy Beach sequence in Saving Private Ryan as much as history or sense will allow, and then some." [...] The Revenant was ranked 22nd on Metacritic's and 79th on Rotten Tomatoes' list of best films of 2015.|$|E

[...] "The Root" [...] is a mid-tempo heartbreak song with the bass line and guitar solo played simultaneously by Hunter on an eight-string guitar. It is about a vengeful woman's effect on the narrator: [...] "In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that <b>knows</b> <b>no</b> floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". Miles Marshall Lewis writes of the song's subject matter, [...] " [...] can actually be digested and emotionally felt, sadly rare for Hot 97 R" [...] Co-written by Roy Hargrove, [...] "Spanish Joint" [...] is a salsa-infused, high tempo track about karma. It incorporates rhythmic Brazilian guitar licks by Hunter, funky horn arrangements by Hargrove, and Latin grooves and fusion instrumentation similar to Stevie Wonder's [...] "Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing" [...] (1973). [...] "Feel Like Makin' Love" [...] is a cover of Roberta Flack's 1974 hit of the same name with a low-key, quiet storm sound.

Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score [...] "is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered, [...] there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative." [...] He concluded that [...] "American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains {{little more than an}} annotated rock concert. ... Still, [...] deserves at least two cheers – for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway." [...] Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote [...] "Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won’t know what hit you. American Idiot <b>knows</b> <b>no</b> limits—it's a global knockout." [...] The musical has been nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards.|$|E

Performed [...] "as a prayer for deliverance from [...] pain and suffering," [...] lyrically, [...] "God Help the Outcasts," [...] a song about faith, explores themes such as discrimination. Additionally, “God Help the Outcasts” [...] "touches on a basic idea behind most faiths." [...] Asking [...] "was Jesus [...] not an outcast, too, as [...] sees firsthand how her people, are persecuted for their differences," [...] the first verse of the song reads, [...] "I don't know if You can hear me/Or if You're even there/I don't know if You would listen/To a gypsy's prayer." [...] Teen Ink observed, [...] "This part is about how it seems like God doesn't listen to you or help you, {{no matter how much}} you pray or talk to him." [...] Finally, asking people to be kind and unselfish, Esmeralda sings, [...] "Please help my people, the poor and downtrodden/I thought we all were the children of God.” In The Gospel According to Disney, author Mark I. Pinsky drew similarities between [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] and the Christian hymn [...] "His Eye Is on the Sparrow," [...] as both songs explore [...] "the love of God that <b>knows</b> <b>no</b> bounds."
