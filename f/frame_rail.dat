25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
50|$|Fleetwood Brougham {{was most}} luxurious model on the US market at that time. It {{included}} many comfort features, but {{could also be}} a true powerhouse for towing. By the 1978 owners manual the maximum trailer weight could be 6000lbs or 2721kg. It could either have bumper mounted towing point or <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> mounted towing point.|$|E
50|$|The Dart and {{its sister}} model—the Plymouth Valiant—were {{substantially}} redesigned for the 1967 model year. In addition to new styling, the cars received revised steering systems, wider front track and <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> spacing, and redesigned K-members capable of accepting larger engines. The Dart would keep this basic form, with facelifts consisting of revised {{front and rear}} end styling and interior trim, {{until the end of}} A-body production in 1976 for North America and 1981 for South America.|$|E

50|$|Another feature seen are tapered rails that narrow {{vertically}} and/or horizontally {{in front}} of a vehicle's cabin. This is done mainly on trucks to save weight and slightly increase room for the engine since the front of the vehicle does not bear as much of a load as the back. Design developments include frames that use more than one shape in the same <b>frame</b> <b>rail.</b> For example, some pickup trucks have a boxed frame {{in front of}} the cab, shorter, narrower rails underneath the cab, and regular C-rails under the bed.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fail-safe}} {{cooling system}} with a dual speed electric fan was put in place, along with a coil-on-plug ignition system. Larger dual piston brake calipers {{were added to the}} front, requiring 16 inch wheels to be standard. A Watt's linkage was added to the rear suspension. Fuel lines were moved to the passenger side <b>frame</b> <b>rail.</b> A coded ignition key (known as Passive Anti-Theft System, or [...] "PATS") system was introduced and a 72 amp/hour battery replaced the previous 58. Other minor changes included a redesigned engine cover and the power steering fluid reservoir being moved {{to the front of the}} engine.|$|E
5000|$|The Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) {{technology}} was employed initially in the Lexus GX 470, and subsequently the 200 Series Toyota Land Cruiser. The system was invented and developed by Kinetic Pty Ltd, a small R&D {{company based in}} Dunsborough, Western Australia. It optimally adjusts front and rear stabilizers based {{on a set of}} interconnected hydraulic cylinders. The interconnection is made up of hydraulic piping and a control cylinder which is located at the <b>frame</b> <b>rail.</b> [...] KDSS, which is fully mechanical, can disengage the stabilizer bars (the bars are jointed, allowing movement independent of one another). This system will not engage during normal driving conditions, when hydraulic pressure is equal. In off-road conditions, KDSS activates when it senses that a wheel has dropped.|$|E

5000|$|The 1994.5 to 1996/97 DI Power stroke has [...] "single shot" [...] HEUI (hydraulically {{actuated}} {{electronic unit}} injection) fuel injectors {{and ran a}} high pressure oil pump (HPOP) to create the necessary oil pressure to fire the fuel injectors. This generation of Power Stroke utilizes an HPOP with a 15° swash plate angle. The 1995-1997 trucks use a cam-driven fuel pump, whereas the 1999-2003 trucks use a <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> mounted electric fuel pump. The California trucks from 1996 and 1997 have split-shot fuel injectors; other trucks did not get split-shot injectors until 1999. Single-shot injectors only inject one charge of fuel per cycle, whereas the split-shot injector releases a preliminary light load before the main charge to initiate combustion in a more damped manner. This controlled injection helps reduce the sharp combustion 'knock'.|$|E
5000|$|These {{models of}} trucks were {{produced}} in 27,500 lb to 60,920 lb Gross Vehicle Weight Ratings (the loaded {{weight of the}} truck), with both single and tandem rear axle models. The Fleetstar line was larger than the Loadstar (International's medium duty lineup during this time) and smaller than the Paystar (severe service) and Transtar (primarily semi-tractors). Fleetstars used the [...] "C" [...] series cab popular on the Loadstar and pickups, and later on got the newer [...] "D" [...] series cab, with some overlap between the two models. There were Cummins, Detroit Diesel, and International Harvester built engines available in larger sizes {{than those of the}} Loadstar line. <b>Frame</b> <b>rail</b> and axle sizes were generally larger than their smaller cousin, and were of the completely straight design for strength. These frames were typical of International truck frames in general, having large flanges, and great strength.|$|E
50|$|Floating Power was a {{technology}} {{developed in the}} 1920s by the United States automobile firm of Chrysler, credited mostly to the engineering of Owen Ray Skelton. It was a new means of attaching an engine to its chassis, {{with the intention of}} reducing vibration. Four-cylinder engines of the day started and rode rather roughly, transmitting the torque to the whole chassis. By attaching the engine at only two points ("fore-and-aft"), on two points defining an axis that passes through the engine's center of mass, the engine would be able to rotate slightly about this axis and reduce the transmission of torsional vibration to the chassis. One mounting attachment was at the upper front of the engine, directly below the water pump. The rear mount was under the transmission case. A transverse spring went {{from the bottom of the}} engine to a snubber bracket on the <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> to limit the rotational travel of the engine. The bracket was lined with rubber.|$|E

50|$|Hydroforming is a {{specialized}} type of die forming {{that uses a}} high pressure hydraulic fluid to press room temperature working material into a die. To hydroform aluminium into a vehicle's <b>frame</b> <b>rail,</b> a hollow tube of aluminium is placed inside a negative mold that has {{the shape of the}} desired result. High pressure hydraulic pumps then inject fluid at very high pressure inside the aluminium tube which causes it to expand until it matches the mold. The hydroformed aluminium is then removed from the mold.Hydroforming allows complex shapes with concavities to be formed, which would be difficult or impossible with standard solid die stamping. Hydroformed parts can often be made with a higher stiffness-to-weight ratio and at a lower per unit cost than traditional stamped or stamped and welded parts. Virtually all metals capable of cold forming can be hydroformed, including aluminium, brass, carbon and stainless steel, copper, and high strength alloys.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame was}} changed for 1990 and {{used some of}} the {{features}} from the 1989 GSX-R 1100 frame. The rake was now 25.5 degrees and wheelbase 55.7 in. The front suspension now had inverted forks, the triple clamps (yokes) and handlebars were changed to accommodate the new forks. The rear suspension featured a new damper (shock) and swingarm. The rear damper (shock) now had a remote reservoir and damping adjustment. The revised swingarm now featured cast ends for the axle adjustment. The rear wheel was widened to 5.5 in (previously 4.5 in) but the tire size remained the same. A non-adjustable steering damper was added which attached from the left <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> to a clamp on the left fork (US models did not receive the damper but the frame had the tapped mounting holes). The rear sprocket carrier and sprocket changed to a six-bolt design (previously five). The front brake rotors changed to a slotted design (previously cross drilled holes).|$|E

5000|$|In the 1941 and 1942 model years, the 216cid inline 6 [...] "Blue Flame" [...] {{engine was}} the only one offered. It {{produced}} 90 horsepower at 3,300 rpm, and in 1950 higher compression bumped it up to 92 horsepower. Also in 1950, a 235.5CID one-bbl.carb six-cylinder engine with [...] was added. [...] A Fleetline of this vintage could easily exceed 80 miles per hour without overdrive. In very early models, the transmission was a manual synchromesh three-speed, with vacuum-assisted shift, in which the [...] "three-on-the-tree" [...] shifter was able to be moved between gears by the slightest pressure on the lever. Third gear was direct, meaning the input and output are equal speeds. From 1950 through the 1952 final year of its production, an automatic transmission was offered, which was quite sluggish. Overdrive was a rare option. Connection to the third member rear-end was via an enclosed [...] "torque tube" [...] driveshaft. The brakes were hydraulic with all-wheel drums. In 1951, the brakes got larger. The master cylinder was located below the floor connected on the <b>frame</b> <b>rail,</b> beneath the driver. Shock absorbers were of the lever type for the early years only. The windshield for all years was of a split, flat-glass type.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} research and testing done by NHTSA, other governments, research organizations {{as well as}} automobile manufacturers to find solutions that improve safety in the small cars when colliding with larger vehicles. In the United States, a group of experts proposed major steps to improve compatibility and these have been accepted as a voluntary regulation by American automotive manufacturers {{as well as by}} most other companies selling vehicles in the U.S. The Canadian government has also accepted these recommendations. The recommendations require all manufacturers to either (a) lower the height of the primary structure (also called <b>frame</b> <b>rail)</b> of all SUV and pickup trucks so that they overlap the primary structure of the cars; or (b) add another structure (called Secondary Energy Absorbing Structure) to the SUVs and pickup truck that cannot meet the first option. Latest studies have shown that these have improved the safety in cars when struck by SUVs. However, no such benefit has been observed in pickup truck to car crashes. It is unclear whether or not certain aftermarket modifications are taken into account, such as [...] "lift kits" [...] which raise the frame or suspension of a vehicle for increased ground clearance. Such modifications would likely greatly reduce the effectiveness of modern auto-safety advances due to causing the rigid parts of a pickup or SUV to strike the weaker parts of lower vehicles, rather than the reinforced regions in an accident. State laws regarding the use of such modifications vary widely, and many have laws that aren't enforced. As of now, there are no Federal laws regarding the bumper height of trucks and SUV's.|$|E

The interior was a carryover from 1991 {{with the exception of the}} center console and steering wheel (X-bar style similar to the one used in the GMT400 trucks). Also, the [...] "S-15" [...] name was dropped from the Jimmy. The S10 Blazer also introduced an upscale Tahoe trim package, the Tahoe LT, which was rebadged as the LT in 1995 whilst the Tahoe package was renamed as the LS. The Tahoe LT had its own exterior décor with faded lower body lines on the lower rockers along with Tahoe LT badges - this also included an overhead console and keyless remote door locks). 1992 was the first model year where the S10 Blazer and Jimmy offered an NP233 electronic transfer case for as a drive train option. This deleted the Manual gear range selector with a 3 position switch located to the left of the gauge cluster in the same location that the rear defrost button would be located on non-electronic transfer-case and 2WD model Blazers and Jimmies (when optioned with the electronic transfer case the defrost button assembly is positioned below the headlight switch). The electronic transfer-case added luxury however there was no neutral position with the electronic transfer case, so the owner's manual stated that the drive shaft had to be removed when the vehicle was being towed. The fuel lines, which were routed on the driver side <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> to the TBI fuel injectors, were redesigned where the fuel inlets entered the rear of the engine (same as the GMT400). This was phased in because of the L35 option which used a similar fuel line setup. The serpentine accessory drive for the 4.3L motor was modified where the air pump was eliminated and further lightened.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the major}} {{applications}} for cold formed carbon steel ‘C ’ sections is through load carrying structural frame side members in heavy road vehicles. Though {{it is expected that}} forming operations would enhance the mechanical properties of sections as a whole by strain-hardening, it leaves certain amount of residual stresses throughout the sections. It is thus necessary to account for the effect of residual stresses remaining from cold forming operations accurately, while assessing the mechanical behavior of truck side <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> sections. In this work, an experimental investigation was carried out to assess residual stresses induced by cold forming operation of truck <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> sections through X-ray diffraction method.

40|$|Abstract. Chassis {{frame rails}} {{in a truck}} are load bearing {{structural}} members that integrate vehicle power train with superstructure to form a complete vehicle. Large numbers of bolt holes that are cut into these frame side members act as joineries and points of attachments for various sub systems of the truck. While bolt holes are unavoidable due to its primary functional importance, the near hole residual stresses remaining from hole cutting operations may {{play a significant role}} in deciding the life of <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> sections as they lead to early initiation of fatigue cracks around bolt hole surface. In order to assess the extent of plastic deformation and resulting residual stress pattern in near hole areas of bolt holes, experimental investigation through microstructure analysis, micro-hardness and X-ray diffraction measurements has been taken up. The hole cutting operations considered for this exercise are drilling, punching, laser cutting and water jet cutting used to cut holes on truck <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> sections. Apart from this, an assessment of shot-peened hole surface was also taken up to understand the effect of shot-peening on structural behavior of <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> bolt hole sections. The experimentally measured near hole residual stress profiles can be considered as initial conditions for further numerical analysis to study the influence of bolt hole residual stresses on fatigue life of <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> sections...|$|E
