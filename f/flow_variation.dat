40|$|We have {{previously}} shown in anesthetized, open-chest dogs with coronary stenosis and endothelial injury that serotonin and/or thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) receptor activation {{play a major}} role in the mediation of platelet-dependent, intermittent coronary occlusion. Using a similar model in awake, closedchest dogs, we tested the following hypotheses: (a) treadmill exercise promotes the development of cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in dogs with coronary stenoses and endothelial injury; (b) ventricular pacing does not induce cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in the same dogs; and (c) TXA 2 and/or serotonin are important mediators of exercise-induced cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in this model. The surgical preparation consisted of the application of a hard, flow-limiting constrictor and a Doppler ultrasonic flow probe around the left coronary artery of 11 dogs.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that free oxygen radicals contribute to platelet aggregation and cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in stenosed and endothelium-injured coronary arteries. Background. Although free oxygen radicals, such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, have been shown to alter platelet function in vitro, the potential role of free oxygen radicals has not been fully described in an in vivo model of coronary artery thrombosis. Methods. Cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> were produced in dogs by an external constrictor placed at the site of the left anterior descending coronary artery with injured endothelium. Blood flow in this artery was monitored by a pulsed Doppler flow probe. If cyclic How variations were observed during postoperative days, dogs intravenously received superoxide dismutase plus catalase. In anesthetized dogs that did not develop an episode of cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations,</b> the effect of intracoronary infusion of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase or hydrogen peroxide on arterial blood flow velocity was studied. In platelet studies, the effect of free oxygen radicals and radical scavengers on platelet aggregation was examined. Result. In conscious dogs with cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations,</b> superoxide dismutase plus catalase significantly reduced cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> (n = 7), whereas saline infusion had no effect (n = 7), The infusion of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase or hydrogen peroxide significantly induced cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in four of six dogs or in five of seven dogs, respectively. In vitro platelet studies showed that xanthine plus xanthine oxidase or hydrogen peroxide significantly enhanced platelet aggregation, and superoxide dismutase or catalase significantly inhibited such aggregation. Conclusion. Reduction of free radical formation decreases platelet aggregation and may eliminate cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations,</b> whereas promotion of free radical generation enhances platelet aggregation and may induce cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations.</b> Thus, free oxygen radicals are an important mediator in this model...|$|R

40|$|Sodium nitroprusside, {{a potent}} vasodilator, was {{evaluated}} for {{its effect on}} platelet aggregation in stenosed and endothelium-injured coronary arteries in a canine model. Twenty-five anesthetized dogs were studied; coronary blood flow velocity was continuously monitored. Recurrent intracoronary platelet aggregation and dislodgment (indicated by cyclic variations in coronary blood flow) were induced by mechanically injuring and stenosing the left anterior descending coronary artery. Sodium nitroprusside was administered either intrapericardially or intravenously 30 min after cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> were established. Intrapericardial administration of saline (control) did not affect cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in any of 6 tested dogs. Sodium nitroprusside abolished cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in all 7 dogs (100 %) when given intrapericardially and in 5 to 7 dogs (71 %) when given intravenously (compared to intrapericardial salines, p < 0. 01). A smaller dose of sodium nitroprusside was required to abolish cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> when given intrapericardially than when given intravenously (1. 6 +/- 0. 5 micrograms. kg- 1. min- 1 vs 4. 8 +/- 0. 8 micrograms. kg- 1. min- 1, p < 0. 01). The mean aortic pressure was reduced by 10 to 20 mmHg after intrapericardial sodium nitroprusside administration and by 30 to 40 mmHg after intravenous sodium nitroprusside administration. To investigate the mechanism of protection by sodium nitroprusside, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthetase, was used to induce cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in mildly injured and stenosed left anterior descending coronary arteries in 5 dogs. Intrapericardial sodium nitroprusside abolished the cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in all 5 dogs. Then oxyhemoglobin, an inhibitor of nitric oxide, was administered into the left anterior descending coronary arteries of these dogs, and it restored the sodium nitroprusside-abolished cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in all 5 dogs. Thus, sodium nitroprusside protects against platelet aggregation and cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in stenosed and endothelium-injured canine coronary arteries, probably {{by the action of}} nitric oxide, and it is more effective and hemodynamically safer when administered intrapericardially than when administered intravenously...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} whether platelet-activating factor {{is a specific}} mediator of cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in damaged stenotic arteries and whether it contributes to reocclusion after thrombolysis, femoral arteries in anesthetized dogs were subjected to mural injury and high grade stenosis to induce cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> (28 Â± 4 /h) or methods selected to elicit platelet-rich and fibrin-rich thrombosis. Oral administration of a novel triazolobenzodiazepine (U 46, 195 [10 mg/kg]) that selectively inhibits platelet-activating factor abolished cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> within 120 min and far â¥ 2 h thereafter compared with persistent <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in dogs given saline solution. Platelet aggregation induced ex vivo with platelet-activating factor was inhibited in parallel with in vivo inhibition of cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> after administration of U 46, 195. However, buccal macosa bleeding time was not affected. After thrombosis, administration of U 46, 195 before thrombolysis was induced with human recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (1. 7 mg/kg intravenously over 60 min) prevented reocclusion within 120 min in six of eight and six of seven arteries by platelet-rich and fibrin-rich thrombosis, respectively. In contrast, in dogs given saline solution, reocclusion occurred in eight of eight (p = 0. 007 compared with U 46, 195) and five of eight arteries by platelet-rich and fibrin-rich thrombosis, respectively. Thus, both cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> and reocclusion after thrombolysis appear to be mediated in part by platelet-activating factor. The results suggest that inhibition of platelet-activating factor with specific antagonists {{may be useful in}} reducing platelet-mediated occlusion of coronary arteries without eliciting bleeding...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that combined thromboxane A 2 synthetase inhibition and receptor blockade is superior to either action alone in preventing cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in stenosed and endothelially injured canine coronary arteries. Forty-five dogs developed coronary cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> after a plastic constrictor was placed around the left anterior descending coronary artery at the site where the endothelium was injured and received different interventions. In Group I, 17 dogs were treated with SQ 29, 548, a thromboxane A 2 -prostaglandin H 2 receptor antagonist. In Group II, 11 dogs received dazoxiben, a thromboxane A 2 synthetase inhibitor. In Group III, R 68, 070, a dual thromboxane A 2 synthetase inhibitor and thromboxane A 2 -prostaglandin H 2 receptor antagonist, was administered to 11 dogs. Group IV comprised six dogs that received aspirin before receiving R 68, 070. Complete abolition of cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> was achieved in 71 % of dogs in Group I, 82 % in Group II, 100 % in Group III (p = 0. 06 compared with Group I) and 50 % in Group IV (p = 0. 03 compared with Group III). Epinephrine was infused into dogs with abolished cyclic flow variations: all dogs in Group I had cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> restored, 44 % in Group II (p = 0. 01 compared with Group I) and 64 % in Group III (p = 0. 04 compared with Group I). The plasma epinephrine levels required to restore cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> were 2. 2 Â± 0. 5 ng/ml (control 0. 04 Â± 0. 01) in Group I, 8. 7 Â± 4. 5 ng/ml (control 0. 05 Â± 0. 02) in Group II and 7. 4 Â± 2. 6 ng/ml (control 0. 07 Â± 0. 02) in Group III. The epinephrine-restored cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in Group II and III dogs were abolished again by LY 53, 857, a serotonin receptor antagonist. None of these dogs had cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> restored even with plasma epinephrine concentrations as high as 25. 1 Â± 3. 6 ng/ml in Group II dogs and 43. 2 Â± 9. 4 ng/ml in Group III dogs. Serum thromboxane B 2 (the stable metabolite of thromboxane A 2) concentrations decreased in both Group III and Group IV dogs from 2. 2 Â± 1. 0 and 2. 0 Â± 1. 0 ng/ml at control study to 0. 8 Â± 0. 9 and 0. 9 Â± 1. 0 ng/ml after the administration of R 68, 070 or aspirin and R 68, 070, respectively. Combined actions of thromboxane A 2 synthetase inhibition and receptor blockade may be more effective than thromboxane A 2 -prostaglandin H 2 receptor blockade alone in eliminating spontaneous canine coronary cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations.</b> Thromboxane A 2 synthetase inhibition alone or combined with receptor blockade provides more protection against epinephrine-induced canine coronary cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> than a thromboxane A 2 -prostaglandin H 2 receptor antagonist alone. Prostacyclin might be an important contributing factor in preventing both spontaneous and epinephrine-induced cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> when a combined thromboxane synthetase inhibitor and receptor antagonist is used in this experimental model. Furthermore, the addition of a serotonin receptor antagonist to a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor or combined thromboxane synthetase inhibition and receptor antagonist provides substantial protection against epinephrine-induced cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> in such an experimental model...|$|R

Healthy schoolchildren (n= 204; 100 males) aged 6 - 16 yrs measured their peak flow and FEV 1 twice daily for 2 weeks using an electronic home spirometer.

40|$|Aims: The {{hypothesis}} {{of this research}} is {{that it is possible to}} increase the drip irrigation lateral line length by using a larger spacing between emitters at the beginning of the lateral line and a smaller one after a certain distance, which would allow for a higher pressure variation along the lateral line under an acceptable value of distribution uniformity. Study Design: Non-pressure compensating drip hose is widely utilized for vegetables and orchards irrigation. Though there is a limitation, which is the lateral line length must be short to maintain uniformity due to head loss and slope, any procedure to increase the length is appropriate because it represents low initial cost of the irrigation system. Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted at the College of Agricultural Sciences of Sao Paulo State University in Botucatu, SP, during the year 2011. Methodology: To evaluate this hypothesis, a nonlinear programming model (NLP) was developed. The input data were: diameter, roughness coefficient, pressure variation, emitter operational pressure, relationship between emitter discharge and pressure. The output data were: line length, discharge and length of the each section with different spacing between drippers, total discharge in the lateral line, multiple outlet adjustment coefficient, head losses, localized head loss, pressure variation, number of emitters, spacing between emitters, discharge in each emitter, and discharge per linear meter. Results: The mathematical model developed was compared with the lateral line length obtained with the algebraic solution generated by the Darcy-Weisbach equation. The NLP model showed the best results since it generated a greater gain in the lateral line length, maintaining the uniformity and the <b>flow</b> <b>variation</b> under acceptable standards.

These <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> are associated with transient platelet aggregation and dislodgment {{and the release of}} selected mediators, including thromboxane A 2 and serotonin. However, cyclic or spontaneous How variations have not been demonstrated in stenosed coronary arteries in humans. In this study, the hypothesis was tested that spontaneous coronary blood <b>flow</b> velocity <b>variations</b> occur in some patients with stenosed coronary arteries before or after {{coronary artery}} angioplasty. Thus, 13 patients with severe and limiting angina underwent intracoronary pulsed Doppler velocimetry of their dilated artery immediately before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, whereas 9 control patients underwent velocimetry of an angiographically normal coronary artery. A 3 F catheter with a 20 MHz Doppler crystal was positioned to achieve a maximal stable signal, and the flow velocity signal was recorded continuously for 20 min. Spontaneous <b>flow</b> velocity <b>variations</b> (â¥ 38 % change in Doppler frequency shift with wide morphologic changes) were present in 3 of the 13 patients tested. Spontaneous <b>flow</b> velocity <b>variations</b> occurred before angioplasty in one patient, after angioplasty in another and both before and after angioplasty in a third. In addition, 2 of the 13 patients, 1 with spontaneous coronary artery <b>flow</b> velocity <b>variations</b> before angioplasty, had frank vasospasm in an adjacent area just distal to the area of coronary dilation immediately after balloon inflation. These data establish that spontaneous coronary artery <b>flow</b> velocity <b>variations</b> occur in some patients with severe and limiting angina before and after coronary angioplasty. These variations may be related to platelet aggregation or coronary vasoconstriction, or both, at sites of endothelial injury resulting from plaque fissuring or ulceration and endothelial and medial injury occurring during coronary angioplasty...|$|R

Direct field observations and a high-resolution (50 -m grid size) numerical ocean model are used to describe the <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> that impact the initial dispersion of eggs and larvae from this site, which serves as a spawning aggregation site for many species of reef fishes. Idealized sensitivity model experiments isolate the role of various processes, such as internal waves, wind, tides, and large-scale <b>flow</b> <b>variations.</b> The acute horizontal curvature and steep topography of the reef intensify the flow, create small-scale convergence and divergence zones, and excite high-frequency oscillations and internal waves. Although the tides in this area are relatively small (â¼ 10 -cm amplitude), the model simulations show that tides can excite significant high-frequency <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> near the reef, which suggests that the preference of fish to aggregate and spawn in the days following the time of full moon may not be coincidental. Even small <b>variations</b> in remote <b>flows</b> (2 - 5 cm s - 1) due to say, meso-scale eddies, are enough to excite near-reef oscillations. Model simulations and the observations further suggest that the spawning site {{at the tip of the}} reef provides initial strong dispersion for eggs, but then the combined influence of the along-isobath flow and the westward wind will transport the eggs and larvae downstream of Gladden Spit toward less turbulent region, which may contribute to enhanced larval survival.

This Mixture consists of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solid (TSS), and Nitrate (NO 3). This research investigated {{the influence of}} concentration and <b>flow</b> <b>variation</b> parameters to treating the Mixture Grey Water and Black Water. Effluent quality of decreasing concentration varied by the concentration and flow recorded BOD was about 102 - 544 mg/l, COD was about 287 - 1. 230 mg/l,TSS was about 280 - 780 mg/l and For treating nitrate the result was fair enough than others was about 4 - 12 mg/l. According to the <b>flow</b> <b>variation</b> resulted the retention time are 4, 6 and 8 hours. The best effluent quality was happened 878 mg/LCOD, and varied by flow are 0, 125. The results of research showedthe higher concentration will decrease the value of BOD and Nitrate removal, due {{to the influence of}} pH. The higher flow will decrease the value of BOD and increase COD, TSS, and Nitrate removal, and optimum condition ensued ata debit of 0, 125 l/hour.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is developed which predicts {{the influence of}} airfoil mean loading on noise generation due to convected gusts. The theory {{is based on a}} linearization of the exact inviscid equations about a nonuniform compressible mean flow and the solution is developed using singular perturbation techniques. The case of a flat plate airfoil, at incidence angle alpha, interacting with three-dimensional disturbances is analyzed. It is found that {{in the vicinity of the}} airfoil leading and trailing edges, local regions are present which scale on the disturbance wavelength, with the noise generation concentrated in these regions. Away from the airfoil edges, the mean <b>flow</b> <b>variation</b> is found to be slow compared to the disturbance wavelength and no significant noise generation occurs. The mean <b>flow</b> <b>variation</b> near the leading edge generates additional noise by distorting the convected gust. The cumulative effect of the airfoil mean loading in the trailing edge region produces a 0 (1) phase shift between the disturbances on the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. A corresponding 0 (1) decrease, compared to the alpha = 0 case, is found in the noise generated at the trailing edge...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{enormous}} untapped potential for hydropower generation in rivers with large head and high <b>flow</b> <b>variation,</b> currently not feasible for conventional hydropower dams. Conventional dams {{make use of the}} potential energy, but waste kinetic energy from spillage during periods of high flows. This article studies the possibility of harnessing energy from potential and kinetic energy from hydropower dams with large head and <b>flow</b> <b>variation,</b> analyses its potential, and shows possible technologies. Focus is given to a Moveable Hydro-Electric Power Plant (HEPP) system in which the turbine module can be adjusted according to the flow and water level in the river. During floods the exceeding flows can pass above and below the Moveable HEPP results in a sub-pressure environment after the turbine module, thereby reducing the damâs downstream head, increasing the pressure difference between the turbine inlet and outlet and the flow through the turbine, which increases the electricity generation of the dam. Dams with head increaser arrangement have been implemented in several dams in the 1930 â 1950 s and now are regaining attention in Middle Europe. The main intention for its implementation is harnessing hydropower generation at run-of-river plants, with low-head, with a 20...|$|E
40|$|Detection {{of changes}} in the flow rate of {{expelled}} fluids in accretionary prisms by monitoring of electric and magnetic fields is discussed. A numerical model of the electric and magnetic fields associated with fluid <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> at the Nankai Trough is presented which gives a numerical solution of the coupled system of electric convection currents and conduction currents that directly determines the magnetic anomaly itself. Measurements in a borehole located between two vents are shown to be well adapted to detection of fluid <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> using the vertical gradient of the electric potential and the horizontal magnetic field. The vertical electric field is about 10 mV/km up to 500 m depth where there is a lithologic reflector and about 50 mV/km below this reflector. The horizontal gradient of the magnetic field is 2 nT/km at the seafloor. Modelization with a lower fault conductivity and a larger dÃ©collement thickness has also been modeled. The vertical gradient of the horizontal magnetic field is ~ 5 to 15 nT/km. A variation of 3 mV and 1. 5 to 3 nT at 600 m depth in a borehole could reveal a fluid <b>flow</b> rate <b>variation</b> of 20 %, which is a reasonable fluid flow change based on some observations at short-scale time. Since a 1. 5 to 3 nT anomaly seems easier to detect than a 3 mV anomaly, {{it is likely that the}} variation of the magnetic field would more sensitively reveal fluid <b>flow</b> <b>variations.</b> When monitoring the magnetic field at the seafloor, a change of 0. 4 nT/km in the horizontal gradient could reveal a fluid <b>flow</b> rate <b>variation</b> of 20 %...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that dismutation of superoxide anion increases endogenous levels of nitric oxide, resulting in inhibition of cyclic <b>variations</b> in blood <b>flow</b> in arteries that are injured and stenotic. Background. Platelet adhesion and aggregation leading to cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> might result, in part, from generation of superoxide anion that can deplete endogenously produced nitric oxide. Methods. Spontaneous cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations,</b> monitored with a proximal Doppler probe, were induced in the carotid artery of anesthetized rabbits by clamping the vessel with forceps and placing a high grade stenosis {{at the site of}} injury. Bovine copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (12 mg/kg body weight, n = 5), a synthetic low molecular weight mimetic (12 mg/kg, n = 8) or buffer vehicle (n = 8) was administered intravenously as divided boluses over 45 min, and the frequency of cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> was monitored for 4 h. Results. Cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> remained stable for 4 h in vehicle-treated animals (15 Â± 1 [mean Â± SEM]/ 30 min at baseline and 16 Â± 1 / 30 min after 4 h, n = 8) but exhibited a marked and persistent reduction in animals given copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (from 14 Â± 1 / 30 min at baseline to 4 Â± 1 / 30 min after 4 h) or the mimetic (from 15 Â± 1 / 30 min at baseline to 3 Â± 1 / 30 min after 4 h, p < 0. 005). They were restored in three of four mimetic-treated animals during infusion of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (100 mg/kg), an inhibitor of nitric oxide production. In addition, levels of cyclic guanosine 5 â²-monophosphate in platelets were elevated after administration of the mimetic (from 2. 4 Â± 0. 5 fmol/ 106 platelets at baseline to 4. 9 Â± 0. 6 fmol/ 106 platelets 45 min after the mimetic, p < 0. 03, n = 6), whereas mean arterial blood pressure was decreased and flow velocity in the carotid artery was increased consistent with mediation of the effect on cyclic <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> by increased endogenous nitric oxide. Conclusions. Dismutation of superoxide anion appears to attenuate platelet thrombus formation at a site of vessel injury by potentiation of endogenously produced nitric oxide. This approach may have utility to inhibit platelet-rich thrombosis in injured and stenotic arteries where production of superoxide anion is increased...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{changes in}} flow below {{hydroelectric}} facilities result from peaking operations, where water is typically {{stored in a}} reservoir at night and released through turbines to satisfy increased electrical demand during the day. Potential impacts of these short-term, recurring disturbances of aquatic systems below dams are important considerations in hydropower development. Reduced biotic productivity in tailwaters may be due directly to <b>flow</b> <b>variations</b> or indirectly {{to a variety of}} factors related to <b>flow</b> <b>variations,</b> such as changes in water depth or temperature, or scouring of sediments. Many riverine fish and invertebrate species have a limited range of conditions to which they are adapted; thus, such conditions can reduce the abundance, diversity, and productivity of these riverine organisms. Information needs for site-specific evaluations of potential impacts at hydroelectric peaking projects are outlined, along with management and mitigation options to reduce anticipated adverse effects...|$|R
