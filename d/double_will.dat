If both opponents roll the same opening number, the {{doubling}} cube is incremented on each occasion yet {{remains in the}} middle of the board, available to either player. The Murphy rule may be invoked with a maximum number of automatic doubles allowed and that limit is agreed to prior to a game or match commencing. When a player decides to double the opponent, the value is then a double of whatever face value is shown (e.g. if two automatic doubles have occurred putting the cube up to 4, the first in-game <b>double</b> <b>will</b> be for 8 points). The Murphy rule is not an official rule in backgammon and is rarely, if ever, seen in use at officially sanctioned tournaments.|$|E

Even for such seemingly safe props, very often a stunt <b>double</b> <b>will</b> replace the main actor for shots involving use of breakaway props.

50|$|Regulation is a {{term used}} for multi-barreled {{firearms}} that indicates how close to the same point of aim the barrels will shoot. Regulation is very important, because a poorly regulated gun may hit consistently with one barrel, but miss consistently with the other, making the gun nearly useless for anything requiring two shots. Fortunately, the short ranges and spread of shot provide a significant overlap, so a small error in regulation in a <b>double</b> <b>will</b> often be {{too small to be}} noticed. Generally the shotguns are regulated to hit the point of aim at a given distance, usually the maximum expected range since that is the range at which a full choke would be used, and where precise regulation matters most.|$|E

40|$|This work pays {{attention}} to the debt of abstract rationality to the iconic and symbolic. From a critical perspective towards a philosophy based in the clear and the distinct, this paper tries to connect image and concept. The first section studies the imagery {{in the formation of}} philosophical ideas, having in mind thinkers such as Plato, Plotinus and Kant. The second section, titled «The Imaginal Schematism in Thought», adopts a genetic or poietic perspective of the image; which is considered in itself a source of thought. The author proposes an archeology of thought, in which it is not sufficient an analysis based on logical concepts and language. For that reason {{it will be necessary to}} turn to a topology, where space will be understood as the form of thought. The rise and unfold of the image, considered as a form of space, will be determinants in the beginning and development of thought. The image of the circle, essential in monist systems, and the image of the mirror, understood as the reflection of the same or like the menacing <b>double,</b> <b>will</b> be discussed as examples that acknowledge the figurative aspect of representations...|$|E

40|$|Esta dissertação busca abordar a temática do duplo na retomada dialógica do mito de Anfitrião, feita por José Saramago no romance moderno O Homem Duplicado. Com profundas raízes mitológicas até chegar ao romance moderno, indivíduos duplicados foram representados em toda a {{literatura}} sob as mais diversas formas - os sósias, os gêmeos, o retrato, o reflexo no espelho - e perpassam o tempo desvendando as relações individuais e sociais de cada época, desde as comédias antigas até os dramas contemporâneos. Com este objetivo, o trabalho apresentará, em primeiro lugar, uma pesquisa sobre o conceito de mito e seu modo de utilização à época da antiguidade clássica. Em seguida, apresentará um estudo do duplo e do modo como esse tema é explorado no mito de Anfitrião e, depois, no romance O homem duplicado. Por último são estabelecidas as relações dialógicas encontradas em ambos os textos. The aim of {{this study}} is to approach the theme of the double in the dialogical appropriation of the myth of Amphitryon by José Saramago, when writing the post-modern novel O Homem Duplicado. Being deeply rooted in the mythological field and reaching the post-modern times, duplicated individuals have been represented under the most diverse forms the counterparts, the twins, the portrait, the reflection in the mirror and pass through time unveiling the individual and social relationships of each period from the ancient comedies up to the contemporary dramas. With such purpose, this essay will present an introductory research about the concept of myth and its use in the ancient times; then, it will present a research about the double and its diachronic literary evolution. Then the myth of the <b>double</b> <b>will</b> be seen both in the ancient myth of Amphitryon and in the novel by Saramago, with subsequent setting up of the relationships between both works...|$|E
