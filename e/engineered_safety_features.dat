However, the Prevé was only offered with a maximum of four airbags upon its April 2012 Malaysian debut. The maximum of six airbags were only offered upon the Prevé's Australian launch in October 2012. Later on 18 October 2013, Proton released the Prevé LE in its domestic market, offering exactly the same safety specifications as the Australian market Prevé models.

25|$|The updated 2014 Proton Prevé {{was quietly}} {{introduced}} into the Malaysian market in November 2013. All Prevé variants on sale in Malaysia are now equipped standard with all <b>engineered</b> <b>safety</b> <b>features,</b> bringing them up to 5-Star ANCAP specifications and thus placing them on par with the Australian market Proton Prevé. Proton launched a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) variant of the Prevé exclusively for Thailand in early 2014. The Prevé LPG is fitted with a dedicated 58-litre tank in the boot and a fuel gauge module on the dashboard, {{as well as a}} separate inlet inside the petrol filler compartment. Both the CamPro IAFM+ and CFE engines have been modified to run on both LPG and E20 petrol. All other specifications remain unchanged over the launch models, and the Prevé LPG is priced between 664,000 and 798,000 baht, whereas the regular Prevé continues on sale between 625,000 and 759,000 baht respectively.|$|E

40|$|The {{function}} of the <b>engineered</b> <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> ventilation system (ESFVS) {{is to provide a}} suitable and controlled environment for <b>engineered</b> <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> components following certain anticipated transients and design basis accidents. The ASB reviews the ESFVS from air intake to the point of discharge to the atmo-sphere to assure conformance with the requirements of General Design Criteria 2, 4, 5, 17, and 60. The review includes components such as air intakes, ducts, air conditioning units, flow control devices, isolation dampers, exhaust vents, and exhaust fans. The review of the ESFVS covers all ventilation systems utilized to maintain a controlled environment in areas containing safety-related equipment. These include the service water pump house, diesel generator area, emergency core cooling system (ECCS) pump rooms, component cooling water pump room, auxiliary feedwater pump area, and other areas containing equipment essential for the safe shutdown of the reactor or necessary to prevent or mitigate the consequences of an accident. 1. The ASB reviews the ESFVS to determine the safety significance of the various portions and subsystems.

This portion of the protection system is called the <b>engineered</b> <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> actuation system (ESFAS). The ESFAS includes both automatic and manual initiation of these systems. This SRP section also includes the review of-control systems which regulates the operation of ESF systems following their initiation by the protection system. The ESF control systems include both the automatic and manual features which control the operation of ESF systems. The review of instrumentation and control. systems for EAS systems is included in the SRP sections which address these systems. SRP Section 7. 5 includes the information systems important to safety that provide information which is used to indicate the need for manual initiation and for the manual control of ESF systems.

40|$|Following a loss-of-coolant {{accident}} in a {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) plant, the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) will supply water to the reactor vessel to reflood, and thereby cool the reactor core. The core flooding rate is governed by the capability of the ECCS water to displace the steam generated in the reactor vessel during the core reflooding period. For PWR plants, {{there is a direct}} depend-ence of core flooding rate on containment pressure; i. e., the core flooding rate will increase with increasing containment pressure. Therefore, as part of the overall evaluation of ECCS performance, the CSB reviews analyses of the minimum containment pressure that could exist during the period of time until the core is reflooded following a loss-of-coolant accident to confirm the validity of the containment pressure used in ECCS performance capability studies. The CSB reviews the assumptions made regarding the operation of <b>engineered</b> <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> heat removal systems; the effectiveness of Structural heat sinks within the containment to remove energy from the containment atmosphere, and other heat removal processes, such as steam in the containment mixing with ECCS water spilling from the break in the reactor coolant system; {{and in the case of}} ice condenser containments, mixing with water from melted ice that drains into the lower containment volume. The review is done for all PWR containment types, i. e., dry, subatmospheric, and ice condenser containments.

40|$|The areas {{reviewed}} {{in this section}} of the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR) include those instrumentation and control systems-associated with systems used to achieve and maintain a safe shutdown condition of the plant. To the extent that the <b>engineered</b> <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> (ESF) systems are used to achieve and maintain safe shutdown, the review of these systems in this section is limited to those features which are unique to safe shutdown and not directly related to accident mitigation. Such features may involve individual component control for safe shutdown versus sytem level actuation for accident mitigation or system operating modes which involve considerations which differ for safe shutdown and accident mitigation. This SRP section also addresses the review of those systems required for safe shutdown which are not classified as ESF systems. The specific arrangement of these systems depends on the type of plant (pressurized water reactor, PWR; boiling water reactor, BWR; etc.) as well as on individual plant design features, and the conditions under. which the safe shutdown has to be achieved and maintained. The functional performance requirements of safe shut-down systems and essential auxiliary supporting systems are reviewed by other branches in accordance with the SRP sections which address these systems. There are two kinds of shutdown conditions: hot shutdown and cold shutdown. In either case, it is necessary that reactivity control systems maintain a sub-critical condition of the core and that residual heat removal systems operate to maintain adequate cooling of the core. For a precise definition of both shutdown conditions for a specific plant, see Chapter 16, "Technical Specifications, " in the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR).

40|$|The {{quantities}} of positron emitting radionuclides used in medical diagnostics {{and the number}} of radiopharmaceutical production facilities have been estimated to be growing worldwide. In this field, an amount of these radionuclides might become airborne and escape into the environment during the process of production and/or during administration by hospital personnel. Therefore, the analysis of dose to the operating staff {{as well as to the}} public, due to releases through the stack, is a very important issue. To this end, sampling and measurement of radionuclide concentration in air released through the stack of a Nuclear Medicine Center (NMC), provided with a cyclotron for radiopharmaceuticals production, must be routinely carried out with an automatic measurement system. In this work is presented the analysis of the air concentration data recorded in “San Gaetano” NMC at Bagheria (Italy). The contaminated air at stack comes from cyclotron vault during irradiation, from Radiochemistry Laboratories during radiopharmaceuticals synthesis, from diagnostics room during medical scanning and other areas. Sampling of air was carried out continuously and gamma-ray spectrometric measurement are made on-line and for a short time by using a shielded Marinelli beaker filled with sampled air and a gamma detector. The use of this system allows to have 720 values per day from 2002, year of the start of operation with the cyclotron, until 2013. Therefore, the concentration values are very many and an analysis software is needed. The analysis allows either to determine the dose to the population and to evaluate possible improvements in the plant devices to reduce the air concentration at stack. Among <b>engineered</b> <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> actuation systems, the provision of Air Compressing Stations (ACS), used for both hot cells and cyclotron vault releases, and a change in the position and height of the stack allow to ensure low level discharges from the stack and to reduce the dose to reference group of population.
