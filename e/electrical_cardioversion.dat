5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate <b>electrical</b> <b>cardioversion</b> may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{reports have}} {{described}} that hospitalizations for atrial fibrillation (AF) {{are continuing to}} increase. Given that hospitalizations are {{responsible for most of}} the economic burden associated with AF, the aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the impact of age and how changing procedural practices may be contributing to the increasing rates of AF hospitalizations. The annual age- and gender-specific incidence of hospitalizations for AF, <b>electrical</b> <b>cardioversions,</b> electrophysiologic studies, and radiofrequency ablation procedures in Australia were determined from 1993 to 2007 inclusive. Over this 15 -year follow-up period spanning almost 300 million person-years, a total of 473, 501 hospitalizations for AF were identified. There was a relative increase in AF hospitalizations of 203 % over the study period, in contrast to an increase for all hospitalizations of only 71 %. Whereas the gender-specific incidence of hospitalizations remained stable, the age-specific incidence increased significantly over the study period, particularly in older age groups. AF hospitalizations associated with <b>electrical</b> <b>cardioversions</b> decreased from 27 % to 14 % over the study period. Electrophysiologic studies and radiofrequency ablation procedures contributed minimally to the overall increase in AF hospitalizations observed. In conclusion, in addition to the growing prevalence of AF because of the aging population, there is an increasing age-specific incidence of hospitalizations for AF, particularly in older age groups. In contrast, changing procedural trends have contributed minimally to the increasing number of AF-associated hospitalizations. Greater attention to older patients with AF is required to develop strategies to prevent hospitalizations and contain the growing burden on health care systems. Christopher X. Wong, Anthony G.

25|$|AF {{is often}} treated with {{medications}} {{to slow the}} heart rate to a near normal range (known as rate control) or to convert the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm (known as rhythm control). <b>Electrical</b> <b>cardioversion</b> {{can also be used}} to convert AF to a normal sinus rhythm and is often used emergently if the person is unstable. Ablation may prevent recurrence in some people. Depending on the risk of stroke either aspirin or anti-clotting medications such as warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant may be recommended. While these medications reduce this risk, they increase rates of major bleeding.|$|E
25|$|The species {{within the}} {{hymenopteran}} order commonly sting or bite others {{with which they}} interact. After a man was stung by a European hornet, he experienced tingling {{at the site of}} contact, as well as headaches and shortness of breath. In the hospital, he was found to have a fast, irregular heartbeat with a blood pressure of 111/63. His subsequent ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. V. crabro toxin contains neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenalineneurotoxin apamin, as well as enzymes phospholipase A and hyaluronidase, the compound histamine, and proteins melittin and bradykinin. These compounds have been shown to cause tachycardia episodes in smaller animals. The mechanism of this attack is still undetermined, but this man possibly was just more susceptible to vespine stings than other humans.

40|$|Pacing {{prevention}} algorithms {{have been}} introduced {{in order to maximize}} the benefits of atrial pacing in atrial fibrillation prevention. It has been demonstrated that algorithms actually keep overdrive atrial pacing, reduce atrial premature contractions, and prevent short-long atrial cycle phenomenon, with good patient tolerance. However, clinical studies showed inconsistent benefits on clinical endpoints such as atrial fibrillation burden. Factors which may be responsible for neutral results include an already high atrial pacing percentage in conventional DDDR, non-optimal atrial pacing site and deleterious effects of high percentages of apical ventricular pacing. Atrial antitachycardia pacing (ATP) therapies are effective in treating spontaneous atrial tachyarrhythmias, mainly when delivered early after arrhythmia onset and/or on slower tachycardias. Effective ATP therapies may reduce atrial fibrillation burden, but conflicting evidence does exist as regards this issue, probably because current clinical studies may be underpowered to detect such an efficacy. Wide application of atrial ATP may reduce the need for hospitalizations and <b>electrical</b> <b>cardioversions</b> and favorably impact on quality of life. Consistent monitoring of atrial and ventricular rhythm {{as well as that of}} ATP effectiveness may be extremely useful for optimizing device programming and pharmacological therapy.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and/or restoration to sinus rhythm with electric or pharmacologic cardioversion induce modifications to the coagulation system. Thirty-five patients with PAF undergoing either electric (n = 11) or pharmacologic (n = 24) cardioversion were studied. Fibrinopeptide A and D-dimer blood samples were taken immediately before and after cardioversion at different intervals. When compared with the control group (n = 70), the precardioversion fibrinopeptide A plasma values were significantly elevated (11. 8 vs 2. 5 ng/mL). Fibrinopeptide A plasma values were significantly reduced 5 minutes after cardioversion (11. 8 vs 5. 3 ng/mL) and remained stable throughout the follow-up sequential measurements. D-dimer plasma values were significantly increased (measured at 12 hours and at day 7) in patients who underwent <b>electrical</b> <b>cardioversions</b> only. A positive correlation (R 2 = 0. 76) was found between the energy delivered for cardioversion to sinus rhythm and D-dimer plasma values on day 7. In patients with PAF, levels of fibrinopeptide A, an indicator of coagulation activation, are elevated and soon reduced by the restoration of sinus rhythm.

40|$|SUMMARY In this study, we {{describe}} the findings in 18 young patients (age range 4 days to 24 years, mean 16. 6 years) who had ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation and were followed for 4 - 70 months (mean 22. 4 months). Patients had a variety of problems associated with their arrhythmia, including mitral valve prolapse, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, prolonged QT syndrome and hypokalemia. Six patients had no clinically recognizable cardiac abnormality. The ventricular tachycardia showed a left bundle branch block contour in 10 of 17 patients, right bundle branch block in four, was multiform in two and had an indeterminate contour in one. Sustained ventricular tachycardia was initiated and terminated reproducibly by atrial and ven-tricular stimulation in three of seven patients {{who did not have}} spontaneous episodes of ventricular tachycardia during the electrophysiologic study. In one other patient, short bursts of ventricular tachycardia were induced.

40|$|The Author(s) 2011. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at SpringerLink. com Sustained maternal arrhythmias during pregnancy {{that would require}} an electrical intervention are rare. The incidence and mechanisms, {{as well as the}} need for intervention, depend strongly on the background disease of the mother (to be). Electrical intervention may be indicated only with severe symptoms and drug refractory arrhythmias. The two cases of attempted <b>electrical</b> <b>cardioversions</b> (and a concise review of the literature of previous cases) by Tromp et al. reported in this issue of the journal [1] illustrate not only that cardioversion can be done safely but also that this intervention is hardly ever needed in the healthy pregnant patient. In general, maternal arrhythmias are more frequent than expected and may be due to pregnancy-related haemodynamic and autonomic changes. The increase in intravascular volume may lead to stretch of the myocardium and activity of stretch-activated ion channels and hence ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. Likewise, increased adrenergic activity may provoke abnormal automaticity and even re-entry or triggered activity especially in susceptible patients, i. e. those with underlying heart disease. Diagnosis and management of these arrhythmias should take these potential mechanisms into account, especially since in many cases, an electrical intervention will not suffice or may even be futile because of non-shockability of the underlying arrhythmogenic mechanisms. Instead, arrhythmia treatment should in the first place consist of rate control...|$|R

Material and methods. Patients (n= 243) were included into a prospective, comparative, open-label, randomized study with a control. They were divided into 4 groups: Patients of Group 1 (n= 61) received verapamil retard 240 mg/day., Group 2 (n= 62) – propafenone 450 mg/day, group 3 (n= 60) – sotalol 160 mg/day. Patients of control Group 4 (n= 60) did not receive antiarrhythmic drugs.

BACKGROUND Rhythm control is desirable in patients suffering from symptomatic AF. METHODS A total of 144 patients with persistent AF were included. Seventy-four (51 %) patients were randomized to the acute (within 24 h) and 70 (49 %) patients to the routine serial ECVs, and 74 (51 %) patients to verapamil and 70 (49 %) patients to digoxin for rate control before ECV and continued during follow-up (2 X 2 factorial design).
