5|$|None of {{the defence}} {{measures}} {{appear to have}} prevented the final destruction and collapse of the Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in ca. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event {{marked the end of}} Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale. The palace of Pylos, in the southwestern Peloponnese, faced destruction in c. 1180 BC. The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention <b>hasty</b> <b>defence</b> preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in the Middle East, the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion conducted more training in Palestine until April 1941 when it was transported to Mersa Matruh, where the battalion began a year-long period serving in the garrison role. Towards {{the end of this}} period– January 1942– the battalion was reassigned to the 9th Division and moved to Syria where it undertook further garrison duty as part of the Allied occupation force that had been established after the Syria–Lebanon campaign to defend against a possible German attack across the Caucasus Mountains. This came to an end in late June 1942 when the 9th was rushed to El Alamein to help establish a <b>hasty</b> <b>defence</b> line.|$|E
60|$|The general placed {{himself at}} their head. The {{officers}} drew their revolvers. The men {{were instructed to}} use the bayonet only. Then they advanced. The ground is by nature broken and confused to an extraordinary degree. Great rocks, undulations and trees rendered all movements difficult. Frequent tents, sheds and other buildings increased the intricacies. Amidst such surroundings were the enemy, numerous and well armed. The twelve men charged. The tribesmen advanced to meet them. The officers shot down man after man with their pistols. The soldiers bayoneted others. The enemy drew off discomfited, but half the party were killed or wounded. The orderly was shot dead. A sapper and a havildar of the 24th were severely wounded. The general himself {{was struck by a}} sword on the neck. Luckily the weapon turned in his assailant's hand, and only caused a bruise. Captain Holland was shot through the back at close quarters by a man concealed in a tent. The bullet, which caused four wounds, grazed his spine. The party were now too few to effect anything. The survivors halted. Lieutenant Climo took the wounded officer back, and collecting a dozen more men of the 24th, returned to the attack. The second attempt to regain the Quarter Guard was also unsuccessful, and the soldiers recoiled with further loss; but with that undaunted spirit which refuses to admit defeat they continued their efforts, and at the third charge dashed across the open space, bowling over and crushing back the enemy, and the post was recovered. All the ammunition had, however, been carried off by the enemy, and as the expenditure of that night had already been enormous, it was a serious loss. The commissariat lines were at length cleared of the tribesmen, and such of the garrison as could be spared were employed in putting up a <b>hasty</b> <b>defence</b> across the south entrance of the enclosure, and clearing away the cook-houses and other shelters, which might be seized by the enemy.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the <b>hasty</b> <b>defences</b> were well-nigh completed, and all the men were {{employed}} in cutting down the thick brushwood outside, so as to clear the ground as far as possible, and so prevent the enemy from stealing up, under shelter, to the felled trees.|$|R
5000|$|Prior {{to being}} {{known by its}} current name, Orlando was once known as Jernigan. This name {{originates}} from the first permanent settlers, Issac and Aaron Jernigan, cattlemen who acquired land two miles northwest of Fort Gatlin along {{the west end of}} Lake Holden in July 1843 by the terms of the Armed Occupation Act. Aarron Jernigan became Orange County's first State Representative in 1845 but his pleas for additional military protection went unanswered. Fort Gatlin was briefly reoccupied by the military for a few weeks during October and November 1849 and subsequently a volunteer militia was left to defend the settlement. A historical marker indicates that by 1850 the Jernigan homestead (or Fort Gatlin in some sources) served as the nucleus of a village named Jernigan. [...] According to an account written years later by his daughter, at that time, about 80 settlers were forced to shelter for about a year in [...] "a stockade that Aaron Jernigan built {{on the north side of}} Lake Conway". One of the county's first records, a grand jury's report, mentions a stockade where it states homesteaders were ``driven from their homes and forced to huddle together in <b>hasty</b> <b>defences</b> sic." [...] Aaron Jernigan led a local volunteer militia during 1852.|$|R
5|$|On Hill 217 the Fusiliers had {{maintained}} {{the pressure on}} the Chinese throughout the day, however they were still unable to capture the feature. Regardless, the efforts of the Fusiliers in conjunction with A Company's diversionary attack and the rapid advance of D Company with tank and artillery support had carried the day. A Company continued to attack against heavy opposition and indirect fire, slowly pushing the Chinese defenders back. Later, a platoon was detached to assist C Company consolidate the defence of Maryang San following its capture, while the remaining two platoons were withdrawn rearwards, again under heavy artillery fire. Indeed, although it had played a supporting role in the attack, the efforts of A Company had been vital, suffering 20 casualties while killing at least 25 Chinese and capturing two. Now with Maryang San captured the Australians began digging-in, modifying the south-facing linear Chinese trench system into an all-round defensive position with mutually supporting weapons pits. Fully expecting a Chinese counter-attack that evening, Hasset moved the Assault Pioneer Platoon to bolster the <b>hasty</b> <b>defences.</b> Meanwhile, the Chinese still occupied three key ridgeline positions—the 'Sierra' feature, the 'Hinge' and the summit of Hill 317 itself—which they continued to furiously defend. These would be the scene of considerable fighting in the days to come as the Australians attempted to clear them.|$|R

50|$|To {{open the}} Second Battle of Ypres, on 22 April 1915 near St Julien, Belgium, the Germans {{unleashed}} the world's first effective poison gas attack. Caught by surprise, the French division {{to the left}} of the 1st Canadian Division was routed, with heavy casualties. After a short pause to wait for the gas to clear, the Germans launched an attack into the gap, while the British and Canadians desperately tried to establish a new defence line. Thousands of German troops were moving in the open towards the <b>hasty</b> <b>defence</b> created by elements of the 14th Battalion CEF around St. Julien. As the improvised defence crumbled, the enemy were only 200 yards away and threatening to overrun a Canadian artillery battery. Fisher and six other men went forward with a machine gun and, under heavy fire, covered the retreat of the battery, losing four men in the process. This action allowed for the 18 pounders to be hauled out of danger.|$|E
500|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120mm) Mark IX guns {{in single}} mounts. For {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) <b>defence,</b> <b>Hasty</b> had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for [...] torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 {{shortly after the}} war began.|$|R
