5|$|Between the 16th {{century and}} the mid-19th century, Britain saw a large {{increase}} in agricultural productivity and net output. New agricultural practices like enclosure, mechanization, four-field crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients, and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to 5.7 million in 1750, <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> {{a significant percentage of}} the workforce, and thereby helped drive the Industrial Revolution. The productivity of wheat went up from about 19 bushels per acre in 1720 to around 30 bushels by 1840, marking a major turning point in history.|$|E
5|$|Both sides claimed victory {{after the}} battle, with the JNA hailing the {{evacuation}} of the garrison as its greatest success. However, they achieved only part of their objectives; the JNA failed to secure the area surrounding the barracks or remove all the weapons and equipment in it, and the planned coordinated advance against Turanj also failed. Croatian forces failed in their primary objective: containing the garrison. Nonetheless, the JNA threat from the Logorište barracks was removed (<b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> forces assigned to the blockade of the barracks) {{and a large number}} of weapons were captured.|$|E

5|$|Jellicoe {{announced}} that at present loss rates, Britain would be effectively starved into submission by November 1917. After {{a meeting at}} Scapa Flow later in July between Sims, Jellicoe, and Admiral David Beatty (commander of the Grand Fleet), the Admiralty requested that the U.S. Navy send four dreadnoughts and six destroyers to join the Grand Fleet. The Admiralty intended that {{the arrival of the}} American dreadnoughts would allow it to decommission five ships of the pre-dreadnought , <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> four thousand officers and ratings to serve on new light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines then under construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} at Buna {{ended on}} 23 January, <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> aircraft to support Wau, and 52 brand-new Dakotas of the US 317th Troop Carrier Group {{had arrived in}} Australia, their movement from the United States having been expedited in response to urgent requests from General Douglas MacArthur arising from the Buna fighting. After a quick maintenance check, they were flown up to Port Moresby to help the 374th Troop Carrier Group fly the 17th Infantry Brigade into Wau. This meant that up to 40 aircraft were now available daily.|$|E
5|$|Techniques such as {{artificial}} insemination and embryo transfer are frequently used today, {{not only as}} methods to guarantee that females breed regularly but also to help improve herd genetics. This may be done by transplanting embryos from high-quality females into lower-quality surrogate mothers – <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> the higher-quality mother to be reimpregnated. This practice vastly increases the number of offspring which may be produced by a small selection of the best quality parent animals. On one hand, this improves {{the ability of the}} animals to convert feed to meat, milk, or fiber more efficiently, and improve the quality of the final product. On the other, it decreases genetic diversity, increasing the severity of certain disease outbreaks among other risks.|$|E

5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria {{accumulated}} a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, Model {{was sent}} to rescue Army Group Centre, which had been torn apart by Operation Bagration, the Soviet {{offensive}} in Belorussia. The Ninth Army (Model's old command) and Fourth Army were trapped, and the Red Army was about to liberate Minsk. Despite the catastrophic situation, Model believed that he could still hold Minsk, but this would require Fourth Army {{to break out of}} its pocket, and reinforcements to counter-attack the Soviet advance. The reinforcements, in turn, could only be obtained by pulling back, thus shortening the line and <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> troops. The consensus is that the German position was doomed, regardless of what Model could have done, but Hitler refused to sanction either Fourth Army's escape or a general withdrawal, until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 1959, {{the library}} moved to its fifth {{location}} and first permanent home, the former Briarcliff Manor station originally on the New York City & Northern Railroad (later the New York and Putnam Railroad). The station {{had been built}} in 1906 by village founder Walter W. Law in the Tudor Revival style, {{as a replacement for}} a smaller station, which was moved to nearby Millwood. In its later operation as a station, the building was rarely used, and only four trains stopped there each day. Due to the railroad's tracks ending in the Bronx and requiring a transfer to continue on to Manhattan, many Briarcliff Manor residents would drive to Pleasantville or Scarborough, which had stations along lines ending in Manhattan, and more trains ran along those lines. The passenger railroad, then known as the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad, discontinued service in 1958, <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> use of the building for the library.|$|E

5|$|Speculation {{regarding}} {{moves to}} the Premier League came to nothing. By October, Žigić had appeared just once for Valencia, in the UEFA Cup, and an opportunity arose to join his former club, Racing Santander, on an emergency loan. This depended on the league allowing Racing to release Luis Fernández on medical grounds, because of a degenerative condition of his knee, thus <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> a space in the first-team squad. The LFP's medical committee decided that the condition was not yet clearly career-ending, so any agreement with Žigić had to be held over until the January 2009 transfer window. In the meantime, he played in four more cup matches for Valencia, two domestic and two UEFA, and scored in three of them, but took no part in the league campaign.|$|E
5|$|The English {{economy was}} {{fundamentally}} agricultural, depending on growing {{crops such as}} wheat, barley and oats on an open field system, and husbanding sheep, cattle and pigs. In the late Anglo-Saxon period many peasants moved away from living in isolated hamlets and instead came together to form larger villages engaged in arable cultivation. Agricultural land became typically organised around manors, and was divided between some fields that the landowner would manage directly, called demesne land, {{and the majority of}} the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants. These peasants would pay rent to the landowner either through agricultural labour on the lord's demesne fields or through rent in the form of cash and produce. By the 11th century, a market economy was flourishing across much of England, while the eastern and southern towns were heavily involved in international trade. Around 6,000 watermills were built to grind flour, <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> labour for other more productive agricultural tasks.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the old {{characters}} in the Pokémon franchise, Mew's development was not overseen by Ken Sugimori, but by Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto. Morimoto programmed Mew into the game secretly, as a prank amongst the staff just prior to its release in Japan, intending {{it to be a}} Pokémon only Game Freak staff members would know about and be able to obtain. Mew was added {{at the very end of}} the development of Pokémon Red and Blue after the removal of debug features, <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> just enough space to add the character despite being told not to alter the game any further at this point. Though not intended by the developers to be obtainable, due to a glitch, players were able to encounter it.|$|E

5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E
5|$|Instead, Johnson {{was given}} another chance with Chester City, {{with whom he}} trained in the run up {{to the start of}} the 2008–09 season. He scored in a {{friendly}} against an Everton reserve team, but despite the club wanting to sign Johnson, the transfer was put on hold because of the club's salary cap. Johnson had to wait a number of weeks to sign for Chester, after a deal to take Paul Rutherford to Northwich Victoria, <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> money to pay Johnson, failed to go through before the 2008 summer transfer deadline closed. Johnson finally signed for Chester on 15 October, agreeing a two-year contract with his hometown club. His debut came three days later in a home game with Port Vale, with Chester losing 2–1, when he had two opportunities to score and was substituted late in the second half. His first goal for Chester was a consolation goal in a 2–1 defeat to Morecambe on 15 November. He missed four weeks out through injury, which coincided with the club's improvement in form under new manager Mark Wright, until he returned as a last-minute substitute against his former side Bradford City.|$|E
5|$|In {{the century}} {{prior to the}} Norman invasion, England's great estates, owned by the king, bishops, monasteries and thegns, had been slowly broken up as a {{consequence}} of inheritance, wills, marriage settlements or church purchases. Most of the smaller landowning nobility lived on their properties and managed their own estates. The pre-Norman landscape had seen a trend away from isolated hamlets and towards larger villages engaged in arable cultivation in a band running north–south across England. These new villages had adopted an open field system in which fields were divided into small strips of land, individually owned, with crops rotated between the field each year and the local woodlands and other common lands carefully managed. Agricultural land on a manor was divided between some fields that the landowner would manage and cultivate directly, called demesne land, and the majority of the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants, who would pay rent to the landowner either through agricultural labour on the lord's demesne fields or through cash or produce. Around 6,000 watermills of varying power and efficiency had been built in order to grind flour, <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> peasant labour for other more productive agricultural tasks. The early English economy was not a subsistence economy and many crops were grown by peasant farmers for sale to the early English towns.|$|E

5|$|On March 26, 2012, Young {{signed on}} {{a minor league}} deal with the Mets. He had {{recently}} undergone surgery to repair a torn anterior capsule in his right shoulder. He spent the first 33 days of the season on the triple A Buffalo Bisons' disabled list before being activated on May 10. Young subsequently made three starts with the single A St. Lucie Mets on May 11, May 16 and 25 before being promoted back to Buffalo on May 27. He compiled a 1–0 record with 3.18 ERA in 17.0 innings during the three starts. On May 31, he pitched 6 scoreless innings for the Bisons against the Columbus Clippers. The Mets announced on June 4 that they would call Young up to the major league roster on June 5. On June 5, 2012, Young made his return against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park with the Mets, giving up 3 runs (2 earned) over 5 innings {{in a game that}} was eventually decided in 12 innings. On June 6 his wife gave birth and he was placed on a paternity leave, which was not intended to interfere with his June 10 scheduled start. The move was for the purpose of <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> a roster spot during Young's off days under a Major League Baseball rule that allows for a three-day leave. Young made his next start on June 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays, earning his first win in over a year.|$|E
5|$|Women were {{encouraged}} to leave the workforce {{and the creation of}} large families by racially suitable women was promoted through a propaganda campaign. Women received a bronze award—known as the Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter (Cross of Honour of the German Mother)—for giving birth to four children, silver for six and gold for eight or more. Large families received subsidies to help with their utilities, school fees and household expenses. Though the measures led to increases in the birth rate, the number of families having four or more children declined by five percent between 1935 and 1940. Removing women from the workforce did not have the intended effect of <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> jobs for men as women were for the most part employed as domestic servants, weavers or in the food and drink industries—jobs that were not of interest to men. Nazi philosophy prevented large numbers of women from being hired to work in munitions factories in the build-up to the war, so foreign labourers were brought in. After the war started, slave labourers were extensively used. In January 1943, Hitler signed a decree requiring all women under the age of fifty to report for work assignments to help the war effort. Thereafter women were funnelled into agricultural and industrial jobs and by September 1944 14.9 million women were working in munitions production.|$|E
