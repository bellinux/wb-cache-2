For this reason, these activities must be examined in context with other factors in order to determine a terrorism financing connection. Simple transactions can be found to be suspect and money laundering derived from terrorism will typically involve instances in which simple operations had been performed (retail foreign exchange operations, international transfer of funds) revealing links with other countries including FATF blacklisted countries. Some of the customers may have police records, particularly for trafficking in narcotics and weapons and may be linked with foreign terrorist groups.

The case of software as collateral {{in the context of a}} <b>financing</b> <b>transaction</b> brings to the surface the various issues which a lender must face when engaging in an intellectual property-based secured transaction. In the execution of such a transaction, the North-American intellectual property and secured financing legal regimes, currently in place, fail to procure the clear, certain and predictable results desired by lenders. Whether at the initial stage of creation of a security interest on the software or in the final steps of its enforcement, these regimes do not reflect the commercial realities and necessities of the software industry, thereby increasing both challenges and risks for the lender. The problems which the lender must face in the process of a software <b>financing</b> <b>transaction</b> will be examined through three Chapters.

40|$|We {{survey the}} {{empirical}} literature on corporate financial restructuring, including breakup transactions (divestitures, spinoffs, equity carveouts, tracking stocks), leveraged recapitalizations, and leveraged buyouts (LBOs). For each transaction type, we survey techniques, deal <b>financing,</b> <b>transaction</b> volume, valuation effects and {{potential sources of}} restructuring gains. Many breakup transactions {{appear to be a}} response to excessive conglomeration and attempt to reverse a potentially costly diversification discount. The empirical evidence shows that the typical restructuring creates substantial value for shareholders. The value-drivers include elimination of costly cross-subsidizations characterizing internal capital markets, reduction in financing costs for subsidiaries through asset securitization and increased divisional transparency, improved (and more focused) investment programs, reduction in agency costs of free cash flow, implementation of executive compensation schemes with greater pay-performance sensitivity, and increased monitoring by lenders and LBO sponsors. Buyouts after the 1990 s on average create value similar to LBOs of the 1980 s. Recent developments include consortiums of private equity funds (club deals), exits through secondary buyouts (sale to another LBO fund), and evidence of persistence in fund returns. LBO deal financing has evolved toward lower leverage ratios. In Europe, recent deals are financed with less leveraged loans and mezzanine debt and more high-yield debt than before. Future research challenges include integrating analyses across transaction types and financing mixes, and producing unbiased estimates of the expected return from buyout investments in the presence of limited data on portfolio companies that do not return to public status.

40|$|This Essay will {{describe}} synthetic lease financings {{and provide an}} analysis of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these transactions for the acquisition or construction of a power generation facility. During the past two years, several leading players in the power generation industry have used “synthetic” leases to finance both the construction and acquisition of power generation assets, as well as bulk purchases of combustion turbines. Synthetic leases can offer a tax and balance sheet efficient alternative for the acquisition and construction of a power generation facility and related equipment (collectively referred to in this Essay as a “power generation facility”). A synthetic lease (also known by other names such as “off-balance sheet financing” or “tax oriented operating lease”) is a <b>financing</b> <b>transaction</b> structured through a lease that satisfies the requirements for characterization of a lease as an operating lease set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement 13 (“SFAS 13 ”) and related accounting rules. Because a synthetic lease allows a project sponsor to enjoy operating lease accounting treatments and avoid depreciation charges attributable to the leased asset, power producers employing this technique may obtain tangible economic advantages in the current market-driven environment. Synthetic lease financing may also allow a project sponsor greater financial flexibility to participate in a number of large scale projects and equipment purchases while mitigating the adverse credit impact of any particular project or transaction. The execution of synthetic leasing transactions in the power generation industry by leading players during the past two years may encourage others in the industry to consider such innovative approaches...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to discuss}} the {{accounting}} treatment {{of one of the}} most popular instruments of financing in Islamic banks, which is Islamic leasing or Ijarah. This research undertakes an empirical investigation of the accounting practices of Ijarah followed by UAE 2 ̆ 7 s Islamic banks. The main objective of this paper is to compare the accounting practices followed by UAE Islamic banks and accounting practices recommended by Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) for the accounting treatment of Ijarah. Design/methodology/approach - This study also aims to examine the justification and explanation behind this practice and clarify the accounting treatment of Ijarah as defined in the regulatory framework and standards. Findings - The author has found that the accounting treatment of Ijarah practiced by four UAE Islamic banks, it is clear that all of them are following IAS- 17 and not FAS- 8 of AAOIFI. The main difference is: FAS- 8 issued by AAOIFI suggests that the accounting treatment for both Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek be similar to operating lease transactions with certain exceptions. On the other hand, these Islamic banks are accounting for Ijarah as a <b>financing</b> <b>transaction,</b> just like finance lease - in accordance with IAS- 17. Research limitations/implications - Taking out the right information from banks officials regarding Ijarah was a big hassle. Practical implications - After considering the above-mentioned points, according to the researcher, Western accounting standards are not appropriate to be applied in Islamic financial institution because of their different nature and treatment of financial instruments. Therefore, Islamic banks and other Islamic finance professionals should consider making the standards of AAOIFI mandatory, and they should stick to these standards for information disclosure, building investors 2 ̆ 7 confidence, monitoring and surveillance. These standards would also ensure the integration of Islamic financial markets with international markets. Social implications - This study also aims to examine the justification and explanation behind this practice of bankers when the researcher approached these four banks, their officials mentioned that Ijarah contracts are similar to conventional form of financing, and it does not involve the central tenet of Islamic capitalism, i. e. to share risk and profit; therefore, they are justified and convinced to adopt IAS- 17 in accounting for Ijarah transactions. Originality/value - It is an original case study based on secondary research data...|$|E
