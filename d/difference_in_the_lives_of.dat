In 1995, Clay started {{working at the}} YMCA. Still in high school, Clay learned quickly {{that he could make}} a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> young people. He found his interest in special education while directing YMCA children's camps as a teenager, and at age 19, he served as a substitute teacher for a classroom of students with autism at Brentwood Elementary School in Raleigh. It was during that experience that he decided to finish college and become a special education teacher. While attending college in Charlotte, he took a part-time job as an assistant to a boy with autism, and it was this child's mother, Diane Bubel, who urged him to audition for American Idol. Although his American Idol activities temporarily delayed his academic pursuits, Aiken completed his course work while on tour and graduated with a bachelor's degree in special education in December 2003.|$|E

There are significant <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beliefs that squatters with and without land titles declare to hold. Lucky squatters who end up with legal titles report beliefs closer to those that favor the workings of a free market. Examples include materialist and individualist beliefs (such as the belief that money is important for happiness or the belief that one can be successful without the support of a large group). The effects appear large. The value of a (generated) index of "market" beliefs is 20 percent higher for titled squatters than for untitled squatters, in spite of leading otherwise similar <b>lives.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> effect is sufficiently large so as to make the beliefs of the squatters with legal titles broadly comparable to those of the general Buenos Aires population, <b>in</b> spite of <b>the</b> large <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> they lead.

50|$|Scholars {{believe that}} David Copperfield's childhood, career, friendships, and love life were highly {{influenced}} by Dickens' experiences, especially his time {{working in a}} factory as a child. David's involvement with the law profession and later {{his career as a}} writer mirror the experiences of Dickens. Many of David's acquaintances are based on people Dickens actually knew. David's first wife, Dora Spenlow, is believed to be based upon Maria Beadnell, whom Dickens loved in his early youth. David's friend since boyhood and his second wife Agnes Wickfield, the real heroine of the novel, is based on Dickens' sisters-in-law Mary and Georgina Hogarth; both of whom were very close to Dickens. Dickens keenly felt his deprived education during his time at the blacking factory, and according to the authoritative biography by his lifelong friend and literary advisor John Forster, it was from these times that he drew David's working period.However, there are many <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of <b>the</b> two. Unlike Dickens, David grew up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country as an only child; Dickens was a city boy with several brothers and sisters. Also there were never any wicked stepfather or any great aunt.|$|R
