40|$|Based on {{analyses}} of the cognitive-evaluative structure <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> <b>feelings</b> and <b>of</b> the normative context of parent-child-relations, the present study aimed at identifying predictors <b>of</b> parent-related <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> {{in a sample of}} middle-aged children. 300 respondents (daughters and sons) aged 41 to 51 years were enrolled in a questionnaire study. Though, parent-related <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> were rather infrequent on the level of means, substantial interindividual differences were observed. These differences could be predicted from two sets of variables, (1) children’s self-perceived violations of filial obligations and (2) reproachful behaviours on the side of parents. About one fourth of the variance in <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> could be explained. <b>Feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> were particularly frequent in children (in particular daughters) who had little (superficial) contact with their parents, and who avoided conflict with their parents, when – at the same time – parents were rated to be low in subjective well-being, and whose parents lived alone. In addition, <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> were enhanced with an increase in parent’s bossiness, especially when addressed to children scoring low in self-esteem. Results are discussed with respect to additional self-perceived violations of filial obligations and cognitive appraisals of responsibility, that could further improve the prediction <b>of</b> parent-related <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt...</b>|$|R

According to AnimeFringe, Cloud's appearance in Kingdom Hearts w{{as one of the}} things that excited Final Fantasy VII fans the most.

James Mielke of 1UP.com commented that Cloud's guilt over Aerith's death was effective enough to move viewers, but regarded such scenes as [...] "manipulative". Michael Beckett, writing for RPGamer, referred to Cloud overcoming Aerith's death as central to the film, and called his fight sequences [...] "the most creative and impressive scenes". Mielke also described the characters as [...] "beautiful; perfect almost", commenting that Cloud possessed [...] "unbreakably perfect hair". Briana Lawerence of Mania Entertainment, however, listed Cloud second in her article [...] "10 Male Headaches of Anime", criticizing his <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> about Aerith's death. Joystiq's Andrew Yoon opined that the director's cut version of the film provides more depth to Cloud's development, taking advantage of its longer runtime by better [...] "humanizing [...] ". A 2010 GamesRadar article showcasing classic game character redesigns contrasted Cloud's appearances in Advent Children and Final Fantasy VII, stating that the move away from low polygon models necessitated the change, and commenting that Square Enix alters the design with each title he features in. In 2014, IGN held a poll for fans to vote for the most favorite Final Fantasy character of all time, as well as individually in each title. Over 2 million votes were cast in. Cloud ranked number one of all the characters. He also took the same place in the Final Fantasy VII title alone as well.|$|E

Barnes was unusual among Villagers in having been raised with a philosophy of free love, espoused both by her grandmother and her father.

2500|$|Another common {{feeling that}} {{many people who are}} adopted deal with is a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt.</b> This guilt is felt towards both their birth {{families}} as well as their adoptive families. They may feel guilty towards their birth family because in many ways, they have accepted their adoptive family as their own and would not want their birth family to be upset or jealous. Many adoptees call their adoptive parents [...] "mom" [...] and [...] "dad" [...] and refer to adoptive siblings as such, which adoptees feel may hurt their biological families, should they find out. The sense of guilt towards adoptive parents comes from curiosity about biological families. Adoptees often feel that any curiosity about their origins and their birth families may hurt their adoptive one. They believe that the adoptive family will feel a sense of betrayal for wanting to know about where they came from, especially if the adoption allows for access to such information. Adoptees may also fear that their adoptive family may love them less because of their curiosity.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> {{experienced}} by mothers on feelings toward children under three years of age, as well as the effects of depression on mothers’ <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt.</b> Mothers (N ＝ 345) completed a questionnaire.

Furthermore, depressive symptoms in mothers with children between one and three years influenced <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> which in turn negatively influenced feelings toward the child, whereas <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> priority over the child positively influenced feelings toward the child.

40|$|Objective This study {{examines}} {{the prevalence of}} problem behaviour in burn injured children who are 0 – 4 years old. Furthermore, it explores the role of TBSA, gender and age {{of the child and}} <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> <b>of</b> the parents on parental stress symptoms and investigates if there are differences between fathers and mothers in reporting problem behaviour, parental stress and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt.</b> Method Parental stress symptoms were measured with the Impact of Event Scale in a prospective cohort study with a follow up at 3 months. Problem behaviour in children was measured using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) for 1. 5 / 5 years. Results Complete data sets were available from 39 children. Mothers have higher self-reported posttraumatic stress and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and reported more problem behaviour of their child than fathers do. Multiple regression analyses showed no statistically significant effect of TBSA, gender and age of the child on parental stress on 1 and 3 months post-burn. A path analysis of the model of fathers, where stress 3 months post-burn and PTSD in the burn injured children were being used, provides a reasonably well-fitting representation of the data. Conclusions Problem behaviour in children with burns was not more prevalent in this study {{than it is in the}} general Dutch population. Remarkable results were observed in fathers. The bigger the burn, the more <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> a father experienced and the guiltier a father felt, the more PTSD symptoms their child displayed.
