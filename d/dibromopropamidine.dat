40|$|We {{report on}} four {{patients}} seen {{during the past}} two years who had acanthamoeba keratitis. One is described in detail. We believe that acanthamoebic eye infection is not rare. An immunofluorescent technique for localisation of amoebae and cysts is described. Our patients' response to propamidine and <b>dibromopropamidine</b> therapy was complicated by problems of toxicity...|$|E
40|$|A {{previously}} healthy 53 -year-old man had keratitis of {{the right}} eye for six months, unresponsive to topical medical therapy. Acanthamoeba was grown from tissue obtained by corneal biopsy and from aqueous from an anterior chamber tap. The patient was treated with propamidine isethionate 0. 1 % drops and <b>dibromopropamidine</b> isethionate 0. 15 % ointment, and after {{two and a half}} months the ocular inflammation was continuing to resolve. This case supports a role for the diamidines in the treatment of acanthamoebic keratitis...|$|E
40|$|The first medical cure of a corneal {{infection}} {{due to an}} Acanthamoeba {{species is}} reported. The 44 -year-old patient developed a suppurative keratitis associated with an epithelial defect, hypopyon, and secondary glaucoma. Acanthamoeba was confirmed as the causative agent four months after presentation when positive cultures {{were obtained from the}} cornea and from the conjunctiva. Sensitivity studies of the isolated organism were performed, and the infection was successfully controlled by treatment with a combination of <b>dibromopropamidine</b> and propamidine isethionate ointment and drops and neomycin drops. Keratoplasty was performed 22 months after onset, and no viable acanthamoebae were present in the resected tissue, though possible cyst remnants were identified by immunofluorescent techniques...|$|E
40|$|Testosterone (a {{strongly}} hydrophobic steroid) and testosterone hemisuccinate (a {{negatively charged}} deriv-ative) {{were used as}} probes to investigate alterations in the outer membrane of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Diffusion rates of the steroids across the lipid bilayer were measured by coupling the influx of these compounds to their subsequent oxidation by an intracellular D 1 -dehydrogenase enzyme. Wild-type cells of P. aeruginosa (strain PAO 1) {{were found to be}} 25 times more permeable to testosterone than to testosterone hemisuccinate. The uptake of the latter compound appeared to be partially dependent on the external pH, thus suggesting a preferential diffusion of the uncharged protonated form across the cell envelope. Using various PAO mutants, we showed that the permeation of steroids was not affected by overexpression of active efflux systems but was increased up to 5. 5 -fold when the outer membrane contained defective lipopolysaccharides or lacked the major porin OprF. Such alterations in the hydrophobic uptake pathway were not, however, associated with an enhanced permeability of the mutants to the small hydrophilic molecule N,N,N*,N*-tetramethyl-p-phenylene diamine. Thirty-six agents were also assayed for their ability to damage the cell surface of strain PAO 1, using testosterone as a probe. Polymyxins, rBPI 23, chlorhexidine, and <b>dibromopropamidine</b> demonstrated the stron-gest permeabilizing activities on a molar basis in the presence of 1 mM MgCl 2. These amphiphilic polycations increased the transmembrane diffusion of testosterone up to 50 -fold and sensitized the PAO 1 cells to hydro...|$|E
40|$|Combinations {{of either}} {{brodimoprim}} or trimethoprim plus either carbenicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin showed synergy at sub-inhibitory concentrations against both Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 5957 and 775. Brodimoprim alone and in combination showed greater antibacterial activity against both strains of E. faecalis than trimethoprim. MBCs of brodimoprim and trimethoprim were 14. 4 and 25. 6 mg/L for E. faecalis NCTC 5957 and 7. 2 and 12. 8 mg/L for E. faecalis NCTC 775. Combinations of either brodimoprim or trimethoprim plus the other antibacterial agents, except gentamicin and <b>dibromopropamidine</b> isethionate, were bactericidal at achievable plasma concen-trations. Viable count determinations of cultures of both test organisms {{in the presence}} of 3 / 4 of the MIC of each of the four antibiotics and the two antifolates alone and combinations of each antibiotic with either brodimoprim or trimethoprim indicated that only the combinations prevented recovery and regrowth of the cultures over 24 h. The ATP released from cultures of both strains of E. faecalis treated with brodimoprim and tnmethoprim at the same concentrations was approximately 1. 5 times greater with brodimoprim than with trimethoprim. Combinations of 3 / 4 of the MIC of each of the antibiotics in combination with 3 / 4 of the MIC of brodimoprim against cultures of both strains of E. faecalis resulted in greater release of ATP than occurred with equivalent trimethoprim combinations. It is postulated that the increased activities observed with the brodimoprim combinations resulted from an effect of brodimoprim on the bacterial cell permeability control. These results indicate that both brodimoprim and trimethoprim offer potential benefits for use with either carbenicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin for the treatment of E. faecalis infections...|$|E
