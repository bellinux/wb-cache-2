50|$|Starflight, {{the first}} <b>hypersonic</b> <b>transport</b> is being {{prepared}} for a media-covered inaugural flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, a planned two-hour flight. The passengers bring some of their problems on board: the pilot, Cody Briggs (Lee Majors), is unfaithful to his wife Janet (Tess Harper) and {{having an affair with}} the media relations representative for Thornwell Aviation, Erica Hansen (Lauren Hutton). Hal Parisi (Phil Coccoioletti) married another passenger because she won the trip on TV, but he is only interested in getting his stolen gold out of the country. Freddie Barrett (Terry Kiser) is trying to get his communications satellite launched from Australia to start his business carrying television signals. Starflight’s takeoff is delayed a short time so that the deceased Australian ambassador and his wife, Mrs. Winfield, can be taken aboard. Del (Kirk Scott), the first officer, remembers that nothing good happened the last time a corpse came aboard his aircraft. Finally, Josh Gilliam, the designer (Hal Linden), has misgivings, wishing the engines were under ground control.|$|E
50|$|The DASS {{engine is}} a pre-cooled {{combined}} cycle propulsion concept {{that can produce}} thrust {{over a wide range}} of vehicle flight Mach numbers (rest to hypersonic). Derivatives of the engine can be used for propulsion of an SSTO vehicle, long-range missiles, and <b>hypersonic</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft. The engine is being developed with the flexibility for various vehicles and mission profiles. The concept uses existing aerospace technologies, including conventional gas turbine components, and new developments in nanotechnology to overcome some of the key technical obstacles associated with overheating and fuel storage. In high-speed flight, the incoming air has a very high dynamic pressure and aerodynamic deceleration results in a rise in static pressure and temperature. Temperatures can rise above the material limits of the compressor blades in a conventional turbojet. A strategy to alleviate this problem is to place a heat exchanger downstream of the inlet in order to reduce gas temperatures prior to mechanical compression. Similar to the deep-cooled turbojet or the liquefied air cycle engine (LACE), energy extracted from the incoming air in the DASS engine is added back into the system downstream as sensible heat in the fuel stream.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{hypersonic}} literature indicated that a general weight and sizing analysis was not available for <b>hypersonic</b> orbital, <b>transport,</b> and fighter vehicles. The objective here is to develop such a method for the preliminary design of aerospace vehicles. This report describes the developed methodology and provides examples to illustrate the model, entitled the Hypersonic Aerospace Sizing Analysis (HASA). It {{can be used to}} predict the size and weight of hypersonic single-stage and two-stage-to-orbit vehicles and transports, and is also relevant for supersonic transports. HASA is a sizing analysis that determines vehicle length and volume, consistent with body, fuel, structural, and payload weights. The vehicle component weights are obtained from statistical equations for the body, wing, tail, thermal protection system, landing gear, thrust structure, engine, fuel tank, hydraulic system, avionics, electral system, equipment payload, and propellant. Sample size and weight predictions are given for the Space Shuttle orbiter and other proposed vehicles, including four <b>hypersonic</b> <b>transports,</b> a Mach 6 fighter, a supersonic transport (SST), a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicle, a two-stage Space Shuttle with a booster and an orbiter, and two methane-fueled vehicles...|$|R

40|$|The design {{complexity}} {{and size of}} convectively-cooled engine and airframe structures for <b>hypersonic</b> <b>transports</b> necessitate the use of large general purpose computer programs for both thermal and structural analyses.

Differences in these techniques make it difficult to achieve an efficient interface. It appears, therefore, desirable to conduct an integrated analysis based on a common technique.

The cooled airplane studies emphasized weight aspects as related to the choice of materials, structural arrangements, structural temperatures, and matching of the cooling system heat load to the available hydrogen fuel-flow heat sink. Consideration was given to reliability and to fatigue and fracture aspects, as well.

This complex consists of the 16 -foot transonic wind tunnel, the static test facility, and the 16 - by 24 -inch water tunnel research facilities. The 16 -foot transonic tunnel is a single-return atmospheric wind tunnel with a 15. 5 foot diameter test section and a Mach number capability from 0. 20 to 1. 30. The emphasis for research conducted in this research complex is on {{the integration of the}} propulsion system into advanced aircraft concepts.

40|$|Performance in {{the high}} angle of attack regime is {{required}} by {{many different types of}} aircraft. Military aircraft, such as fighters, utilize flight in this regime to improve maneuverability. Civilian aircraft, such as supersonic or <b>hypersonic</b> <b>transports,</b> will also need to operate in this regime during take off and landing, due to their small highly swept wings. Flight at high angles of attack is problematic due to the vortices being created on the nose of the aircraft. The vortices tend to become asymmetric and produce side forces. At the same time, the rudders are less effective because they are becoming immersed in the flow separating from the wings and fuselage. Consequently, the side force produced by the vortices on the nose tend to destabilize the aircraft. This situation may be corrected {{through the use of a}} forebody flow control system such as tangential slot blowing. In this concept, a jet is blown from the nose in an effort to alter the flow field around the nose and diminish the destabilizing side force. Alternately, the jet may be used to create a side force which could be used to augment the rudders. This would allow the size of the rudders to be decreased which would, in turn, diminish the cruise drag. Therefore, the use of a tangential slot blowing system has the potential for improving both the maneuver performance and the cruise performance of an aircraft. The present study was conducted to explore the physics of forebody flow control. The study consisted of two major thrusts: (1) exploration of forebody flow control with tangential slot blowing; (2) investigation of flow and field response to a general perturbation...|$|R

The fundamental differences between {{the effects of a}} pure water-vapor layer and a pure carbon dioxide layer are demonstrated. It is shown that with a water-vapor layer the earth's surface temperature will decrease and, for conditions appropriate for the SST, will change by a few hundredths of a degree. Within the layer, the temperature will increase on the order of one degree. For the HST, the radiative effects are shown to be roughly ten times greater than for the SST...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of developing a}} <b>hypersonic</b> commercial <b>transport</b> (HST) for the early 21 st century is explored in terms of potential performance characteristics and recent advances in propulsion and structures technology. Range-gross weight characteristics indicate that a 200 passenger, Mach 6 aircraft {{with a range of}} 9200 km (5000 n. mi.) would have a gross take-off weight not too different from that of current wide-body subsonic transports. The low cruise sonic boom overpressures generated by the HST opens the {{possibility of}} supersonic overland flight which, if permitted, would greatly increase the attractiveness of this type of aircraft. Recent advances in hypersonic propulsion systems and long-lived hypersonic aircraft structure are also discussed.

The enhancement of the kinetic energy dissipation by the dilatational terms is one of the typical compressibility effects. Zeman (1990) and Sarkar et al. (1991) proposed that the dilatation dissipation is proportional to the solenoidal dissipation and is a function of the turbulent Mach number. Sarkar (1992) also modeled the pressure-dilatation correlation using the turbulent Mach number. Zeman (1991) related the correlation to the rate of change of the pressure variance...|$|E
