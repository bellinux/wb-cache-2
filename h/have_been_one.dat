5|$|A view {{of part of}} Albany, New York, {{as it was in}} 1814 shows {{a mixture}} of Dutch, English and Federal styles, {{although}} Dutch brick was reportedly used for one of the English-style houses. One house in the Dutch style was said to date from the American Revolution. If so, it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the last genuine Dutch-style houses to be built in the United States, reflecting the conservative Dutch culture of Albany at that time.|$|E
5|$|Krugers is {{recorded}} {{as having been}} active in film in the mid-1920s, leading the laboratory at N.V. Java Film. He may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of its founders, together with the Dutchman L.Heuveldorp. The company exclusively produced documentaries until 1926, when Heuveldorp directed the colony's first feature film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng. Krugers served as a cameraman for the film, {{which was based on}} a Sundanese folktale, also processing the film in his laboratory in Bandung.|$|E

5|$|Operationally, the National Hurricane Center {{determined}} if the non-tropical {{low that}} absorbed Nicholas {{developed into a}} tropical or subtropical storm, it would be named Odette. In post-season analysis, the center considered classifying the system as an unnumbered tropical depression, though lack of sufficient characteristics of a tropical depression prevented the classification. If Nicholas had attained hurricane status, it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of eight tropical cyclones to reach hurricane status in October in the deep tropical Atlantic since 1900.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Reuleaux polygons shows that diameter measurements alone cannot verify that an object has a circular cross-section. Overlooking this fact {{may have played}} a role in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, as the roundness of sections of the rocket in that launch was tested only by measuring different diameters, and off-round shapes may cause unusually high stresses that could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the factors causing the disaster.|$|E
5|$|The {{hills in}} the {{locality}} such as Bathampton Down saw human activity from the Mesolithic period. Several Bronze Age round barrows were opened by John Skinner in the 18th century. Solsbury Hill overlooking the current city was an Iron Age hill fort, and the adjacent Bathampton Camp may also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one.</b> A long barrow site {{believed to be}} from the Beaker people was flattened to make way for RAF Charmy Down.|$|E

5|$|The kulintang gong {{itself is}} {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of those foreign musical elements incorporated into kulintang music, derived from the Sundanese kolenang due to its striking similarities. Along {{with the fact that}} they play important roles in their respectively ensembles, both the kulintang and kolenang show striking homogeneity in tapered rims (as opposed to pronouncedly tapered Javanese bonang and non-tapered Laotian khong vong gongs). Even the word kulintang {{is believed to}} be just an altered form of the Sundanese word kolenang.|$|E
5|$|The robbery {{also made}} the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups. Lenin's desire to {{distance}} himself from the legacy of the robbery may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the sources of the rift between him and Bogdanov and Krasin. Stalin distanced himself from Kamo's gang and never publicized his role in the robbery.|$|E
5|$|The {{suicide of}} Nero on 9 June 68 brought the Julio-Claudian dynasty to an end, {{leading to the}} chaotic Year of the Four Emperors, which saw the {{successive}} {{rise and fall of}} the emperors Galba, Otho and Vitellius, until the accession of Vespasian on 21 December 69. Virtually nothing is known of Nerva's whereabouts during 69, but despite the fact that Otho was his brother-in-law, he appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the earliest and strongest supporters of the Flavians.|$|E

5|$|Under {{continuing}} {{pressure from}} Raff, Edison eventually conceded {{to investigate the}} possibility of developing a projection system. He seconded one of his lab's technicians to the Kinetoscope Company to initiate the work, without informing Dickson. Dickson's ultimate discovery of this move appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the central factors leading to his break with Edison that occurred in spring 1895.|$|E
5|$|Aldfrith died {{soon after}} Wilfrid's arrival back in England. The new king, Eadwulf, had been {{considered}} one of Wilfrid's friends, but after his accession to the throne he ordered Wilfrid {{to stay out of}} Northumbria. Eadwulf's reign lasted only a few months however, before he was expelled to make way for Aldfrith's son Osred, to whom Wilfrid acted as spiritual adviser. Wilfrid may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of Osred's chief supporters, along with Oswiu's daughter Abbess Ælfflæd of Whitby, and the nobleman Beornhæth. Once Osred was secure on the throne Wilfrid was restored to Ripon and Hexham in 706. When Bosa of York died, however, Wilfrid did not contest the decision to appoint John of Beverley to York. This appointment meant John's transfer from Hexham, leaving Wilfrid free to perform episcopal functions at Hexham, which he did until his death.|$|E
5|$|At 04:40, HMAS Canberra {{recorded}} {{that the}} Japanese may have fired torpedoes at her. This may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of many false alarms throughout the night. However, M-21 {{had attempted to}} fire its two torpedoes, but failed because of damage to the bow either from HMAS Yandras ramming or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS Chicago, making it possible that M-21 attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes.|$|E

5|$|Back at the front, Potemkin {{won more}} {{military}} acclaim, but then fell ill; rejecting medicine, he recovered only slowly. After {{a lull in}} hostilities in 1772 his movements are unclear, {{but it seems that}} he returned to St. Petersburg where he is recorded, perhaps apocryphally, to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of Catherine's closest advisers. Though Orlov was replaced as her favourite, it was not Potemkin who benefited. Alexander Vasilchikov, another Horse-Guardsman, replaced Orlov as the queen's lover. Potemkin returned to war in 1773 as Lieutenant-General to fight in Silistria. It appears that Catherine missed him, and that Potemkin took a December letter from her as a summons. In any case Potemkin returned to St. Petersburg as a war hero.|$|E
5|$|By the 1330s, Southampton's {{prosperity}} {{was in a}} slow decline. In 1338 {{there was}} a successful French attack on the town, during which various buildings were burned and castle was damaged. The house may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of those damaged in the raid, as the south-western {{corner of the building}} collapsed around that time and had to be quickly rebuilt; other alterations, including the addition of a fireplace, may have been carried out at the same time. Southampton's economy collapsed {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks and never fully recovered. The character of FrenchStreet began to change, as many houses were sub-divided or redeveloped to fit in more buildings. The Medieval Merchant's House ceased to be used by major merchants and by 1392 appears to have been rented out to tenants by Thomas Fryke and John Barflet, the latter a descendent of John Fortin, for whom the house was originally built.|$|E
5|$|Carolingian support may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of {{the factors}} that helped Ecgberht achieve the {{military}} successes of the late 820s. However, the Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed at some time in the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious—the {{first of a series of}} internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. These distractions may have prevented Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.|$|E
