500|$|When not breeding, the Fiji parrotfinch is gregarious, and {{is usually}} found in small flocks of up to six birds. It feeds on seeds, usually at the [...] "milk" [...] (watery ripe) stage. A {{favourite}} is the <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass,</b> Megathyrsus maximus. The finch will also take seed from rice ears, and its spread into gardens has been aided by another preferred food plant, carpet grass, Axonopus compressus, which is a common lawn grass in Fiji. This finch readily takes insects, often extracted from under loose bark or tree crevices. It also feeds on nectar and small berries. In some areas, this finch's diet may bring it into conflict with rice growers, {{but there is no}} evidence that this protected species is seen as a serious agricultural threat either in Fiji, or in Australia, where it is kept in captivity in small numbers.|$|E

30|$|In vitro {{data were}} only {{reported}} by Regan (2000) and Juárez Reyes et al. (2009). Regan (2000) {{reported that in}} northern Australia bale silage was prepared from wilted pasture with pangola grass (Digitaria eriantha subsp. eriantha) and two legumes, namely cavalcade centurion (Centrosema pascuorum) and wynn cassia (Chamaecrista rotundifolia). The DM content of the silages made from the wilted plants ranged from 42 – 57 %, the in vitro digestibility from 55.0 - 58.0 % and the estimated metabolizable energy concentration from 8.5 - 9.0  MJ/kg DM. Juárez Reyes et al.

40|$|Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) and Chilo orichalcociliellus Strand (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) are gramineous stem borers {{that occur}} sympatrically in the {{southern}} coastal area of Kenya. Evidence over a 30 -yr period indicates that the indigenous stem borer, C. orichalcociliellus, is being gradually displaced by the exotic stem borer, C. partellus. Comparative laboratory studies were conducted in several large-stemmed grasses to examine factors that {{may be involved in}} the displacement of C. orichalcociliellus, and to examine other possible effects of the invasion of C. partellus into Kenya. C. partellus had a higher fecundity than C. orichalcociliellus at 25 and 28 °C, but not at 31 °C. In addition, more C. partellus than C. orichalcociliellus eggs survived to the first instar. C. partellus larvae developed faster than C. orichalcociliellus in maize and sorghum. In this shorter developmental time, C. partellus consumed more maize than C. orichalcociliellus, but both species consumed equal amounts of sorghum. On a daily basis, C. partellus consumed more maize and sorghum than C. orichalcociliellus. A few C. orichalcociliellus survived to the pupal stage in napier and <b>guinea</b> <b>grasses,</b> whereas no C. partellus survived. The shorter developmental period of C. partellus may give this species a competitive advantage over the slower developing C. orichalcociliellus. However, the ability of C. orichalcociliellus to complete development in two native grasses in which C. partellus did not survive may provide a refuge that has allowed C. orichalcociliellus to escape extirpation from the coastal area of Kenya...|$|R

P. phaseoloides often shows a high palatability compared to tropical grasses and hence under high grazing pressure it can disappear.

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in Borgou department (northern Benin) to characterize Guinea fowl production systems in rural areas. A questionnaire was administered to 70 Guinea fowl keepers in order to collect information about Guinea fowl management and husbandry practices in the region. This activity was practised according to traditional management in Benin where free range {{is the most common}} system of rearing. Birds scavenged during the day while at night, keets and surrogate hens were housed in poor, cramped coops whereas adult Guinea fowls roosted on trees. No rational feeding system was practised. <b>Guinea</b> fowls gleaned <b>grass</b> seeds, vegetable leaves, insects, worms, bones and eggshells. Poultry received a supplement consisting of cereals and their by-products, e. g. sorghum (30. 4 %), maize (25. 0 %), rice (14. 3 %), maize bran (7. 1 %), kitchen waste (5. 4 %), sorghum bran (3. 6 %), millet (1. 8 %) and complete food (1. 8 %). Adult body weight was 1121. 3 ± 100. 2 g at 6 months and maximum growth rate of 10. 2 g/day was reached at four months. Point-of-lay was between 7 and 9 months. Local hens were used to incubate Guinea fowl eggs, and hatchability was 72. 9 %. The survey revealed that Guinea fowl productivity is low because of high keet mortality. Average keet mortality registered from 0 to 6 months was 48 % (range 3 to 100 %). Moreover, 74 % of interviewed farmers reported that keet mortality constituted the major constraint to Guinea fowl rearing. Others reported constraints, included keet weakness, poor quality of eggs, egg losses hidden under brush, keets predation, poor housing and infestations. The size of the keet populations varied over the year with the highest proportion in June-July while the proportion of growers increased from September to January. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Ruminants in {{the tropics}} are slow growing, arising from low quality feed. The use of {{indigenous}} legume trees and <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass</b> is a good strategy for an improved livestock performance. The nutrient composition and secondary metabolites of differently year of established Tephrosia candida leaf were determined. The mixtures of Tephrosia candida leaf and <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass</b> as treatments A (100 % Tephrosia + 0 % <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass),</b> B (75 % Tephrosia + 25 <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass),</b> C (50 % Tephrosia + 50 % <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass),</b> D (25 % Tephrosia + 75 % <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass)</b> and E (0 % Tephrosia + 100 % <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass)</b> were incubated for in vitro gas production for 24 hours. The total gas (ml/ 200 mg DM) at post incubation was measured. Methane (mmol/ 200 mg DM) was evaluated by introducing 10 M NaOH into the content. Metabolizable energy (MJ/Kg DM) and organic matter digestibility (%) were calculated. Results showed that the crude protein (g/ 100 g DM) ranged between 19. 33 and 23. 18 while neutral detergent fibre (g/ 100 g DM) ranged from 25 – 32. The Tephrosia forages contained condensed tannin and steroids. The inclusion levels of the legume apparently increased the total gas production (range 1 – 6), metabolizable energy (range 2. 99 – 4. 75), organic matter digestibility (range 21. 46 – 33. 80) and methane (29. 30 – 234). It is concluded that Tephrosia candida forage {{may be a good}} combination with <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass</b> for livestock production but may be higher than 50 % inclusion in order to minimize energy loss through methane...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} the ensiling characteristics of silages prepared from <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass,</b> Stylo legume or Stylo legume mixed with <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass</b> (50 : 50 w/w). <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass</b> and Stylo legume were harvested 45 and 60 days after regrowth, respectively and treated with a fermented juice of lactic acid bacteria (FJLB) prior to being ensiled. After 45 days, selected ensiling characteristics were determined. The nutritive value of rations based on the experimental silages was evaluated using six male, rumen cannulated crossbred Anglo Nubian × Native goats in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design study. Concentrate was provided at 0. 9 % body weight and experimental silages ad libitum. Apparent fecal macronutrient digestibility was determined. The pH values, NH 3 -N and lactic acid contents were not different between the silages but greater contents (P < 0. 05) of acetic and butyric acid were found in the silage prepared from <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass.</b> Voluntary silage intake was similar for the three silages. Digestibility of dry and organic matter did not differ between treatments. However, the digestibility of crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber was greater (P < 0. 05) when the rations contained silage from Stylo legume instead of <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass.</b> In conclusion, the process of fermentation of silages is similar for Stylo legume and <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass.</b> The feeding of rations based on silage from Stylo legume versus <b>Guinea</b> <b>grass</b> can enhance animal production due to its higher nutritive value...|$|E
