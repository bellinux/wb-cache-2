50|$|The {{brake light}} {{operated}} {{only by the}} rear brake in the UK market. A switch was available as a spare part to fit onto the front brake master cylinder casting which would also operate the brake light. The necessary wiring was already included on the main wiring harness in the <b>headlamp</b> <b>shell.</b> Sales were 14,000+ in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|The USA {{machines}} usually came standard with a trip-meter {{and minimal}} AC lighting, with a speedometer as an option, whereas PE's in Australia and Belgium (for example) had speedometers, stop lights, horn, 6V DC battery and charging system to suit, by law. The UK machines {{did not have}} indicators or battery; however these did come with an AC horn. The lighting requirements varied across years and countries, so a PE in the UK, South Africa or France might have substantially different rear tail-lights and mounting assemblies {{to those in the}} USA. The French PE's (for example) continued to use the PE250B style <b>headlamp</b> <b>shell,</b> with a parking light and a yellow globe insert, due to local regulations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1956 and named the TR6 Trophy-bird, borrowing {{its name from the}} Thunderbird model. The model used the same engine as the T110, but with the new [...] "Delta" [...] alloy cylinder head. The cast iron barrel was retained, but painted silver. The engine used 8.5:1 compression ratio and developed 42 bhp. The power delivery made the mount ideal for off-road competition, for which the model is well known. The bike sported a 'siamese' (two-into-one) exhaust system and a 7-inch front brake. Another feature taken from the TR5 was the quick-detachable headlamp, which was ideal for bikes ridden to competitive events and back again. This used a multipin connector which plugged {{into the bottom of the}} <b>headlamp</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E
50|$|The D1 (the {{original}} model) 125cc {{was available}} initially {{only with a}} rigid rear suspension, although within three years the range was enhanced to include an optional plunger rear suspension. The front suspension of all D1's possessed no damping and resulted in a bouncy ride quality.D1's were available {{with a variety of}} electrical lighting systems. Wipac systems were available either in 6v AC (known as direct lighting) or DC. The AC system used a small dry 'torch' cell battery to illuminate the forward facing 'pilot' bulb within the <b>headlamp</b> <b>shell,</b> the remaining lighting was only available for use when the engine was running and the dry cell had to be regularly replaced. The DC system incorporated a lead acid battery and operated in a conventional manner. For a short period some D1's were equipped with Lucas lighting systems and these operated in a similar manner to the Wipac DC system. The D1 continued to be available to the public right up until 1963 and was still produced for the GPO (General Post Office) for at least 2 more years.|$|E
50|$|Saurer F007: Simultaneously {{with the}} Saurer F006 the Saurer F007 was {{introduced}} in 1980 as a Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle with similar versions available to the public. The F007 uses the same chassis and the same drive unit as the F006, however, unlike the F006 {{it does not have}} the cab behind the engine, but instead the engine compartment is internally located (as with many vans). It is therefore called a cab. Unlike the F006 the F007 has three windshield wiper blades instead of two, four headlights instead of two, and the front parking lights and turn signals are housed in the same <b>headlamp</b> <b>shell.</b> The gasoline tank filler neck is on the left side immediately behind the driver's door, and not as in the F006 on the right side between the rear and the rear wheel. The vehicle has a fixed cab which is open to the rear. The cargo area, passenger space is covered with a plastic sheet, including two plastic windows on each side. Again, this was based on the concept of the cab-over model 260 F by Monteverdi. For Swiss Army procurement, starting from 1982, SUV's in addition to dedicated military vehicles were prepared for testing. Here, too, the Swiss Army examined and appreciated the high-road tested prototypes of the F007, but did not buy the vehicle. The existing Saurer F007's are now privately owned.|$|E
