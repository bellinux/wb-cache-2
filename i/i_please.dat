He said at the time, [...] "I am sick and tired of being sold without gaining anything by it, and it is about time that my bank account was benefited by these transfers." [...] He told a reporter for The New York Times that he was not penniless and would refuse to play unless his demands were met.

500|$|I, the Supreme (orig. Spanish Yo el supremo) is a {{historical}} novel written by exiled Paraguayan author Augusto Roa Bastos. It is a fictionalized account of the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, who was also known as [...] "Dr. Francia." [...] The book's title derives {{from the fact that}} Francia referred to himself as [...] "El Supremo" [...] or [...] "the Supreme." [...] The first {{in a long line of}} dictators, the Supreme was a severe, calculating despot. [...] The central themes of the novel are power and language and the relation between the two. [...] The Supreme believes himself to be above all power and history: [...] "I don't write history. I make it. I can remake it as <b>I</b> <b>please,</b> adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth." [...] Yet this assertion is constantly challenged by the very fact that while he achieves power by means of writing and dictating, these very same methods can be used by others to dispute his authority. Not even his own identity, represented by the personal pronoun I, is safe and can easily be usurped as is demonstrated by the incident of the pasquinade. Language, as powerful as it is, can never be controlled and can just as easily be used as an instrument of coercion as an instrument of resistance.|$|E
500|$|The novel's format, {{its various}} {{multiple}} sources, its manipulation of linear time and its inclusion of supernatural elements (talking dogs and meteor rifles, for example) all serve to deconstruct {{the idea of}} absolute power, by creating an ambiguity between fact and myth, between Dr Francia and the Supreme, and between Roa Bastos and the Compiler. Francia places himself above all power and history: [...] "I don't write history. I make it. I can remake it as <b>I</b> <b>please,</b> adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth." [...] Yet in the Compiler's notes and retelling of events, the novel {{is presented as a}} genuine version of history, one that contradicts and questions the Supreme's. In their collectivity, they deny the illusion of absolute power, whether the power is that of Francia the dictator or Roa Bastos the writer. This ambiguity between myth and fact is elaborated on {{at the end of the}} novel in the fictional debate over the Supreme's remains; it questions the nature of national political myth, and how heroes and villains are created in it and where the Supreme falls into those categories after being portrayed as both by Roa Bastos. As Deiner poses the question raised by the novel, [...] "Is he to be portrayed as a valiant leader who held the country together in the face of enormous external aggression, or as a despot who laid the basis for almost two centuries of exploitation of Paraguay’s peoples by its leaders?" [...] The answer is not so much of importance to the novel, so much as the fact that the question itself exists, thereby confirming the power of writing over so called [...] "absolute" [...] power.|$|E

Buddicom recalls him swinging from the luggage rack in a railway carriage like an orangutan to frighten a woman passenger out of the compartment. At Eton he played tricks on John Crace, his Master in College, among which was to enter a spoof advertisement in a College magazine implying pederasty. Gow, his tutor, said he [...] "made himself as big a nuisance as he could" [...] and [...] "was a very unattractive boy". Later Blair was expelled from the crammer at Southwold for sending a dead rat as a birthday present to the town surveyor.

He followed the last book with a fourteen-part series in True West magazine titled Wyatt Earp, Legendary American. Boyer responded to continuing questions about his sources and allegations of fraud, claiming that because of his close connection to the [...] Earp family, he [...] "had a license to say any darned thing <b>I</b> <b>please</b> for the purpose [...] of protecting the reputation of the Earp Boys, which I committed myself to do.

Impersonating Elizabeth II, Greig said: [...] "Oh hello there, could <b>I</b> <b>please</b> speak to Kate please, my granddaughter." [...] Saldanha responded, [...] "Oh yes. Hold on," [...] and transferred the call to the Duchess's nurse, who spent approximately two minutes speaking with Greig as well as Christian, the latter impersonating Prince Charles.

Surely, this sacrifice of time and inclination requires some compensation, which it meets with. But how am I entitled to make my fortune (which cannot be done without all this anxiety and drudgery) who do hardly any thing at all, and never any thing but what I like to do?

2500|$|In 1994, other Western {{researchers}} and rival authors of new Earp books identified alleged discrepancies {{in the book}} and began to challenge the authenticity of what they called the [...] "Clum manuscript". They also claimed to have identified factual errors and inconsistencies in other books published by Boyer, leading to an increasing number of questions about the veracity of his work. The risque cover image was linked to a photogravure titled Kaloma that had been first published by a novelty company in 1914. [...] A 1998 investigative article in the Phoenix New Times revealed that Boyer could not prove the Clum manuscript existed and refused to allow the reporter access to the source documentation. [...] The article also disclosed that the university press' editor encouraged Boyer to embellish the account. During the interview, Boyer said that he had a responsibility to protect the reputation of the Earp brothers, and that he [...] "had a license to say any darned thing <b>I</b> <b>please...</b> lie, cheat, and steal."
