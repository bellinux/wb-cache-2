In young chickens, severe respiratory distress may occur. In layers, respiratory distress, nephritis, decrease in egg production, and loss of internal (watery egg white) and external (fragile, soft, irregular or rough shells, shell-less) egg quality are reported.|$|E

5000|$|Bordetella bronchiseptica is a small, Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} bacterium of {{the genus}} Bordetella. It can cause <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> in dogs and other animals, [...] but rarely infects humans. Closely related to B. pertussis - the obligate human pathogen that causes pertussis (whooping cough); B. bronchiseptica can persist in the environment for extended periods.|$|E
5000|$|When inhaled, virus will {{attach to}} {{glycoprotein}} receptors containing sialic acid on ciliated epithelial {{cells of the}} respiratory epithelium. The respiratory replication will result in loss of ciliary activity, [...] mucus accumulation, necrosis and desquamation, causing respiratory distress, r√¢les and asphyxia. Local virus replication will result in viremia, spreading the infection into other tissues and organs. Other respiratory diseases of chickens (Mycoplasma gallisepticum, avian infectious laryngotracheitis (Gallid herpesvirus 1), Newcastle disease (Avian Paramyxovirus1), avian metapneumovirus infection may be confused clinically to <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a chicken coop is to protect {{chickens}} from bad weather - heat, cold, wind and rain and secure them from predators. One method to protect chickens is to put an isolation material between two layers of wood or bricks. Because chickens don't like heat, windows should be oriented {{in such a way}} as to prevent overheating. Proper ventilation is also important to protect the chickens from overheating and <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> Another purpose for chicken coops is to protect the hens from predators--especially foxes and cats. The hens can be released outside by daylight but should be locked in a coop at night.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife rehabilitators {{should be}} careful to not misdiagnose M. gallisepticum {{infection}} with other diseases with similar clinical signs, such as avian influenza, chlamydiosis, Newcastle disease, <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> head trauma, and avian pox virus. M. gallisepticum can be treated with antibiotics such as tylosin, tetracycline, or oral enrofloxacin with ophthalmic gentamicin. These are given through food, water or injections. Especially tylosin gives good results in the feed. However, treated birds must be kept in captivity and isolation {{for a long time}} period because birds may become asymptomatic carriers. At this point, {{it is very difficult to}} verify if previously infected birds are still infected with M. gallisepticum. Treatment and release is not wise for disease control in wild populations.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{attenuated}} vaccine, live virus or bacteria {{with very}} low virulence are administered. They will replicate, but locally or very slowly. Since they do reproduce {{and continue to}} present antigen to the immune system beyond the initial vaccination, boosters may be required less often. These vaccines may be produced by passaging, for example, adapting a virus into different host cell cultures, such as in animals, or at suboptimal temperatures, allowing selection of less virulent strains, or by mutagenesis or targeted deletions in genes required for virulence. There is a small risk of reversion to virulence, which is smaller in vaccines with deletions. Attenuated vaccines also cannot be used by immunocompromised individuals. Reversions of virulence were described for a few attenuated viruses of chickens (infectious bursal disease virus, avian <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> virus, avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.03_AVIAN_INF_LARYNGO.pdf, avian metapneumovirus http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.15_TURKEY_RHINO.pdf) ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> is {{an acute}} viral disease with high {{contagious}} and mortality among chicks. The {{aim of this}} study was to survey of relation between ascites syndrome incidence and <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> in broiler chickens by ELISA method in Iran. Eight Ross strain broiler farm affected by <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> were selected in this study. Blood samples were gathered early stages of disease and blood sampling was repeated two times with seven days interval. ELISA serologic test was used for approving the determination of <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> In addition, in order to differential diagnosis of Newcastle and influenza (H 9 N 2) some relevant experiments were conducted. The rate of mortality in any farm during rearing, autopsy and the cause of mortality were recorded. Ascites cases were calculated in terms of prevalence. The growth parameters, FCR, final weight, total consumption of grain at each farm were calculated and mentioned. Based on obtained results in this study, the mean rate of mortality caused by ascites syndrome has been increased meaningfully in herds affected by <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> compared with control group. In eight understudied farms affected by <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> the mean rate of Ascites mortality was 3 % such that the mean rate of Ascites mortality was 0. 5 % at previous periods. Based on relevant results also final weight mean in affected herds with <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was lower compared with previous periods. Meanwhile, FCR in affected herds with <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was high compared with healthy herds.

40|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>Bronchitis</b> is {{an acute}} and highly {{contagious}} viral respiratory disease of chickens characterized by gasping, coughing, tracheal rales and nasal discharge. Infected chickens have congestion in trachea and lungs with caseous exudates exudates in the trachea in post mortem examination. Ascites syndrome {{is a significant}} cause of mortality in broiler chickens. Gross lesions of this syndrome are cardiac enlargement, hydropericard and ascites. <b>Infectious</b> <b>Bronchitis</b> virus induces repiratory damage and causes ascites in broilers. In this study eight broiler farms that were infected to <b>infectious</b> <b>Bronchitis</b> selected. Blood samples were collected {{at the onset of}} infection and ELISA Test was applied for confirmation of <b>infectious</b> <b>Bronchitis.</b> In each farm autopsy was applied, causes of mortality recorded and also feed conversion ratio, total weight and feed consumption were calculated. The percentage of ascites mortality in chickens that were infected to <b>infectious</b> <b>Bronchitis</b> increased significantly than the control chickens. In eight <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> infected famrs, percentage ascites mortality was 3 % and in non-infected chickens was 0. 5 %. Total weight in infected (IB) chickens was significantly lower than in healthy chickens. Feed conversion ratio in infected chickens was higher than healthy chickens.
