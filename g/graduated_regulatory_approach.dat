40|$|In this study, {{we compare}} and {{contrast}} the U.

In Korea, there is an existing regulatory framework with suggestive guidelines {{that can be used to}} address net neutrality in a case-bycase fashion. The U. S. follows a <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach</b> by creating enforceable nondiscrimination rules. Our findings suggest that the issue is not only complicated, but also as complex and vague as the parties' diverse interests are. We conclude that a careful combination of government coordination and market forces is an effective way to govern net neutrality...|$|R

I contend, however, that definitions of harmful work must be appropriate to local contexts and informed by working children's views. I support this with {{a case study of}} a village in Ethiopia where the current abolitionist approach is overly restrictive. However, a <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach</b> based on international definitions of harmful work would probably not protect children in the case study village against some harmful work. Children and parents in the village are able to define harmful work more precisely than international definitions, suggesting that locally specific definitions developed with working children should form the basis of regulatory legislation.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach</b> that {{implements}} capital requirements contingent on executive incentive schemes. We argue that excessive risk-taking {{in the financial}} sector originates from the shareholder moral hazard created by government guarantees rather than from corporate governance failures within banks. The idea behind the proposed <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach</b> is thus that the more the compensation structure decouples the interests of bank managers from those of shareholders by curbing risk-taking incentives, the higher the leverage the bank is permitted to take on. Consequently, the risk-shifting incentives caused by government guarantees and the risk-mitigating incentives created by the compensation structure offset each other such that the manager chooses the socially efficient investment policy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some of {{the challenges}} associated with development of an airworthiness regulatory framework for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). The risk paradigm and a simple model describing the regulatory trade-space are developed. The model is used to explain fundamental differences between the regulation of manned and unmanned aircraft. General challenges are presented and the possible <b>regulatory</b> <b>approaches</b> are discussed. Moving forward, it is concluded {{that the development of}} an effective airworthiness regulatory framework for UAS should follow a systematic and risk-based process of: 1) specifying safety policy and the safety objectives, 2) developing an airworthiness classification framework, and 3) identifying a <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach</b> suitable to each airworthiness category.

40|$|Do {{employers}} invest sufficiently in {{the working}} conditions of employees? We examine this question in a simple principal-agent model. We show that, even though investment is contractible, the principal underinvests whenever her agent's alternatives are rather poor. This provides a reason for regulation. The indirect <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach</b> of taking measures that improve the agent's bargaining power or outside option at least weakly enhances the agent's well-being and welfare. The direct <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach</b> of demanding a certain standard of working conditions increases the principal's investment, but may nonetheless leave the agent's well-being unaffected and deteriorate welfare. This holds true since due to a standard, the principal may provide the agent with a lower-powered incentive scheme and implement a lower effort level...|$|R
40|$|In {{the work}} of the Basel Committee there has been a {{tradition}} of distinguishing market from credit risk and to treat both categories in-dependently in the calculation of risk capital. In practice positions in a portfolio depend simultaneously on both market and credit risk factors. In this case, an approximation of the portfolio value function splitting value changes into a pure market risk plus pure credit risk component can lead to underestimation of risk. It can therefore not be argued that the current <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach</b> would always be conser-vative from a risk assessment perspective. We discuss this fact in the context of foreign currency loans and argue that under the traditional <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach</b> the true risk of a portfolio of foreign currency loans would be significantly underestimated...|$|R

40|$|The current {{financial}} and sovereign crisis is pushing European politicians and EU bureaucrats to devise new institutional and policy solutions. However, the new EU institutional framework and stricter regulatory requirements do not introduce {{significant changes in}} the laissez-faire nature of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach.</b> Our opinion is that the entire re-regulation process does not go to the roots of how financial fragility endogenously accumulates, and how finally it produces a crisis each time starting from the weakest part of the financial system. Analysing the European banking sectors from this perspective, we show how domestic specificities add to the limits due to risk-based regulation and supervision. We then build on Minsky’s regulatory proposals to present the skeleton of a simple alternative to the existing <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{evaluating}} current {{environmental protection}} policy, economists often note that current regulations are more costly than necessary to meet environmental quality standards. While the a priori case is strong that current <b>regulatory</b> <b>approaches</b> are resulting in higher-than-necessary costs to attain environmental standards, there is relatively little empirical {{evidence to support}} this claim. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to supply some of the missing evidence by presenting the results of one study that assesses some of the potential savings associated with implementing economic, rather than command-and-control, <b>regulatory</b> <b>approaches</b> to abate one type of air pollution in one region of the country. Specifically, the paper examines the costs of meeting a prospective short-term standard for nitrogen dioxide under a range of alternative emissions control strategies for stationary sources of nitrogen oxide emissions in the Chicago Air Quality Control Region. The alternative strategies that are considered range from those that might result under current regulatory policy to those that economic policy approaches (such as emissions charges or marketable permits) are designed to implement. The analysis shows that the most efficient program of emissions controls may be more than an order of magnitude less costly than current regulatory strategies, and that economic approaches have additional advantages over more conventional <b>regulatory</b> <b>approaches.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationships between governance structures and <b>regulatory</b> <b>approaches.</b> It develops a typology to explain and fine-tune supranational regulatory models for the governance of markets. The article suggests, firstly, a range of regulatory options which are defined according to two dimensions: (a) the degree of centralization of regulation, which includes networks, meta-organizations, and single central authorities; and (b) the degree of invasiveness of regulation, which ranges from sunshine regulation to command and control approaches. The aim is to relate structural alternatives (considered in terms of centralization) to <b>regulatory</b> <b>approaches</b> (considered in terms of invasiveness). The typology here constructed is applied to analyse the governance structure of EU competition law. Secondly, the article focuses on the recent structural changes reshaping the governance of European financial markets. The reform is discussed {{through the lens of}} the typology. It appears that, differently from what was observed in the EU competition law model, the newly established European Supervisory Agencies (ESAs) are part of a complex structural development, in which the separation between a highly invasive <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach</b> and a decentralised supervisory structure adds further complexity. The article concludes by noting a set of possible normative implications, suggested by the typology, to ensure a consistent governance model for financial markets regulation and supervision in the EU. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{development}} of financial reform in Australia, focusing primarily on the past twenty years. In this period the <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach,</b> <b>regulatory</b> institutions, and the financial system itself have undergone massive change. It is argued that the financial deregulation of the 1970 s and 1980 s, was founded on an inadequate vision of {{the workings of the}} financial system and financial institutions-one which paid inadequate attention to sources of market failure and agency problems involving financial institutions. Subsequent reform has focused on the need to ensure that there are appropriate incentives and accountability for market participants, together with adequate disclosure and transparency, and on the search for a suitable design for the regulatory infrastructure. While the practice of financial regulation in Australia generally correlates quite closely with “best practice / core principles” articulated by international bodies, there remain some key areas of difference and some characteristics of the Australian <b>regulatory</b> <b>approach</b> make it significantly different from other national approaches...|$|R
