5|$|Forster had a {{successful}} 2011–12 season with Celtic, winning the Scottish Premier League and helping his team beat the previous season's record of 23 clean sheets. He and Załuska kept 25 clean sheets combined, Forster racking up 21 of them. In December 2011, Hearts were awarded a controversial penalty {{in the final minute}} of a league match at Parkhead, with Celtic leading 1–0. Forster, however, pulled off an excellent save from Eggert Jonsson's penalty kick to secure three <b>important</b> <b>points</b> for Celtic. In total, he kept 26 clean sheets from 47 matches that season.|$|E
5|$|Supporters {{said that}} the {{publication}} of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of free speech regardless of the validity of the expression, {{that it was important to}} openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made <b>important</b> <b>points</b> about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June 2013, Sheridan {{signed a}} one-year contract, with {{the option of}} a further season with APOEL from Cyprus. He made his {{official}} debut on 17 August 2013 against Apollon Limassol in the Cypriot Super Cup final, in a match which APOEL won 1–0 and lifted the trophy. He scored his first official goal for APOEL on 7 December 2013, in his team's 2–0 away win against Ethnikos Achna for the Cypriot First Division. On 8 January 2014, he scored the only goal in APOEL's 1–0 home victory against AEL Limassol for that season's Cypriot Cup. On 5 February 2014, he gave his team the three <b>important</b> <b>points</b> after scoring the winning goal against Anorthosis in APOEL's 2–1 away win. On 29 March 2014, he scored the second goal of the match against Apollon Limassol, in APOEL's 3–0 home win for the Cypriot First Division play-offs. On 21 May 2014, Sheridan scored APOEL's second goal in the Cypriot Cup final against Ermis Aradippou and helped his team to lift the trophy after a 2–0 win. On 31 May 2014, Sheridan gave APOEL their 23rd Cypriot First Division title after scoring the only goal in the title decider match against AEL Limassol.|$|E

5|$|It is archaeologically {{difficult}} to distinguish Diocletian's fortifications from those of his successors and predecessors. The Devil's Dyke, for example, the Danubian earthworks traditionally attributed to Diocletian, cannot even be securely dated to a particular century. The most {{that can be said}} about built structures under Diocletian's reign is that he rebuilt and strengthened forts at the Upper Rhine frontier (where he followed the works built under Probus along the Lake Constance-Basel and the Rhine–Iller–Danube line), on the Danube- where a new line of forts {{on the far side of}} the river, the Ripa Sarmatica, was added to older, rehabilitated fortresses – in Egypt, and on the frontier with Persia. Beyond that, much discussion is speculative, and reliant on the broad generalizations of written sources. Diocletian and the tetrarchs had no consistent plan for frontier advancement, and records of raids and forts built across the frontier are likely to indicate only temporary claims. The Strata Diocletiana, built after the Persian Wars, which ran from the Euphrates North of Palmyra and South towards northeast Arabia in the general vicinity of Bostra, is the classic Diocletianic frontier system, consisting of an outer road followed by tightly spaced forts – defensible hard-points manned by small garrisons – followed by further fortifications in the rear. In an attempt to resolve the difficulty and slowness of transmitting orders to the frontier, the new capitals of the tetrarchic era were all much closer to the empire's frontiers than Rome had been: Trier sat on the Rhine, Sirmium and Serdica were close to the Danube, Thessaloniki was on the route leading eastward, and Nicomedia and Antioch were <b>important</b> <b>points</b> in dealings with Persia.|$|E
25|$|Although {{partially}} ruined, the Castle of Lanhoso is {{a popular}} attraction, receiving 100,000 visitors between 1996 and 2006. In addition to the castle (which offers a small exhibition), the shrine and castro are also <b>important</b> <b>points</b> of interest.|$|E

As mentioned, the two <b>important</b> <b>points</b> on the curve are rheobase (b) and chronaxie (c), which correlates to twice the rheobase (2b). Strength-duration curves are useful in studies where the current required is changed when the pulse duration is changed.|$|E

25|$|The {{public library}} {{was one of}} the most <b>important</b> <b>points</b> of access for interviewees, along with the {{internet}} and bookstores.

25|$|A {{narrow band}} or {{strongly}} correlated electronic system and degenerated ground states are <b>important</b> <b>points</b> to understand in explaining superconductivity in fullerene solids. When the inter-electron repulsion U {{is greater than}} the bandwidth, an insulating localized electron ground state is produced in the simple Mott–Hubbard model. This explains the absence of superconductivity at ambient pressure in caesium-doped C60 solids. Electron-correlation-driven localization of the t1u electrons exceeds the critical value, leading to the Mott insulator. The application of high pressure decreases the interfullerene spacing, therefore caesium-doped C60 solids turn to metallic and superconducting.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} <b>important</b> <b>points</b> made by dam {{expansion}} opponents is that raising the dam will not create more water (in fact it will actually cause some water loss due to evaporation) but merely increases the capacity to store it.

The cost of the dam raise is projected at $500 million-$1 billion. One of the expansion's most staunch opponents is the Winnemem Wintu tribe, almost all of whose land was inundated by the construction of Shasta Dam. Raising the dam would destroy much of their little remaining land.|$|E
