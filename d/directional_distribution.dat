40|$|AbstractInformation being {{dealt with}} in micro-mechanics is massive. Most of them are {{directional}} data. Macro-scale physical laws embedded with micro-scale fundamentals {{need to be developed}} in terms of the statistics of the micro-scale variable in a frame-indifferent form. Mathematical techniques and theories for characterizing the statistics of directional data with tensors are hence demanded. This is the main concern of the current paper. Starting with the general theory established in Kanatani (1984) of describing the <b>directional</b> <b>distributions</b> of orientations, mathematical formulations have been extended to address the <b>directional</b> <b>distributions</b> of vector-valued <b>directional</b> data, which is the most common data type being {{dealt with in}} micromechanical investigations. For vector-valued directional data, statistical analyses are required in regarding to both their <b>directional</b> probability density <b>distribution</b> and their representative values along each direction. The technique used here is to approximate these <b>directional</b> <b>distributions</b> by polynomials in unit directional vector n. The coefficients are in tensorial form and determined from observed directional data by applying the least square error criterion. These coefficient tensors serve as macro-scale variables representing the statistics of the micro-scale directional data, and are referred to as direction tensor. Orthogonal decompositions are addressed so that the coefficient tensor of different orders can be determined independently from each other. The coefficient tensors in the orthogonal decompositions are referred to as deviatoric direction tensor. The choice of sufficient approximation order is suggested. As an example, a general form of the stress–force–fabric relationship is derived for demonstrating the application of the proposed mathematical theory in the micro-mechanical investigation of the behaviour of granular materials...|$|R
40|$|High-dimensional data {{is central}} to most data mining applications, and only {{recently}} has it been modeled via <b>directional</b> <b>distributions.</b> In [Banerjee et al., 2003] the authors introduced {{the use of the}} von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution for modeling high-dimensional directional data, particularly for text and gene expression analysis. The vMF distribution is one of the simplest <b>directional</b> <b>distributions.</b> The Watson, Bingham, and Fisher-Bingham distributions provide distributions with an increasing number of parameters and thereby commensurately increased modeling power. This report provides a followup study to the initial development in [Banerjee et al., 2003] by presenting Expectation Maximization (EM) procedures for estimating parameters of a mixture of Watson (moW) distributions. The numerical challenges associated with parameter estimation for both of these distributions are significantly more difficult than for the vMF distribution. We develop new numerical approximations for estimating the parameters permitting us to model reallife data more accurately. Our experimental results establish that for certain data sets improved modeling power translates into better results. ...|$|R

In this thesis, we present a suite of novel applications using latent variable models. In particular, we (i) extend topic models using <b>directional</b> <b>distributions,</b> (ii) propose novel solutions using latent variable models to detect outliers (anomalies) and (iii) to answer cross-modal retrieval problem. We present a study of <b>directional</b> <b>distributions</b> in modeling data. Specifically, we implement the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and develop latent variable models {{which are based on}} directed graphical models. The directed graphical models are commonly used to represent the conditional dependency among the variables. Under Bayesian treatment, we propose approximate posterior inference algorithms using variational methods for the models. We show that by incorporating the vMF distribution, the quality of clustering is improved rather than by using word count-based topic models. Furthermore, with the properties of <b>directional</b> <b>distributions</b> in hand, we extend the applications to detect outliers in various data sets and settings. Finally, we present latent variable models that are based on supervised learning to answer the cross-modal retrieval problem. In the cross-modal retrieval problem, the objective is to find matching content across different modalities such as text and image. We explore various approaches such as by using one-class learning methods, generating negative instances and using ranking methods. We show that our models outperform generic approaches such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and its variants. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|In {{decision}} theoretic {{estimation of}} parameters in Euclidean space R^p, the action space is {{chosen to be}} the convex closure of the estimand space. In this paper, the concept has been extended to the estimation of circular parameters of distributions having support as a circle, torus or cylinder. As <b>directional</b> <b>distributions</b> are of curved nature, existing methods for distributions with parameters taking values in R^p are not immediately applicable here. A circle is the simplest one-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We employ concepts of convexity, projection, etc., on manifolds to develop sufficient conditions for inadmissibility of estimators for circular parameters. Further invariance under a compact group of transformations is introduced in the estimation problem and a complete class theorem for equivariant estimators is derived. This extends the results of Moors [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 76 (1981) 910 - 915] on R^p to circles. The findings are of special interest to the case when a circular parameter is truncated. The results are implemented {{to a wide range}} of <b>directional</b> <b>distributions</b> to obtain improved estimators of circular parameters.

Particular attention is given to the tails of the distribution function of the surface elevation, wave heights and wave crests. Comparison with a simplified model based on second-order theory is reported.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the physical parameterizations available in spectral wave models have already been validated, {{but there is little}} information on their relative performance especially with focus on the higher order spectral moments and wave partitions. This study concentrates on documenting their strengths and limitations using satellite measurements, buoy spectra, and a comparison between the different models. It is confirmed that all models perform well in terms of significant wave heights; however higher-order moments have larger errors. The partition wave quantities perform well in terms of direction and frequency but the magnitude and directional spread typically have larger discrepancies. The high-frequency tail is examined through the mean square slope using satellites and buoys. From this analysis it is clear that some models behave better than the others, suggesting their parameterizations match the physical processes reasonably well. However none of the models are entirely satisfactory, pointing to poorly constrained parameterizations or missing physical processes. The major space-time differences between the models are related to the swell field stressing the importance of describing its evolution. An example swell field confirms the wave heights can be notably different between model configurations while the <b>directional</b> <b>distributions</b> remain similar. It is clear that all models have difficulty in describing the directional spread.

40|$|Traditionally, the <b>directional</b> <b>distribution</b> {{of ocean}} waves has been {{regarded}} as unimodal, with energy concentrated mainly on the wind direction. However, numerical experiments and field measurements have already demonstrated that the energy of short waves tends to be accumulated along two off-wind directions, generating a bimodal <b>directional</b> <b>distribution.</b> Here, numerical simulations of the potential Euler equations are used to investigate the temporal evolution of initially unimodal directional wave spectra. Because this approach does not include external forcing such as wind and breaking dissipation, spectral changes are only driven by nonlinear interactions.

As a result, the <b>directional</b> <b>distribution</b> develops a bimodal form as the wavefield evolves.
