40|$|Although promising, {{clinical}} {{responses to}} adoptive immunotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are still {{limited by the}} restricted number of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens that can be targeted and their poor immunogenicity. Our previous work indicated that the immunogenic features of the NPC-associated viral antigen BARF 1 may be exploited for immunotherapeutic purposes. Nevertheless, T-cell lines obtained with current protocols include only negligible numbers of BARF 1 -specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, pointing {{to the need to}} enrich these effectors in BARF 1 specificities. Considering that in B lymphocytes BARF 1 is mainly a lytic EBV antigen, we tested different EBV lytic-cycle inducers (TPA/butyric acid, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) used at suboptimal concentrations for their ability to upregulate BARF 1 expression in lymphoblastoid B-cell lines (LCL), the commonly used antigen-presenting cells, without compromising their survival. The LCLs treated with doxo-rubicin (DX-LCL) can reproducibly and efficiently generate EBV-specific effectors enriched in BARF 1 specificities from both healthy donors and NPC patients. These DX-LCLs also had more pronounced immunogenic properties, including HLA class I upregulation and expression of immunogenic cell death markers, such as enhanced calreticulin exposure and HMGB 1 release. In particular, doxorubicin triggers an HMGB 1 autocrine/paracrine loop with its receptor, TLR 4, which is also upregulated in DX-LCLs and is responsible for NF-kappa B activation and a delayed apoptosis that allows a prolonged stimulation of EBV-specific T-cell precursors. This protocol may thus constitute a valid alternative to the use of engineered LCLs to generate EBV-specific T-cell lines for adoptive immunotherapy, being relatively simple, easily upgradable to <b>Good</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Practice</b> <b>standards,</b> and therefore more broadly applicable...|$|R

Current procedures for banking of human bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) require cell isolation and expansion, and thus the use of large amounts of animal sera. However, animal-derived culture supplements {{have the potential to}} trigger infections and severe immune reactions. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate an optimized method for cryopreservation of human bone-marrow fragments for application in cell banking procedures where stem-cell expansion and use are not immediately needed. Whole trabecular fragments enclosing the bone marrow were stored in liquid nitrogen for 1 year in a cryoprotective solution containing a low concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide and a high concentration of human serum (HuS). After thawing, the isolation, colony-forming-unit ability, proliferation, morphology, stemness-related marker expression, cell senescence, apoptosis, and multi-lineage differentiation potential of hBM-MSCs were tested in media containing HuS compared with hBM-MSCs isolated from fresh fragments. Human BM-MSCs isolated from cryopreserved fragments expressed MSC markers until later passages, had a good proliferation rate, and exhibited the capacity to differentiate toward osteogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic lineages similar to hBM-MSCs isolated from fresh fragments. Moreover, the cryopreservation method did not induce cell senescence or cell death. These results imply that minimal processing may be adequate for the banking of tissue samples with no requirement for the immediate isolation and use of hBM-MSCs, thus limiting cost and the risk of contamination, and facilitating banking for clinical use.

Pharmacopeias provides an effective guideline to overcome those problems by following current <b>good</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> and establishing <b>standard</b> operating procedures. In-process quality control tests are done with a motive to remove error from every stage in production and maintain the quality of the final product with the compendial standards as specified in the pharmacopoeias. The quality of final products depends on in-process control tests, because it helps to incorporate excellence within the products. The qualitative and quantitative parameters of pharmaceutical products are checked by finished product quality controls tests. Therefore, the drive {{of this study is to}} provide concise information on the in-process and finished product quality control tests for parenteral preparations as per different pharmacopoeias.
