40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{examined}} the genetic diversity of 80 inbred waxy maize lines using 22 SSR molecular markers {{that could be}} used to achieve heterosis in waxy maize. Eighty inbred waxy maize lines with different phenotypes, 40 yellow, 25 white, 13 black, and two red lines were analyzed by SSR molecular marker fingerprint and cluster analysis. Using a standard genetic distance of 0. 55, the 80 waxy maize inbred lines were clustered into nine groups. Among them, group II, <b>group</b> V, <b>groups</b> <b>VII</b> and VIII, and group IX were divided into three subgroups at a genetic distance of 0. 46, into two subgroups at 0. 49, into two subgroups at 0. 46, and into four subgroups at 0. 493, respectively. All but one of the yellow waxy maize inbred lines were clustered in <b>groups</b> VI, <b>VII,</b> VIII, and IX. Group IX (30 lines) contained 28 yellow lines; the other 11 yellow lines were distributed among <b>groups</b> VI, <b>VII</b> and VIII. Among the 25 white lines, 21 were clustered in groups III, V, VI and the third subgroup of group II. The black line N 72 was in a group of its own. The black lines N 75, N 76 and N 78 were distributed in <b>groups</b> <b>VII,</b> VIII and IX, respectively. The other nine black lines were clustered in group II. The red lines were distributed in the second subgroup of group II and there was no difference in genetic distance between them. In conclusion, there were considerable genetic differences among waxy maize inbred lines of different colors. The mean genetic distance of inbred lines of the same color was significantly less than that of lines 255 ©FUNPEC-RP www. funpecrp. com. brGenetics and Molecular Research 11 (1) : 254 - 260 (2012) Genetic distance by SSR analysis of different colors.

50|$|A DNA {{virus is}} {{a virus that}} has DNA as its genetic {{material}} and replicates using a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase.

Although <b>Group</b> <b>VII</b> viruses such as hepatitis B contain a DNA genome, they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather reverse transcribing viruses because they replicate through an RNA intermediate.
