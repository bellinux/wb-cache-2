It brought little to a common market of 150 million people, as its main industry, the steel industry, was already integrated in the European Coal and Steel Community. Its small population and the backwardness of its farming industry led it to demand special treatment which provoked the irritation of other countries. Luxembourg feared that in a common market, Luxembourgish agriculture, which had benefited from protectionist measures since the Zollverein, would be devastated by foreign competition. <b>In</b> addition, the <b>free</b> <b>circulation</b> of people inside the European Community risked increasing in an uncontrolled manner the number of foreigners in Luxembourg, who already constituted 11% {{of the population and}} 27% of the workforce in 1956. Luxembourg finally obtained two exception clauses in an annex to the treaty of the common market. The first stipulated that during a transition period of 12 to 15 years, the Grand Duchy could limit the import of certain agricultural products. Nevertheless, the Luxembourgish government had to pledge to take “all structural, technical and economic measures to enable the progressive integration of Luxembourgish agriculture in the common market”.

40|$|This chapter {{analyzes}} {{the difficulties of}} creating a viable legal framework for ‘cloned food’ in the EU combining a legal perspective with insights from the interdisciplinary research on risk governance. Animal cloning offers an instructive example for the challenges of designing regulatory frameworks for scientific innovations in the EU, especially {{in the area of}} food safety. It presents a nebulous combination of challenges to devising effective regulation: scientific uncertainty about risks to human health and the environment; strong international trade interest <b>in</b> the <b>free</b> <b>circulation</b> of ‘cloned foods’ on the EU market; and other concerns (e. g. ethics) as well as societal resistance and negative consumer preferences that affect the legitimacy of regulatory approaches. This mix of circumstances has hampered the establishment of new legal rules for animal cloning under the EU Novel Foods legal framework. The analysis of this paper reveals that the establishment of viable EU legal rules in this area has been afflicted with problems due to the complexity and multi-sectoral nature of animal cloning regulation. Moreover, strong pressure from the international trade market and international trade rules has resulted in persistent institutional disagreement over animal cloning. This indicates that legal and political pressure from EU’s external trade partners hampers the willingness and ability of the EU to establish precautionary and responsive risk frameworks...|$|R

According to established Norwegian law, international exhaustion applied to trade marks. The EFTA Court held that under the First Trade Mark Directive 89/104/EEC, the EFTA States were entitled to opt for the international exhaustion of trade mark rights. The Court emphasized that they retained their sovereignty in foreign trade matters. Unlike the EC Treaty, the EEA Agreement did not establish a customs union, but an enhanced free trade area. The purpose and {{the scope of the}} EC Treaty and the EEA Agreement are therefore different. According to Article 8 EEA, the principle of free movement of goods as laid down in Articles 11 to 13 EEA applies only to goods originating in the EEA, while in the Community a product is <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>circulation</b> once it has been lawfully placed on the market in a Member State. In general, the latter applies {{in the context of the}} EEA only with respect to products originating in the EEA. In the case at hand, the product was manufactured in the United States and imported into Norway. Accordingly, it was not subject to the principle of the free movement of goods within the EEA. Based on this, the EFTA Court rejected the argument put forward by the governments of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom as well as by the European Commission that giving the EEA/EFTA States the right to opt for international exhaustion would lead to disparities in the EEA market. Article 7(1) of the Trade Mark Directive was interpreted so that it was for the EEA/EFTA States’ legislatures and courts to decide whether they wanted to introduce or to maintain the principle of international exhaustion of trade mark rights with regard to goods originating from outside the EEA. The EFTA Court found that international exhaustion was in the interest of free trade and competition and thus in the interest of consumers. Furthermore, the principle of international exhaustion was in line with the main function of a trade mark, to allow the consumer to identify with certainty the origin of the products. This interpretation of Article 7(1) of the Trade Mark Directive was also consistent with the TRIPs Agreement, which left the issue open for the Member States to regulate.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to reconcile the}} principle of assimilation with the principle of mutual recognition with respect to third country goods entering the EU. It argues that third country goods <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>circulation</b> should benefit from the principle of mutual recognition when imported into other Member States if those goods are marketable {{in any one of}} the Member States. Following the principle of assimilation, such goods should be able to rely on Article 34 TFEU "without distinction" between goods of EU origin and third country origin. Mutual recognition, on the other hand, allows traders to challenge indistinctly applicable product rules if goods are "lawfully produced and marketed in another Member State". This article assesses four different ways of reconciling these two principles. The article argues that the preferred option is to allow goods <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>circulation</b> that are "lawfully marketable" in another Member State to benefit from the presumption of equivalence that follows from mutual recognition when those goods are imported into another Member State. This is the least trade restrictive way to achieve the fundamental purpose of mutual recognition: subjecting goods within the EU internal market, as much as possible, to only one set of technical regulations, not two or zero. If goods of third country origin can be marketed in one Member State according its technical rules, those goods should be presumed to meet equivalent standards set by the Member State of importation. The burden of proof should be on the Member State seeking to apply its technical rules to the imported products in question to demonstrate their necessityin light of public interest requirements...|$|E

In order to produce bainitic structure different heat treatment was applied on the specimens to have identical hardness level. It was observed that different heat treatments influenced the transducer performance, particularly hysteresis behaviour point of view. To minimize the hysteresis error of force transducers has prime concern and best result was obtained in the bainitic-structured specimen.

40|$|Streptokinase (SK) is {{a potent}} clot {{dissolver}} but lacks fibrin clot specificity as it activates human plasminogen (HPG) into human plasmin (HPN) throughout the system leading to increased risk of bleeding. Another major drawback associated with all thrombolytics, including tissue plasminogen activator, is the generation of transient thrombin and release of clot-bound thrombin that promotes reformation of clots. In order to obtain anti-thrombotic as well as clot-specificity properties in SK, cDNAs encoding the EGF 4, 5, 6 domains of human thrombomodulin were fused with that of streptokinase, either at its N- or C-termini, and expressed these in Pichia pastoris followed by purification and structural-functional characterization, including plasminogen activation, thrombin inhibition, and Protein C activation characteristics. Interestingly, the N-terminal EGF fusion construct (EGF-SK) showed plasmin-mediated plasminogen activation, whereas the C-terminal (SK-EGF) fusion construct exhibited 'spontaneous' plasminogen activation which is quite similar to SK i. e. direct activation of systemic HPG in absence of free HPN. Since HPN is normally absent <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>circulation</b> due to rapid serpin-based inactivation (such as alpha- 2 -antiplasmin and alpha- 2 -Macroglobin), but selectively present in clots, a plasmin-dependent mode of HPG activation is expected {{to lead to a}} desirable fibrin clot-specific response by the thrombolytic. Both the N- and C-terminal fusion constructs showed strong thrombin inhibition and Protein C activation properties as well, and significantly prevented re-occlusion in a specially designed assay. The EGF-SK construct exhibited fibrin clot dissolution properties with much-lowered levels of fibrinogenolysis, suggesting unmistakable promise in clot dissolver therapy with reduced hemorrhage and re-occlusion risks...|$|E

However, excellence in science will {{become more and more}} dependent on sharing of data and expertise - the nuclear idea emphasized in this viewpoint article, which conveys the major points presented and discussed by the senior author in the (invited) opening plenary lecture delivered at EFSA 5 th anniversary scientific forum. Data and knowledge are usually shared within the scientific community itself - and are typically aimed at peers; however, the associated citing metrics do not often correlate with their applicability and usefulness. Funding bodies have for long recognized the value of networking and crossbreeding among scientists - in reinforcing complementarities and promoting synergies. Furthermore, these bodies have had a major effect in driving food scientists reach out of their cocooned, narrow communities toward embracing a wider spectrum of disciplines (e. g. in social and economic sciences). Web-supported databases of e. g. risk data and pathogen sequences have also revolutionized access to, and use of knowledge.

I would take issue with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s rather partisan account of the negotiations, the consultations, and the outcomes associated with the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011. In my view, the negotiations were secretive and biased; the local consultations were sometimes farcical {{because of the lack of}} information about the draft texts of the agreement; and the final text of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 is not in the best interests of Australia, particularly given that it is a net importer of copyright works and trade mark goods and services. I would also express grave reservations about the quality of the rather pitiful National Interest Analysis – and the lack of any regulatory impact statement – associated with the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011. The assertion that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 does not require legislative measures is questionable – especially given the United States Trade Representative has called the agreement ‘the highest-standard plurilateral agreement ever achieved concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights. ’ It is worthwhile reiterating that there has been much criticism of the secretive and partisan nature of the negotiations surrounding the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011. Sean Flynn summarizes these concerns: "The negotiation process for ACTA has been a case study in establishing the conditions for effective industry capture of a lawmaking process. Instead of using the relatively transparent and inclusive multilateral processes, ACTA was launched through a closed and secretive “‘club approach’ in which like-minded jurisdictions define enforcement ‘membership’ rules and then invite other countries to join, presumably via other trade agreements. ” The most influential developing countries, including Brazil, India, China and Russia, were excluded. Likewise, a series of manoeuvres ensured that public knowledge about the specifics of the agreement and opportunities for input into the process were severely limited. Negotiations were held with mere hours notice to the public as to when and where they would be convened, often in countries half away around the world from where public interest groups are housed. Once there, all negotiation processes were closed to the public. Draft texts were not released before or after most negotiating rounds, and meetings with stakeholders took place only behind closed doors and off the record. A public release of draft text, in April 2010, was followed by no public or on-the-record meetings with negotiators. " Moreover, it is disturbing that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 has been driven by ideology and faith, rather than by any evidence-based policy making Professor Duncan Matthews has raised significant questions about the quality of empirical evidence used to support the proposal of Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 : ‘There are concerns that statements about levels of counterfeiting and piracy are based either on customs seizures, with the actual quantities of infringing goods <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>circulation</b> in any particular market largely unknown, or on estimated losses derived from industry surveys. ’ It is particularly disturbing that, in spite of past criticism, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has supported the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011, without engaging the Productivity Commission or the Treasury to do a proper economic analysis of the proposed treaty. Kader Arif, Rapporteur for the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 in the European Parliament, quit his position, and said of the process: "I want to denounce in the strongest possible manner the entire process that led to the signature of this agreement: no inclusion of civil society organisations, a lack of transparency from the start of the negotiations, repeated postponing of the signature of the text without an explanation being ever given, exclusion of the EU Parliament's demands that were expressed on several occasions in our assembly. As rapporteur of this text, I have faced never-before-seen manoeuvres from the right wing of this Parliament to impose a rushed calendar before public opinion could be alerted, thus depriving the Parliament of its right to expression and of the tools at its disposal to convey citizens' legitimate demands. ” Everyone knows the ACTA agreement is problematic, whether it is its impact on civil liberties, the way it makes Internet access providers liable, its consequences on generic drugs manufacturing, or how little protection it gives to our geographical indications. This agreement might have major consequences on citizens' lives, and still, everything is being done to prevent the European Parliament from having its say in this matter. That is why today, as I release this report for which I was in charge, I want to send a strong signal and alert the public opinion about this unacceptable situation. I will not take part in this masquerade. " There have been parallel concerns about the process and substance of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 in the context of Australia. I have a number of concerns about the substance of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011. First, I am concerned that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 fails to provide appropriate safeguards in respect of human rights, consumer protection, competition, and privacy laws. It is recommended that the new Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights investigate this treaty. Second, I argue that there is a lack of balance to the copyright measures in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 – the definition of piracy is overbroad; the suite of civil remedies, criminal offences, and border measures is excessive; and there is a lack of suitable protection for copyright exceptions, limitations, and remedies. Third, I discuss trade mark law, intermediary liability, and counterfeiting. I express my concerns, in this context, that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 could have an adverse impact upon consumer interests, competition policy, and innovation in the digital economy. I also note, with concern, the lobbying by tobacco industries for the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 – and the lack of any recognition in the treaty for the capacity of countries to take measures of tobacco control under the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Fourth, I note that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 provides no positive obligations to promote access to essential medicines. It is particularly lamentable that Australia and the United States of America have failed to implement the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health 2001 and the WTO General Council Decision 2003. Fifth, I express concerns about the border measures in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011. Such measures lack balance – and unduly favour the interests of intellectual property owners over consumers, importers, and exporters. Moreover, such measures will be costly, as they involve shifting the burden of intellectual property enforcement to customs and border authorities. Interdicting, seizing, and destroying goods may also raise significant trade issues. Finally, I express concern that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 undermines the role of existing international organisations, such as the United Nations, the World Intellectual Property Organization and the World Trade Organization, and subverts international initiatives such as the WIPO Development Agenda 2007. I also question the raison d'être, independence, transparency, and accountability of the proposed new ‘ACTA Committee’. In this context, I am concerned by the shift in the position of the Labor Party in its approach to international treaty-making in relation to intellectual property. The Australian Parliament adopted the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement 2004, which included a large Chapter on intellectual property. The treaty was a ‘TRIPs-Plus’ agreement, because the obligations were much more extensive and prescriptive than those required under the multilateral framework established by the TRIPS Agreement 1994. During the debate over the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement 2004, the Labor Party expressed the view that it would seek to mitigate the effects of the TRIPS-Plus Agreement, when at such time it gained power. Far from seeking to ameliorate the effects of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement 2004, the Labor Government would seek to lock Australia into a TRIPS-Double Plus Agreement – the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011. There has not been a clear political explanation for this change in approach to international intellectual property. For both reasons of process and substance, I conclude that the Australian Parliament and the Australian Government should reject the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011. The Australian Government would do better to endorse the Washington Declaration on Intellectual Property and the Public Interest 2011, and implement its outstanding obligations in respect of access to knowledge, access to essential medicines, and the WIPO Development Agenda 2007. The case study of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 2011 highlights the need for further reforms to the process by which Australia engages in international treaty-making...|$|E
