25|$|The clandestine {{conversion}} of morphine to ketones of the hydromorphone class or other derivatives like <b>dihydromorphine</b> (Paramorfan), desomorphine (Permonid), metopon, etc. and codeine to hydrocodone (Dicodid), dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), etc. is more involved, time-consuming, requires lab equipment of various types, and usually requires expensive catalysts and {{large amounts of}} morphine at the outset and is less common but still has been discovered by authorities in various ways during the last 20 years or so. <b>Dihydromorphine</b> can be acetylated into another 3,6 morphine diester, namely diacetyldihydromorphine (Paralaudin), and hydrocodone into thebacon.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is a {{precursor}} {{in the manufacture}} in {{a large number of}} opioids such as <b>dihydromorphine,</b> hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and oxycodone as well as codeine, which itself has a large family of semi-synthetic derivatives. Morphine is commonly treated with acetic anhydride and ignited to yield heroin.|$|E
25|$|The methyl {{group that}} makes {{morphine}} into codeine {{can be removed}} or added back, or replaced with another functional group like ethyl and others to make codeine analogues of morphine-derived drugs and vice versa. Codeine analogues of morphine-based drugs often serve as prodrugs of the stronger drug, as in codeine and morphine, hydrocodone and hydromorphone, oxycodone and oxymorphone, nicocodeine and nicomorphine, dihydrocodeine and <b>dihydromorphine,</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dihydro{{morphine}}'s</b> {{onset of}} action is more rapid than morphine and it also tends to have a longer duration of action, generally 4-7 hours.|$|R
25|$|Animal {{and human}} studies and {{clinical}} experience {{back up the}} contention that morphine {{is one of the}} most euphoric drugs known, and via all but the IV route heroin and morphine cannot be distinguished according to studies because heroin is a prodrug for the delivery of systemic morphine. Chemical changes to the morphine molecule yield other euphorigenics such as <b>dihydromorphine,</b> hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Hydal), and oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), as well as the latter three's methylated equivalents dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone, respectively; in addition to heroin, there are dipropanoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, and other members of the 3,6 morphine diester category like nicomorphine and other similar semi-synthetic opiates like desomorphine, hydromorphinol, etc. used clinically in many countries of the world but in many cases also produced illicitly in rare instances.|$|E
25|$|Morphine was {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of <b>dihydromorphine</b> (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of dihydrocodeine, poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is {{the most}} {{abundant}} opiate found in opium, the dried latex extracted by shallowly scoring the unripe seedpods of the Papaver somniferum poppy. Morphine is generally 8–14% of the dry weight of opium, although specially bred cultivars reach 26% or produce little morphine at all (under 1%, perhaps down to 0.04%). The latter varieties, including the 'Przemko' and 'Norman' cultivars of the opium poppy, are used to produce two other alkaloids, thebaine and oripavine, which {{are used in the}} manufacture of semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids like oxycodone and etorphine and some other types of drugs. P. bracteatum does not contain morphine or codeine, or other narcotic phenanthrene-type, alkaloids. This species is rather a source of thebaine. Occurrence of morphine in other Papaverales and Papaveraceae, as well as in some species of hops and mulberry trees has not been confirmed. Morphine is produced most predominantly early in the life cycle of the plant. Past the optimum point for extraction, various processes in the plant produce codeine, thebaine, and in some cases negligible amounts of hydromorphone, <b>dihydromorphine,</b> dihydrocodeine, tetrahydro-thebaine, and hydrocodone (these compounds are rather synthesized from thebaine and oripavine).|$|E
2500|$|Whereas {{converting}} codeine to morphine is {{a difficult}} and unrewarding task, dihydrocodeine {{can be converted to}} <b>dihydromorphine</b> with very high yields (over 95%). [...] <b>Dihydromorphine</b> is widely used in Japan. The <b>dihydromorphine</b> can be quantitatively converted to hydromorphone using potassium tert butoxide.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{discovered}} in 1953, that humans and some animals naturally produce minute amounts of morphine, codeine, and possibly some of their simpler derivatives like heroin and <b>dihydromorphine,</b> in addition to endogenous opioid peptides. [...] Some bacteria are capable of producing some semi-synthetic opioids such as hydromorphone and hydrocodone when living in a solution containing morphine or codeine respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Dihydrocodeine was {{developed}} during the intense international search for more effective antitussives, especially to help reduce the airborne spread of tuberculosis, pertussis, pneumonia, and similar diseases, in the years from c.a. 1895 to 1915. It is similar in chemical structure to codeine. Dihydrocodeine is twice as strong as codeine. [...] Although dihydrocodeine does have extremely active metabolites, {{in the form of}} <b>dihydromorphine</b> and dihydromorphine-6-glucuronide (one hundred times more potent), these metabolites are produced in such small amounts {{that they do not have}} clinically significant effects.|$|E
2500|$|Codeine {{has been}} used in the past as the {{starting}} material and prototype of a large class of mainly mild to moderately strong opioids; such as hydrocodone (1920 in Germany), oxycodone (1916 in Germany), dihydrocodeine (1908 in Germany), and its derivatives such as nicocodeine (1956 in Austria). However, these opioids are no longer synthesized from codeine and are usually synthesized from other opium alkaloids; specifically thebaine. [...] Other series of codeine derivatives include isocodeine and its derivatives, which were developed in Germany starting around 1920. [...] In general, the various classes of morphine derivatives such as ketones, semisynthetics like <b>dihydromorphine,</b> halogeno-morphides, esters, ethers, and others have codeine, dihydrocodeine, and isocodeine analogues. [...] The codeine ester acetylcodeine is a common active impurity in street heroin as some codeine tends to dissolve with the morphine when it is extracted from opium in underground heroin and morphine base labs.|$|E
2500|$|Morphine, {{the archetypal}} opioid, and other opioids (e.g., codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, <b>dihydromorphine,</b> pethidine) all exert a similar {{influence}} on the cerebral opioid receptor system. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, and tramadol is a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) with weak μ-opioid receptor agonist properties. [...] Tramadol is structurally closer to venlafaxine than to codeine and delivers analgesia by not only delivering [...] "opioid-like" [...] effects (through mild agonism of the mu receptor) but also by acting as a weak but fast-acting serotonin releasing agent and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. [...] Tapentadol, with some structural similarities to tramadol, presents what {{is believed to be}} a novel drug working through two (and possibly three) different modes of action in the fashion of both a traditional opioid and as a SNRI. The effects of serotonin and norepinephrine on pain, while not completely understood, have had causal links established and drugs in the SNRI class are commonly used in conjunction with opioids (especially tapentadol and tramadol) with greater success in pain relief. Dosing of all opioids may be limited by opioid toxicity (confusion, respiratory depression, myoclonic jerks and pinpoint pupils), seizures (tramadol), but opioid-tolerant individuals usually have higher dose ceilings than patients without tolerance.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{converting}} codeine to morphine is {{a difficult}} and unrewarding task, dihydrocodeine {{can be converted to}} <b>dihydromorphine</b> with very high yields (over 95%). <b>Dihydromorphine</b> is widely used in Japan. The <b>dihydromorphine</b> can be quantitatively converted to hydromorphone using potassium tert butoxide.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dihydromorphine</b> (Paramorfan, Paramorphan) is a semi-synthetic opioid {{structurally}} {{related to}} and derived from morphine. The 7,8-double bond in morphine {{is reduced to}} a single bond to get <b>dihydromorphine.</b> <b>Dihydromorphine</b> is a moderately strong analgesic and is used clinically {{in the treatment of}} pain and also is an active metabolite of the analgesic opioid drug dihydrocodeine. [...] <b>Dihydromorphine</b> occurs in trace quantities in assays of opium on occasion, as does dihydrocodeine, dihydrothebaine, tetrahydrothebaine, etc. The process for manufacturing <b>dihydromorphine</b> from morphine for pharmaceutical use was developed in Germany in the late 19th Century, with the synthesis being published in 1900 and the drug introduced clinically as Paramorfan shortly thereafter. A high-yield synthesis from tetrahydrothebaine was later developed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dihydromorphine</b> is {{slightly}} stronger than morphine as an analgesic {{with a similar}} side effect profile. The relative potency of <b>dihydromorphine</b> is about 1.2 times that of morphine. In comparison, the relative potency of dihydrocodeine is 1.15 times that of codeine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dihydromorphine</b> {{acts as an}} agonist at the μ-opioid (mu), δ-opioid (delta) and κ-opioid (kappa) receptors. Agonist of the μ-opioid and δ-opioid receptors {{is largely}} {{responsible}} for the clinical effects of opioids like <b>dihydromorphine</b> with the μ agonism providing more analgesia than the δ.|$|E
50|$|The process {{gave rise}} to various {{concentrations}} of hydromorphone, <b>dihydromorphine,</b> hydromorphinol, and oxymorphone during the experiments. Three paths were found: from morphine to hydromorphone with <b>dihydromorphine</b> as the penultimate step, from morphine to hydromorphone with morphinone as the penultimate step, and from morphine to hydromorphinol to hydromorphone.|$|E
50|$|Hydrocodone {{was first}} marketed by Knoll as Dicodid, {{starting}} in February 1924 in Germany.This name {{is analogous to}} other products the company introduced or otherwise marketed: Dilaudid (hydromorphone, 1926), Dinarkon (oxycodone, 1917), Dihydrin (dihydrocodeine, 1911), and Dimorphan (<b>dihydromorphine).</b> Paramorfan is the trade name of <b>dihydromorphine</b> from another manufacturer, as is Paracodin, for dihydrocodeine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dihydro{{morphine}}</b> and morphine {{are also}} used alongside each other in clinical use in Japan and is regulated as such ...|$|E
50|$|Diacetyldihydromorphine {{is quickly}} metabolized by plasma {{esterase}} enzymes into <b>dihydromorphine,</b> {{in the same}} way that diamorphine is metabolized into morphine.|$|E
50|$|Under the 1961 {{international}} Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs treaty <b>dihydromorphine</b> is a Schedule I narcotic {{subject to}} control, and other countries' laws may vary.|$|E
50|$|Nicodicodeine is an opioid {{developed}} as a cough suppressant and analgesic. Synthesized in 1904, it is not commonly used, but has activity similar to other opioids. Nicodicodeine is metabolised in the liver by demethylation to produce 6-nicotinoyldihydromorphine, and subsequently further metabolised to <b>dihydromorphine.</b> Since the final active metabolite is the slightly stronger opiate <b>dihydromorphine</b> rather than morphine, nicodicodeine {{can be expected to}} be marginally more potent and longer acting than nicocodeine. Side effects {{are similar to those of}} other opioids and include itching, nausea and respiratory depression.|$|E
5000|$|Under the Controlled Substances Act, <b>dihydromorphine</b> {{is listed}} as a Schedule I {{substance}} along with heroin. [...] In the United States, {{its role in the}} production of dihydrocodeine and other related drugs make it a Schedule I substance with one of the higher annual manufacturing quotas granted by the US Drug Enforcement Administration—3300 kilos in 2013; manufacturers, distributors, and importers with the correct DEA license and state permits related thereto are able to use Schedule I drugs in this fashion when they are transformed into something of a lower schedule. The DEA has assigned <b>dihydromorphine</b> and all of its salts, esters, &c the ACSCN of 9145. As with nicomorphine, MDMA, heroin (DEA 2013 production quota: 25 grammes) and the like, <b>dihydromorphine</b> is also used in research such as that mentioned above in properly licensed facilities; Form 225, the most common and least expensive individual researcher's license, does not include Schedule I so the lab must have a higher-level DEA registration [...] As with other licit opioids used for medical purposes in other countries, including even much weaker opioids like nicocodeine, benzylmorphine, and tilidine, the reason for <b>dihydromorphine</b> being in Schedule I is that it was not in medical use in the USA at time the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 was drawn up.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dihydromorphine,</b> often {{labelled}} {{with the}} isotope tritium {{in the form}} of 3H-dihydromorphine, is used in scientific research to study binding of the opioid receptors in the nervous system.|$|E
50|$|The clandestine {{conversion}} of morphine to ketones of the hydromorphone class or other derivatives like <b>dihydromorphine</b> (Paramorfan), desomorphine (Permonid), metopon, etc. and codeine to hydrocodone (Dicodid), dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), etc. is more involved, time-consuming, requires lab equipment of various types, and usually requires expensive catalysts and {{large amounts of}} morphine at the outset and is less common but still has been discovered by authorities in various ways during the last 20 years or so. <b>Dihydromorphine</b> can be acetylated into another 3,6 morphine diester, namely diacetyldihydromorphine (Paralaudin), and hydrocodone into thebacon.|$|E
50|$|Nicodicodeine is {{a similar}} drug which is to nicocodeine as codeine is to dihydrocodeine. The {{metabolites}} of nicodicodeine include <b>dihydromorphine</b> where nicocodeine is turned into morphine as noted above.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dihydromorphine</b> is an opioid that is {{used for}} the {{management}} of moderate to severe pain such as cancer, although it's less effective in treating things such as neuropathic pain and is generally considered inappropriate and ineffective for psychological pain.|$|E
50|$|The 2013 DEA annual {{production}} quota for nicocodeine and its two related drugs are zero. Nicocodeine's ACSCN is 9309. Nicodicodeine is not assigned an ACSCN and is presumably controlled as either an ester of <b>dihydromorphine</b> or derivative of nicomorphine.|$|E
50|$|As an ester of <b>dihydromorphine,</b> diacetyldihydromorphine is presumably a Schedule I/Narcotic {{controlled}} substance in the United States {{but does not}} have its own ACSCN or annual production quota. It does appear in the German Betäubungsmittelgesetz and other European controlled-substances laws.|$|E
50|$|Morphine-N-oxide {{can also}} form as a {{decomposition}} product of morphine outside {{the body and}} may show up in assays of opium and poppy straw concentrate. Codeine and the semi-synthetics such as heroin, dihydrocodeine, <b>dihydromorphine,</b> hydromorphone, and hydrocodone also have equivalent amine oxide derivatives.|$|E
50|$|Dihydrocodeine is metabolised by the CYP450 system {{isoenzyme}} 2D6 to <b>dihydromorphine,</b> which mediates {{the majority}} of its analgesic effects. Owing to the low oral bioavailibility of dihydrocodeine (20%), and its subsequent metabolism to active compounds, it is likely that doses below 30mg are sub therapeutic for analgesia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dihydromorphine</b> is {{regulated}} {{in the same}} fashion as morphine in Germany under the BtMG, Austrian SMG, and Swiss BtMG, where it is still used as an analgesic. [...] The drug was invented in Germany in 1900 and marketed shortly thereafter. It is often used in Patient Controlled Analgesia units.|$|E
50|$|Since acetyldihydrocodeine has higher {{lipophilicity}} than codeine and {{is converted}} into <b>dihydromorphine</b> rather than morphine, {{it can be}} expected to be more potent and longer-lasting. It also has a higher bioavailability than codeine. Side effects {{are similar to those of}} other opiates and include itching, nausea and respiratory depression.|$|E
50|$|Diacetylnalorphine (BAN) is an opioid drug {{described}} as an analgesic and antidote which was never marketed. It is the 3,6-diacetyl ester of nalorphine, and therefore the heroin analogue of nalorphine. Diacetylnalorphine may behave as a prodrug to nalorphine, similarly to the cases of heroin (diacetylmorphine) to morphine and diacetyldihydromorphine to <b>dihydromorphine.</b>|$|E
50|$|It was {{discovered}} in 1953, that humans and some animals naturally produce minute amounts of morphine, codeine, and possibly some of their simpler derivatives like heroin and <b>dihydromorphine,</b> in addition to endogenous opioid peptides. Some bacteria are capable of producing some semi-synthetic opioids such as hydromorphone and hydrocodone when living in a solution containing morphine or codeine respectively.|$|E
50|$|This drug, the benzyl ether of {{morphine}}, {{should not}} be cofused with dibenzoylmorphine, an ester of morphine comparable to heroin. Another morphine ether developed around the same time, benzyldihydromorphine, saw some clinical use in the opening years of the 20th Century. The ethers of morphine and codeine as well as <b>dihydromorphine</b> and dihydrocodeine number close to 100 and include such obscure opioids as formylallopseudoisocodeine.|$|E
