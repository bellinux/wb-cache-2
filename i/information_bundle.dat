40|$|We {{find that}} on average, an {{announcement}} of rising unemployment {{is good news}} for stocks during economic expansions and bad news during economic contractions. Un-employment news bundles three types of primitive information relevant for valuing stocks: information about future interest rates, the equity risk premium, and corpo-rate earnings and dividends. The nature of the <b>information</b> <b>bundle,</b> and hence the relative importance of the three effects, changes over time depending {{on the state of the}} economy. For stocks as a group, information about interest rates dominates dur-ing expansions and information about future corporate dividends dominates during contractions. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE SHORT-RUN response of stock prices to the arrival of macroeconomic news. The particular news event we consider is the Bureau of Labor Statistic’s (BLS) monthly announcement of the unemployment rate. We establish that the stock market’s response to unemployment news arrival depends on whether the economy is expanding or contracting. On average, the stock market responds positively to news of rising unemployment in expansions, and negatively in contractions. Since the economy is usually in an expansion phase, it follows that the stock market usually rises on the announcement of bad news from the labor market. ...|$|E
40|$|First {{generation}} {{cognitive science}} has always {{maintained that the}} mind/brain is a modular system. This has been especially apparent in linguistics, where the modularity thesis goes largely unquestioned by the linguistic mainstream. Cognitive linguists have long disputed the reality of modular architectures of grammar. Instead of conceiving syntax as a computational system of a relatively small set of formal principles and parameters, cognitive linguists take the notion of grammatical construction to be the basic unit of syntax: syntax is simply our repertoire of form-meaning pairings. On such a view, there is no a-priori {{reason to believe that}} semantics and phonology cannot affect syntax. In the present paper, we want to take things a step further and suggest, more generally, that language is not a module of cognition in any strict sense. &# 13; We present preliminary results from research in progress concerning the effect of music on grammatical constructions. More specifically, our experiment compares reaction times between two grammatical constructions that differ in semantics and intonational curves but share lexical material. Our data so far suggests that subjects take less time reading the construction when the semantic bias and intonation match than in non-matching cases. This, we argue, suggests not only that semantics, phonology and syntax form an <b>information</b> <b>bundle</b> (i. e. a construction in the cognitive linguistic sense), but that perceived similarity of music can influence linguistic cognition...|$|E

The low marginal cost of production, the lack of capacity constraint on production and ease of bundling products affect the pricing and allocation strategies of firms selling information goods. Previous work on <b>bundling</b> <b>information</b> goods assumes ex-ante knowledge about either consumer valuations (or reservation prices) or their distributions. In this paper, we relax these assumptions and develop an incentive-compatible auction mechanism to determine bundle prices and allocation. Of course, when valuations or reservation prices are known ex-ante, one can solve a nonlinear optimization problem which will give a higher revenue than our incentive compatible mechanism. Conversely, even if valuations or reservation prices are unknown, one could use a fixed price strategy to price <b>information</b> goods <b>bundles.</b> We will compare our mechanism with other pricing options for <b>information</b> goods <b>bundles.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Topic: Supply Chain Issues The {{paper is}} related to the {{logistic}} challenges of the European Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances. The bans of the six materials, among them lead, is followed from a strong requirement of distinguishing products and subproducts, whether they fall under the scope of the directive or not. The scope covers eight from ten categories of electronic products, mostly made for the private customer. But the weak boundaries of the categories, the lists of exemptions and the dates of coming in force and reviewing the exemptions enforces {{a very large number of}} variations, a subproduct could contain lead in their structure. The problem will be tapered due to the definition of maximum concentration values based on homogeneous material, which is a clear interpreted term only for macro materials. Logistic is a time, cost and quality deciding business task regarding as well the supply chain as the intra-enterprise management. Understanding and trustfulness between the partners, clear rules and contracts are required for providing a beneficial business and withstanding the competition. The supply chain in electronic industry ranges from ore mining to the customer, but modern business management includes the whole life cycle until the services, reuse and recycling before the disposal. Due to this fact, dealing the information about used materials is a big issue. Above all, more than one employee in the intra-enterprise business workflows is involved in gathering information, keeping information online and addressing information to product and customer. Although the RoHS Directive does not define a marking of products and subparts, a common marking is desired for handling some kind of information regarding to lead. The paper will discuss in a first part the international standards, released after a long process. So the JEITA ETR- 7021, the JEDEC JESD 97 as well as the IPC- 1066 will be introduced and commented with the focus on usability for RoHS compliance and possible compliance to other legislation. The RoHS compliant diamond, proposed by Soldertec, may give a condensed information regarding RoHS if it is complemented by a description of possible exemptions. Beyond that, a checklist for manufacturers/suppliers will be given to broader the view from the marking issue to the whole business process. The complexity of the processes requires a further assistance from national, international and European manufacturer associations and standardisation bodies to support the enterprises fulfilling a secure logistic task through the whole life cycle. In a second part the amount of information regarding only the lead content in a product will be opened to environmental oriented <b>information</b> <b>bundle.</b> So the topics like traceability, part numbering and material data declaration format are among the objectives for the following challenges to be met for staying innovatively and compatibly in the global market...|$|E

For finite costs, finite-sized bundles are optimal. Then, we use game-theoretic analysis and simulation to explore the behavior of the market when there are multiple cont [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} question of choosing the best information alternative in engineering decisions. The decision maker maximizes his expected utility under uncertainty where both the action he takes {{and the state of}} the environment determines the payo&# 64256; earned. The decision maker has an opportunity to gather information about the decision environment a priori at a certain cost. There might be di&# 64256;erent information alternatives, and the decision maker has to determine which alternative o&# 64256;ers "better" prospects for improving the decision. Any decision environment that is characterized by a &# 64257;nite number of outcomes and a discrete probability distribution over the set of outcomes is a lottery. We analyze the value of information on a single outcome and determine the attributes in each piece of information that maximizes its value. Information is valuable when the decision is changed after gathering information. We show that if the number of optimal actions taken under di&# 64256;erent outcomes scenarios is &# 64257;nite, the decision maker does not require the perfect information. Further, we analyze the relation between the value of information and its determinants, and show a monotonic relation exists for a restricted class of <b>information</b> <b>bundles</b> and utility functions. We use di&# 64256;erent approaches to evaluate information and analyze the cases where preference reversals occur between di&# 64256;erent approaches. We observe that a priori pricing of information does not necessarily induce the same ranking with the expected utility approach, however both approaches agree on whether a given piece of information is valuable or not. The second part of this dissertation evaluates information in both static and dynamic coinsurance problems. In static insurance decisions, we analyze the case where the decision maker gathers information about the severity of the risk events and perform ranking of <b>information</b> <b>bundles</b> in a speci&# 64257;c class. In dynamic insurance problems, we make a case study to analyze di&# 64256;erent physical risks that the production facilities are exposed to. The information in dynamic insurance problems involves more detail with regard to the timing of the multiple risk events. We observe that information on events that pose relatively good scenarios for the decision maker have value, however, their value may diminish as their probability of occurance decreases. The decision maker purchases more information as the pro&# 64257;tability of the product increases and less information as the initial wealth increases. Furthermore, the decrease cost of insurance does not necessarily make information more valuable as the value {{is directly related to the}} change in the decisions rather than the cost of taking a speci&# 64257;c action...|$|R

By relying on already available lower-level protocols and avoiding duplicated functionality, this approach manages to significantly reduce the size and complexity of CHARON's implementation. There is a small impact on communication efficiency, leading to longer frames due to extra encapsulation—a generally advantageous tradeoff. Furthermore, it helps make the solution platform-agnostic and independent of the low-level details. There are only two types of messages in CHARON: beacons, which relay routing <b>information,</b> and <b>bundles,</b> which carry application data.

40|$|Commerce in {{information}} goods {{is one of}} the earliest emerging applications for intelligent agents in commerce. However, the fundamental characteristics of information goods mean that they can and likely will be offered in widely varying configurations. Participating agents will need to deal with uncertainty about both prices and location in multi-dimensional product space. Thus, studying the behavior of learning agents is central to understanding and designing for agent-based information economies. Since uncertainty will exist on both sides of transactions, and interactions between learning agents that are negotiating and transacting with other learning agents may lead to unexpected dynamics, it is important to study two-sided learning. We present a simple but powerful model of an <b>information</b> <b>bundling</b> economy with a single producer and multiple consumer agents. We explore the pricing and purchasing behavior of these agents when articles can be bundled. In this initial exploration, we study the dynamics of this economy when consumer agents are uninformed about the distribution of article values. We discover that a reasonable albeit naive consumer learning strategy can lead to disastrous market behavior. We find a simple explanation for this market failure, and develop a simple improvement to the producer agent's strategy that largely ameliorates the problem. But in the process we learn an important lesson: dynamic market interactions when there is substantial uncertainty can lead to pathological outcomes if agents are designed with "reasonable" but not sufficiently adaptive strategies. Thus, in programmed agent environments it may be essential to dramatically increase our understanding of adaptivity and learning if we want to obtain good aggregate outcomes...|$|R
