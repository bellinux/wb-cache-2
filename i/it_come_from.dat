5|$|This {{still left}} {{the problem of}} getting {{government}} support for uranium research. Another friend of Szilárd's, the Austrian economist Gustav Stolper, suggested approaching Alexander Sachs, who had access to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sachs told Szilárd that he had already spoken to the President about uranium, but that Fermi and Pegram had reported that the prospects for building an atomic bomb were remote. He told Szilárd that he would deliver the letter, but suggested that <b>it</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> someone more prestigious. For Szilárd, Einstein was again the obvious choice. Sachs and Szilárd drafted a letter riddled with spelling errors and mailed it to Einstein.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the more}} {{surprising}} and, perhaps, counterintuitive (from a neo-Darwinian viewpoint) results of recent research in evolutionary developmental biology {{is that the}} diversity of body plans and morphology in organisms across many phyla are not necessarily reflected in diversity {{at the level of}} the sequences of genes, including those of the developmental genetic toolkit and other genes involved in development. Indeed, as John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner have noted, there is an apparent paradox: [...] "where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change". So, if the observed morphological novelty between different clades does not come from changes in gene sequences (such as by mutation), where does <b>it</b> <b>come</b> <b>from?</b> Novelty may arise by mutation-driven changes in gene regulation.|$|E
2500|$|Could the SCF just end? This is {{difficult}} to comprehend. [...] If there is displacement along this fault, where did <b>it</b> <b>come</b> <b>from?</b> [...] To quote Wyld et al. (albeit {{in the context of}} a different fault): [...] "it cannot just end". [...] Although the SCF has had substantial strike-slip displacement, [...] claim that final major movement on the SCF (about 40 Ma ago) was dominantly dip-slip (vertical displacement). [...] So perhaps the displacement came from the depths, and, as it was extruded, was eroded and redistributed as sediments. [...] But this has not been established.|$|E

2500|$|Nobody's Daughter was {{released}} on April 26, 2010 worldwide on Mercury Records, and was received by music critics with moderately positive acclaim. Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars, but noted [...] " [...] was an absolute monster vocalist in the nineties, the greatest era ever for rock singers... She doesn't have that power in her lungs anymore – barely a trace. But at least she remembers, and that means something in itself." [...] The magazine also referred to the album as [...] "not a true success", but a [...] "noble effort". Love's voice, which had been noticeably raspier (likely due to years of scream-singing, drug abuse, and smoking) was compared {{to the likes of}} Bob Dylan. NME gave the album a 6/10 rating, and Robert Christgau rated it an [...] "A-", saying, [...] "Thing is, I can use some new punk rage in my life, and unless you're a fan of Goldman Sachs and BP Petroleum, so can you. What's more, better <b>it</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a 45-year-old woman who knows how to throw her weight around than from the zitty newbies and tattooed road dogs who churn most of it out these days. I know—for her, BP Petroleum is just something else to pretend about. But the emotion fueling her pretense is cathartic nevertheless." [...] In support of the release, Hole toured extensively between 2010 and 2012 throughout North America and Europe, as well as performing in Japan, Russia, and Brazil.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{suggested}} etymologies {{for the name}} [...] "Karašica". It's not explainable in Croatian.

One explanation is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Indo-European words *yow and *h2elut, so that it means [...] "magical beer." [...] The other, more likely, is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Indo-European roots *yow and *h2elom, so that it means [...] "magical herb", whatever plant that signified.
