40|$|Summary: What {{is known}} and objective: Safety of the {{anti-inflammatory}} drug <b>flurbiprofen</b> is comparable {{with that of}} other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs of the propionic acid class, which are commonly associated with gastrointestinal and renal side effects. Here we report {{a case of a}} fatal hypersensitivity reaction to an oral spray of <b>flurbiprofen</b> taken for sore throat. Case summary: A 29 -year-old man came to the emergency care unit reporting sore throat with an intense burning sensation associated with fever. Pharyngotonsillitis was diagnosed, and local treatment with oral <b>flurbiprofen</b> spray was prescribed. Immediately after using the spray, the patient experienced a severe reaction characterized by serious dyspnoea, followed by death. The cause of death was heart failure with acute asphyxia from oedema of the glottis. The cause of death was concluded to be hypersensitivity to <b>flurbiprofen</b> spray. What is new and conclusion: Oral propionic acid derivatives have been associated with a relatively high frequency of allergic reactions. However, allergy to <b>flurbiprofen</b> has rarely been documented. Scientific literature reports two relevant cases of hypersensitivity reaction to flurbiprofen: in one case, a patient presented with a maculopapular rash 48 h after having taken oral <b>flurbiprofen</b> followed by angio-oedema and hypotension.

40|$|PURPOSE. The in vivo {{plasma protein}} binding and {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>flurbiprofen</b> were studied in awake, unrestrained rats using intravenous microdialysis sampling. METHODS. <b>Flurbiprofen</b> (20 mg/kg) was administered i. v. to 2 groups of 6 rats: {{in both groups}} sampling {{was carried out by}} microdialysis, but in the second group an additional 10 blood samples were withdrawn via a jugular cannula. In vitro and ex vivo (following i. v. administration of <b>flurbiprofen</b> 20 mg/kg to another group of 13 rats) plasma protein binding of the drug was determined by equilibrium dialysis. RESULTS. The area under the unbound plasma concentration-time profile of <b>flurbiprofen</b> (AUCu), determined by microdialysis sampling was somewhat smaller (- 19 %, p = 0. 666) in the rats undergoing simultaneous serial blood sampling (2. 21 +/- 0. 36 micrograms. h/ml) as compared to the rats undergoing microdialysis sampling only (2. 73 +/- 0. 60 micrograms. h/ml). Comparison of total and unbound concentrations of <b>flurbiprofen</b> showed an in vivo plasma binding varying between 99. 5 % at low and 98. 0 % at high total <b>flurbiprofen</b> plasma concentrations. Plasma binding of <b>flurbiprofen</b> determined in vitro over the same concentration range was higher (99. 5 - 99. 9 %) but also concentration-dependent.

40|$|Nitric oxide {{has been}} {{reported}} to have paradoxical effects in experimental endotoxic shock, contributing to the hemodynamic consequences of endotoxin administration, but apparently protecting the gastrointestinal mucosa. A novel class of nitric oxide-releasing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derivatives has recently been described which exert anti-inflammatory activities but produce significantly less gastrointestinal injury than the parent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs from which they are derived. Thus, the present study was performed {{to determine the effects of}} one of these derivatives, <b>flurbiprofen</b> 4 -nitroxybutylester, compared to the native nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, <b>flurbiprofen,</b> in an experimental model of endotoxic shock. Intravenous administration of endotoxin from Salmonella typhosa to rats pretreated with <b>flurbiprofen</b> produced a profound decrease in systemic arterial blood pressure, an increase in hematocrit and extensive gastric and small intestinal damage.

In both cases, conventional blood sampling and sc microdialysis sampling were simultaneously performed. The microdialysates were analyzed on-line by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Naproxen, which was shown to have a similar in vivo loss by retrodialysis as <b>flurbiprofen</b> (71. 5 0. 9 % and 71. 0 0. 8 % respectively, n 3), was used to continuously monitor probe recovery.
