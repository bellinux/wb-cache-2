5|$|Cho {{was able}} to pass both {{background}} checks and successfully complete both <b>handgun</b> purchases after he presented to the gun dealers his U.S. permanent residency card, his Virginia driver's permit to prove legal age and length of Virginia residence and a checkbook showing his Virginia address, in addition to waiting the required 30-day period between each gun purchase. He was successful at completing both <b>handgun</b> purchases {{because he did not}} disclose on the background questionnaire that a Virginia court had ordered him to undergo outpatient treatment at a mental health facility.|$|E
5|$|During {{the scene}} at the town hall, several {{citizens}} are seen stroking guns: Smithers has a revolver, an unidentified woman also has a revolver, Moe has a shotgun, Skinner has a semi-automatic <b>handgun</b> with a suppressor attached, and Barney has a derringer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Handguns</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly popular for hunting. Intended to be fired {{with one or two}} hands, but lacking a shoulder support, <b>handguns</b> are more challenging to shoot accurately than a long gun (a rifle or shotgun). Hunting <b>handguns</b> differ from defensive <b>handguns</b> in a number of ways; hunting <b>handguns</b> usually have longer barrels, better sights (often mounting telescopic sights or red dot sights), and, depending on the game, will fire a much more powerful cartridge. Rimfire hunting <b>handguns</b> can be of any action type, but centerfire hunting <b>handguns</b> are dominated by the single shot and revolver actions, such as the Thompson Center Arms Contender.|$|R

5|$|Another small-bore cannon of the 14th {{century was}} the culverin, whose name derives from the snake-like handles {{attached}} to it. It was transitional between the <b>handgun</b> and the full cannon, and {{was used as an}} anti-personnel weapon. The culverin was forged of iron and fixed to a wooden stock, and usually placed on a rest for firing.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Hahneman used a <b>handgun</b> {{to hijack}} an Eastern Airlines 727 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in May, demanded $303,000, and {{eventually}} parachuted into Honduras, his country of birth.

He was a gun rights supporter who voted against the Brady <b>Handgun</b> Violence Prevention Act and Federal Assault Weapons Ban.|$|E
5000|$|Restricted {{firearms}} include, but are {{not limited}} to, <b>handguns.</b> All <b>handguns</b> are, at a minimum, restricted in Canada. Many <b>handguns</b> (common in the United States) are prohibited firearms in Canada, as their barrel length is 105 mm or less, or they are a prohibited calibre (.25 and [...]32).|$|R

50|$|Although most <b>handguns</b> {{can be used}} as long as {{they have}} no {{compensator}} or optic, the same equipment which is used in Limited is also popular in Limited-10. Like in Limited, double stack <b>handguns</b> can have a magazine length of 141.25 mm and single stack <b>handguns</b> (i.e. the 1911) can be used with 171.25 mm magazines. However double-stack pistols like the 2011 seem to be preferred over single stack models due to easier mag changes, and single stack <b>handguns</b> are therefore naturally more competitive in the Single Stack Division where they compete against other single stack <b>handguns.</b> As with Limited, shooters must use a 10 mm caliber or larger bullet in order to score a major power factor.|$|R

5|$|At the airport, Cole {{leaves a}} last message telling the {{scientists}} that in following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys {{they are on}} the wrong track, and that he will not return. He is soon confronted by Jose, an acquaintance from his own time, who gives Cole a <b>handgun</b> and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders. At the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters, and recognizes him from a newspaper photograph as an assistant at Goines' father's virology lab. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks.|$|E

5|$|During the {{daylight}} hours, Jericho's powers are gone, {{so he has}} to fight as a normal human, using a wide variety of weaponry, from a Darkwatch's standard-issue 24-shot Redeemer <b>handgun</b> to a crossbow firing explosive arrows and a rocket launcher, as well as melee combat. In some missions, Jericho can drive a Gatling gun-equipped Coyote Steamwagon vehicle; using it or a horse changes perspective to the third-person view. During horse-riding rail shooter sequences, Jericho is granted unlimited ammunition and high attack speed, at the cost of only being able to use the Redeemer.|$|E

5|$|Newspapers {{across the}} country defended the union workers, and the trio decided to assassinate Frick.

Berkman's plan was to assassinate Frick and then kill himself; Goldman was to explain Berkman's motives after his death; and Aronstam was to follow Berkman {{in the event that}} he failed in his mission. Emulating his Russian idols, Berkman tried to make a bomb, but when that failed, he went to Pittsburgh with the plan to use a <b>handgun.</b>|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v. Heller {{that the}} city's 1976 <b>handgun</b> ban {{violated}} {{the right to}} keep and bear arms as protected under the Second Amendment. However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E
5000|$|However, in 2013 the Texas DPS {{decided to}} replace their [...]357 SIG <b>handguns</b> with 9mm <b>handguns.</b> The {{ability to carry}} more rounds per {{magazine}} (9mm vs[...]357 SIG) in a lighter gun were among the stated reasons for the change.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} types of {{firearms}} used in firearm suicides in Iowa and tests {{the hypothesis that the}} use of <b>handguns,</b> rifles, and shotguns in such suicides reflects the availability of these weapons. The percentage of firearm suicides involving <b>handguns</b> increased from 36. 6 % in 1980 through 1984 to 43. 3 % during 1990 and 1991. In both time periods, the use of <b>handguns</b> was more likely than would be expected from their household prevalence. Our data suggest that <b>handguns</b> are disproportionately represented among firearm suicides and that this overrepresentation has increased during the last decade...|$|R

5|$|One {{group of}} Corregidor prisoners, before first {{entering}} the camp, had each hidden {{a piece of}} a radio under their clothing, to later be reassembled into a working device. When the Japanese had an American radio technician fix their radios, he stole parts. The prisoners thus had several radios to listen to newscasts on radio stations as far away as San Francisco, allowing the POWs to hear about the status of the war. A smuggled camera was used to document the camp's living conditions. Prisoners also constructed weapons and smuggled ammunition into the camp for the possibility of securing a <b>handgun.</b>|$|E
