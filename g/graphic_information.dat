40|$|<b>Information</b> <b>{{graphics}}</b> are non-pictorial graphics such as {{bar charts}} and line graphs that depict attributes of entities and relations among entities. Most <b>information</b> <b>graphics</b> appearing in popular media have a communicative goal or intended message; consequently, <b>information</b> <b>graphics</b> constitute {{a form of}} language. This paper argues that <b>information</b> <b>graphics</b> are a valuable knowledge resource that should be retrievable from a digital library and that such graphics {{should be taken into}} account when summarizing a multimodal document for subsequent indexing and retrieval. But to accomplish this, the <b>information</b> <b>graphic</b> must be understood and its message recognized. The paper presents our Bayesian system for recognizing the primary message of one kind of <b>information</b> <b>graphic</b> (simple bar charts) and discusses the potential role of an <b>information</b> <b>graphic’s</b> message in indexing graphics and summarizing multimodal documents...|$|R
40|$|<b>Information</b> <b>{{graphics}}</b> (non-pictorial graphics such as {{bar charts}} and line graphs) {{are an important}} component of multimodal documents. When <b>information</b> <b>graphics</b> appear in popular media, such as newspapers and magazines, they generally have a message that they are intended to convey. This chapter addresses the problem of understanding such <b>information</b> <b>graphics.</b> The chapter presents a corpus study that shows the importance of taking <b>information</b> <b>graphics</b> into account when processing a multimodal document. It then presents a Bayesian network approach to identifying the message conveyed by one kind of <b>information</b> <b>graphic,</b> simple bar charts, along with an evaluation of the graph understanding system.

50|$|Identifiable victims, {{as their}} name suggests, have {{features}} {{that make them}} identifiable. Details about their predicament, family background, educational history, etc, are shared through the media and brought to public attention. The stories are emotional, with victims often portrayed as innocent and helpless. Images and videos of the victim are often shared, and the public is able to follow the victim’s predicament in real-time. Studies have previously indicated that people respond more to concrete, <b>graphic</b> <b>information</b> than abstract, statistical information. Therefore, identifiable victims elicit greater reactions from people than statistical victims.|$|E

50|$|According to the LINCS website, {{the role}} of word {{recognition}} results in differences between the habits of adults and the habits of children learning how to read. For non-literate adults learning to read, many rely more on word recognition than on phonics and word analysis. Poor readers with prior knowledge concerning the target words can recognize words and make fewer errors than poor readers with no prior knowledge. Instead of blending sounds of individual letters, adult learners {{are more likely to}} recognize words automatically. However, this can lead to errors when a similarly spelled, yet different word, is mistaken for one the reader is familiar with. Errors such as these are considered to be due to the learner's experiences and exposure. Younger and newer learners tend to focus more on the implications from the text and rely less on background knowledge or experience. Poor readers with prior knowledge utilize the semantic aspects of the word, whereas proficient readers rely on only <b>graphic</b> <b>information</b> for word recognition. However, practice and improved proficiency tend to lead to a more efficient use of combining reading ability and background knowledge for effective word recognition.|$|E
5000|$|The graphophonemic cues {{are related}} to the sounds we hear (the phonological system {{including}} individual letters and letter combinations), the letters of the alphabet, and the conventions of spelling, punctuation and print. Students who are emerging readers use these cues considerably. However, in the English language there is a very imprecise relationship between written symbols and sound symbols. [...] Sometimes the relationships and their patterns do not work, as in the example of great and head. Proficient readers and writers draw on their prior experiences with text and the other cueing systems, as well as the phonological system, as their reading and writing develops. Ken Goodman writes that, [...] "The cue systems are used simultaneously and interdependently. What constitutes useful <b>graphic</b> <b>information</b> depends on how much syntactic and semantic information is available. Within high contextual constraints an initial consonant may be all that is needed to identify an element and make possible the prediction of an ensuing sequence or the confirmation of prior predictions." [...] He continues with, [...] "Reading requires not so much skills as strategies that make it possible to select the most productive cues." [...] He believes that reading involves the interrelationship of all the language systems. Readers sample and make judgments about which cues from each system will provide the most useful information in making predictions that will get them to meaning. Goodman provides a partial list of the various systems readers use as they interact with text. Within the graphophonemic system there are: ...|$|E

Moreover, when an article is composed of text and graphics, the intended message of the <b>information</b> <b>graphic</b> (its discourse intention) must {{be integrated into the}} discourse structure of the surrounding text and contributes to the overall discourse intention of the article.
