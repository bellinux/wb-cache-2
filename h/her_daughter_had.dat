5|$|One of Reich's first {{patients}} was Lore Kahn, a 19-year-old woman {{with whom he}} had an affair. Freud had warned analysts not to involve themselves with their patients, but {{in the early days of}} psychoanalysis the warnings went unheeded. According to Reich's diaries, Kahn became ill in November 1920 and died of sepsis after sleeping in a bitterly cold room she had rented as a place for her and Reich to meet (both his landlady and her parents had forbidden their meetings). Kahn's mother suspected that <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>had</b> died after a botched illegal abortion, possibly performed by Reich himself. According to Christopher Turner, she found some of her daughter's bloodied underwear in a cupboard.|$|E
5|$|The {{search and}} rescue efforts for Holloway began immediately. Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined in the effort. During {{the first days of}} the search, the Aruban {{government}} gave thousands of civil servants the day off to participate in the rescue effort. Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline. Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams. Beth Twitty was provided with housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she coincidentally stayed in the same room <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>had</b> occupied.

5|$|Mariam {{lives in}} a kolba on the {{outskirts}} of Herat with her embittered mother. Jalil, her father, is a wealthy businessman who owns a cinema and lives in the town with three wives and nine children. Mariam is his illegitimate daughter, and she is prohibited to live with them, but Jalil visits her every Thursday. On her fifteenth birthday, Mariam wants her father to take her to see Pinocchio at his movie theater, against the pleas of her mother. When he does not show up, she hikes into town and goes to his house. He refuses to see her, and she ends up sleeping on the street. In the morning, Mariam returns home to find that her mother has committed suicide out of fear that <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>had</b> deserted her. Mariam is then taken to live in her father's house. Jalil arranges for her to be married to Rasheed, a shoemaker from Kabul who is thirty-years her senior. In Kabul, Mariam becomes pregnant seven successive times, but is never able to carry a child to term. This is a sad, disquieting reality for both Rasheed and Mariam. Ultimately Rasheed grows more and more despondent over his wife's inability to have a child and particularly a son. As their marriage wears on Rasheed gradually becomes more and more abusive.|$|E
5|$|Shelley, {{who visited}} the toddler Allegra while she was being boarded with a family chosen by Byron, objected to the child's living {{arrangements}} over the years, though he had initially approved of Clairmont's plan to relinquish her to her father. During the summer of 1819, Allegra stayed with four different families and was abandoned by her nursemaid. Byron sent her to stay for long periods with his friend, British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, but Hoppner's wife didn't like Allegra and sent her to stay with three other families in as many months. Though he'd originally agreed to permit Clairmont to visit their daughter, Byron reneged on the agreement. Shelley often tried to persuade Byron to let Clairmont see her daughter and they thought of ways to regain custody of her. Clairmont was alarmed by reports in 1820 that <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>had</b> suffered a malarial-type fever and that Byron had moved her to warm Ravenna {{at the height of}} the summer. Clairmont wrote that Allegra must be moved to a more healthy climate if she was to survive and pleaded with Byron to send their daughter to her in Bagni di Lucca, a town with a cool mountain climate. However, Byron didn't want to send Allegra back to be raised in the Shelley household, where he was sure she'd grow ill from eating a vegetarian diet and would be taught atheism. He pointed out that all of the other children in the Shelley household had died: the Shelleys' first three children had all died young and their fourth child, Elena Adelaide Shelley, died in a foster home in 1820 at age seventeen months.|$|E

25|$|When Dowler {{failed to}} return home, she was {{reported}} missing to the police at 7:00pm. A nationwide search for her followed, with 100 police officers and helicopters searching fields, streets and rivers around Hersham. Detectives who had investigated the abduction of Sarah Payne were called in to help. Police and the Dowler family made many appeals for information, including a reconstruction on Crimewatch UK. The Crimewatch UK appeal included a direct appeal to Dowler {{in the hope that}} she had run away from home of her own accord. A plea was also made by Pop Idol winner Will Young, whose concert Dowler had attended shortly before her disappearance. Dowler's mother expressed hope that <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>had</b> run away, but said that she could not think of a reason why she would want to do so.

25|$|Sex Trafficking/New York: The Flores-Carreto family sex-trafficking ring {{operated}} between Tenancingo, Tlaxcala, Mexico, and Queens, New York, from 1991 to 2004 {{and involved}} brothels in the New York metropolitan area. ICE began its investigation in December 2003 after {{the mother of}} a trafficking victim reported to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City that <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>had</b> been kidnapped and was being held against her will in New York. ICE discovered that male members of the Flores-Carreto family romantically lured young Mexican women to the United States, where they were forced into prostitution through beatings and threats against their children, who were residing with the traffickers' mother in México. Victims who became pregnant were forced to have abortions. In April 2005, Josue Flores-Carreto, Gerardo Flores-Carreto and Daniel Perez Alfonso, a brothel manager, were sentenced to 50, 50, and 25 years imprisonment respectively, for multiple offenses related to forced prostitution. In January 2007, Mexico extradited Consuelo Caretto Valencia, the mother of the Carreto brothers, to the United States, where she was charged with conspiring on sex trafficking and related offenses. On July 22, 2008, she pleaded guilty to sex trafficking and is pending sentencing for that crime. The prosecution {{has been one of the}} largest sex trafficking cases brought under the provisions of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.

She went on to write that she felt ashamed of her adopted country because people like Treitschke and Stoecker [...] "behave so hatefully towards people of a different faith and another race who become an integral part (and by no means the worst) of our nation!". Clad in the uniform of a Prussian field marshal Frederick, together with Victoria, attended a synagogue service in Berlin in 1880 to show support for tolerance in contrast to what Victoria called Treitscke's [...] "disgraceful attacks". Shortly afterward, Frederick gave a speech denouncing the anti-Semitic movement in Germany as [...] "a shameful blot on our time", adding that [...] "We are ashamed of the Judenhetze which has broken all bounds of decency in Berlin, but which seems to flourish under the protection of the Court clerics." [...] In 1881, Frederick and Victoria again attended a synagogue service, this time in Wiesbaden [...] "to demonstrate as clearly as we can what our convictions are". Frederick followed this up by giving a speech in which he spoke out for [...] "poor, ill-treated Jews" [...] of Europe. Frederick's mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, wrote to thank him for his speech, saying she was proud that <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>had</b> married someone like him, but within Junker circles, Frederick was widely criticised for his actions in support of the Jews. Prominent among the Crown Prince's critics was his eldest son, Prince Wilhelm, who called his father a weak, cowardly man controlled by his British mother and the Jews.
