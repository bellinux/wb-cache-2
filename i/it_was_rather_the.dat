2500|$|Three other Rainbow chapters, at the University of Tennessee, at Emory and Henry College, and at Chamberlain-Hunt Academy (a preparatory school) were {{unwanted}} by Delta Tau Delta and the Rainbow Fraternity {{withdrew the}} charters from those chapters {{so they would}} not be included in the consolidation (many of the Emory and Henry Rainbows joined the local chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon). In the end, the Delta Tau Delta-Rainbow merger resulted in the larger fraternity only acquiring the Rainbow chapters at the University of Mississippi and Vanderbilt University, a process that became official in early 1886. At least one observer at the time questioned whether the Rainbow Fraternity had, in fact, merged with Delta Tau Delta or <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> case that two of its chapters had simply bolted Rainbow for the Delts. The heart of {{the question is whether the}} charters of Tennessee, Emory and Henry, and Chamberlain-Hunt had been legitimately revoked. The secret nature of the Rainbow constitution makes a more thorough assessment impossible.|$|E

60|$|Miss Frost {{said very}} little. But she had serious {{confidential}} talks with Dr. Fordham. Dr. Fordham didn't approve, certainly he didn't--but neither {{did he see}} any great harm in it.

60|$|It must not, however, be {{supposed}} {{that this was}} Marian's abiding frame of mind; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> temper which was infused into her by each successive visit to Selina during the next three years.

60|$|A kindly man, he was {{extremely}} averse to any measure which would plunge his tenants into distress, and especially in cases where {{there had been no}} question of opposition between himself and them. But, reduced to its essentials, the matter stood thus: Apart from that particular quarry the Pendridny estate was not only a going, but even a profitable concern, supporting itself and supplying some of the sinews of war towards Valleys House and the racing establishment at Newmarket and other general expenses; with this quarry still running, allowing for the upkeep of Pendridny, and the provision of pensions to superannuated servants, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> other way.|$|E

6000|$|The {{region in}} which the {{paternal}} hamlet of Somersby lies, [...] "a land of quiet villages, large fields, grey hillsides, and noble tall-towered churches, on the lower slope of a Lincolnshire wold," [...] {{does not appear to}} have been rich in romantic legend and tradition. The folk-lore of Lincolnshire, of which examples have been published, does seem to have a peculiar poetry of its own, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> humorous than the poetical aspect of the country-people that Tennyson appears to have known. In brief, we have nothing to inform us as to how genius came into that generation of Tennysons which was born between 1807 and 1819. A source and a cause there must have been, but these things are hidden, except from popular science.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, in the frosty {{twilight}} {{of the spring}} morning, though Henry was now clad in his usual garb, sleeplessness, sorrow, and fasting made him as wan and haggard as any ascetic monk; his eyes were sunken, and his closed lips bore a stern fixed expression, which scarcely softened even when the sacrificial rite struck the notes of praise; and though a light came into his eye, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> devotion of one who had offered himself, than the gleam of hopeful exultation. The horses stood saddled at the west door, for Henry was feverishly eager to reach Pontefract, where {{he had left his}} queen, and wished to avoid the delay of breaking his fast at York, but only to snatch a meal at some country hostel on his way.|$|E

As yet weakness and fever, and pain, had scarcely begun their work of hollowing the cheeks and reducing him to a shadow of himself. There was already scarcely a tinge of color in his face, while there was a drawn look round the mouth and a bluish tinge on the lips. The eyes seemed deeper in the head and the expression of the face greatly changed--indeed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> lack of any expression that characterized it. It might have been a waxen mask.|$|E
50|$|Native Dagbani {{speakers}} {{assert that}} Dagbani is mutually intelligible with Dagaare, Frafra, Mamprusi, and Wali, {{but in the}} case of Dagaare, Frara and Wali <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> case that many people can understand some of a language which is not their mother tongue.

50|$|Of course, artistic talent enters decisively!

6000|$|The peculiarity, then, of {{the myths}} which we propose to call [...] "Heroic and Romantic Tales" [...] (märchen contes populaires), is the absence, as a rule, of any obvious {{explanatory}} purpose.

60|$|What {{he told me}} was not true, nor was it even original; being, indeed, but a new edition, vamped {{up again}} by village ignorance and superstition, of stories nearly as ancient as the race of man. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> {{application}} that appalled me. In the old days, he said, the Church would have burned out that nest of basilisks; but {{the arm of the}} Church was now shortened; his friend Miguel had been unpunished by the hands of men, and left to the more awful judgment of an offended God. This was wrong; but it should be so no more. The Padre was sunk in age; he was even bewitched himself; but the eyes of his flock were now awake to their own danger; and some day--ay, and before long--the smoke of that house should go up to heaven.|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, late as it was, Colonel Barrington and {{his chief}} lieutenant, Gordon Dane, {{sat in his}} log-walled smoking-room talking with a man he sold his wheat through in Winnipeg. The room was big and bare. There were a few fine heads of {{antelope}} upon the walls, and beneath them an armory of English-made shotguns and rifles, while a row of silver-mounted riding crops, and some handled with ivory, stood in a corner. All these represented amusement, while two or three treatises on veterinary surgery and agriculture, lying amidst English stud-books and racing records, presumably stood for industry. The comparison was significant, and Graham, the Winnipeg wheat-broker, noticed it as he listened patiently to the views of Colonel Barrington, who nevertheless worked hard enough in his own fashion. Unfortunately <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> fashion of the English gentleman than that common on the prairie.|$|E
6000|$|These {{reflections}} oppressed me {{from the}} second or third day of my distemper, and in the violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience, extorted some words from me, like praying to God, though I cannot say they were either a prayer attended with desires, or with hopes; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> voice of mere fright and distress; my thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable condition, raised vapours into my head with the mere apprehensions; and, in these hurries of my soul, I knew not what my tongue might express: but it was rather exclamation, such as, [...] "Lord! what a miserable creature am I! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help, and what will become of me!" [...] Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good while.|$|E
5000|$|Neither {{a thought}} nor an emotion, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> steady {{conscious}} realization of reality's transience. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{the ground for}} wisdom and freedom and the protector of compassion and love.

2500|$|Influenced by seminal {{works of}} science fiction, the transhumanist {{vision of a}} {{transformed}} future humanity has attracted many supporters and detractors {{from a wide range}} of perspectives, including philosophy and religion.

50|$|In this example, the {{correlation}} (simultaneity) between windmill activity and wind velocity {{does not imply}} that wind is caused by windmills. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> other way around, as suggested by the fact that wind doesn’t need windmills to exist, while windmills need wind to rotate. Wind can be observed in places where there are no windmills or non-rotating windmills—and there are good reasons to believe that wind existed before the invention of windmills.|$|R
