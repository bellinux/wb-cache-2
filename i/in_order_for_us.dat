25|$|Another part of {{restructuring}} the movement comes from education; bell hooks {{points out that}} there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do not want to hear from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer {{like the rest of the}} masses. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to achieve equality, people must be able to learn from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, then there will be more success and less inequality.|$|E

However, Blumer also deviated from Mead's work.
