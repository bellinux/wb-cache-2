40|$|We {{propose a}} theory of the {{dynamics}} of polymers in dilute solution, in which the popular Zimm and Rouse models are just the limiting cases of an infinitely large and small draining parameter. The equation of motion for the polymer segments (beads) is solved together with Brinkman’s equation for the solvent velocity that takes into account the presence of other polymer coils in the solution. The equation for the polymer normal modes is obtained and the relevant time correlation functions are found. A tendency to the time-dependent hydrodynamic screening is demonstrated on the diffusion of the polymers {{as well as on the}} relaxation of their internal modes. With the growing concentration of the coils in the solution, they both show a transition to the exactly Rouse behaviour. The shear viscosity of the solution, the <b>Huggins</b> <b>coefficient</b> and other quantities are calculated and shown to be notably different from the known results...|$|E

Swelling changes polymers’ elastic properties of which the plate is made, changes the scan point sizes that, in the final analysis, affects the printing product quality. The kinetics of swelling flexographic plate polymer interaction with low-molecular liquids used {{in the process of}} plate production and operation was studied. Constants of speed, parameters Flory - <b>Huggins,</b> diffusion <b>coefficient</b> D for each solvent was determined. The changes of the basic thermodynamic functions ΔG, ΔS, ΔH of swelling, are calculated. The received data allow to choose the optimum solvents for processes of polygraphic technology...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} two-dimensional van der Waals equation {{model was}} {{proposed for the}} prediction of multicomponent gas–solid adsorp-tion isotherms from corresponding single-component adsorption equilibrium data. The model was used to predict adsorption iso-therms of CO–CO 2 mixtures and CO 2 –N 2 mixtures on Cu(I) –NaY zeolite. Experimental adsorption equilibrium data of the two sys-tems were compared with results calculated from the model and three other models in the literature: the ideal adsorbed solution model, the vacancy solution theory of adsorption using the Flory– <b>Huggins</b> activity <b>coefficient</b> equation, and the two-dimensional van der Waals equation. The {{results indicated that the}} modified van der Waals equation predicted the experimental results better than the three other models for the two systems studied, especially for the CO–CO 2 system, which involved chemical reaction during adsorption and exhibited azeotropic behavior. © 1998 Academic Press Key Words: gas adsorption; isotherm; zeolite; equation of state...|$|R
40|$|Rheological {{properties}} of isotropic solutions and gel structures of lysozyme-sodium dodecyl sulfate mixtures in water are investigated. Isotropic solutions behave as Newtonian fluids with very low viscosity values. For the lysozyme solutions the intrinsic viscosity and the <b>Huggins</b> <b>coefficient</b> were calculated {{on the basis}} of the Mooney equation. Above a certain yield stress value, the viscosity of the gel samples decreases continuously in the whole range of the shear rate. Dynamic rheological experiments show weak gel behavior where the storage modulus and the loss modulus are almost parallel and are frequency-dependent. A belated gel stage with very slow kinetics has been characterized. There is a substantial enhancement of the gel strength by ageing since the belated gel stage manifests a higher yield stress value and a higher storage modulus than the initial gel stage. The gels are stable in the temperature range between 10 and 32 degreesC...|$|E
40|$|The {{steady-state}} shear viscosity of low-concentrated Poly(2 -ethyl- 2 -oxazoline) (PEOX) aqueous solutions {{is measured}} near the presumed theta temperature using the falling ball viscometry technique. The experimental data are analyzed within {{the model that}} joins the Rouse and Zimm bead-spring theories of the polymer dynamics at the theta condition, {{which means that the}} polymer coils are considered to be partially permeable to the solvent. The polymer characteristics thus depend on the draining parameter h that is related to the strength of the hydrodynamic interaction between the polymer segments. The <b>Huggins</b> <b>coefficient</b> was found to be 0. 418 at the temperature 20 °C, as predicted by the theory. This value corresponds to h = 2. 92, contrary to the usual assumption of the infinite h. This result indicates that the theta temperature for the PEOX water solutions is 20 °C rather than 25 °C in the previous studies. The experimental intrinsic viscosity is well described coming from the Arrhenius equation for the shear viscosity...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{concerns with}} the potential adverse biological effects of subchoronic exposure of male rats to low intensity Static Magnetic Field (SMF) on the biophysical properties of hemoglobin (Hb) molecule as well as possible genotoxic effects on DNA stability. Animals were equally divided into four groups: control group and three groups exposed to 3 mT SMF for different time intervals, the last group was used for delayed effect study. The viscometric and refractometry measurements for Hb (intrinsic viscosity, <b>Huggins</b> <b>coefficient,</b> slope and refractive index) {{as well as the}} DNA alteration in somatic and germ tissues using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method were carried out for all groups. The results revealed a remarkable change in viscometric and refractometry measurements in exposed animals indicating change in the molecular shape and dimensions of Hb and its protein conformation. Also, the data indicated changes in RAPD profiles in DNA isolated from germ tissue in exposed animals. In contrast the same treatment failed to induce DNA damage in somatic tissue. The results showed the dependence of SMF biological effect on the period of exposure. The data also revealed no sign of changes in all studies carried out on Hb and DNA for animals of delayed effect experiment indicating that the damage induced in Hb molecule and DNA isolated from testis were fully recovered or repaired and/or non cumulative effect of magnetic field...|$|E
40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{theory for}} the viscoelastic behaviour of suspensions of rigid rods with excluded volume interactions is presented, which is valid in the asymptotic limit of {{very long and}} thin rods. Stresses arising from translational and rotational Brownian motion and direct interactions are calculated for concentrations up to (L/D) (with L the length; D, {{the thickness of the}} rods; and their volume fraction). It is argued that for very long and thin rods, contributions to the stress arising from hydrodynamic interactions vanish asymptotically with increasing aspect ratio relative to the single particle contribution. As will be discussed, this is supported by calculations of Shaqfeh and Fredrickson (Phys. Fluids A 2 (1990) 7), although convergence to negligible hydrodynamics interactions with increasing aspect ratio is very slow (for aspect ratios larger than ≈ 50, the contribution of hydrodynamic interactions to the stress is at most ≈ 20 %). It is argued that the pair-correlation function is in good approximation given by the Boltzmann exponential of the pair-interaction potential. The neglect of hydrodynamic interactions {{and the use of the}} Boltzmann exponential approximation for the pair-correlation function allows the microscopic evaluation of stresses in terms of concentration and the orientation order parameter tensor to within a Ginzburg–Landau expansion up to third order, without having to resort to thermodynamic arguments. The orientational order parameter tensor in turn is obtained from an equation of motion that is derived from the N-particle Smoluchowski equation. The resulting expression for the stress tensor and the equation of motion are similar to, but also in some respects significantly differing from, the well known theory due to Doi, Edward and Kuzuu. Analytic expressions are derived for linear and leading order non-linear, viscoelastic response functions. It is found that the zero shear viscosity varies linearly in concentration. The <b>Huggins</b> <b>coefficient</b> vanishes like the square of the shear-rate. Such a linear concentration dependence of the zero shear viscosity for very long and thin rods is also found in simulations by Claeys and Brady (J. Fluid Mech. 251 (1993) 443) and Yamane et al. (J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 54 (1994) 405) for the long rods, but is in contradiction with the Berry–Russel theory (J. Fluid Mech. 180 (1987) 475), where interactions are treated in an approximate, orientationally pre-averaged fashion. In addition, we find a Maxwellian frequency dependence of response functions at zero shear-rate. Highly non-linear viscoelastic response functions at higher shear-rates are computed numerically. Among other things, we find normal stress differences that do not change sign as a function of shear-rate and higher order harmonic response functions that are qualitatively different for the paranematic and nematic states...|$|E
