40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} {{in the field of}} biomaterials engineering is the replication of the non-linear elasticity of soft tissues. In this PhD thesis project, non-linearly elastic biomaterials have been successfully fabricated from a chemically cross-linked elastomeric poly (glycerol sebacate) (PGS) and thermoplastic poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). PGS/PLLA <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> were fabricated using the core/shell electrospinning technique and the spun fibrous materials, containing a PGS core and PLLA shell, demonstrated J-shaped stress-strain curves, having ultimate tensile strength, rupture elongation, and stiffness constants comparable to muscle tissue properties. In vitro evaluations have shown that the PGS/PLLA fibrous biomaterials possess excellent biocompatibility, and are capable of supporting human stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes over several weeks in culture or supports, and they can foster the growth of enteric neural crest (ENC) progenitor cells. Controlled enzymatic degradation is a major requirement of polyester implants in vivo and excessively rapid degradation speed is the major drawback for PGS. In vitro degradation of PGS/PLLA core/shell <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> were explored in tissue culture medium with and without enzyme, and were compared with cast PGS sheets. Both pH change and weight loss results have proved that the degradation rates of these core/shell <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> are much slower than PGS sheet in media with or without enzyme. It has been previously shown that aligned <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> can guide neurite and stem cell growth along the aligned fibres. Therefore in this project, aligned PGS/PLLA core/shell <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> collected on a rotating drum under different rotational speeds were fabricated, and their alignment and mechanical properties measured. The stiffness of <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> dramatically increased with higher rotation speed, while UTS elongation and resilience initially increased with the degree of alignment, but then decreased. PLLA cannot be easily removed by solvent dissolution and so pure PGS <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> could not be obtained from PGS/PLLA core/shell <b>fibre</b> <b>mats.</b> However more pure PGS porous mats were fabricated by dissolution of the water soluble poly (vinyl alcohol) shell surrounding the PGS core in core-shell electrospun <b>fibres,</b> and these <b>mats</b> were studied. For these experiments, a different PGS was synthesized with a stoichiometric glycerol:sebacic acid ratio of 2 : 3 (rather than the more common 1 : 1 ratio) and it was found that this overcame the rapid degradation kinetics normally found with 1 : 1 PGS. Tensile tests showed these porous PGS 2 : 3 mats had superior mechanical properties than cast PGS 2 : 3 polymers and they demonstrated J-shaped stress-strain curves when tested in the wet state. In vitro evaluations revealed that the spun porous PGS 2 : 3 have excellent biocompatibility...|$|R

One of those detectors is the LHCb experiment which was specifically designed for the study of heavy hadrons containing bottom and charm quarks (heavy flavour physics). To deal with the increased beam energy and instantaneous luminosity of the LHC after the Long Shutdown 2 in 2018 / 19, several subsystems of the LHCb detector have to be exchanged and upgraded. For this purpose, a new tracking system that will replace the so-called Inner and Outer Tracker of the current detector is currently being developed and built.

The fibres are arranged in six-layered <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> which are read out with the help of silicon photomultipliers {{at the edge of the}} tracker’s acceptance.

Among others, the tracking stations, currently realised as silicon strip and drift tube detectors, {{will be replaced by}} the Scintillating Fibre (SciFi) Tracker. The SciFi Tracker is based on scintillating fibres with a diameter of $\text 250 \mu m$, read out by multichannel silicon photomultipliers. The two major challenges related to the fibres are the radiation damage of the light guidance and the production of precise multi-layer <b>fibre</b> <b>mats.</b> This thesis presents radiation hardness studies performed with protons at the tandem accelerator at Forschungszentrum Garching and in situ in the LHCb cavern. The obtained results are combined with additional data of the LHCb SciFi group and two different wavelength dependent models of the radiation induced attenuation are determined. These are used to simulate the relative light yield, for both models it drops to $ 83 \%$ on average {{at the end of the}} nominal lifetime of the SciFi Tracker. A machine and techniques to produce multi-layer <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> were developed and optimised. Procedures for the production and alignment are described. These are implemented in the serial production of the SciFi modules which will start in the second quarter 2016...|$|R
25|$|Strawberries {{are popular}} and {{rewarding}} plants {{to grow in}} the domestic environment, be it for consumption or exhibition purposes, almost anywhere in the world. The best time to plant is in late summer or spring. Plant in full sun or dappled shade, and in somewhat sandy soil. The addition of manure and a balanced fertilizer aids strong growth. Alternatively they can be planted in pots or special planters using compost. <b>Fibre</b> <b>mats</b> placed under each plant will protect fruits from touching the ground, and will act as a weed barrier.|$|R
