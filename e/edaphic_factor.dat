Quadrates methods {{were used to assess}} weed species distribution in relation to <b>edaphic</b> <b>factor</b> and farming practices. Phytosociological attributes such as frequency, relative frequency, density, relative density and Importance Values were measured by placing 9 quadrates (1 × 1 m 2) randomly in each field. Initial results showed that the study area has 29 diverse weed species belonging to 27 genera and 15 families distributed in 585 quadrats. Presence and absence data sheet of 29 weed species and 65 fields were analyzed through PC-ORD version 5. Cluster and Two Way Cluster Analyses initiated four different weed communities with significant indicator species and with respect to underlying environmental variables using data attribute plots. Canonical Correspondence Analyses (CCA) of CANOCO software version 4. 5 was used to assess the environmental gradients of weed species. It is concluded that among all the edaphic factors the strongest variables were higher concentration of potassium, organic matter and sandy nature of soil.

Hierarchical {{analysis was used}} to test the hypothesis that a land unit’s <b>edaphic</b> <b>factors</b> could explain the differences in vegetation responses to grazing. We established the survey sites at increasing distances from a livestock camp or water point within each land unit, then analysed patterns of change in floristic and functional compositions, vegetation volume and soil properties within each land unit to reveal differences in vegetation responses to grazing. We also examined the variations in floristic and functional compositions across land units to identify the <b>edaphic</b> <b>factors</b> that may underlie these differences. Changes in vegetation and soil properties at increasing distances from a camp or water point within each land unit were into three different patterns. Ordination techniques consistently indicated that land unit groups categorised using <b>edaphic</b> <b>factors</b> corresponded to those categorised using response patterns.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} - In Katanga (D. R. Congo), {{outcrops}} of bedrocks naturally enriched in Cu and Co ("copper hills"), host unique plant communities. The spatial variation of vegetation {{has long been}} attributed almost exclusively to variation in Cu concentration in the soil, but this assumption has not been experimentally tested. We analysed the variation in plant communities and the niches of selected species in relation to edaphic factors within a copper hill. Methods - Forty-eight 1 m 2 plots were sampled for plant community and soil mineral element composition, and classifed with Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) using the Bray-Curtis distance. Plant-edaphic relationships were examined using a Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Species niches were modelled with Generalized Additive Model (GAM). Mean edaphic factors between the soil of plant communities were compared with one-way Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric ANOVA. Key results - The diversity of communities at the site scale was higher than observed in previous studies at a larger scale. Cu was the most discriminating <b>edaphic</b> <b>factor</b> of plant communities. However, detailed comparisons of mean edaphic factors among communities revealed individual combinations of edaphic parameters for each community, as well as differences in soil Cu content. High covariation {{appears to be an}} essential trait of the <b>edaphic</b> <b>factor</b> variation of Katangan Cu-rich soils. This makes it diffcult to examine separately the effect of these factors on plant community structures. A bimodal pattern of niche distribution was found for Cu and pH. For physical parameters, niche optima were normally distributed. Conclusions - Global variation in edaphic factors associated with variation in combinations of edaphic parameters generates a highly heterogeneous environment favourable to a high diversity of plant communities over limited areas. Conservation strategies or restoration actions to limit the impact of mining activities on Cu-enriched ecosystems should pay special attention to recreate heterogeneity, taking into account the covariation of edaphic factors. © 2013 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.

40|$|Although {{speciation}} {{has been}} a central focus in evolutionary biology {{for more than a}} century, there are very few case studies where we have a good understanding of the exact forces that may have acted in the diversification of a group of organisms. In order to examine such forces, botanists have often focused on closely related plants that are found under contrasting soil conditions. The study of such edaphically differentiated plants has provided valuable insight to the role of natural selection in evolution. This paper discusses several key studies that have appeared in the literature in the last half century emphasizing the role unusual soil conditions—such as those found on serpentinite out-crops, mine tailings, guano deposits, and salt flats—can play in the diversification of plant species. Many of these studies have not only shown adaptive differentiation in response to various edaphic features, but have also attempted to examine the link between adaptive traits and traits that are directly responsible for reproductive isolation between the divergent taxa. With the advent of novel genetic techniques and an increased understanding of the genetic architecture of various adaptive traits dealing with substrate tolerance, it will soon be possible to demonstrate the central role of the <b>edaphic</b> <b>factor</b> in plant evolution...|$|E

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Soils derived from serpentinite (serpentine soils) often have low {{macronutrient}} con-centrations, exceedingly low Ca:Mg molar ratios and high heavy metal concentrations, typically resulting in sparse vegetative cover. This combined suite of edaphic stresses {{is referred to}} as the “serpentine syndrome. ” Although several plant community-level studies have been conducted to identify the most important <b>edaphic</b> <b>factor</b> limiting plant growth on serpentine, the primary factor identified has often varied by plant community and local climate. Few studies to date have been conducted in serpentine plant communities of alpine or boreal climates. The goal of our study was to determine the primary limiting edaphic factors on plant community species composition and productivity (cover) in the alpine and boreal climate of the Western Alps, Italy. Methods Soil properties and vegetation composition were analyzed for several sites underlain by serpentinite, gabbro, and calc-schist substrates and correlated using direct and indirect statistical methods. Results Boreal forest soils were well-developed and tended to have low pH throughout the soil profile resulting in high Ni availability. Alpine soils, in comparison, were less developed. The distinct ser-pentine plant communities of the Western Alps are most strongly correlated with high levels of bioavail-able Ni associated with low soil pH.

40|$|Edaphic {{factors are}} a strong {{selective}} force in shaping both plant species distributions and the diversification of many lineages. Specifically, adaptation to novel soil environments {{can result in}} species-level changes in floral morphology, phenology, or chemistry, each of which may affect plant reproduction. However, whether floral chemical changes alter plant reproduction following colonization of novel soils is poorly described. In this work, I investigate the effects of soil chemistry on plant chemistry, plant-animal interactions, and pollen-pistil interactions using serpentine-adapted plant species to help {{determine the effects of}} the soil chemical environment on plant reproduction and reproductive isolation. I show that (1) plants accumulate soil metals into vegetative and reproductive organs, as well as into pollen and nectar, (2) floral metal accumulation deters generalist pollinators and filters natural pollinator communities, and (3) floral metal accumulation alters pollen grain germination. These findings have important implications for plant reproduction on metal-rich soils. For example, my research has identified two novel mechanisms through which serpentine soil chemistry may foster reproductive isolation between species or populations growing in disparate soil environments. First, floral metal accumulation may result in pollinator filtering. Specifically, closely related plant species occurring in sympatry that differ in floral metal accumulation may become reproductively isolated through reduced pollinator sharing. Second, floral metal accumulation may provide a mechanism through which gene flow is reduced between serpentine and non-serpentine populations by altering pollen germination and pollen-pistil compatibility. I found that elevated metal concentrations in the pistils of maternal plants limits pollen tube growth towards ovules in non-adapted species. Furthermore, my results suggest that using metal hyperaccumulating plants in phytoremediation should be considered with caution. While I found that generalist pollinators exhibited decreased visitation to Ni-enriched flowers, they still visited these flowers, and therefore likely ingested a potentially toxic resource. If bioaccumulation of heavy metals occurs in plant-pollinator systems near metal-contaminated soils, pollinator populations may become threatened.

The informative estimation of every humidification type is determined for every bird species. Thereby it is definitely a contribution of every gradation of <b>edaphic</b> <b>factor</b> to the structural genesis of dendrophilous bird communities. The strongest informative connection between humidity gradients and the avifauna structure of the wood stands is available in dry edaphotopes for margin representatives and fresh one for typical forest species. These two humidification types play a start function in the structural genesis of some blocks of dendrophilous bird communities per se. It is determined that change of bird species of forest-steppe faunogenetic complex by species from Nemoral complex undergoes in most cases {{on the border of}} the gradient between fresh and humid edaphotopes. For 53 species of birds from dendrophilous complex is was revealed that the importance of different levels of soil moisture has a different impact in shaping of the modern structure dendrophilous avifauna. Dry and especially drily edaphotopes determine the spatial structure of the species that are of forest-steppe origin and belong to the representatives of the optional component of dendrophilous bird communities. Wet edafotopes are involved {{in the formation of the}} spatial structure of species of predominantly immoral origin and relate to the obligate component of representatives of dendrophilous bitd comminities.

Stands rather dry and fresh items currently being the most active formation of the spatial structure of bird communities. In relation to the stands for dryish soil compaction observed populations of species that nest there. The fort stands on fresh soil tend to be the emergence of new species for nesting communities. Despite the small area and the uneven spatial arrangement of belts that are caused the effect of irrigation, there are some places of nesting of small belts for species that occur there only because of the increased level of humidity and the presence of open temporary ponds used by waterbirds. These belts have a ‘hunchback’ profile, caused by the constant flooding, and as a result - a tall and dense stands in the center adjustment of reserve stands caused by the age and condition of vegetation diversity management techniques, moreover the "island" effect becomes characteristic is fewer birds – like dendrophilous. Under present conditions, it does not describe the dendrophilous features for the bird communities in general. Only a few species possess the most biocenotical selectively retain the characteristics inherent to the "island”type populations.

The most common are dark chestnut soils in the north of the reserve bordering the southern black soils. Most belts representing tree plantation reserve, located in dark chestnut soils with low humus content in loess loam. Also, the composition of the physical and chemical properties of soil contributes to some zoogenic factors. In relation to the spatial distribution of birds in the reserve, one of the leading factors of the spectrum is the nature of hydration. Directly or through the woody vegetation it determines the nature of the spatial distribution of bird dendrophilous complexes. Relatively high diversity was registered due to the variety of types of moisturizing various irrigation methods for soils.

Vegetation compositions of different altitudnal zones were also described. Plant communities having first dominant common, were further grouped into four association types (Ebenus stellata association, Artimisia stricta association, Cymbopogon jwarancusa association and Onobrychus cornuta association) which correlated with <b>edaphic</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R
50|$|The main island, Grande Terre hosts {{multiple}} habitats {{under the}} influence of varied precipitation, geology, <b>edaphic</b> <b>factors</b> and altitude. New Caledonia has several biotopes, including dense evergreen forests, maquis shrubland, sclerophyllous forest (dry forest), wetlands, savannas, and halophytic vegetation. The island has two main ecoregions: the greater area is occupied by the eastern New Caledonia rainforest while the now-fragmentary New Caledonia dry forest runs along the west coast.|$|R

The present article presents a field survey of colonization and intensity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) roots from young (5 years old) and old (more than 20 years) plantations. The results observed were explained by seasonality and <b>edaphic</b> <b>factors.</b> Prickly pear roots showed a mycorrhizal frequency (F%) up to 100 % of colonization and a mycorrhizal intensity (M%) that may exceed 70 %. According to ANOVAs, both F% and M% varied significantly between Prickly pear plantation ages, but only M% between seasons. The Generalized linear model showed that <b>edaphic</b> <b>factors</b> {{have no effect on}} the variation of F%. However the statistical model showed that M% were significantly influenced by active CaCO 3, organic matter, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus contents and C/N. Our findings highlight the importance of mycorrhization in rehabilitation programs of degraded rangelands by prickly pear plantations in semiarid and arid lands, particularly during early plant ages and under environmental abiotic stresses such as climate and soil type...|$|R
40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi {{are common}} in moderately saline soil (colonized by Distichlis stricta) in an inland boreal salt pan in north-central Manitoba, but are absent from adjacent soil that is extremely saline (colonized by Puccinellia nuttalliana). In order to determine if this absence {{was due to the}} lack of suitable plant hosts or to <b>edaphic</b> <b>factors,</b> mycorrhizal colonization, vegetation composition, soil salinity and water content were examined along transects between the two vegetation zones. Correlation and principal component analyses revealed that mycorrhizal colonization of P. nuttalliana was positively linked to cover of Distichlis stricta and soil water content, and negatively linked to bare ground. The area closest to the point of salt seepage was uncolonized by mycorrhizal fungi. A transplant experiment confirmed that mycorrhizal fungi are unable to sustain colonization in this area of the salt pan. In this inland salt pan, colonization by mycorrhizal fungi is limited by <b>edaphic</b> <b>factors,</b> and not by the absence of suitable host plants, suggesting that mycorrhizal fungi have a lower limit of salinity tolerance than halophytes such as P. nuttalliana...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} quantitative {{analysis of the}} vegetation and spatial variations of environmental factors controlling the abundance and distribution of vegetation in canal and drain banks in the Nile Delta region of Egypt. Five vegetation groups have been recognized: group A codominated by Arundo donax and Polygonum equisetiforme, group B codominated by Rumex dentatus and Polypogon monspeliensis, group C dominated by Eichhornia crassipes, group D codominated by Phragmites australis and Echinochloa stagnina and group E dominated by Typha domingensis. The total number of weeds recorded {{in the study area}} is 113 species belonging to 36 families. Therophytes (48. 67 %) and geophytes (14. 16 %) are the most frequent life-forms. The major chorotypes in the study area are Mediterranean (42. 48 %), Cosmpolitan (19. 47 %), Pantropical (13. 27 %) and Palaeotropical (12. 39 %). The relationships between the vegetation gradients and <b>edaphic</b> <b>factors</b> showed that, potassium and sodium cations, potassium adsorption ratio, chlorides, sodium cation adsorption ratio, pH value and water-holding capacity are the main controlling <b>edaphic</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R
