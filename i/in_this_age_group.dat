5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E
5|$|In many {{countries}} {{the rate of}} suicide is highest in the middle-aged or elderly. The absolute number of suicides however is greatest in those between 15 and 29 years old due {{to the number of}} people <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> In the United States it is greatest in Caucasian men older than 80 years, even though younger people more frequently attempt suicide. It is the second most common cause of death in adolescents and in young males is second only to accidental death. In young males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality. In the developing world rates are similar, but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma. In South-East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world, deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females.|$|E

5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the {{association}} between overweight and HRQoL has been reported in Tehranian children during early adolescence. However, the limitations for this study should be noted. Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, we cannot make causal inferences about associations between overweight and HRQoL. Secondly, in the current study BMI was used to determine body weight status of the students, although BMI cannot distinguish between fat and muscle mass and it does not precisely indicate the distribution of body fat; hence, BMI may not be an accurate measure of body fat and indicator of healthy body weight. Moreover, the participants of this study were limited to a representative sample of children residing in north of Tehran, but not the whole city. Hence, to confirm our findings and get more conclusive results, conducting studies that include students from other areas of Tehran is recommended. Finally, there are other important factors that may influence HRQoL in children and adolescents which were not included in the current study; further research is needed to investigate factors associated with poorer HRQoL <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R

25|$|Cardiometabolic risk among {{children}} and adolescents is fueled by the rising prevalence of obesity <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> From 1980 to 2008, rates of obesity have increased from 5% to 10% among preschool children aged 2–5. During the same time period, obesity increased from 6.5% to nearly 20% among 6-11year-olds and from 5% to 18% among adolescents aged 12–19. Hypertension {{among children}} and adolescents has increased by 1% since 1999 and is estimated to affect 3.6% of those aged 3–18. This increase is attributed to the rising number of overweight and obese children. The prevalence of lipid abnormalities among {{children and adolescents}} is also tied to obesity and overweight. Approximately 14% of normal-weight youths aged 12–19 have lipid abnormalities. That figure rises to 22% of overweight youths and nearly 43% of obese youths.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Food {{behaviours}} {{are important}} {{in the context of}} health and obesity. The aim was to explore the environments and food behaviours of a sample of young people in the North East of England to further understanding of the relationship between eating behaviours and environmental context. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with four groups of young people aged 16 - 20 years (n = 40; 28 male, 12 female) between November 2006 and June 2007. Analysis was informed by grounded theory methods and was an iterative process of identifying themes across the transcripts. RESULTS: Topics explored included: their main environment, home food responsibility and cooking, food outside of the home, where food was purchased/obtained and where food was eaten and with whom. Emergent themes included: the value for money in food purchases, time convenience, the car as a means of accessing food and health perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: The complexities of the food environment were illustrated. This work has highlighted the importance of the home food environment and parents, and indicated the importance of factors such as time and cost <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> <b>group's</b> food choices.

Teenagers and young adults are more likely to need hospitalization from injuries than other age groups. While elderly persons are less likely to be injured, they are more likely to die from injuries sustained due to various physiological differences that make it more difficult for the body to compensate for the injuries.

" — Swami Vivekananda In the parlance of the {{nutrition}} scientists pregnant and lactating women, along with children under five, are referred to as the vulnerable groups. This means that they are most susceptible to the ill effects of malnutrition. This is because the nutrient requirements go up tremendously during pregnancy and lactation; in fact, more so in lactation, a fact not always well appreciated by clinicians. Between 15 and 45 years of age, that is, in the 30 year span of reproductive life, an average Indian woman becomes pregnant about 8 times. She may ultimately be left with only 3 · 5 children because the abortion and stillbirth rate is about 15 % (1), infant mortality rate is 122 and death rate of children under five is 18 per 1000. Each live born infant is breast fed generally up to 2 - 3 years, and the milk output is quite substantial in the first 18 · 24 months. Thus, of the total 360 months of reproductive life, 200 months or 50. 60 % of the time is spent in pregnancy and lactation (Table 1).

40|$|We analyse the {{determinants}} of hiring of older employees and examine how policy changes have affected the hiring behaviour of firms. We use linked employer-employee data from Finland in the period 1990 - 2004. This allows us to identify at the plant level employees in different <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> that have been hired {{during the last two}} years, and employees who have exited the plants. We form two measures of age-related hiring rates, relative share of old hires and old hires in relation to the stock of old employees. In descriptive analysis we examine trends in these rates and corresponding exit rates, as well as the plant-level segregation of age-related hiring. Over time the relative share of old hires has been lower than the stock of old employees, but their trends are rather similar, whereas the exit share of the old has varied much more. The hiring of older employees has become somewhat less segregated. Regression analysis shows that larger firms are more likely to hire older employees, but their hiring rates are lower. We have evaluated a reform in the eligibility of unemployment related early-exit channel i. e., increasing the lower <b>age</b> limit for <b>this</b> channel. This policy reform reduced the ease of downsizing the older work force, but at the same it also reduced the costs related to redundancies <b>in</b> <b>this</b> relevant <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> Our difference-in-differences results show some evidence for increased incentive to hire workers who were in an <b>age</b> <b>group</b> that was no longer eligible for the scheme <b>in</b> question. <b>This</b> <b>age</b> <b>group</b> also experienced a decline in the exit rate, especially in larger firms...|$|R
