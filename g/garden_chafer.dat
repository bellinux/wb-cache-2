40|$|Seven-eight {{years ago}} we first {{observed}} very large numbers of Garden Chafers (Phyllopertha horticola) swarming at Rygge Air Station in June and July, attracting large numbers of Black-headed- (Larus ridibundus) and Common Gulls (Larus canus) feeding on these flying beetles. Every summer season since then the Garden Chafers have been present, although in a smaller number in most recent years. The Garden Chafers {{appear to be the}} gulls ’ main food during this swarming, since we once found as many as 281 dead chafers inside the belly and oesophagus of one single Black-headed Gull. The large number of gulls at the Air Station naturally causes a serious hazard to the aviation. After first having been refused by the authorities to treat with insecticidal chemicals against the beetles, we started in 2004 to spray the grass areas along the runway with the biological control agent, Heterohabditis megidis (also known as Nemasys H), a parasitic nematode known to attack and control the larvae of the <b>Garden</b> <b>Chafer</b> living in the soil. In subsequent years both the runway and the two taxiways were sprayed with nematodes. The nematodes seem to have successfully controlled the <b>Garden</b> <b>Chafer,</b> as the number of <b>Garden</b> <b>Chafer</b> larvae in the soi...|$|E

30|$|According to the literature, the Scarabeidae (Coleoptera) species, mainly {{responsible}} for grub damage in Austrian alpine grasslands, are the cockchafers (Melolontha melolontha and M. hippocastani), the <b>garden</b> <b>chafer</b> (Phyllopertha horticola) and, {{to a lesser}} degree, the June beetle (Amphimallon solstitiale; Pötsch et al. 1997, Traugott 2003, Strasser 2004 a, Keller and Zimmermann 2005). Keller (2004) reported A. solstitiale to cause damage mainly in sports turfs, parks and gardens. Also the survey results of Strasser (2004 a) indicated that particularly M. melolontha and P. horticola cause increasing damage in cultivated grasslands all over Austria, while A. solstitiale is of lesser significance. Since the adults of A. solstitiale might be often mistaken for M. melolontha beetles, the contribution of this species to damage in managed pastures could as well be underestimated (Traugott and Juen 2008).|$|E
30|$|According to Pötsch et al. (1997), {{the areas}} {{damaged by the}} {{cockchafers}} are rather found in the valleys and plains of 300 to 600  m above sea level, while the areas damaged by the <b>garden</b> <b>chafer</b> extend from the valleys up into higher mountainous regions. This observation corresponds to Scheerpelz (1950), who stated that M. melolontha mainly occurs in areas with annual mean temperatures of at least 7 °C. Melolontha melolontha (adult: 20 – 30  mm) has a three or four year life cycle in Austria, while the smaller P. horticola (adult: 8.5 – 12  mm) completes its larval development within one year (Raw 1951, Freude et al. 1969, Pötsch et al. 1997). Due to its shorter life cycle, P. horticola can build up high population densities more quickly in response to favourable environmental conditions. Faber (1961) discovered a transition from a four-year to a three-year development cycle of M. melolontha, particularly in some Alpine valleys. This trend is probably connected to increasing mean temperatures (Keller 1993, Scheifinger et al. 2007). However, recent systematic grub density surveys in damaged Austrian grasslands are not reported in the literature.|$|E
40|$|In 2011, a field block trial {{examined}} the biological control of white grubs of June beetle (Amphimallon solstitialis), margined vine chafer (Anomala dubia) and <b>garden</b> <b>chafer</b> (Phyllopertha horticola) {{on a permanent}} cut grassland in Gotenica (SE Slovenia). The efficacy of Beauveria brongniartii, Beauveria bassiana, Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora {{in the form of}} water suspension and infested grain was tested against a control treatment. The initial number of white grubs (April 12; 39 white grubs/m 2) was reduced with all tested entomopathogens up until the third evaluation (May 26; 32 white grubs/m 2). However, the studied treatments were not sufficient to reduce the white grub population in the soils below the economical threshold (20 individuals/m 2). The average number of white grubs was affected mostly by the treatment where the active ingredient was B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki. With one application in April, only the abundance of overwintered white grubs was reduced. To decrease the summer generation of white grubs, an application of biological agents is also required at a later time. The 8 % higher dry matter yield at the first cut (June 10) compared to the second cut (September 6) provided evidence for the prior statement...|$|E
30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{possible}} function as food resource for young larvae of P. horticola, high humus contents might provide optimal moisture conditions by {{contributing to the}} water permeability in soils with higher clay or silt content, but retaining enough soil water in sandy soils (Scheffer et al. 2002), which were typical for the investigated grassland sites. On the one hand, Laughlin (1957 b) showed that the eggs are not resistant to desiccation with relative humidities[*]≤[*] 98 % being lethal. On the other hand, moist soils are inadequate for P. horticola grub development (Milne 1964), because of increased pressure by diseases (Milne 1984), difficult hatching conditions (Raw 1951) and the negative effect on soil temperatures. Milne (1964) even considered that:” Apart from proper food, which is provided by grassland, the most important living condition for the <b>garden</b> <b>chafer</b> in the soil appears to be proper soil moisture”. Gaylor and Frankie (1979) showed that Phyllophaga crinita (Scarabaeidae), causing heavy damage to crops and turfs in North- and Central-America, did not oviposit in very wet or very dry soil and egg as well as early larval instar survival were low under extreme conditions. Comparably, Cyclocephala immaculata (Scarabaeidae), a pest in north-american turf grasses, failed to oviposit and introduced 1 st instar larvae did not survive in desiccated turf (Potter and Gordon 1984).|$|E
40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{occurrence}} of agricultural pests in Austria might already reflect climate change phenomena. In this study, {{an inventory of}} white grub (Melolontha melolontha, Amphimallon solstitiale and Phyllopertha horticola) damages in Austrian grassland including organic cultivation was performed by questioning plant protection consultants of 74 Agricultural County Chambers. Altogether, a cumulated 14. 800 hectares of white grub damages were recorded. From 2000 onwards, a steady increase of white grub damages occurred with a climax {{in the year of}} heat and drought 2003. The infested fields extended along the alpine main ridge from Vorarlberg up to the alpine foreland. Additionally, southern slopes of the Danube valley in Upper and Lower Austria were affected. Very likely, the damages were mainly due to the <b>garden</b> <b>chafer</b> P. horticola. From 2004 to 2006, the extent of damages decreased again all over Austria. By studying meteorological data, it became obvious that the damaged areas were mainly situated in regions with a strong precipitation deficit. On-farm investigations performed in 2007 strengthened the hypothesis that drought and elevated soil temperatures might be the decisive factors for a strong development of grub populations and subsequent feeding damages. Additionally, drought can increase the effects of grub damage by delaying the regeneration of the damaged sward. A strongly damaged sward on slopes can be dangerous for the farmers e. g. by slipping machines...|$|E
30|$|The soil-dwelling larvae {{of several}} Scarabaeidae species (white grubs), like the {{cockchafer}} (Melolontha melolontha) and the <b>garden</b> <b>chafer</b> (Phyllopertha horticola), are serious pests in European cultivated grassland, reducing grass yield and destroying the turf by root-feeding. Nevertheless, the factors {{responsible for the}} development of large grub populations and the associated damage risk are poorly understood. The objectives of the study were to survey grub densities in grassland sites with different damage histories and find correlations with environmental and management variables. Data on grub densities were collected at 10 farms in the eastern Austrian Alps in September and October 2011. At each farm, one recently damaged site (high risk) and one site at which grub damage had never been observed by the farmers (undamaged site[*]=[*]low risk; each site: 500  m 2) were sampled. All sites were dominated by P. horticola (99 % of 1, 422 collected individuals; maximum density 303 grubs/m 2), which indicates that grub damage there is mainly caused by that species. Recently damaged sites tended to higher grub densities than undamaged sites. However, 3 out of 10 undamaged sites harbored high grub populations as well. Humus content together with the depth of the A-horizon significantly explained 38 % of P. horticola grub density variance, with highest densities in deeper humus-rich soils. The risk of grub damage was positively connected to the humus content and negatively related to the cutting frequency. For the investigated mountainous grassland sites, these results suggest an important role of humus {{for the development of}} high grub densities and an effect of management intensity on grub damage.|$|E
