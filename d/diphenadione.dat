As a [...] "second-generation" [...] anticoagulant, <b>diphenadione</b> is more toxic than the first generation compounds (e.g., warfarin). For purposes of treating toxicity on exposure, <b>diphenadione</b> is grouped with other vitamin K antagonists (coumarins and indandiones); despite being directed at rodents and being judged as less hazardous to humans and domestic animals than other rodenticides in use (by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency), indandione anticoagulants, nevertheless, [...] "may cause human toxicity {{at a much lower}} dose than conventional 'first-generation anticoagulants'… and can bioaccumulate in the liver." ...|$|E

The chemical compound is an anti-coagulant with active half-life longer than warfarin and other synthetic indandione anticoagulants.|$|E
40|$|Studies in Mexico in 1972 {{showed that}} diphacinone (<b>Diphenadione)</b> 1 (2 -diphenylacetyl- 1, 3 -indandione) was {{effective}} in reducing both vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) populations and the incidence of bat-transmitted rabies in cattle. Two highly selective methods were developed: treating cattle systemically and treating vampire bats topically. Since 1972, Denver Wildlife Research Center personnel have assisted Latin American Ministries of Agriculture in developing control campaigns. Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guyana, Panama, Venezuela, and Nicaragua have either undertaken or are considering operational vampire bat control programs...|$|E

It is tasteless and colorless, {{was used as a}} poison, and is still marketed as a pesticide against rats and mice. Several long-acting warfarin derivatives—superwarfarin anticoagulants—such as brodifacoum, <b>diphenadione,</b> chlorophacinone, bromadiolone, are used as pesticides and can produce profound and prolonged anticoagulation. Several factors increase the risk of warfarin toxicity. However, polymorphisms in cytochrome P 450 genes and drug interactions account for most of the risk for toxicity complications. Each person is unique in their degree of susceptibility to toxic agents. The toxicity interpretation and the health risk of most toxic substances are a subject of uncertainty. Genetically determined low metabolic capacity in an individual can dramatically alter the toxin and metabolite levels from those normally expected, which is crucial for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, like warfarin. Personalized approaches in interpretation have the potential to remove some of the scientific uncertainties in toxicity cases...|$|E
40|$|REN, P., P. Y. STARK, R. L. JOHNSON AND R. G. BELL: Mechanism {{of action}} of anticoagulants: Correlation between the {{inhibition}} of prothrombin synthesis and the regeneration of vitamin K from vitamin K epoxide. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 201 : 541 - 546, 1977. It {{has been proposed}} that coumarin and indandione anticoagulants inhibit clotting protein synthesis by preventing the regeneration of vitamin K from its 2, 3 -epoxide metabolite. To test this hypothesis, the effects of nine coumarmn and indandiones on prothrombin synthesis and the conversion of vitamin K, epoxide to vitamin K were measured. There was a good correlation between the inhibition of prothrombin synthe-sis and the epoxide-K conversion both in vivo and in vitro. <b>Diphenadione</b> (2 -diphenyl acetyl- 1, 3 -indandione) caused a delayed inhibition of prothrombin synthesis which correlated with a delayed inhibition of the epoxide-K, conversion in vivo. These results provide strong evidence for the proposed mechanism of action of coumarin and indan-dione anticoagulants. Recent work has demonstrated that vitamin K {{is necessary for the}} carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in a precursor protein (Stenflo, 1976). This produces biologically active pro-thrombin which contains y-carboxyglutamic acid. How vitamin K functions in the carboxy-lation and how anticoagulants antagonize its action are not known. Vitamin K- 2, 3 -epoxide, the major metabo-lite of vitamin K in both rat and man, accumu-lates in the presence of coumarin and indan-dione anticoagulants (Matschiner et at. 1970; Ren et at., 1974; Shearer et at., 1974).
