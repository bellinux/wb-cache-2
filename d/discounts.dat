40|$|Researchers in {{different}} disciplines have independently found {{evidence to suggest}} that the social <b>discount</b> rate may be hyperbolic, rather than exponential, in nature. Both behaviorist research and some empirical economics studies support the hyperbolic <b>discounting</b> hypothesis. U. S. and U. K. government <b>discounting</b> dispensations for some long-run public development projects are explicable in terms of an underlying hyperbolic social <b>discount</b> rate. A statistical aggregation argument demonstrates that even if the behaviorist, economics and public choice evidence for hyperbolic <b>discounting</b> is not conclusive, the social <b>discount</b> rate of a set of people who individually express time preferences best modeled by exponential <b>discounting</b> functions is nonetheless hyperbolic. Further empirical economics studies of <b>discounting</b> preferences are required. Comparisons of different national <b>discounting</b> practices would also be useful to see how widespread is the use of unusually low exponential rates of <b>discount</b> for long-run projects.

Doing so, however, creates conflicts between short-term considerations — a <b>discounting</b> scheme has to be consistent with observed behaviours — and long-term ethical issues — a <b>discounting</b> scheme must not favour the current generation over future ones.

Each task used an adjusting-amount procedure, and participants' choices affected 					the amount {{and timing of}} their remuneration for participating. Both group and 					individual <b>discounting</b> functions from all three procedures were well fitted by 					hyperboloid <b>discounting</b> functions. A negative correlation between the 					probability <b>discounting</b> of gains and losses was observed, consistent with the 					idea that individuals' choices on probability <b>discounting</b> tasks reflect their 					general attitude towards risk, {{regardless of whether the}} outcomes are gains or 					losses. This finding further suggests that risk attitudes reflect the weighting 					an individual gives to the lowest-valued outcome (e. g., getting nothing when the 					probabilistic outcome is a gain or actually losing when the probabilistic 					outcome is a loss). According to this view, risk-aversion indicates a tendency 					to overweight the lowest-valued outcome, whereas risk-seeking indicates a 					tendency to underweight it. Neither probability <b>discounting</b> of gains nor 					probability <b>discounting</b> of losses were reliably correlated with <b>discounting</b> of 					delayed gains, a result that is inconsistent with the idea that probability 					<b>discounting</b> and delay <b>discounting</b> both reflect a general tendency towards 					impulsivity...|$|R
