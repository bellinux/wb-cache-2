Previous work has demonstrated that nod 26 facilitates the transport of water and glycerol, although a potential additional role as a channel for <b>fixed</b> <b>ammonia</b> efflux has been hypothesized. In the present study it is shown that recombinant nod 26 reconstituted into proteoliposomes facilitates NH 3 transport in an Hg 2 +-sensitive manner with a reduced activation energy, hallmarks of protein-facilitated transport characteristic of aquaporins. Comparison of the predicted single-channel transport rates of nod 26 suggests a 4. 9 -fold preference for ammonia compared to water...|$|E
40|$|Anabaena spiroides has {{the ability}} to {{maintain}} intense biomass production for extensive periods in the epilimnion of a small eutrophic lake characterized by conditions shown to cause photooxidative death {{in a number of other}} phytoplankton. By the enhancement of carotenoid synthesis chlorophyll a was protected from photooxidation and prevented from catalyzing other photooxidative reactions within the cells. By temporally separating CO 2 and N 2 fixation, maximum utilization of photosynthetically active radiation was achieved. Because CO 2 fixation was more sensitive than N 2 fixation to a high oxygen concentration, the former was maximized during morning hours, before the afternoon buildup of dissolved oxygen. The diurnal partitioning of carbon and N 2 fixation has two additional advantages; possible competition for reductant-generating compounds is minimized, and adequate endogenous pools of carbon skeletons are assured to accept newly <b>fixed</b> <b>ammonia.</b> Hence, Anabaena, far from undergoing photooxidative death, appears to utilize a physiological strategy which allows optimization of radiant energy use for reductive processes and dominance of surface waters and shading of deeper phytoplankton during summer blooms...|$|E

In-situ optical reflectivity traces of GaN growth show that the three- to two-dimensional process has been prolonged by using varied ammonia flow on SiN (x) mask layer method compared with that grown by fixing ammonia flow. Structural and optical properties were characterized by high-resolution X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence, and compared with the sample grown by fixing ammonia flow, GaN grown using the varied ammonia flow on SiNx mask layer showed better structure and optical quality. It was assumed that the low NH 3 flow in the initial growth stage considerably increased the GaN island density on the nano-porous SiN (x) layer by enhancing vertical growth. Lateral growth was significantly favored by high NH 3 flow in the subsequent step. As a result, the improved crystal and optical quality was achieved utilizing NH 3 flow modulation for GaN buffer growth on Si(111) substrate...|$|E

This makes the coastal zone an ideal experimental laboratory for describing microbial diversity and testing hypotheses on community structure, function and control. Coastal sediment is of significance in nutrient regeneration and transformation involving different assemblages of microbes in the nitrogen cycle.

40|$|The rhizobia–legume, root-nodule {{symbiosis}} {{provides the}} most efficient source of biologically <b>fixed</b> <b>ammonia</b> fertilizer for agricultural crops. Its development involves pathways of specificity, infectivity, and effectivity resulting from expressed traits of the bacterium and host plant. A key event of the infection process required for development of this root-nodule symbiosis is a highly localized, complete erosion of the plant cell wall through which the bacterial symbiont penetrates to establish a nitrogen-fixing, intracellular endosymbiotic state within the host. This process of wall degradation must be delicately balanced to avoid lysis and destruction of the host cell. Here, we describe the purification, biochemical characterization, molecular genetic analysis, biological activity, and symbiotic function of a cell-bound bacterial cellulase (CelC 2) enzyme from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii, the clover-nodulating endosymbiont. The purified enzyme can erode the noncrystalline tip of the white clover host root hair wall, making a localized hole of sufficient size to allow wild-type microsymbiont penetration. This CelC 2 enzyme is not active on root hairs of the nonhost legume alfalfa. Microscopy analysis of the symbiotic phenotypes of the ANU 843 wild type and CelC 2 knockout mutant derivative revealed that this enzyme fulfils {{an essential role in}} the primary infection process required for development of the canonical nitrogen-fixing R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii-white clover symbiosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} of {{the negative impact of}} NOx resulted in increasingly tighter automotive emission regulations. Companies are under pressure to develop methods, which can meet the legislative demands. After treatment solutions, and especially Selective Catalytic Reduction, became the focus of research and have shown so far promising results. However, more in depth understanding of the SCR process under different conditions is needed. This thesis describes an investigation of the SCR performance using gas and urea injections under steady state and transient conditions undertaken on a light duty diesel engine using a 1 D exhaust system designed for uniform flow across the catalyst. Under steady state conditions, the SCR performance was examined for low and high temperature conditions. Ammonia was supplied either as 5 % ammonia gas or in form of urea injection. The engine was operating at 1500 rpm and 6 and 8 bar BMEP to provide an exhaust gas temperature of 210 °C and 265 °C respectively. Also, the effect of SCR brick length on the NOx conversion was investigated using SCR catalysts of length 30, 45 and 75 mm. To measure the influence of NO 2 :NOx ratio on the SCR performance, different sizes of standard DOC were used. NH 3 :NOx dosage levels included; α~ 0. 5 - deficient ammonia, α~ 1. 0 - stoichiometric ammonia, α~ 1. 25 - excess ammonia. Gas emissions were measured before and after the SCR catalysts with a Horiba FTIR analyser during steady state and long transient tests. It was found that conditions such as temperature and NO 2 :NOx had the biggest impact on the SCR performance. During the steady state engine conditions, at α~ 1. 0 ammonia dosing and NO 2 :NOx ratio of 0, only 17 % of NO was converted in the first 30 mm of the SCR brick length. The conversion was improved at high temperature (263 °C) to 31 %. A fast response CLD analyser was used during short transient testing to sample emissions with a high resolution. The short transient test with standard 0. 5 and 1 DOC, and <b>fixed</b> <b>ammonia</b> dosing, showed that NOx conversion was reduced during the ramp event due to deficient ammonia and a drop in the supplied NO 2 :NOx ratio. During urea injection experiments, urea was injected either through an oblique pipe arrangement with a mixer device placed downstream or directly into a mixing can. In this case the mixer device was replaced with a straight pipe. A 75 mm SCR was fitted and to ensure that supplied NO 2 :NOx ratio was zero, a palladium only DOC was used post a DPF. It was found that a large proportion of urea decomposition and hydrolysis was occurring {{on the surface of the}} SCR catalyst. Comparing NOx performance between urea injection and ammonia gas dosing experiment, more NO was converted for a given NH 3 :NOx ratio when ammonia was supplied in the form of gas. That was true for low and high temperature tests. For most studies, a long 10 degree diffuser was used in front of the SCR to provide uniform gas distribution across the catalyst. In addition SCR performance was investigated with a 180 degree sudden expansion diffuser in order to measure the influence of temperature and velocity profiles. During this study, a 45 mm SCR catalyst was used to provide a moderate amount of NO conversion and ammonia slip. The results showed that the flow and temperature distribution upstream of the SCR catalyst will have an effect on the NOx conversion, and that gas velocity has bigger impact on NOx conversion than gas temperature...|$|E

40|$|As a basic {{building}} block in many biological molecules the element nitrogen (N) is essential for life. Dinitrogen (N 2) is abundant in Earth’s atmosphere, but this form is biologically unavailable. To be biologically available N 2 must undergo an energy demanding reduction reaction to the <b>fixed</b> form, <b>ammonia</b> (NH 3). The industrial Haber-Bosch process, which accounts for approximately 50 % of the worlds fixed nitrogen, uses energy from fossil fuels to achieve high pressures and temperatures to facilitate the reaction. The energy used by Haber-Bosch accounts for approximately 2 % of the world’s annual supply. The remainder of fixed nitrogen is produced biologically by nitrogen fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs), utilizing nitrogenase enzymes. Nitrogenase enzymes perform the reduction at ambient temperature and pressure, deriving the necessary energy from the energy rich molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The main focus {{of this research is}} exploring how nitrogenase enzymes are able to achieve N 2 reduction under ambient conditions. Another focus is aimed at understanding how nitrogenase enzymes can be used to reduce carbon dioxide into energy rich hydrocarbons.

Here, we report that a derivative of S. meliloti carrying a mutation in the chromosomal ntrR gene induced nodules with enhanced nitrogen fixation capacity, resulting in an increased dry weight and nitrogen content of alfalfa. The efficient nitrogen fixation {{is a result of the}} higher expression level of the nifH gene, encoding one of the subunits of the nitrogenase enzyme, and nifA, the transcriptional regulator of the nif operon. The ntrR gene, controlled negatively by its own product and positively by the symbiotic regulator syrM, is expressed in the same zone of nodules as the nif genes. As a result of the nitrogen-tolerant phenotype of the strain, the beneficial effect of the mutation on efficiency is not abolished in the presence of the exogenous nitrogen source. The ntrR mutant is highly competitive in nodule occupancy compared with the wild-type strain. Sequence analysis of the mutant region revealed a new cluster of genes, termed the "ntrPR operon," which is highly homologous to a group of vap-related genes of various pathogenic bacteria that are presumably implicated in bacterium-host interactions.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The nitrogen-fixing {{symbiosis}} between Rhizobiaceae and legumes {{is one of}} the best-studied interactions established between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The plant develops root nodules in which the bacteria are housed, and atmospheric nitrogen is <b>fixed</b> into <b>ammonia</b> by the rhizobia and made available to the plant in exchange for carbon compounds. It has been hypothesized that this symbiosis evolved from the more ancient arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, in which the fungus associates with roots and aids the plant in the absorption of mineral nutrients, particularly phosphate. Support comes from several fronts: 1) legume mutants where Nod 2 and Myc 2 co-segregate, and 2) the fact that various early nodulin (ENOD) genes are expressed in legume AM. Both strongly argue for the idea that the signal transduction pathways between the two symbioses are conserved. We have analyzed the responses of four classes of non-nodulating Melilotus alba (white sweetclover) mutants to Glomus intraradices (the mycorrhizal symbiont) to investigate how Nod 2 mutations affect the establishment of this symbiosis. We also re-examined the root hair responses of the non-nodulating mutants to Sinorhizobium meliloti (the nitrogen-fixing symbiont). Of the four classes, several sweetclover sym mutants are both Nod 2 and Myc 2. In an attempt to decipher the relationship between nodulation and mycorrhiza formation, we also performed co-inoculation experiments with mutant rhizobia and Glomus intraradices on Medicago sativa, a close relative of M. alba.

40|$|Objectives: A false-negative biopsy urease test (BUT) {{is common}} in Helicobacter pylori-associated {{bleeding}} peptic ulcers. Although blood in the stomach is thought {{to interfere with the}} biopsy urease test, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. This in vitro experiment sought to identify the blood component(s) that interfere with the biopsy urease test, and delineate the mechanism of inhibition. Methods: The modified Hazell's microtiter test was used to detect the urease activity of H. pylori. A positive result was indicated by a color change of the pH indicator, bromothymol blue, at 630 μm. Human whole blood, sera with and without anti-H. pylori antibody, electrolytes, and enzymes were incubated with H. pylori to identify the blood component(s) causing the inhibition of urease activity. In addition, any interference of the pH color indicator was tested by adding different concentrations of serum albumin to the urease reagent that contained a <b>fixed</b> quantity of <b>ammonia</b> in the absence of H. pylori. Results: The color change of the microtiter urease test was significantly reduced by blood (p < 0. 0001), regardless of the presence of anti-H. pylori antibody. Electrolytes and serum enzymes did not interfere with the urease test. The color change of the pH indicator was progressively suppressed by higher concentrations of serum albumin. Conclusions: Blood adversely affects the performance of the BUT. This is mediated by the buffering effect of serum albumin on the pH indicator, rather than by a direct inhibition on the urease activity. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} {{and maintenance of}} deep-sea ferromanganese/polymetallic nodules still remains a mystery 140 years after their discovery. The wealth of rare metals concentrated in these nodules has spurred global interest in exploring the mining potential of these resources. The prevailing theory of abiotic formation has been called into question {{and the role of}} microbial metabolisms in nodule development is now an area of active research. To understand the community structure of microbes associated with nodules and their surrounding sediment, we performed targeted sequencing of the V 4 hypervariable region of the 16 S rRNA gene from three nodules collected from the central South Pacific. Results have shown that the microbial communities of the nodules are significantly distinct from the communities in the surrounding sediments, and that the interiors of the nodules harbor communities different from the exterior. This suggests not only differences in potential metabolisms between the nodule and sediment communities, but also differences in the dominant metabolisms of interior and exterior communities. We identified several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) unique to both the nodule and sediment environments. The identified OTUs were assigned putative taxonomic identifications, including two OTUs only found associated with the nodules, which were assigned to the α-Proteobacteria.

The present study aimed to fill a knowledge gap by providing an explicit picture of spatial and temporal dynamics of a subset of these soil microorganisms at the plot scale. We selected an unfertilized perennial grassland, where nitrogen cycling is considered to be efficient and tightly coupled to plant growth. At six times over one growing season 60 soil samples were taken from a 10 m x 10 m area and abundances of marker genes for total archaea and bacteria (16 S rRNA), nitrogen <b>fixing</b> bacteria (nifH), <b>ammonia</b> oxidizing archaea (amoA AOA) and bacteria (amoA AOB), and denitrifying bacteria (nirS, nirK and nosZ) were determined by qPCR. Potential nitrification activity (PNA) and denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) were determined. Seasonal changes in abundance patterns of marker genes were detected, and were associated with changes in substrate availability associated with plant growth stages. Potential nitrification and denitrification enzyme activities were strongly spatially structured at the studied scale, corresponding to periods of rapid plant growth, June and October, and their spatial distributions were similar, providing visual evidence of highly localized spatial and temporal conditions at this scale. Temporal variability in the N -cycling communities versus the stability of their respective potential activities provided evidence of both short-lived temporal niche partitioning and a degree of microbial functional redundancy.

40|$|In {{response}} to compatible rhizobia, leguminous plants develop unique plant organs, root nodules, in which rhizobia <b>fix</b> nitrogen into <b>ammonia.</b> During nodule invasion, the rhizobia {{gain access to}} newly divided cells, the nodule primordia, in the root inner cortex through plant-derived cellulose tubes called infection threads. Infection threads begin in curled root hairs and bring rhizobia into the root crossing several cell layers in the process. Ultimately the rhizobia are deposited within nodule primordium cells through a process resembling endocytosis. Plant host mechanisms underlying the formation and regulation of the invasion process are not understood. To identify and clone plant genes required for nodule invasion, recent efforts have focused on Medicago truncatula. In a collaborative effort the nodulation defect in the lin (lumpy infections) mutant was characterized. From an EMS-mutagenized population of M. truncatula, two non-allelic mutants nip (numerous infections with polyphenolics) and sli (sluggish infections) were identified with defects in nodule invasion. Infection threads were found to proliferate abnormally in the nip mutant nodules with only very rare deposition of rhizobia within plant host cells. nip nodules were found to accumulate polyphenolic compounds, indicative of a host defense response. Interestingly, nip was also found to have defective lateral root elongation suggesting that NIP has a role in both nodule and lateral root development. NIP was found to map at the upper arm of chromosome 1. In sli, infection threads were observed to bring rhizobia from infection threads to newly divided nodule primordium cells in the roots inner cortex. Polyphenolic accumulation in sli nodule/bumps was found.

40|$|In the sediments of the NW African {{continental}} margin the mainly biogenic carbonate constituents become increasingly diluted with terrigenous material as one approaches the coast, {{as indicated by}} the carbonate-CO 2 content, the Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 -ratios, and the presence of <b>ammonia</b> <b>fixed</b> to alumino-silicates, predominantly to illites. In the norther area of the investigation - off Cape Blanc and Cape Bojador. the terrigenous constituents are mainly quartz from the Sahara Desert, whereas in the south - off Senegal - more alumino-silicates as clay minerals are admixed with the carbonate constituents. The organic carbon content of the continental slope sediments off Senegal is higher than in samples of the continental rise or of the preservation of organic matter as a result of high production and relatively rapid sedimentation. The zone of manganese-oxide enrichment follows the redox potential of + 330 mV from the surface (0 - 5 cm) into the sediments (20 - 30 cm deep) at 2000 [...] 3000 m and 3700 m of water depths, respectively. At shallower water depths, low redox potentials preclude deposition of manganese oxides and cause their mobilization from the sediments. About 1 / 3 of the total sedimentary Zn and 1 / 4 of the Cu is associated with the carbonate mineral fraction, probably in calcium phosphate overgrowths {{as a result of the}} mineralization of phosphorus-containing organic matter. Besides the precipitation of calcium phosphate, the mineralization of organic matter mediated by bacterial sulfate reduction also results in calcium carbonate precipitation and the exchange of ammonia for potassium on illites. Because of these simultaneous reactions, the depth distribution of all mineralization constituents in the interstitial water can be determined using the actual molar carbon-to-nitrogen-to phosphorus ratios of the sedimentary organic matter. The amount of sulfide sulfur in this process indicates the predominance of bacterial sulfate reduction in the sediments off NW Africa. This process also preferentially decomposes nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing organic compounds so organic matter deficient in these elements is characteristic for the rapidly accumulating sediments than today, indicating there was increased production of organic carbon compounds and more favorable conditions of their preservations. During the last interglacial times conditions were similar to those to today. This differentiation with time has also been observed in sediments from the Argentine Basin and from slope off South India indicating perhaps world-wide environmental changes throughout Late Quaternary times...|$|R
40|$|Chalcopyrite is {{not only}} the most {{abundant}} of the copper sulphides, but also the most stable, making it recalcitrant to hydrometallurgical treatment processes especially in atmospheric leaching. Hence, pyrometallurgical processes are traditionally used to treat chalcopyrite concentrates. However, ore grades are falling and concentration processes are becoming increasingly costly, prompting need to revisit hydrometallurgical treatment processes (especially heap leaching), which are otherwise regarded as relatively economic and environmentally friendly. Key hydrometallurgical processes for chalcopyrite treatment are ferric sulphate, chloride and ammoniacal systems. The ferric sulphate system does not work well under atmospheric conditions, except in combination with thermophilic microorganisms, whereas the chloride system has only recently been evaluated more seriously for heap leach processes. The ammonia system remains relatively unexplored and most studies date back more than 40 years, but the system has considerable potential for further development. Ammonia systems can be effectively used to leach copper from chalcopyrite in the presence of an oxidant. The ammoniacal leaching system is heavily reliant on a good surface mass transfer system, hence it being widely studied in high pressure systems where oxygen was accepted to be the oxidant. Leach reactors were designed to use agitation systems which promote the abrasion of an iron based deposit layer thought to passivate the mineral surface. Most research on the ammonia leaching systems has previously been carried out in controlled or bulk leaching studies and only a few used electrochemical studies. A disconnect exits between the two approaches, resulting in different proposed fundamental reaction mechanisms and kinetic understanding. A fundamental electrochemical and controlled leach study of the oxidative leaching of chalcopyrite in ammoniacal solutions has been undertaken. The study covered the following aspects: a description of the mixed potentials, chemistry and kinetics of the anodic reaction, the cathodic reduction of the oxidants, the formation and effect of surface deposits and lastly a look at how results from electrochemical studies compare to those from the leaching of a similar mineral sample under similar solution conditions. A detailed study of the mixed potentials on a more or less pure chalcopyrite electrode has shown the redox reactions {{on the surface of the}} mineral to be controlled by the oxidation of chalcopyrite and reduction of copper(II). The presence of oxygen has been found to have no significant effect on mixed potentials in ammoniacal solutions in the presence of initial copper(II). Constant potential and potentiodynamic studies on the anodic reaction have shown the rate of the anodic reaction to increase with an increase in potential in a standard 1 M ammonia/ammonium sulphate solution (which buffers at pH 9. 6) in exponential fashion supporting conventional Butler-Volmer behaviour with a anodic transfer coefficient of 0. 42 and a rate constant k* CuFeS 2 of 0. 0431 cms⁻¹. Increasing total ammonia increased the rate of reaction only at low concentrations; at higher concentrations increasing total ammonia had no effect on the anodic reaction. An increase of pH at <b>fixed</b> total <b>ammonia</b> concentration showed an increase in reaction rate, but the effect cannot clearly be discerned from the concomitant shift in relative proportion of free NH₃ and NH₄⁺. Coulometric studies have shown the oxidation reaction to proceed via the formation of a thiosulphate intermediate and this to be a 7 - 8 electron transfer reaction. A surface deposit layer consisting of iron, oxygen and small quantities of sulphur was formed and the sulphur component of this product layer was seen to be gradually depleted during leaching. Anodic currents were found to gradually decrease with time and this was linked to the growth of the surface deposit layer. However, the surface deposit layer did not passivate the anodic reaction; instead, it was proposed that the surface deposit layer adsorbed copper ions and displayed "ohmic" behaviour. The formation of the surface deposit layer was found to apparently promote the cathodic reduction of copper(II). While reduction of copper(II) was shown to be the primary reduction reaction, the presence of oxygen was seen to promote this reduction reaction through the regeneration of copper(II) in experiments that ran for longer time periods. An apparent accumulation of copper(I) on the mineral surface was seen to adversely affect the rate of the cathodic reaction and thus the overall rate of dissolution. The nature and morphology of the surface layer was found to be significantly influenced by the choice of cation in solution, which was thought to influence primarily the complexation/precipitation of ferric species forming near the surface. The degree of agitation during leach studies influences the rate of leaching due to the fragmentation of surface deposits, which are seen to slow the anodic reaction. A kinetic model has been developed for the anodic and cathodic reactions. This thesis presents significant new findings regarding the role of the copper(I) /copper(II) redox couple on the oxidative leaching of chalcopyrite. It also highlights the potentially limiting role of the cathodic reactions which have frequently been overshadowed by the focus on chalcopyrite oxidation reactions. Furthermore, the growth of a surface inhibiting layer which cannot be removed in heap leach systems due to the lack of mechanical agitation can now potentially be addressed by looking into the complexation and precipitation characteristics of cations in solution for ammoniacal leach systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis deals with the symbiosis of Frankia spp. and Alnus glutinosa. Frankia spp. are actinomycetes giving rise {{to the formation of}} nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of a number of non-leguminous plants. In these nodules Frankia spp. live within the plant cells and obtain all sources of carbon and energy from the plant, giving fixed nitrogen in exchange. To answer the question what compounds Frankia spp. obtain from the plant, insight into the metabolism of this microorganism is required. To obtain this insight, researches have been made with the free-living Frankia AvcI 1, isolated from root nodules of Alnus viridis ssp crispa by Baker et al. (1979). This organism has been isolated and cultivated on complex media. In order to obtain insight into the C- and N-source requirements of Frankia AvcI 1, a simple and well-defined growth medium is needed. The composition of this medium and the C- and N-metabolism of Frankia AvcI 1 are the subjects of Chapter II of this thesis. In Chapter II. 1 it is shown that Frankia AvcI 1 is able to grow on a medium containing Tween 80 (an oleate ester of polyethyleneglycol sorbitan) as sole C-source and either glutamic acid or NH 4 Cl as sole N-source. The growth yield of Frankia AvcI 1 on various media is reported. It is shown that the doubling time of Frankia AvcI 1 growing on QMOD/Tween medium is about 2 days, which is slow, even for an actinomycete. When growing with Casamino acids as nitrogen source, Frankia AvcI 1 selectively takes up glutamic acid and aspartic acid, leaving the concentrations of the other detectable amino acids unchanged. The mechanism of this selection is still unclear. Chapter II. 2 contains further data on the C-sources utilized by Frankia AvcI 1 It is shown that Frankia AvcI 1 can utilize as C-source also other Tweens, viz. Tweens 20, 40, 60 and 85, and in addition several fatty acids, viz. acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, caproic, caprylic, capric, palmitic and stearic acids. No growth of Frankia AvcI 1 was observed on media containing triglycerides as C-sources. The dependence of the growth yield {{on the nature of the}} carbon source and the concentration of NH 4 + in the media is shown. Utilization of NH 4 + as nitrogen source of Frankia AvcI 1 growing in the Tween/NH 4 + medium is confirmed by incorporation experiments with 15 N-NH 4 Cl. The results reported in Chapter II. 3 show that Frankia AvcI 1 does not take up glucose from a medium containing both glucose and Tween 80. In agreement with this observation, it is demonstrated that the activities of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in cells grown on the QMOD/Tween medium (containing both glucose and Tween 80) are of the same order ofmagnitude as in cells grown on the Tween/NH 4 + medium (containing Tween 80 as sole C-source). Organisms growing on fatty acids, and degrading these compounds to acetyl-CoA, start gluconeogenesis with the action of the glyoxylate cycle (Kornberg and Krebs, 1957) leading to the conversion of 2 acetyl-CoA molecules to 1 molecule of succinate. The presence of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in Frankia AvcI 1 cells grown with Tween 80 as C-source is therefore not surprising. The succinate formed in the glyoxylate cycle can be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by the subsequent action of the enzymes succinate dehydrogenase, fumarase, malic enzyme and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase, which are found in cell-free extracts of Frankia AvcI 1 From phosphoenolpyruvate, gluconeogenesis can continue with the action of phosphoglycerate kinase and 3 -phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase. For energy generation, Frankia AvcI 1 can oxidize the acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid breakdown in the citric acid cycle, although the low activity of the enzyme succinyl-CoA synthetase leaves room for the presumption that the citric acid cycle is not very operative in Frankia AvcI 1 This is not impossible since the oxidation of fatty acids yields many reducing equivalents. The data contained in Chapter II. 4 show that Frankia AvcI 1 does not take up succinate from a medium containing acetate plus succinate or succinate alone. In accordance, no repressing effect of succinate on the activities of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes was observed, whereas in cells grown on propionate these enzymes were not found, indicating that they are hot constitutive in Frankia AvcI 1 Frankia AvcI 1 is able to utilize several amino acids as sole nitrogen source, viz. alanine, γ-aminobutyric acid, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, leucine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, tyrosine and valine. No differences in C- and N-source requirements were observed for the three Frankia strains AvcI 1, CPI 1 (isolated by Callaham et al., 1978, from Comptonia peregrina root nodules) and AgSp+ 1 (isolated by Quispel and Burggraaf, 1981, from Alnus glutinosa spore-(+) type root nodules). These three strains were shown to utilize either Tween 80 or acetate, but no ethanol, lactate, glucose or succinate as sole C-source, and either NH 4 Cl, Casamino acids, aspartic acid or alanine as N-source. From the data given in Chapter II it will be clear that Frankia AvcI 1 is able to grow on a well-defined medium, which is a prerequisite for obtaining a clear insight into the physiology of the organism. The alcoholic root extract (Quispel and Tak, 1978) or the soybean lecithin (Lalonde and Calvert, 1979), added to the medium as growth factors, can be replaced by Tween 80 or fatty acids which are utilized as carbon source, while NH 4 Cl or amino acids can be utilized as nitrogen source. It is unknown whether Frankia spp. grow with the same growth rate on media with different constituents. The growth yields presented in Chapter II are usually small as compared to the amount of carbon present in the media. This suggests that either an additional component of the medium is present in limiting concentrations or that Frankia spp. can only grow for a limited time after inoculation. The only group of compounds known so far to be utilized as C-source by free-living Frankia AvcI 1 are fatty acids, either free or esterified. The question what carbon source Frankia spp. living symbiotically in the nodule obtain from the plant, still remains to be answered. Based on the data obtained for free-living Frankia spp. it is not unlikely that some fatty acid functions as C-source under such conditions. Other possible candidates for this function are plant lipids like the alcoholic root extract (Quispel and Tak, 1978) or the soybean lecithin (Lalonde and Calvert, 1979). It is unlikely that sugars like glucose or dicarboxylic acids like succinate are playing this role, unless the ability of Frankia spp. to take up one or more of these compounds should alter during the transition from the free-living to the symbiotic stage. The cultivation of free-living Frankia spp. is a powerful tool in discovering symbiotic interactions of the endophyte and the host. In Chapter II. 4 of this thesis it is shown that by replacing acetate as C-source of the medium by propionate, the activities of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes are repressed. Other authors (Tjepkema, Ormerod and Torrey, 1980 and 1981, Gauthier, Diem and Dommergues, 1981) reported a medium in which free-living Frankia spp. show vesicle formation and N 2 -ase activity. The present knowledge thus enables one to influence regulation in freeliving Frankia spp., which is important in studying the symbiotic interactions mentioned above. In Chapter III attention is paid to the assimilation of the ammonia produced by the endophyte living symbiotically in the root nodules of Alnus glutinosa grown in the greenhouse from seeds collected in Wageningen. In Chapter III. 1 the composition of the pool of free amino acids in root nodules and the xylem tissue of stems is reported. It is shown that citrulline is the predominant free amino acid in nodules, while serine also occurs in relatively large amounts. In xylem tissue citrulline and glutamic acid are prominent. The activities of N 2 -ase, GS, GDH and OCT in root nodule homogenates are reported. From the K m values of GDH for NH 4 + (16 mM) and glutamate (0. 9 mM) and the concentrations in the nodule of NH 4 + (1. 5 mM) and glutamate (0. 5 mM) it is concluded that GDH in alder nodules probably is responsible for the deamination of glutamate and not for the synthesis of this key amino acid. The important function of GDH in the nitrogen metabolism of alder nodules is confirmed by the much higher activity of this enzyme in homogenates of nodules as compared to that in homogenates of root-tips and leaves. The vesicle clusters, which contain the N 2 -ase activity, did not show activity of GS, GDH and OCT. The cytoplasm of the host cells was shown to possess the GS activity, while GDH and OCT are localized in the organelles of the host cells. No activity of NADH-dependent GOGAT was observed. In Chapter 111. 2 it is shown that the activity of NADH-dependent GOGAT from root nodules of lupins is inhibited by some compound in the homogenate of alder nodules. Simultaneously with and independently of the present research, Schubert et al. (1981) analyzed the composition of the pool of free amino acids in nodules and the xylem tissue of Alnus glutinosa grown in the field in East Lansing, Michigan. The only difference with respect to these amino acid pools between the American alders and the European alders studied in the present research, is the relatively high amount of serine in nodules of the latter, whereas in nodules of the former this amino acid is not found. The results of both Schubert et al. (1981) and the present research confirm the hypothesis that in alder,citrulline is the main transport vehicle of fixed nitrogen (Miettienen and Virtanen, 1952; Leaf, Gardner and Bond, 1958; Wheeler and Bond, 1970). From the results shown in Chapter 111. 2 it can be concluded that our failure to find any GOGAT activity may be ascribed to the presence of an inhibiting compound in the homogenate of alder nodules, so that it is not excluded that GOGAT is active in alder nodules in vivo. The data reported in Chapter III are in accordance with the following model: The nitrogen <b>fixed</b> as <b>ammonia</b> in the vesicle clusters of the endophyte, is assimilated in the cytoplasm of the host cell into glutamate by the action of GS and presumably GOGAT. Glutamate is in part deaminated in the plant organelles by the action of GDH to supply the NH 4 + required for the synthesis of carbamyl phosphate. Another part of the glutamate is converted to ornithine, which in the organelles of the host cellreacts with carbamyl phosphate to form citrulline according to the OCT reaction. Citrulline is excreted from the nodule and serves as nitrogen source for the plant. ...|$|R
