50|$|This type of clamp {{was invented}} in 1921 by ex Royal Navy Commander, Lumley Robinson, who founded L. Robinson & Co (Gillingham) Ltd., a {{business}} in Gillingham, Kent. The company owns the trademark for <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clip.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clip</b> is a {{circular}} metal band or strip {{combined with a}} worm gear fixed to one end. It is designed to hold a soft, pliable hose onto a rigid circular pipe, or sometimes a solid spigot, of smaller diameter.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clip</b> {{was invented}} by Commander Lumley Robinson of the British Royal Navy, who was granted the first patent for the device by the London Patent Office in 1921 while operating as a sole trader. It is now subject to a registered trademark in many countries around the world. The design has been copied with many variations, {{and there are many}} other hose clips of a similar design.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clips</b> are {{generally}} made {{of stainless steel}} or galvanised or electro-plated steel. Rotating the screw {{has the effect of}} changing the diameter of the circle formed by the band. <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clips</b> are available in a range of sizes (diameters). Larger-diameter <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clips</b> tend to have wider bands.|$|R
25|$|Gas-tight {{connections}} between the flexible hoses and rigid fittings are made by using crimped hose clips or ferrules, {{often referred to as}} 'O' clips, over barbed spigots. The use of worm-drive hose <b>clips</b> or <b>Jubilee</b> <b>clips</b> is specifically forbidden in the UK and other countries.|$|R
50|$|In 1982 {{the group}} {{established}} a first overseas company when John Jennings (John Lumley-Robinson's son-in-law), founded <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clips</b> Deutschland GmbH, {{in anticipation of}} Britain leaving the EU under growing political pressure at that time. This company {{continues to be a}} success selling Jubilee products in Germany and mainland Europe.|$|R
5000|$|In many countries, Jubilee Clips tend to {{be known}} almost {{exclusively}} by their brand name, but elsewhere (where the brand is not so well known for example), they are known by generic names such as worm-drive hose clip or hose clamp or hose clip. The <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clip</b> dominated the market {{to the point where}} the brand name is often used instead of the generic term [...] "hose clamp", particularly in the United Kingdom, Ireland and in some of the former British colonies. It remains the term used in everyday speech in the UK and Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|Production of the GT-Four (or {{previously}} {{known as}} All-Trac in the US), continued for the Japanese, Australian, European, and British markets. This ST205 version {{was to be}} the most powerful Celica produced to date, producing [...] (export version) or [...] (Japanese market) from an updated 3S-GTE engine. Influenced strongly by Toyota Team Europe, Toyota's factory team in the World Rally Championship, {{the final version of the}} GT-Four included improvements such as an all-aluminum hood to save weight, four-channel ABS (with G-force sensor), an improved turbocharger (incorrectly known by enthusiasts as the CT20B), and Super Strut Suspension. The 2500 homologation cars built to allow Toyota to enter the GT-Four as a Group A car in the World Rally Championship also sported extras such as all of the plumbing required to activate an anti-lag system, a water spray bar for the Intercooler's front heat exchanger, a water injection system for detonation protection, a hood spoiler mounted in front of the windscreen to stop hood flex at high speed and the standard rear spoiler mounted on riser blocks. The car proved to be quite competitive in the 1995 World Championship. However, the team was banned from competition for a year after the car's single victory due to turbocharger fixing - a device that meant there was no air path restriction on the intake - when the <b>jubilee</b> <b>clip</b> was undone this would flick back into place so as to go un-noticed by inspectors. Toyota has always claimed that they knew nothing of the fix - but opponents say it was one very cleverly engineered device. In some respects this car is a true sports car; in order to qualify for rallying it has a lot of special features and a unique strut arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the site}} became an {{electro-plating}} works and was owned by Smiths Signs, until it was bought by L Robinson & Co (Gillingham) Ltd in 1967-68 {{as part of their}} group known for their product, <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clips.</b> [...] This became the home of L Robinson & Co. (Plating) Ltd, incorporated on 31 July 1968.|$|R
50|$|More recently, in 2007 to 2008, {{the group}} {{acquired}} a new site in Gillingham, Kent, {{where all of}} the UK-based manufacturing and distribution activities of the UK companies of the group are now consolidated on one site in the town where the very first <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clips</b> {{were made by the}} original inventor, Lumley Robinson.|$|R

50|$|Together Lumley and Emily {{had four}} children: Henry, {{who went to}} Cambridge University and became Director of Education for Rochdale; Leonard, who joined the Royal Navy and then later worked for an {{advertising}} company called Ripley Preston in Bristol, where the first well-known advertisements for <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clips</b> were made; Dorothy, who married and stayed in Gillingham and John, who would eventually run the family business.|$|R
50|$|The UK {{declared}} war on Germany on 3 September 1939, just fourteen days after Commander Robinson's death. Before {{the end of the}} month, the War Ministry had realised the importance of <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clips</b> for the war effort and men arrived from the ministry to take over the company. His widow, Emily, wasn't having any of it however. She changed her name by deed poll to Lumley-Robinson and ran the business herself throughout the war.|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} the war, she {{continued}} to run the business until her youngest son, John Lumley-Robinson took over. (He, being under 21 when his mother changed her name, had been the only other member of the family to take the surname Lumley-Robinson). During and after the war other hose clip manufacturers started to emerge all over Europe, but Jubilee continued to be successful. The business was finally incorporated on 1 April 1948 as L. Robinson & Co (Gillingham) Ltd. Subsequently, the group grew with Jubilee Components Ltd and <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clips</b> Ltd being formed to take on the manufacturing processes, alongside L. Robinson & Co (Plating) Ltd, an electro-plating company established in 1968.|$|R
5000|$|Pat Gallagher (the {{chairman}} of Gallagher) {{was born in}} County Leitrim, Ireland (as part of a grocer family). The family and Pat (aged 17) left Ireland {{and moved to the}} village of Aylesford to live with his aunt. Pat started working for <b>Jubilee</b> <b>Clips</b> in Gilingham before going to work with Aylesford Sewage works. His father Patrick was killed after falling into a tank. After her husband's death, his mother moved back to Ireland. He decided to stay in Kent. He then drove a digger for builder Pat Burke, now his best friend, who advised him there was enough work for everyone. The young Gallagher bought that digger for Â£2000 and that started his construction career. [...] Three of his four children - Stephen, Richard and Lyndsey - are also involved in the business.|$|R
40|$|Springer International Publishing AG 2017. Several robotic {{jellyfish}} {{have been}} designed over the years, yet none have properly mimicked the very efficient method of propulsion that jellyfish use. Using circumferential contraction, water is pushed out {{the bottom of the}} bell creating upwards thrust. Jellyfish use this basic movement along with more complex features to move around the seas. In this paper, we attempt to mimic this circumferential contraction using hydraulically actuated silicone bellows that expand and contract a bell made of flexible silicone skin. 3 D printed polylactic acid (PLA) was used to make the structure of the robot, and hinges and <b>jubilee</b> <b>clips</b> were used to fasten it together in order to maintain exchangeability of parts. The jellyfish expands and contracts using a pump with a simple on-off control which switches dependent on the internal pressure of the hydraulic system. This very simple control mechanism is similar to real jellyfish, and much like jellyfish, our design attempts to use both passive and active movements to maximize thrust...|$|R
