5000|$|Nieu Bethesda is {{situated}} on the farm, Uitkyk, which belonged to BJ Pienaar. There {{was a very strong}} water supply on the farm and BJ Pienaar changed the course of the Gats River to drain the vlei’s (marshes) and turn the area into fertile lands - where Nieu Bethesda stands today. On 15 December 1874, the farmers of this area {{met for the first time}} with a view to establishing a village and Dutch Reformed Church congregation. A town council was elected. In February 1875, a petition group of 169 men met the church council of Graaff-Reinet, headed by the Reverend Charles Murray, son of the first preacher Andrew Murray [...]On the same day, negotiations were concluded to buy Uitkyk from Pienaar’s sons. It was not until 1878 that Graaff-Reinet agreed to the petitions of the Nieu Bethesda people. Rev. Charles Murray named the new settlement Nieu Bethesda in reference to the strong fountain and its biblical reference. In 1880, the church struggled to run the village so, in 1866, it became a municipality, but with administrative rights only. The church retained the properties. This meant that residents had to pay two taxes, an arrangement that led to friction for many generations. The town experienced a period of growth from its <b>establishement</b> in 1870s to about 1930. Nieu-Bethesda was eclipsed by larger towns during the 1930s and ‘40s. [...] The Great Depression, improved transport and the town's isolated location led to a mass exodus, leaving the town in an impoverished state.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the main stages of the physical development of Härnösand. The investigation includes not only buildings, but also streets, quays, bridges and other <b>establishements</b> which form {{an essential part of}} the physical environment. Since comparatively few buildings from the period have been preserved, the material for the theses has mainly been collected from archives, it has been the author's ambition to find a material which can be used in antiquarian contexts as much as possible. The theses is mainly arranged as follows: 1. Historical background. An outline of the economic, administrative and so cial development. 2. The physical development of the town. The development of the inhabited areas of the town is described on the basis of preserved maps. In particular, suggested revisions of existing town plans are studied, and to what extent these were effected. In addition the development of the stipulations for buildings, such as the fire stipulations and the architectural stipulations are studied. 3. Public buildings and <b>establishements.</b> A technical and historical description of the church, the town hall, streets, bridges, etc is given. Particular attention is paid to monumental buildings which are interesting from the point of view of the history of art, especially the county governor's house by Olof Tempelman built in 1790 in neo-classistic style, and the »gymnasium« from 1791 with its unique, round pillared hall. The old hospital from 1788 is also stressed as an example of neo-classistic stone architecture »translated« into wood. In a subsequent Part II private buildings will be treated. There the social and geographical distribution of buildings of defferent kinds (dwelling-house, wash-house, cowshed etc) will be studied. The physical shape of these different buildings will also be described - main types and variants of these. A special chapter will be devoted to the development of building techniques. A description will be given of the development of wooden panelling, house-paints, tiled roofs etc. Part II will also include an aesthetic analysis of the town milieu with special emphasis on local traditions of style.

30|$|Establishment survey: The establishments were geo-located and {{classified}} in 20 industry sectors {{using the}} International Industrial Uniform Code (IIUC) [4]. Thirteen sectors {{were classified as}} freight-intensive sectors (e.g., mineral; construction; manufacturing; accommodation and food, transportation; wholesale trade; retail trade; food) while the other seven are service-oriented (e.g., finance, insurance and real estate; service industries; public administration). The geo-location of the establishments {{in the study area}} made possible the design of a sample that respects the geographical breakdown of establishments with about 13 % at north, 13 % at south, and 74 % in Medellin. The sample was randomly drawn across the ten municipalities of the region. Only 1 % of the establishments listed were not considered in the sample because they are located in rural areas not covered by the survey. Similarly to the geographical distribution, the sample was designed to reproduce the distribution of industry segments {{with the exception of the}} large establishments (more than 200 employees), due to lack of data for this type of <b>establishements.</b> Most of the IIUCs were considered in the sample. The only exceptions were agriculture, livestock, fishing (usually not present in urban areas), other housing service activities, and other services. The data were collected through surveys in 4  months (between February and May of 2012) with a sample of 2947 establishments (4.4 % of the total). About 2 % had major errors and were excluded from the expansion procedure. A set of expansion factors, relating the sample to the universe for each IIUC, were applied to the survey results to obtain the overall picture of internal freight activity.|$|R
40|$|Aims Reducing alcohol-related harm {{in young}} people is a major {{priority}} across Europe. Much alcohol use and associated harm {{in young people}} occurs in public drinking environments. This review aims to identity environmental factors in drinking <b>establishements</b> {{that are associated with}} increased alcohol consumption and associated harm and to understand the extent of study in this area across Europe. Methods A systematic literature search identified studies that had explored associations between physical, staffing and social factors in drinking environments and increased alcohol use or alcohol-related harm. Results Fifty-three papers were identified, covering 34 studies implemented in nine countries. Most studies had been implemented in non-European countries and many had collected data more than a decade prior to the review. The majority had used observational research techniques. Throughout the studies, a wide range of physical, staffing and social factors had been associated with higher levels of alcohol use and related harm in drinking environments. Factors that appeared particularly important in contributing to alcohol-related problems included a permissive environment, cheap alcohol availability, poor cleanliness, crowding, loud music, a focus on dancing and poor staff practice. However, findings were not always consistent across studies. Conclusions Drinking establishments, their management and the behaviours of the young people who use them vary widely across Europe. While international research shows that environmental factors in drinking settings can have an important influence on alcohol-related harm, there is currently a scarcity of knowledge on the relevance and impacts of such factors in modern European settings. Developing this knowledge will support the implementation of strategies to create drinking environments in Europe that are less conducive to risky drinking and alcohol-related har...|$|R
