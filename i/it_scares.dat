So dealing with rejection {{became a part of}} life.... All that has taken a toll, I guess. I find it hard to deal with praise. Today, when people say that I have made it and made it on my own, I feel like locking up myself somewhere... <b>It</b> <b>scares</b> me." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{scene in}} which Ottman meshed his editing and {{composing}} duties was when Dussander wakes {{up in the hospital}} with the television show The Jeffersons playing in the background. Ottman explained his intent for the scene, [...] "I used The Jeffersons as this innocuous thing—going between him and the television—so that when he does open his eyes, <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> the hell out of you... I added this deafening Bartok pizz, which is when all the violins pluck their strings really loud and they create this gnarly, unsettling sound." [...] Ottman recorded the film's score with the Seattle Symphony.|$|E

[...] This is a bloke, with a brain on his shoulders, who is actually saying something he sincerely believes is happening in the world, saying it with real venom, and real passion. [...] It touches you and <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> you; it makes you feel uncomfortable. [...] It's like somebody saying [...] "The Germans are coming! [...] And there's no way we're gonna stop 'em! ...|$|E

500|$|Hordern was a self-confessed [...] "lazy bugger" [...] {{when it came}} to role preparation. He did not regret {{his lack}} of formal acting training, and {{attributed}} his abilities to watching and learning from other actors and directors. He said: [...] "I am bored of the intellectual view of the theatre. Actually, <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> the shit out of me, my view being that an actor should learn the lines without too much cerebral interference." [...] In 1951, he asked Byam Shaw how best to rehearse unfamiliar roles. [...] The director advised him to [...] "never read up on them" [...] before going on to say [...] "read the plays as much as [...] but never read the commentators or critics". It was advice which Hordern adopted for the role of King Lear, {{and for the rest of}} his career. The critic Brian McFarlane, writing for the British Film Institute, said that Hordern, despite his relaxed attitude, [...] "had one of the most productive careers of any 20th century British actor".|$|E

Of her crazy crush, DeGarmo said: [...] "Ooh, she wants him bad! Angie has her eyes, her heart and her body set on landing Kevin — and <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> him to death." [...] She said that Kevin was too sweet and nervous, and is weakened to Angelina's preying on him. [...] "She loves seeing him squirm" [...] DeGarmo stated. Of working with Rikaart, she said: [...] "Greg and I can't stop laughing during our scenes together." [...] During an interview with MSN, she stated: [...] "I've had the great pleasure sharing the screen with Mr. Greg Rikaart. Angelina gets {{a little bit of}} a crush on Kevin, and she's not afraid not to show it. It's a blast, because she makes him incredibly nervous [...] The sparks that fly on screen are just hilarious. It's wonderful to be a part of." [...] Just before Kevin was set to marry his girlfriend Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson), Angelina persuaded him to help her escape town, as she was in danger. They returned home safe.|$|E
2500|$|After seeing Armie Hammer's {{performance}} in The Social Network (2010), Guadagnino [...] "fell in love" [...] {{with him and}} cultivated his passion for Hammer and the movies he made afterwards. The director {{found him to be}} a [...] "sophisticated actor, with a great range" [...] and had him in mind for the role of Oliver. Hammer, who expressed his interest in Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash, met with the director years before the film went into production. When Hammer got the script, he almost turned down the role because of the nudity that was originally in it. [...] "I did want to pass. It scared me," [...] he said. [...] "There’s a lot of stuff here that I’ve never done on film before. But there’s no way I can’t do this, mostly because <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> me so much." [...] According to Guadagnino, Hammer was going to pass on the role through his agent, but then changed his mind {{at the end of their}} conversation. This is the third film that has Hammer playing a gay character, following Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar (2011) and Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait (2017).|$|E
