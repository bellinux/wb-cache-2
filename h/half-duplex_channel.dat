Each mobile station (MS) is either directly connected to a base station (BS) and/or con-nected to a relay station. We first derive closed-form solutions or upper-bound of the ergodic and outage capacities of four different downlink data relaying schemes: A direct scheme, a relay scheme, a selection scheme, and a cooperative scheme.

In this most general case, the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is characterized {{as a solution to}} a simple, two-variable optimization problem. This problem is then solved in closed form for special classes of channels defined by certain restrictions on the numbers of antennas at the three nodes. The key mathematical tool developed here that enables the explicit characterization of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is the joint eigenvalue distribution of three mutually correlated random Wishart matrices. Previously, without actually characterizing the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff, the optimality in this tradeoff metric of the dynamic compress-and-forward (DCF) protocol based on the classical compress-and-forward scheme of Cover and El Gamal was shown by Yuksel and Erkip. However, this scheme requires global channel state information (CSI) at the relay. In this work, the so-called quantize-map and forward (QMF) coding scheme due to Avestimehr et al is adopted as the achievability scheme with the added benefit that it achieves optimal tradeoff with only the knowledge of the (channel dependent) switching time at the relay node. Moreover, in special classes of the MIMO <b>half-duplex</b> relay <b>channel,</b> the optimal tradeoff is shown to be attainable even without this knowledge. Such a result was previously known only for the <b>half-duplex</b> relay <b>channel</b> with a single antenna at each node, also via the QMF scheme.

Due to its fundamental and practical importance, there has been an increasing interest in this channel. However, surprisingly, there has been few work that characterizes the fundamental tradeoff between the communication reliability and transmission rate across all signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) regimes. In this paper, we consider amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relaying due to its simplicity. We first derive the random coding error exponent for the link in each direction. From the exponent expression, the capacity and cutoff rate for each link are also deduced. We then define the minimal error exponent for the two-way AF relay fading channel, which is the worst exponent decay between the two links and gives us insight into the fundamental tradeoff between the rate pair and information-exchange reliability of the two terminals. As applications of the error exponent analysis for the design of two-way relay networks, we present two optimal resource allocations to maximize the minimal error exponent: i) the optimal rate allocation under a sum-rate constraint and its closed-form quasi-optimal solution that requires only the knowledge of the capacity and cutoff rate of each link; and ii) the optimal power allocation under a total power constraint of two terminals in the presenc...|$|E

In this paper, we derive capacity bounds for this problem for each of three protocols.

The second protocol considers sequential transmissions from the two users followed by a transmission from the relay while the third protocol is a hybrid of the first two protocols and has four phases. In the latter two protocols the inner and outer bounds are not identical, and differ in a manner similar to the inner and outer bounds of Cover’s relay channel. Numerical evaluation shows that at least in some cases of interest our bounds do not differ significantly. Finally, in the Gaussian case with path loss, we derive achievable rates and compare the relative merits of each protocol in various regimes. This case is of interest in cellular systems.
