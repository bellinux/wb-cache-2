In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called polyvalent (or unspecific) <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E

In a first study, 86 subjects could assess their performance after a motor test. The results showed that ego-oriented subjects chose normative information <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a high perceived ability, and rejected information <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a low one; task-oriented subjects chose objective information regardless of their perceived ability. In a second study, 108 subjects could use information during a training period.

5|$|Various {{species are}} known to feed on dead {{arthropods}} (scavenging), web silk, and their own shed exoskeletons. Pollen caught in webs may also be eaten, and {{studies have shown that}} young spiders {{have a better chance of}} survival <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the opportunity to eat pollen. In captivity, several spider species are also known to feed on bananas, marmalade, milk, egg yolk and sausages.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist.

Fish crows also appear as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E
50|$|Escalade was, in essence, {{an attempt}} to {{overwhelm}} defenders in a direct assault rather than sit through a protracted siege. Attackers would generally attempt escalade <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> reason for wanting a swift conclusion, or <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> an overwhelming superiority in numbers. Otherwise, less costly siege tactics were often preferred.|$|R
30|$|Patients {{were asked}} to tick the {{medication}} they were currently using {{from a list of}} maintenance medications (lithium, carbamazepine, valproate, lamotrigine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or aripiprazole), and to add any other medication they were currently using for BD, and were asked if, and with what frequency, laboratory tests were part of the treatment with lithium, valproate or carbamazepine. For psychosocial treatments, patients were asked <b>if</b> <b>they</b> ever <b>had</b> participated in a group psychoeducation program, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> ever received psychotherapy, and <b>if</b> so, whether <b>they</b> <b>had</b> received it in the previous year, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> received supportive treatment in the previous year, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> an emergency plan {{on how to deal with}} early symptoms of an impending mood episode, and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> regularly monitored their mood by completing prospective LifeCharts according to the NIMH Life-Chart Method (Leverich and Post 1998), which is well-known in the Netherlands.|$|R

5|$|Volcanoes {{are usually}} {{considered}} to be active <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> had eruptions during the Holocene. However, {{as demonstrated by the}} unexpected eruption of Chaiten volcano in Chile in May 2008, even long-inactive volcanoes can become active again. Such volcanoes can constitute a threat to regions with seemingly quiet volcanism. Ciomadul has had repose periods of over 10,000 years and possibly even longer. Zircon crystallization data imply that the magma chambers of Ciomadul were active over time spans of over 300,000 years.|$|E
5|$|While Star Trek {{in general}} {{features}} few overt references to religion, {{there is a}} clear recognition that a laying aside of past hurts is necessary for peace, similar to the concept of shalom in Judaism. Shatner regretted that Kirk's angst at being outmoded was minimized in the final print. A scene where Spock asks Kirk <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> grown so old and inflexible they have outlived their usefulness had two meanings: it was as much Nimoy asking Shatner as it was their characters.|$|E
5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon. Flowers are self-fecundating and protogynous (with female parts {{maturing}} first), and will self-pollinate <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not been pollinated by insects during the day. While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies. The hair on lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.|$|E

5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> any {{validity}} at all, {{may represent}} the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In reality, the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in reality. The latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an official document) {{and the fact that}} it is ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E
5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} few {{antidepressants}} {{that does}} not cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies demonstrate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants, but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction. According to a survey of psychiatrists, it is the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, although this is not an indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. There have also been a few studies suggesting that bupropion can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).|$|E
