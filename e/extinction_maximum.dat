A variety of combinations of these features were found, ranging from near or complete absence of a 2200 A bump (HD 29647), to low far-ultraviolet extinction (Rho Oph), to unusually steep, far-ultraviolet extinction (HD 169454). Anomalous extinction apparently shows up frequently in stars associated with nebulosity or dense clouds.

It is examined here how faunal diversity and rates of taxic evolution are related to change in sea-level and stability of the sea-level cycles. Evolutionary metrics of Palaeogene larger foraminifera are calculated and stability of sea-level cycles are determined using number and average duration of third order cycles in each stratigraphic interval. Generic diversity and the rates of origin and extinction individually do not show one to one correspondence either with transgression-regression or with the stability of the sea-level cycles. The rate of extinction relative to the rate of origination, however, is found to be significantly affected by the stability of the sea-level cycles. The rate of extinction exceeds the rate of origin during the periods of low stability.

The optical properties of this structure are described using a generic theoretical framework for surface waves in a coupled multilayer system.

The experimental results are further verified by numerical simulations, which also enable visualization of the near field. This study illustrates the surface plasmon characteristics (sensitive to periodicity) of the <b>extinction</b> <b>maximum</b> in the asymmetric spectral resonance induced by aperture arrays, while the transmission maximum corresponds to a resonance of localized character (sensitive to pore shape).

40|$|Spherical silver {{nanoparticles}} {{were prepared}} {{by means of}} ion beam synthesis in lithium niobate. The embedded nanoparticles were then irradiated with energetic 84 Kr and 197 Au ions, resulting in different electronic energy losses between 8. 1 and 27. 5 keV nm− 1 in {{the top layer of}} the samples. Due to the high electronic energy losses of the irradiating ions, molten ion tracks are formed inside the lithium niobate in which the elongated Ag nanoparticles are formed. This process is strongly dependent on the initial particle size and leads to a broad aspect ratio distribution. Extinction spectra of the samples feature the <b>extinction</b> <b>maximum</b> with shoulders on either side. While the maximum is caused by numerous remaining spherical nanoparticles, the shoulders can be attributed to elongated particles. The latter could be verified by COMSOL simulations.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{elaborate}} an experimental approach {{for improving the}} sensitivity of the SPR DNA hybridization sensor using GNPs modified by specific oligonucleotides, it was necessary to find compromising conditions for two simultaneous phenomena: an aggregation stability of GNPs and a quite efficient DNA hybridization. It is well known that an efficiency of DNA hybridization directly depends on the ionic strength of medium. For example, in our previous works, DNA hybridization on the SPR sensor surface was performed in 1 [*]×[*]SSC [5] or in 2 [*]×[*]SSC [2] buffer solutions, the ionic strength of which exceeded 150 or 300  mM, respectively. Under such conditions, an equilibrium between attractive hydrogen bonds and repulsive electrostatic forces in dispersion of GNPs is disturbed and electrolyte-induced aggregation occurs. The dispersed GNPs exhibit only a single peak at ~ 520  nm, while linked particle pairs (or larger aggregates) show two light <b>extinction</b> <b>maxima.</b> As the interparticle spacing decreases, the first peak becomes weaker, while the second peak intensifies and shifts to longer wavelengths [12 – 14].|$|R

Currently available methods, {{in addition to being}} tedious and time-consuming, result in polydispersed nanostructures, particularly due to polydispersed templates. In this study, optically tunable hollow gold nanostructures (HGNS) were synthesized by galvanic replacement reaction between silver nanospheres (AgNS) templates and gold salt. Monodispersed AgNS were created using a gold seed-mediated heteroepitaxial growth. Since it is easier to ensure monodispersed gold nanosphere seeds, the resulting AgNS showed a tight control on size. Hollow gold nanostructures 43 - 70 nm in size with <b>extinction</b> <b>maxima</b> ranging between 450 - 590 nm were produced by varying the gold to silver molar ratio. The nanostructures were observed to be monodispersed and uniform (SD <= 11 %) in all the batches.

Refractive index sensitivity of the HGNS based sensors was found to be 1. 5 -fold higher than solid gold nanosphere (GNS) -based fiber-optic sensors.

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this dissertation describes the design and synthesis of different gold nanoshells with strong absorption coefficients at the near-infrared region (NIR) of the spectrum, and includes preliminary studies of their use for the photo-induced heating of pancreatic cancer cells and ex vivo tissues. As the emphasis was on gold nanoshells with <b>maximum</b> <b>extinctions</b> located at 800 nm, the methods explored for their synthesis led us to the preparation of silica-core and hollow gold nanoshells of improved stability, with <b>maximum</b> <b>extinctions</b> at or beyond the targeted within the near-infrared window. The synthesis of silica-core gold nanoshells was investigated first given its relevance {{as one of the}} pioneering methods to produce gold nanostructures with strong absorption and scattering coefficients in the visible and the near-infrared regions of the spectrum. By using a classical method of synthesis, we explored the aging of the precursor materials and the effect of using higher concentrations than the customary for the reduction of gold during the shell growth. We found that the aging for one week of the as-prepared or purified precursors, namely, the gold cluster suspensions, and the seeded silica particles, along with higher concentrations of gold in the plating solution, produced fully coated nanoshells of 120 nm in size with smooth surfaces and <b>maximum</b> <b>extinctions</b> around 800 nm. Additional work carried out to reduce the time and steps in the synthesis of silica-core gold nanoshells, led us to improve the seeding step by increasing the ionic strength of the cluster suspension, and also to explore the growth of gold on tin-seeded silica nanoparticles. The synthesis of hollow gold nanoshells (HGS) of with <b>maximum</b> <b>extinctions</b> at the NIR via the galvanic replacement of silver nanoparticles for gold in solution was explored next. A first method explored led us to obtain HGS with <b>maximum</b> <b>extinctions</b> between 650 and 800 nm and sizes between 30 and 80 nm from silver nanoparticles, which were grown by the addition of silver nitrate and a mild reducer. We developed a second method that led us to obtain HGS with <b>maximum</b> <b>extinctions</b> between 750 and 950 nm by adjusting the pH of the precursor solution of the silver particles without much effort or additional steps. The last part of this work consisted in demonstrating the photo-induced heating of two biological systems containing HGS. Photothermal therapy studies of immobilized PANC 1 pancreas cancer cells in well-plates were carried out with functionalized HGS. We found that cells exposed to HGS remained viable after incubation. Moreover, the cells incubated with HGS modified with mercaptoundecanoic acid and folic acid turned non-viable after being irradiated with a laser at 800 nm. The other study consisted in the laser-induced heating between 750 and 1000 nm of ex vivo tissues of chicken and pork with nanoshells injected. In comparison with non-injected tissues, {{it was found that the}} temperature at the irradiated areas with HGS increased more than 10 °C. Moreover, the extent of the heated area was broader when the laser was used at wavelengths beyond 900 nm, suggesting that the heating was due to the radiation absorbed and transformed into heat primarily by the HGS and at a lesser extent by the water in the tissue...|$|R

Adequate protection of skin against {{the harmful effects}} of UV irradiation is essential. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the protective effects of afzelin, one of the flavonoids, against UV irradiation in human keratinocytes and epidermal equivalent models. Spectrophotometric measurements revealed that the afzelin <b>extinction</b> <b>maxima</b> were in the UVB and UVA range, and UV transmission below 376 nm was < 10 %, indicating UV-absorbing activity of afzelin. In the phototoxicity assay using the 3 T 3 NRU phototoxicity test (3 T 3 -NRU-PT), afzelin presented a tendency to no phototoxic potential. In addition, in order to investigate cellular functions of afzelin itself, cells were treated with afzelin after UVB irradiation. In human keratinocyte, afzelin effectively inhibited the UVB-mediated increase in lipid peroxidation and the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Afzelin also inhibited UVB-induced cell death in human keratinocytes by inhibiting intrinsic apoptotic signaling. Furthermore, afzelin showed inhibitory effects on UVB-induced release of pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin- 6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and prostaglandin-E 2 in human keratinocytes by interfering with the p 38 kinase pathway. Using an epidermal equivalent model exposed to UVB radiation, anti-apoptotic activity of afzelin was also confirmed together with a photoprotective effect at the morphological level. Taken together, our results suggest that afzelin has several cellular activities such as DNA-protective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory as well as UV-absorbing activity and may protect human skin from UVB-induced damage by a combination of UV-absorbing and cellular activities...|$|R

40|$|Metal {{enhanced}} fluorescence (MEF) is {{a physical}} effect through which the near-field interaction of fluorophores with metallic nanoparticles can lead to large fluorescence enhancement. MEF can be exploited in many fluorescence-based biomedical applications, with potentially significant improvement in detection sensitivity and contrast enhancement. Offering lower autofluorescence and minimal photoinduced damage, the development of effective and multifunctional MEF platforms in the near-infrared (NIR) region, is particularly desirable. In this work, the enhancement of NIR fluorescence caused by interaction with regular arrays of cylindrical gold (Au) nanoparticles (nanodiscs), fabricated through nanosphere lithography, is reported. Significant MEF of up to 235 times is obtained, with tuneable enhancement factors. The effect of array structure on fluorescence enhancement is investigated by semi-quantitatively de-convoluting excitation enhancement from emission enhancement, and modelling the local electric field enhancement. By considering arrays of Au nanodiscs with the same <b>extinction</b> <b>maximum,</b> it is shown that the excitation enhancement, due to increased electric field, is not significantly different for the particle sizes and separation distances considered.

Tetrathiol cavitands such as 8 and 13 enhance the dispersion and robustness of midnanometer-sized gold particles suspended in organic solvents. Tetra-C-thiomethyl cavitand 13 is a superior dispersant over tetra-C-thiol cavitand 8 under the conditions examined. However, cavitand 8 provides excellent dispersion control of gold nanoparticles at the air-water interface and enables their spontaneous organization into two-dimensional arrays. In addition, we {{have studied the}} self-assembly of resorcinarene-encapsulated gold nanoparticles {{as a function of}} surface charge and surfactant structure. The degree of monolayer formation and 2 D order within the self-assembled nanoparticle arrays is strongly influenced by the amount and type of electrolyte (chloride and/or citrate) adsorbed on the nanoparticle surface. Resorcinarenes with strongly chemisorptive headgroups promote the self-assembly of 2 D arrays. ^ The gold nanoparticle arrays exhibit size-dependent <b>extinction</b> <b>maxima</b> which shift toward near-infrared wavelengths with increasing periodicity.

Monophasic extinction increases reaching the same final value were observed when either discoid or spiny sphere platelets were converted to smooth spheres by treatment with chlorpromazine, and sphering of discoid cells was accompanied by a larger total extinction change than the retraction of pseudopods by already spherical cells. These and other results suggest that the ADP-induced transient state represents platelets that are approximately as "spherical" as the irregular spiny sphere but lack the characteristic long pseudopods and as a consequence are larger bodied. Fitting the ADP progress curves to the series reaction A leads to B leads to C by means of the light scattering equivalent of the Beer-Lambert law yielded scattering cross sections that are consistent with this explanation. The rate constants for the two reaction steps were identical, indicating that ADP activation corresponds to a continuous random (Poisson) process with successive apparent states "disc," "sphere," and "spiny sphere," whose individual probabilities are determined by a single rate-limiting step...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The Arctic is a {{receptor}} {{of pollution}} transported from distant regions. Pollution reaches the Arctic both in gaseous and aerosol form, {{both of which}} have important climatic and ecological implications. This dissertation focuses on aerosols in the Arctic, specifically their transport to and their distribution in space and time within the arctic troposphere. The cornerstone of this thesis is the analysis of the retrievals made by the satellite-borne Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), a two-wavelength polarization-sensitive lidar that measures the atmospheric attenuated backscatter return and provides high-resolution vertical profiles of aerosols and clouds. Chapter 2 uses CALIOP observations to follow the evolution of pollution aerosols transported from East Asia to the Arctic. The transport pathway is elucidated with backtrajectories and aerosol simulations with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. The polluted air mass experiences strong ascent within a cyclonic circulation near the source region. Once in the free troposphere, a block in the upper-air flow forces the circulation to take on a strongly southerly route. Since the air mass reaches the Arctic very rapidly (3 - 5 days), the aerosol scavenging is incomplete. Transport is nearly-isentropic except in its initial phase. Once in the Arctic, the aerosol plume slowly subsides due to radiative cooling. Using six years of CALIOP observations, Chapter 3 focuses on the horizontal, vertical and temporal distribution of Arctic aerosols. At low altitudes in the High Arctic (poleward of 70 ºN), aerosol extinctions maximize in winter/early spring and reach their lowest values during summer. In the lower troposphere in the Low Arctic, in addition to the winter/early spring maximum, aerosol extinctions also display a secondary maximum in summer due to boreal forest fires. CALIOP measurements show that a major low-level Eurasian pollution transport pathway occurs on the western flank of the Siberian anticyclone. There is a progressive shift of the <b>extinction</b> <b>maximum</b> with altitude, from January at 0 - 2 km, to March at 2 - 5 km, to April at 5 - 8 km. In the free troposphere, the most polluted aerosol transport pathway occurs downwind of East Asia. Biomass burning emissions anomalies and the Arctic Oscillation control the interannual variability of aerosol extinction throughout the Arctic troposphere. Chapter 4 focuses on comparing the Arctic aerosol distribution observed by CALIOP against a simulation from the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model. Independent in situ observations are also used in this evaluation. The model successfully reproduces the seasonal cycle of sulfate aerosol concentrations at the surface, the vertical and temporal distribution of extinction in the free troposphere and the variability and magnitude of column optical depth from March to September. However the model does not reproduce the low-level <b>extinction</b> <b>maximum</b> observed by CALIOP and in situ instruments during winter. The model significantly underestimates observed sea-salt aerosol concentrations maximum at three High Arctic surface stations. This suggests a potential missing source of sea salt aerosols from blowing snow over sea ice from November to March. In summer, aerosol wet removal within the Arctic is too weak, possibly due to a raindrop size distribution in the parametrization of below-cloud scavenging that is too large for the Arctic summer stratocumulus drizzle. The model underestimates extinction over central and eastern Russia through the troposphere in all seasons, suggesting that emissions in northern Russia are likely underestimated...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSeveral {{ecological}} {{factors that could}} play into species extinction are expected to correlate with species age, i. e., time elapsed since the species arose by speciation. To date, however, statistical tools to incorporate species age into likelihood-based phylogenetic inference have been lacking. We present here a computational framework to quantify age-dependent <b>extinction</b> through <b>maximum</b> likelihood parameter estimation based on phylogenetic trees, assuming species lifetimes are gamma distributed. Testing on simulated trees shows that neglecting age dependence can lead to biased estimates of key macroevolutionary parameters. We then apply this method to two real data sets, namely a complete phylogeny of birds (class Aves) and a clade of self-compatible and -incompatible nightshades (Solanaceae), gaining initial insights into {{the extent to which}} age-dependent extinction may help explain macroevolutionary patterns.
