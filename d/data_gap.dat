5000|$|Scafetta {{argues that}} the total solar {{irradiance}} (TSI) measurements gathered by satellites since 1978 are flawed because the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster prevented the timely launching of the ACRIM 2 satellite, which he worked on, to replace ACRIM 1. This results in a two-year <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> in the ACRIM time series, which scientists bridge with overlapping data from several other satellites. They conclude that heating from the Sun did not increase between 1980 and 2002 and does not significantly contribute to the global surface warming over that period. Some ACRIM investigators, including principal investigator Richard Willson (Columbia) and Scafetta, disagree and argue for a significant upward trend in average solar luminosity during the same period. The Duke University student newspapers report that Scafetta and West's interpretation of Richard Willson's analysis is that [...] "the sun may have minimally contributed about 10 to 30 percent of the 1980-2002 global surface warming." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>data</b> <b>gaps</b> {{is always a}} concern in geophysical records, creating not only difficulty in interpretation but, more importantly, also a large source of uncertainty in data analysis. Filling the <b>data</b> <b>gaps</b> is a necessity for use in statistical modeling. There are numerous approaches for this purpose. However, particularly challenging are {{the increasing number of}} very large spatio-temporal datasets such as those from Earth observations satellites. Here we introduce an efficient three-dimensional method based on discrete cosine transforms, which explicitly utilizes information from both time and space to predict the missing values. To analyze its performance, the method was applied to a global soil moisture product derived from satellite images. We also executed a validation by introducing synthetic gaps. It is shown this method is capable of filling <b>data</b> <b>gaps</b> in the global soil moisture dataset with very high accuracy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

50|$|ICAM {{sought to}} develop {{procedures}} (IDEF) processes (Group Technology) and software (CAD/CAM) that would integrate all operations in Aerospace manufacturing and thus greatly reduce costs. Earlier the USAF Manufacturing Technology Program had funded the Automatically Programmed Tools (APT) language for programming Numerically Controlled (NC) machine tools. To close the <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> between parts design and manufacturing, {{one of the}} ICAM goals was to develop CAD software that would automatically generate numerical control programs for the very complex Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machine tools used throughout the Aerospace industry. A serious issue was the incompatibility of data produced by the many CAD systems in use at the time. USAF/ICAM called {{a meeting at the}} National Bureau of Standards (now known as National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST) in 1978 to address this issue. Boeing offered to sell its CAD translation software to USAF for one United States dollar. USAF accepted this offer and contracted NIST to bring together a group of users and vendors, including Boeing, General Electric, Xerox, Computervision, Applicon and others to further develop and test this software. Though it was the practice to begin the name of ICAM developments with the word integrated (for example the IDEFs) believing that there would be rapid development of graphical exchange software, USAF decided that the IGES would be the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification not the Integrated Graphics Exchange Specification.|$|E
40|$|Governments {{worldwide}} are recognising {{ecosystem services}} as {{an approach to}} address sustainability challenges. Decision-makers need credible and legitimate measurements of ecosystem services to evaluate decisions for trade-offs to make wise choices. Managers lack these measurements because of a <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> linking ecosystem characteristics to final ecosystem services. The dominant method to address the <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> is benefit transfer using ecological data from one location to estimate ecosystem services at other locations with similar land cover. However, benefit transfer is only valid once the <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> is adequately resolved. Disciplinary frames separating ecology from economics and policy have resulted in confusion on concepts and methods preventing progress on the <b>data</b> <b>gap.</b> In this study, we present a 10 -step approach to unify concepts, methods and data from the disparate disciplines to offer guidance on overcoming the <b>data</b> <b>gap.</b> We suggest: (1) estimate ecosystem characteristics using biophysical models, (2) identify final ecosystem services using endpoints and (3) connect them using ecological production functions to quantify biophysical trade-offs. The guidance is strategic for public policy because analysts need to be: (1) realistic when setting priorities, (2) attentive to timelines to acquire relevant data, given resources and (3) responsive {{to the needs of}} decision-makers...|$|E

40|$|A common {{question}} in the CERCLA remedial investigation (RI) process is, {open_quotes}What are the <b>data</b> <b>gaps</b> that must be filled in order to perform a risk assessment for a given site?{close_quotes} Often a method {{that can be used}} to identify and rank <b>data</b> <b>gaps</b> is needed to help allocate scarce remedial investigation funds, and to help prepare for a CERCLA site`s baseline risk assessment (BRA). A CERCLA Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) is underway at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory`s (INEL) Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA). The SDA is a radioactive waste disposal site where transuranic (TRU) waste, mixed waste (MW), and low-level waste (LLW) has been buried in pits, trenches, and soil vaults since 1952. The procedures described in this paper have been developed for the identification of risk assessment <b>data</b> <b>gaps</b> at the SDA. In preparation for the SDA RI/FS, three major investigations have been performed over the past two years. The first of these investigations identified all of the waste streams that were buried in the SDA from 1952 through 1983. The second investigation identified all of the SDA waste streams that were buried from 1984 through the present, and made predictions of the waste volumes that will be buried through the year 2003. The third investigation was the Preliminary Scoping Risk Assessment (PSRA) for the SDA. The PSRA was an initial evaluation of the human health risk associated with the SDA`s buried waste, and it was developed with the intent of identifying risk assessment <b>data</b> <b>gaps</b> for the SDA.

40|$|Scientific {{information}} {{has become a}} centralr ationalef or environmental regulation, and scientific uncertainty {{is viewed as a}} major obstacle in developing, justifying, and enforcing environmental laws and policies. In the context of environmental regulation, scientific information may be analyzed as subject to both supply and demand. A regulatory system that supplies more scientific information than it demands can operate effectively to impose protective regulation. By contrast, a system that demands more information than it supplies will face a 2 ̆ 2 <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> 2 ̆ 2 and will fail to accomplish its protective goals. The <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> can be addressed by applying regulatory techniques that increase the supply of data by providing more information (2 ̆ 7 filling 2 ̆ 2 the gap) or that reduce the demand by permitting regulation to proceed despite uncertainty and incomplete information (2 ̆ 2 bridging 2 ̆ 2 the gap). Environmental law is also structured by the divide between pollution control and chemical regulation on the one hand, and resource management on the other. In addressing the <b>data</b> <b>gap,</b> therefore, it is necessary to distinguish not only between supply and demand, but also between chemical and conservation issues. The existence of a <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> between the scientific information necessary for effective environmental regulation and the information available to regulators and the public presents an opportunity to study the causes and extent of the differences in the chemical and conservation regulatory systems.

40|$|Methods {{to predict}} and fill Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector (SLC) -off <b>data</b> <b>gaps</b> are diverse and their {{usability}} is case specific. An appropriate gap-filling method {{that can be}} used for seagrass mapping applications has not been proposed previously. This study compared gap-filling methods for filling SLC-off <b>data</b> <b>gaps</b> with images acquired from different dates at similar mean sea-level tide heights, covering the Sungai Pulai estuary area inhabited by seagrass meadows in southern Peninsular Malaysia. To assess the geometric and radiometric fidelity of the recovered pixels, three potential gap-filling methods were examined: (a) geostatistical neighbourhood similar pixel interpolator (GNSPI); (b) weighted linear regression (WLR) algorithm integrated with the Laplacian prior regularization method; and (c) the local linear histogram matching method. These three methods were applied to simulated and original SLC-off images. Statistical measures for the recovered images showed that GNSPI can predict <b>data</b> <b>gaps</b> over the seagrass, non-seagrass/water body, and mudflat site classes with greater accuracy than the other two methods. For optimal performance of the GNSPI algorithm, cloud and shadow in the primary and auxiliary images had to be removed by cloud removal methods prior to filling <b>data</b> <b>gaps.</b> The gap-filled imagery assessed in this study produced reliable seagrass distribution maps and should help with the detection of spatiotemporal changes of seagrasses from multi-temporal Landsat imagery. The proposed gap-filling method can thus improve the usefulness of Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off images in seagrass applications...|$|R
