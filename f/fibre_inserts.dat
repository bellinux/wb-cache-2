40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the fracture resistance of premolars with mesio-occluso-distal (MOD) preparations restored with two different resin composites along with three placement methods. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, sixty human sound maxillary premolars mounted in acrylic resin were randomly divided into two groups according to the type of composite restoration (Filtek P 60, Nulite F). Each group was further subdivided into three subgroups according to the type of placement methods namely Bulk, Centripetal and <b>Fibre</b> <b>Insert</b> (n = 10). The same adhesive system; Single Bond, was used for composite bonding following manufacturer's instructions for all teeth. Specimens in groups 1, 2 and 3 were restored with Filtek P 60 resin composite while in groups 4, 5 and 6 Nulite F was applied. After 24 hours storage in 37 °C, a 4 mm diameter steel sphere in Universal Testing Machine was contacted the buccal and lingual cusps of the tested teeth at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min until fracture occurred. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and Duncan tests (p value < 0. 05). Results: Groups 3 and 6 showed a higher fracture resistance than other groups (P = 0. 001). Among the placement methods, <b>Fibre</b> <b>insert</b> showed a significant result (P = 0. 0001) but the type of composite was insignificant (P = 0. 791). Conclusion: It seems that on MOD cavities, contrary to the type of materials used, the insertion method, largely influences fracture resistance of premolar teeth restored with resin composite.

40|$|AbstractAimsTo {{establish}} a possible mechanism {{of damage to}} a laser fibre significant enough to cause a retained segment within a patient. MethodsA 21 G needle was used to pierce a VARILASE™ 810 nm Laser <b>Fibre</b> <b>inserted</b> within a 4 F sheath. A tiny pin source {{of light from the}} aiming beam emerged from the needle hole in the sheath. Using laser protection protocol, the generator was fired for one minute at 14 Watts (W) continuous wave. The sheath and fibre were then examined. In a control experiment, we were unable manually to break a fibre where the coating had been damaged prior to the laser being fired. ResultsThe aiming beam was noted to be concentrated {{at the side of the}} catheter at the point of needle damage rather than at the fibre tip. When the fibre was removed from the sheath the distal length, from the point of damage to the tip, was retained within the sheath. Longer firing with the sheath surrounded by a wet towel or a pork loin resulted in complete severance of the sheath and fibre. ConclusionThere are no firm manufacturer's guidelines on whether Tumescent Anaesthesia should be delivered before or after the laser <b>fibre</b> has been <b>inserted</b> into the patient. Some units performing EVLA prefer to do this with the laser fibre in situ as it is easier to image on ultrasound than the sheath alone. The results of this in-vitro experiment would suggest it is possible to cause sufficient needle damage to fracture a laser fibre when fired. In the interests of safety we would recommend administration of tumescent anaesthesia should always be carried out before introduction of the laser fibre...|$|R

Light penetration depths at 630, 660 and 690 nm and the optimal configuration of intrauterine light-diffusing fibres were determined in 14 human uteri {{to assist in the}} design of a light intrauterine device. Post-menopausal ex-vivo uteri showed a significantly lower light penetration depth than pre-menopausal uteri. With a single central diffusing <b>fibre</b> <b>inserted,</b> the fluence rate measured in the uterine wall at the most remote point of the cavity decreased to 1. 1 ± 0. 4 % of that measured at closest proximity, whereas it decreased to only 40. 0 ± 9. 0 % with three fibres. Distension of the uterine cavity with 2 ml of an optically clear fluid increased the fluence rate at the fundus between the fibres at a depth of 2 mm by a factor of 4. We conclude that in normal-sized pre-menopausal uterine cavities, three diffusing fibres will deliver an optical dose above the photodynamic threshold level at a depth of 4 mm, even in the most remote areas, in < 30 min without causing thermal damage.

40|$|The use {{of optical}} fibre as a {{mechanism}} for the delivery of the trapping laser beam to the sample chamber significantly reduces both the size and the build costs of “Optical Tweezers”. Furthermore, the use of fibre facilitates the decoupling of the optical trapping beam from the microscope optics, which provides further scope {{for the development of}} a portable optical trapping system, and the potential for uncomplicated integration with other advanced microscopy systems such as an atomic force microscope (AFM) for example. For use with an AFM, the optical <b>fibre</b> must be <b>inserted</b> at an angle of 10 ° with respect to the sample chamber floor. However, previous literature suggests that 3 D optical trapping with a single <b>fibre</b> <b>inserted</b> at an angle ≤ 20 ° is not feasible. This thesis presents the design, development, build and test of a single beam optical fibre based gradient force optical tweezers system and its associated software. An investigation is conducted to ascertain why optical trapping, using single fibre systems, cannot be achieved at sub 20 ° insertion angles, the result of which formed the basis of a hypothesis that explains this limitation. This finding led to the development of tapered optical fibre tips that are cable of 3 D optical trapping at an insertion angle of ≤ 10 °. The optimised optical fibre tapers are presented and their ability to trap both organic and inanimate material in 3 D at an insertion angle of 10 ° is demonstrated. The near-horizontal insertion angle introduced a maximum trapping range (MTR). The MTR of the tips is determined empirically, evaluated against simulated data, and found to be tuneable through taper optimisation. Optical trap characterisation has been undertaken in terms of the optical trapping forces acting on the trapping subjects. Finally, the fibre tapering devices ability to reproduce identical tapers, or not, using the same device parameters, was investigated and the results in terms of geometric profile and optical performance are presented...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of local}} {{hyperthermia}} to treat {{cancer of the}} internal organs has been limited by the difficulty of controlling delivery of heat and limiting the effects to the tumour, but this can be overcome by using laser light transmitted through thin flexible fibres. Laser energy was delivered to tumours through <b>fibres</b> <b>inserted</b> percutaneously through needles directly into {{the centre of the}} tumour area. Ultrasound scanning was used to locate the tumour, position the fibres correctly within the tumour, and monitor the development of thermal necrosis in real time during laser exposure and through the subsequent period of healing. Five patients were treated (one with a tumour of the breast, one with a subcutaneous secondary tumour, one with a recurrent pancreatic tumour, and two with secondary tumours in the liver). Tumour necrosis was found on ultrasonography or computed tomography in all, and there were no immediate or delayed complications. In one patient the size of the isolated secondary tumour in the liver had not increased over 10 months, and he subsequently showed no other evidence of residual cancer. To develop this technique careful studies are essential to ensure that in every case the extent of thermal necrosis produced by absorption of the laser light can be matched to {{the full extent of the}} tumour being treated and that there is always sufficient adjacent normal tissue to ensure safe healing.

40|$|The barrier {{properties}} against electromagnetic radiation of multilayer needle-bonded nonwovens containing flax (F) fibres and polypropylene (PP) fibres and manufactured in different technological conditions have been investigated. Single-fibre webs of longitudinally arranged fibres put into layers one onto another to comprise a multilayer structure of seven single-fibre webs. The number of F fibre webs {{in the lap}} influenced the percentage of flax fibres evaluated by mass. Each kind of the laps was needled at the density 80, 120, and 200 cm– 2. As a result, 18 samples of needle-bonded nonwovens of similar morphological and comfort properties but different bulk electrical resistance were prepared. The maximum bulk electrical resistance at dry conditions, {{of the order of}} 7 · 1014 Ω, was characteristic for the samples made entirely of PP fibres, while the minimum resistance, of the order of 1010 Ω, was characteristic for the samples made entirely of F <b>fibres.</b> <b>Insert</b> of flax <b>fibres</b> into the nonwoven structure at amount ~ 14 % resulted in 20 – 100 times decrease of electrical bulk resistance.

40|$|Acute {{effects of}} {{intramuscular}} aponeurotomy on muscle force and geometry {{as a function}} to muscle length were studied in rat m. gastrocnemius medialis (GM). Acutely after aponeurotomy, activation of the muscle at increasing lengths (acute trajectory) showed a spontaneous and progressive but partial tearing of the connective tissue interface between the <b>fibres</b> <b>inserting</b> directly proximally and distally {{to the location of}} the section. After this the muscle consisted morphologically of a stable proximal and a distal part (post-aponeurotomy). Post-aponeurotomy mean active sarcomere length within fibres of the proximal part was shown to be unaffected. In contrast, mean sarcomere length within the distal part was reduced substantially after aponeurotomy. However active sarcomeres in the distal part were still attaining higher lengths with increasing muscle lengths (p < 0. 005), indicating myofascial force transmission through the intact part of the connective tissue interface of the muscle parts. Post-aponeurotomy optimum muscle force was reduced substantially to less than 45 % of pre-aponeurotomy values. During the acute trajectory the muscle yielded approximately 20 % higher forces than post-aponeurotomy, indicating that myofascial force transmission was related to the area of connective tissue interface. It is concluded that after aponeurotomy of the proximal aponeurosis of rat GM, fibres without direct myotendinous connection to the origin of the muscle are still able to contribute to muscle force. As the magnitude of reduction in muscle force can only be explained partially by the spontaneous rupture of the connective tissue interface between proximal and distal muscle part, other factors causing a decrease of muscle force are present.

40|$|Since cancer {{continues}} to plague humanity there is large need {{for development of}} modalities for both diagnosis and therapy. Most of the currently available methods suffer from serious disadvantages. The treatments, e. g. ionising radiation, chemotherapy, surgery, may themselves induce malignancies or the patient may be physically impaired {{for a longer period}} of time. The work presented aims at developing equipment and methods that use light for both detection and treatment of various malignant or pre-malignant conditions. Fundamental knowledge on the interaction between light and tissue is required in order to develop models for the light distribution in tissue. Therefore, basic properties of light-tissue interaction, like refractive index, absorption, scattering, and scattering anisotropy, are introduced. How the physiological status of the tissue affects these properties are discussed. Utilizing the differences in the fluorescence spectra emitted by healthy and malignant tissues, when irradiated with visible light, it is possible to detect and delineate certain lesions. The contrast between diseased and healthy tissue can be further enhanced with the use of a fluorescence tumour marker. The evolution of these tumour markers has been fuelled by the fact that many tumour markers also can be utilized for light therapy. The modality is called photodynamic therapy (PDT) and has now been clinically approved for the treatment of several conditions. The possible indications for this type of treatment are generally limited to thin superficial lesions due to the limited penetration of the light in tissue. The work presented in this thesis mainly relates to overcoming the limited light penetration by leading the light through multiple optical <b>fibres</b> <b>inserted</b> into the tumour. In this way both embedded tumour and/or thick tumours could be an indication for this modality.

This particular laser diode in temperature range from 6 degrees celsius to 24 degrees Celsius has a tuning range of 0, 86 nm, which correspond to change of 650 GHz in optical frequency domain. In this paper we also present methodology and results for frequency noise properties investigation of this laser with unbalanced Mach-Zhender interferometer and 10 m long <b>fibre</b> spool <b>inserted</b> in reference arm...|$|R
50|$|Tendon cells form a {{connecting}} {{epithelial layer}} between the muscle and shell in molluscs. In gastropods, for example, the retractor muscles {{connect to the}} shell via tendon cells. Muscle cells {{are attached to the}} collagenous myo-tendon space via hemidesmosomes. The myo-tendon space is then attached {{to the base of the}} tendon cells via basal hemidesmosomes, while apical hemidesmosomes, which sit atop microvilli, attach the tendon cells to a thin layer of collagen. This is in turn attached to the shell via organic <b>fibres</b> which <b>insert</b> into the shell. Molluscan tendon cells appear columnar and contain a large basal cell nucleus. The cytoplasm is filled with granular endoplasmic reticulum and sparse golgi. Dense bundles of microfilaments run the length of the cell connecting the basal to the apical hemidesmosomes.|$|R
