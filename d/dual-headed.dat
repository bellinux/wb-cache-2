For MRI imaging (1. 5 Tesla), the phantom was filled with water and doped with Gd-DTPA for contrast enhancement. For both modalities, phantom images were acquired and reconstructed using a routine clinical protocol. MRI and SPET images were matched by Downhill Simplex minimization of the sum of absolute Count Differences (CD), the sum of the Square Root of absolute count differences (SR), the Difference in Shape between the binary masks (SD), the number of Sign Changes in the subtracted image (SC), the Variance of intensities between corresponding pixels (VAR), the sum of absolute count differences between the 2 D- and 3 D-Gradient images (2 DG- 3 DG) and, finally, the standard deviation of the Uniformity Index (UI), that is the intensity ratio between spatially corresponding voxels. Six degrees of freedom were allowed (three translation and three rotation parameters, three scaling parameters were constrained). The accuracy of the matching process with these different similarity measures was evaluated via the residual mismatch between external markers.

The focus of the essay is the gender division of decision-making within <b>dual-headed</b> beneficiary households. Descriptive and regression analysis indicate that women 2 ̆ 7 s land rights and their membership in the Landless Rural Worker 2 ̆ 7 s Movement (MST) are associated with greater than average rates of joint decision-making and women 2 ̆ 7 s autonomous decision-making in the household. The second chapter compares children 2 ̆ 7 s school enrollment and attainment rates among <b>dual-headed</b> and lone parent families on agrarian reform land encampments and land settlements, using two datasets collected in 1999. Children of all ages on land settlements {{are more likely to}} be in school than children on land encampments, but teenage girls on land settlements {{are more likely to be}} in school than boys, and also attain more in school. There is evidence that the combined effects of household membership in the MST and in producer 2 ̆ 7 s organizations predict a greater likelihood of school enrollment and a higher rate of attainment for children in all households.

30|$|Adenosine stress 99 mTc-tetrofosmin (250  MBq, 6.8  mCi) {{and rest}} 99 mTc-tetrofosmin (750  MBq, 20  mCi) electrocardiographically gated single-photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) were performed in consecutive order in a 1 -day protocol to analyse myocardial ischaemia. Patients {{were asked to}} withdraw caffeine-containing beverages and/or food 24  h before the examination. 99 mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT studies were obtained 1  h after tracer administration using a <b>dual-headed</b> gamma camera, equipped with low-energy high-resolution collimators (Symbia T 16 gamma camera, Siemens Medical System, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA), electrocardiographic gating, and low-dose computed tomography for attenuation correction. All data from the 99 mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT studies were reformatted to obtain short-axis, horizontal and vertical long-axis sections. Data were analyzed and displayed in a 17 -segment polar map using the Quantitative Perfusion SPECT application, a commercially available gated cardiac software package developed by the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Los Angeles, CA, USA) [14]. Average counts per segment {{were obtained from the}} 17 segments and the measured counts were normalized to the segment with the highest average counts.|$|E
40|$|This paper re-examines {{the labor}} supply {{responses}} in the Seattle and Denver Income Maintenance Experiments (SIME/DIME). Specifically, the original experimental results show a significantly larger labor supply response {{for men and women}} from <b>dual-headed</b> households in the five-year Negative Income Tax (NIT) treatment relative to those in the three-year NIT treatment. Although typically thought of only as an NIT experiment, the SIME/DIME also included a job training experiment that enrolled roughly 60 percent of households, including both NIT treatment and control households. The original empirical specification imposed strong assumptions on the treatment response to the job training experiment in order to increase the precision of the estimated parameters. Once these assumptions are relaxed, the labor supply differences between men in the three- and five-year NIT treatments fall by over 50 percent in magnitude and become statistically insignificant. The analogous differences for women are almost entirely explained by these specification changes. Whereas the original findings of the SIME/DIME were inconsistent with the standard life-cycle labor supply model, the results of the re-analysis are mostly consistent with the model. ...|$|E
