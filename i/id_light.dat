40|$|In this thesis, I {{will discuss}} the Anstotelian {{concepts}} of actuality and potentiality {{in combination with the}} Cartesian method. On the one hand this will be done as an attempt to balance the traditional English language interpretation of the relationship between Anstotelian and Cartesian philosophy, which tends to characterise them as fundamentally opposed. On the other hand, it will be done in order to generate legitimate unexplored conceptual frameworks for viewing the work of both philosophers. There is an assumption central to the greater part of English language scholarship on Descartes, attaining almost the status of self evidence, that within the philosophical canon, the appearance of the Cartesian method marks a definitive break between the ancient and the modern. Descartes signal achievement, on this assumption, was that he found a way once and for all, to break philosophy free from the shackles of Aristotelian thought. Such an idea is based upon the notion that, after Aristotle and prior to Descartes, philosophy consisted of little more than the endless repetition, or subtle modification of a hybrid Christian/ Anstotelian doctrine. The subsequent trajectory of English language philosophy appears to attest to the validity of such a view, and its apparent self-evidence from the perspective of this tradition serves to cover over other legitimate approaches to interpretation and use of Aristotelian and Cartesian concepts. In this thesis, rather than performing a comparison of the philosophy of Aristotle and Descartes, the Aristotelian concepts of actuality and potentiality and the Cartesian method will be considered <b>ID</b> <b>light</b> of a smgle task, namely, an attempt to theorise transformations in fundamental structures of knowledge. This will be accomplished by identifying latent possibilities suitable for such a task within Aristotelian and Cartesian conceptual structures, and extending them accordingly. As such, this thesis must be understood as a speculative work rather than as a work in history of philosophy. Aristotle demonstrates the meaning and function of the concepts of actuality and potentiality by way of analogy. This form of demonstration leaves the meaning of actuality and potentiality open to further extension by analogy. As such, the concepts of actuality and potentiality can be extended to cases not originally brought under these concepts by Aristotle. In this thesis the concepts of actuality and potentiality will be extended, according to the structure of the analogy by which Aristotle originally defines them, to an explanation of transformation in structures of knowledge. At the same time, the Cartesian method will be interpreted as a detailed account of a particular transformation from one structure of knowledge to another. Whilst Descartes characterises his own project in terms of the attainment of certainty, I intend to show that Descartes' stated intention in the creation of his method is less significant in terms of his overall system that the transformation that this intent brings about...|$|E

40|$|The {{basic problem}} of {{communicating}} over a computer network can be illustrated by analogy. Imagine that {{a dozen people}} know they will be imprisoned, one person per cell. Each cell has a single light panel, featuring a light bulb, on/off buttons, and an <b>ID</b> number. <b>light</b> panel with <b>ID</b> # 6 Pressing the "on " button on one light panel turns on the light bulbs in every cell. Likewise, the "off " button turns off everyone's lights. In other words, all light panels are connected to a single light system. 1 Knowing all this, the dozen people conspire to use the light system {{to communicate with each}} other. They know they can represent any information as a string of bits (0 s and 1 s). How can they use their light panels to transmit 0 s and 1 s, and what difficulties will they encounter? In a Bit Let's first deal with the problem where only one person wishes to broadcast a string of bits to everyone. How can they use the light system to represent 0 s and 1 s? You migh...|$|R
40|$|The Canadian Light Source (CLS) {{storage ring}} has been {{operating}} routinely since commissioning was completed {{in the spring of}} 2004. Beam currents up to 230 mA have been achieved with the single superconducting RF cavity. With steady improvement beam lifetimes (1 /e) of 14 hours at 200 mA and 0. 5 % coupling are now possible. In the last year the vertical tune was increased by 1 integer to produce a smaller vertical beam size in the insertion device (ID) straight sections. This year the horizontal tune will be increased to reduce the beam emittance. The vertical coupling has been reduced both globally and locally using a skew quadrupole response technique. A wide range of photon energies are provided by an initial complement of five IDs and two infrared (IR) ports. The 5 m straights have room for two <b>IDs.</b> The <b>light</b> cones from these IDs are separated by about 1. 5 mrad by “chicaning ” the electron beam in the straights. To date two IDs have been installed in one straight using the chicaning technique.

40|$|Recently machine learning-based Intrusion Detection systems (IDs) {{have been}} {{subjected}} to extensive researches because they can detect both misuse and anomaly. Most of existing IDs use all features in the network packet to look for known intrusive patterns. In this paper a new hybrid model RSC-PGP (Rough Set Classification- Parallel Genetic Programming) is presented {{to address the problem of}} identifying important features in building an intrusion detection system, increase the convergence speed and decrease the training time of RSC. Tests are done on KDD- 99 data used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition. Results showed that the proposed model gives better and robust representation of rules as it was able to select features resulting in great data reduction, time reduction and error reduction in detecting new attacks. Empirical results reveal that Genetic Programming (GP) based techniques could play a major role in developing <b>IDs</b> which are <b>light</b> weight and accurate when compared to some of the conventional intrusion detection systems based on machine learning paradigms.

40|$|Earlier {{research}} has shown that after physics instruction, many students have difficulties with the force concept, and with constructing free-body diagrams (FBDs). It has been suggested that treating forces as interactions could help students to identify forces as well as to construct the correct FBDs. While there is evidence that identifying interactions helps students in quantitative problem solving, there is no previous research investigating the effect of a visual-representation tool—an interaction diagram (ID) —on students’ ability to identify forces, and to construct the correct FBDs. We present an empirical study conducted in 11 Finnish high schools on students (n ¼ 335, aged 16) taking their first, mandatory, introductory physics course. The study design involved groups of students having heavy, light, or no use of IDs. The heavy and <b>light</b> <b>ID</b> groups answered eight pairs of ID and FBD questions in various physical contexts and the no ID group answered two of the eight FBD questions. The results indicate that the heavy ID group outperformed both the light and the no ID groups in identifying forces and constructing the correct FBDs. The analysis of these data indicates that the use of IDs is especially beneficial in identifying forces when constructing FBDs...|$|R
40|$|When {{considering}} global illumination, material editing is a non-linear {{task and}} even in scenes with moderate complexity, the global nature of material editing makes final prediction of appearance of other objects in the scene a difficult task. In this thesis, a novel interactive method is proposed for object appearance design. To achieve this, a randomized per-pixel parametrization of scene materials is defined. At rendering time, parametrized materials have different properties for every pixel. This way, encoding of multiple rendered results into one image is obtained. We call this collection of data a hyperimage. Material editing means projecting the hyperimage onto a given parameter vector, which is achieved using non-linear weighted regression. Pixel guides based on geometry (normals, depth and unique object <b>ID),</b> materials and <b>lighting</b> properties of the scene enter the regression problem as pixel weights. In {{order to ensure that}} only relevant features are considered, a rendering-based feature selection method is introduced, which uses a precomputed pixelfeature function, encoding per-pixel importance of each parametrized material. The method of hyperimages is independent of the underlying rendering algorithm, while supporting a full global illumination and surface interactions. Our method is not limited to parametrization of materials, and can be extended to other scene properties. As an example, we show parametrization of position of an area light source...|$|R
