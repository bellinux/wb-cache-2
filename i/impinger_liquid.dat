Sampler differences for viable collection {{were due to}} incomplete physical collection (slippage) and killing of phage by the samplers. Dynamic aerosols of a mass median diameter of 0. 2 μ were produced with a Dautrebande generator from concentrated aqueous purified phage suspensions containing extracellular soluble radioactive phosphate as a physical tracer.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Jet nubulisers and metered dose inhalers {{are widely}} used to deliver aerosolised drugs to the lungs of intubated {{patients}} in adult intensive care units. Drug delivery using these systems {{has been shown to}} be inefficient and both forms of delivery have the potential to induce paradoxical bronchoconstriction in patients with reactive airways disease. METHODS: Experiments were carried out to determine whether it was possible to deliver drug from a dry powder delivery system through an endotracheal tube. A 200 micrograms budesonide Turbohaler was enclosed in a chamber which allowed it to be inserted into a ventilator circuit. Experiments were performed with a multistage <b>liquid</b> <b>impinger</b> in which drug was drawn through the Turbohaler and endotracheal tube at 60 l/min providing an index of the maximum drug delivery achievable via this route. A second series of experiments was performed in which the Turbohaler was placed in a ventilator circuit using a Servo 900 C volume cycled ventilator. Drug delivered from the Turbohaler during the inspiratory phase was collected on a filter placed between the end of a 9 mm endotracheal tube and a model lung. A tidal volume of 500 ml and inspiratory time of 0. 5 seconds was used. Budesonide was assayed using an ultraviolet spectrophotometric assay. RESULTS: Thirty percent of the nominal dose passed through the endotracheal tube and was collected in the multistage <b>liquid</b> <b>impinger.</b> Mean drug delivery to the filter in the ventilator circuit was 20 %.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} several impactors for in vitro equivalence testing of salbutamol with respect to efficacy and to define in vitro equivalence limits validated with in vivo efficacy data. The four impactors described in Supplement 2000 of the European Pharmacopoeia were used: Glass Impinger (GI), Metal <b>Impinger</b> (MI), Multistage <b>Liquid</b> <b>Impinger</b> (MSLI) and Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI). Three salbutamol dry powder formulations with different fine particle doses (FPDs) were prepared and the aerodynamic particle size distribution was measured. For each impactor also the recovery was determined. The same three preparations were administered to 12 asthmatic patients in a randomized, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover study. Cumulative doses from 50 mug up to 400 jig were given. The FEV 1 was measured at baseline and 15 min after each dose. The in vitro results showed large differences between the FPDs of the three preparations with all impactors, whereas only small differences were observed between the four impactors. Since the recoveries of the MI and GI were low, in vitro equivalence testing should only be performed with the MSLI or ACI. The in vivo measurements did not show significant differences in efficacy between the three active preparations, even at the most discriminatory dose of 50 mug. It is concluded that in case there are no relevant differences between delivered dose, inhalation device and excipients, for salbutamol dry powder inhalers equivalence can be assumed when the 90 % confidence interval for the FPD ratio of the test product and reference product is within 0. 50 - 1. 20 and each of the two products has a FPD (particles < 6 mum) of at least 10 mug.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{output of}} the drug and the {{particle}} size produced by various nebulisers were assessed, and sensible nebulisation times for sodium cromoglycate calculated. Three of the four nebuliser systems tested produced over 80 % of total drug output within the first five minutes of nebulisation. We suggest that five minutes is an optimum nebulisation time for sodium cromoglycate using these nebuliser combinations. Nebulisation treatment can upset both child and parent, especially when it is prolonged. Parents frequently report spending up to 20 minutes nebulis-ing a 2 ml charge of sodium cromoglycate.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{mechanical}} impaction on the aerosolperformance of pharmaceutical powders comprising smooth and rough-surfaced spherical particles was investigated. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) {{was chosen as}} a model drug and powders prepared using spray drying. Surface roughness and adhesion force properties of BSA were measured by atomic force microscopy. The aerosolperformance of the powders was assessed by impaction using a customised throat model built with specific mitre joints (0, 15, 45 and 90 °), coupled with a <b>liquid</b> <b>impinger</b> through a laser diffractometer. Results showed enhanced aerosolperformance of BSA by mechanical impaction, with the effect increasing with the impaction angle and being more pronounced with corrugated BSA. This is attributed to the lower cohesion force between the corrugated particles, enabling them to de-agglomerate more readily on impaction. In conclusion, impaction causes significantly better deagglomeration in corrugated particles than smooth particles.

40|$|The extreme {{particle}} size range and enormous heterogeneity of airborne biological particles make sampling a significant challenge. Three major sampler types available include gravity devices, impactors and suction samplers.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study investigates (1) {{the effect}} ofmodifying {{the design of}} a dry powder inhaler on the device performance, and (2) which design {{features}} significantly contribute to overall inhaler performance. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to determine how the flowfield generated in anAerolizer 1 at 60 lmin 1 varied when the inhaler grid and mouthpiece were modified. The computational models were validated by Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). Dispersion performance of the modified inhalerswasmeasuredwith amannitol powder using amultistage <b>liquid</b> <b>impinger</b> at 60 l min 1. The inhaler grid was found to significantly affect the performance of the Aerolizer 1. As the grid voidage was increased, the amount of powder retained in the device doubled (due to increased tangential flow of particles in the inhaler mouthpiece) and the FPFLoaded was reduced from 57 to 44 % (due to increased mouthpiece retention). The length of the mouthpiece played a lesser role on the inhaler performance, having no significant effect on the flowfield generated in the devices. In summary, the performance of a dry powder inhaler can be affected by simple design changes. CFD, coupled with experimental results, provides a rational basis for understanding the performanc...|$|R

The powders were highly dispersible, with emitted doses in excess of 90 % of loaded powder aerosolised from a Spinhaler dry powder inhaler. The fine particle fraction (FPF) was observed to decrease, whereas the time for 100 % drug release increased, with increasing chitosan MW. For example, the low MW formulation exhibited an FPF of 64 % and a 100 % dissolution time of 2 h, whereas the high MW formulation demonstrated an FPF of 54 % and a dissolution time of 12 h. These powders would be anticipated to deposit predominately in the lower regions of the lung following inhalation, and then undergo delayed rather than instantaneous drug release, offering the potential to reduce dosing frequency and improve patient compliance.

In this study, we investigate the utility of leucine as a dry powder dispersibility enhancer when added prior to spray-drying a model non-viral gene therapy formulation (lipid:polycation:pDNA, LPD). Freeze-dried lactose-LPD, spray-dried lactose-LPD and spray-dried leucine-lactose-LPD powders were prepared.

40|$|AbstractIn vitro {{measurements}} of aerosol fine particle fraction (FPF) using particle-sizing apparatus (e. g. the twin <b>impinger,</b> multi-stage <b>liquid</b> <b>impingers,</b> cascade impactors) {{have a key}} {{role to play in}} the development of new pharmaceutical products and in quality control. However, use of in vitro methodology to attempt to predict lung deposition in vivo is of limited value due, in part, to the inability of current apparatus to mimic upper and lower airway anatomy satisfactorily. Estimates of FPF based on cut-off points ranging from 5 – 7 μm generally overestimate lung deposition as measured in vivo by gamma scintigraphy. We recommend that: 1. 1. multistage apparatus (minimum five stages) be used to characterize particle size distribution adequately, over the range 0 · 5 – 5 · 0 μm; 2. 2. where possible, measurements should be made at a range of rates and profiles of flow reflecting those likely to be generated using the inhalation device in clinical practice (including use by young and elderly patients with varying degrees of airflow obstruction); 3. 3. encouragement should be given to the further development, standardization, and validation of apparatus with a ‘throat’ which more closely resembles the human oropharynx and larynx. Pharmacokinetic methods can give a good estimate of total, but not regional, lung deposition, with drugs which are either not absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract, or whose absorption can be blocked by co-administration of charcoal, thus avoiding confounding by absorption of drug substance deposited in the oropharynx and subsequently swallowed. Techniques which rely on evaluation of a timed fractional output of drug substance in the urine are susceptible to the inherent variability of rate of absorption across the respiratory epithelium. We recommend that consideration should be given to the further refinement and validation of PK methods which would more clearly identify the fractional dose deposited in the lung. Lung-imaging methodology, e. g. gamma scintigraphy, employing formulations radiolabelled with gamma-rayemitting radionuclides such as 99 mTc, can measure total lung deposition and oropharyngeal deposition, provided that the radiolabelling process is appropriately validated and suitable corrections are made for attenuation of gamma rays by body tissues. An estimate of regional lung deposition can be made by drawing ‘regions of interest’ on the scintigraphic image; the precision of this measure is limited by the two-dimensional (2 -D) nature of most images which mean that there is an overlay of structures of interest (alveoli, small and large airways), which is most marked centrally. Three-dimensional (3 -D) imaging techniques (e. g. single photon emission computed tomography, SPECT, and positron emission tomography, PET) have the potential to give more detailed data on regional lung deposition, but are currently more expensive, employ higher radiation doses, and are less well validated than 2 -D (planar) imaging. We consider that, of the available imaging modalities, planar gamma scintigraphy represents current best practice for the assessment of lung deposition from inhaler devices where regional differences may be important. The methodology should be optimized by the adoption of generally accepted standards for radiolabelling, imaging, attenuation correction, and interpretation. It is important that deposition in all sites (device, oropharynx, lungs, stomach) should be quantified. Consideration should be given to refining the concept of regions of interest to coincide more closely with anatomical lung structures. Statistical methods to compare the size distributions of drug and radiolabel in validation experiments should be developed. In the longer term it is envisaged that three-dimensional imaging may play a more important part in evaluating lung deposition; an optimal three-dimensional anatomical model of lung zones of interest needs to be developed...|$|R

A 20 s delay between actuation and inhalation reduced the amount recovered to 10. 9 micrograms (3. 2), but no reduction was seen when using a low static spacer after the same delay. Multiple actuations into the spacer before sampling also reduced the recovery to 24. 8 micrograms (3. 4) after two actuations, and 13. 5 micrograms (7. 6) after five actuations. When using a Nebuhaler with budesonide metered dose inhalers, more respirable drug will be obtained if the aerosol is inhaled immediately after actuation, and multiple actuations into the spacer device are avoided.

40|$|PURPOSE: Temozolomide {{dry powder}} {{formulations}} for inhalation, performed with no excipient {{or with a}} lipid or lactose coating, have been evaluated. METHODS: The particle size of raw temozolomide in suspension was reduced by a high-pressure homogenizing technique, and the solvent was evaporated by spray-drying to obtain a dry powder. The physicochemical properties of this powder were evaluated and included its crystalline state, thermal properties, morphology, particle size and moisture and drug content, and these properties were determined by X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, laser light scattering, thermogravimetric analysis and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The aerodynamic properties and release profiles were also evaluated using a multistage <b>liquid</b> <b>impinger</b> and a modified USP type 2 dissolution apparatus adapted for inhaler products, respectively. RESULTS: The dry powder inhalation formulations had a high temozolomide content that ranged from 70 % to 100 % in the crystalline state and low moisture content. Aerodynamic evaluations showed high fine-particle fractions of up to 51 % related to the metered dose. The dissolution profile revealed a similarly fast temozolomide release from the formulations.

The powders were prepared by spray-drying using PTH, sugars, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, and/or albumin. They presented an average primary particle diameter of 4. 5 mm and tap density of 0. 06 g/cm 3, a mass median aerodynamic diameter between 3. 9 and 5. 9 mm, and reached up to 98 % emitted dose and up to 61 %fine particle fraction in themulti-stage <b>liquid</b> <b>impinger</b> using a Spinhaler inhaler device. Varying the airflow rate from 30 to 100 L/min had limited influence on the aerodynamic behavior of the aerosols. The absolute PTH bioavailability was 21 % after intratracheal administration of the powder formed of PTH/albumin/ lactose/dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and 18 % after subcutaneous injection in rats. Equilibrium dialysis revealed a 78 % binding of PTH to albumin and the withdrawal of albumin from the powder increased absolute bioavailability after inhalation from 21 to 34 %. No acute inflammation appeared in the lung up to 48 h after a single inhalation. The increased bioavailability of the optimized powder aerosol of PTH makes it a promising alternative to subcutaneous injection. 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the America...|$|R
40|$|Dry powder inhaler (DPI) {{formulations}} usually contain micronized drug {{particles and}} lactose as a carrier. Fine lactose {{could be used}} as a ternary component to improve drug delivery from DPIs. The aim of this study was to investigate the deposition profile of a model drug, cefotaxime sodium (CS), using coarse and fine carriers after aerosolization at 60 l/min via a spinhaler® into a twin stage <b>liquid</b> <b>impinger</b> (TSI). Two micronization methods. jet milling and spray drying were used to micronize the active drug and carrier. The particle size of CS and lactose were characterized by laser diffraction, and the morphology of formulations was examined by scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction of jet milled lactose showed crystalline nature, but spray dried lactose exhibited an amorphous state. The results showed the existence of fine lactose in formulations significantly (p 0. 05) difference was observed between the effect of jet milled and spray dried lactose. On the other hand selection of micronization technique to reduce particle size of CS, was very effective on deposition profile. The highest influence of fine lactose was obtained by formulation containing jet milled CS in ratio of drug/carrier 1 / 1 and 10 % of fine lactose as third component...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{describe}} the preparation of highly dispersible dry powders for pulmonary drug delivery that display sustained drug release characteristics. Powders were prepared by spray-drying 30 % v/v aqueous ethanol formulations containing terbutaline sulfate as a model drug, chitosan as a drug release modifier and leucine as an aerosolisation enhancer. The influence of chitosan molecular weight on the drug release profile was investigated by using low, medium and high molecular weight chitosan or combinations thereof. Following spray-drying, resultant powders were characterised using scanning electron microscopy, laser diffraction, tapped density analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravitational analysis. The in vitro aerosolisation performance and drug release profile were investigated using Multi-Stage <b>Liquid</b> <b>Impinger</b> analysis and modified USP II dissolution apparatus, respectively. The powders generated were of a suitable aerodynamic size for inhalation, had low moisture content and were amorphous in nature. The powders were highly dispersible, with emitted doses of over 90 % and fine particle fractions of up to 82 % of the total loaded dose, and mass median aerodynamic diameters of less than 2. 5 microm. A sustained drug release profile was observed during dissolution testing; increasing the molecular weight of the chitosan in the formulation increased the duration of drug release.

40|$|This study investigates (1) {{the effect}} of modifying {{the design of a}} dry powder inhaler on the device performance, and (2) which design {{features}} significantly contribute to overall inhaler performance. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to determine how the flowfield generated in an Aerolizer® at 60 l min− 1 varied when the inhaler grid and mouthpiece were modified. The computational models were validated by Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). Dispersion performance of the modified inhalers was measured with a mannitol powder using a multistage <b>liquid</b> <b>impinger</b> at 60 l min− 1. The inhaler grid was found to significantly affect the performance of the Aerolizer®. As the grid voidage was increased, the amount of powder retained in the device doubled (due to increased tangential flow of particles in the inhaler mouthpiece) and the FPFLoaded was reduced from 57 to 44 % (due to increased mouthpiece retention). The length of the mouthpiece played a lesser role on the inhaler performance, having no significant effect on the flowfield generated in the devices. In summary, the performance of a dry powder inhaler can be affected by simple design changes. CFD, coupled with experimental results, provides a rational basis for understanding the performance difference...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of sodium}} {{carboxymethylcellulose}} (NaCMC) as a spray-drying excipient {{in the preparation}} of inhalable formulations of proteins was investigated, using alkaline phosphatase as a model functional protein. Two spray-dried powders were investigated: a control powder comprising 100 % (w/w) alkaline phosphatase and a test powder comprising 67 % (w/w) NaCMC and 33 % (w/w) alkaline phosphatase. Following physicochemical characterisation, the powders were prepared as both dry powder inhaler (DPI) and pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) formulations. The aerosolisation performance of the formulations was assessed using a Multi-Stage <b>Liquid</b> <b>Impinger,</b> both immediately after preparation and over a 16 -week storage period. Formulating the control powder as a DPI resulted in a poor fine particle fraction (FPF: 10 %), whereas the FPF of the NaCMC-modified DPI formulation was significantly greater (47 %). When the powders were formulated as pMDI systems, the control and NaCMC-modified powders demonstrated FPFs of 52 % and 55 %, respectively. Following storage, reduced FPF was observed for all formulations except the NaCMC-modified pMDI system; the performance of this formulation following storage was statistically equivalent to that immediately following preparation. Co-spray-drying proteins and peptides with NaCMC may therefore offer an alternative method for the preparation of stable and respirable pMDI formulations for pulmonary delivery...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{feasibility}} of using two types of carbomer (971 and 974) to prepare inhalable dry powders that exhibit modified drug release properties. Powders were prepared by spray-drying formulations containing salbutamol sulphate, 20 - 50 % w/w carbomer as a drug release modifier and leucine as an aerosolization enhancer. Following physical characterization of the powders, the aerosolization and dissolution properties of the powders were investigated using a Multi-Stage <b>Liquid</b> <b>Impinger</b> and a modified USP II dissolution apparatus, respectively. All carbomer 974 -modified powders and the 20 % carbomer 971 powder demonstrated high dispersibility, with emitted doses of at least 80 % and fine particle fractions of approximately 40 %. The release data indicated that all carbomer-modified powders displayed a sustained release profile, with carbomer 971 -modified powders obeying first order kinetics, whereas carbomer 974 -modified powders obeyed the Higuchi root time kinetic model; {{increasing the amount of}} carbomer 971 in the formulation did not extend the duration of drug release, whereas this was observed for the carbomer 974 -modified powders. These powders would be anticipated to deposit predominately in the lower regions of the lung following inhalation and then undergo delayed rather than instantaneous drug release, offering the potential to reduce dosing frequency and improve patient compliance...|$|R
40|$|The {{controlled}} co-delivery {{of multiple}} agents to the lung offers potential benefits to patients. This {{study investigated the}} preparation and characterisation of highly respirable spray-dried powders displaying the sustained release of two chemically distinct therapeutic agents. Spray-dried powders were produced from 30 % (v/v) aqueous ethanol formulations that contained hydrophilic (terbutaline sulphate) and hydrophobic (beclometasone dipropionate) model drugs, chitosan (as a drug release modifier) and leucine (aerosolisation enhancer). The influence of chitosan molecular weight on spray-drying thermal efficiency, aerosol performance and drug release profile was investigated. Resultant powders were physically characterised: with in vitro aerosolisation performance and drug release profile investigated by the Multi-Stage <b>Liquid</b> <b>Impinger</b> and modified USP II dissolution apparatus, respectively. It was found that increased chitosan molecular weight gave increased spray-drying thermal efficiency. The powders generated were of a suitable size for inhalation—with emitted doses over 90 % and fine particle fractions up to 72 % of the loaded dose. Sustained drug release profiles were observed in dissolution tests for both agents: increased chitosan molecular weight associated with increased duration of drug release. The controlled co-delivery of hydrophilic and hydrophobic entities underlines the capability of spray drying to produce respirable particles with sustained release for delivery to the lung.

40|$|Summary: To better {{understand}} the underlying mechanisms of aerovirology, accurate sampling of airborne viruses is fundamental. The sampling instruments commonly used in aerobiology have also been used to recover viruses suspended in the air. We reviewed over 100 papers to evaluate the methods currently used for viral aerosol sampling. Differentiating infections caused by direct contact from those caused by airborne dissemination {{can be a very}} demanding task given the wide variety of sources of viral aerosols. While epidemiological data can help to determine the source of the contamination, direct data obtained from air samples can provide very useful information for risk assessment purposes. Many types of samplers have been used over the years, including <b>liquid</b> <b>impingers,</b> solid impactors, filters, electrostatic precipitators, and many others. The efficiencies of these samplers depend on a variety of environmental and methodological factors that can affect the integrity of the virus structure. The aerodynamic size distribution of the aerosol also has a direct effect on sampler efficiency. Viral aerosols can be studied under controlled laboratory conditions, using biological or nonbiological tracers and surrogate viruses, which are also discussed in this review. Lastly, general recommendations are made regarding future studies on the sampling of airborne viruses...|$|R
