5|$|In 2007, Easton Mayor Phil Mitman {{dedicated}} that year's lighting to {{the troops}} fighting in Iraq and all of America's veterans. At about 7 p.m., the mayor <b>introduced</b> <b>U.S.</b> Navy veteran Kyle Stocker, whose son 4½-year-old Kayden hit the switch {{to turn on the}} spotlights illuminating the candle.|$|E
25|$|Barrett {{taught to}} us, the Paraguayan writers, to write. He <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> in the grazing light {{and in the}} almost phantasmagoric nebulous of the reality that is delirious of its historical, social and {{cultural}} myths and counter-myths.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, AAA {{promoted}} the When Worlds Collide pay-per-view {{in conjunction with}} the U.S. promotion company World Championship Wrestling (WCW). When Worlds Collide <b>introduced</b> <b>U.S.</b> audiences to many of the top luchadores in Mexico at the time.|$|E

25|$|Late in 1940, {{as part of}} the Tizard Mission, Taffy Bowen had <b>introduced</b> <b>US</b> {{scientists}} to the British work on microwave radar using the cavity magnetron. After returning to the UK, Bowen's earlier observation about differences in ground returns noticed in early experiments led Philip Dee to develop a prototype ground mapping system in March of 1941, a development that would evolve into the H2S radar.|$|E
2500|$|The 2-minute {{radio show}} even had parodies of the Daleks (the Drecks and their creator Lavdros) {{as well as}} the Master (Doctor Wee, an [...] "Asian stereotype"). The show also <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> to Doctor Poo's wife, Constance.|$|E
2500|$|Most cite Sadi Carnot's 1824 book Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire as the {{starting}} point for thermodynamics as a modern science. [...] Carnot defined [...] "motive power" [...] to be the expression of the useful effect that a motor is capable of producing. [...] Herein, Carnot <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> to the first modern day definition of [...] "work": weight lifted through a height. [...] The desire to understand, via formulation, this useful effect in relation to [...] "work" [...] {{is at the core of}} all modern day thermodynamics.|$|E

2500|$|Thanks {{to their}} Split Enz connection, {{the newly formed}} Crowded House had an {{established}} Australasian fanbase. They began by playing at festivals in Australia and New Zealand and released their debut album, Crowded House, in June 1986. Capitol Records initially failed to see the band's potential and gave them only low-key promotion, forcing the band to play at small venues to try and gain attention. The album's first single, [...] "Mean to Me", reached the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart top 30 in June. It failed to chart in the US, but moderate American airplay <b>introduced</b> <b>US</b> listeners to the group.|$|E
2500|$|Samuel Reid, a {{volunteer}} from Louisiana, described McCulloch and his ranger company as [...] "men in groups with long beards and mustaches, dressed in every variety of garment, with one exception, the slouched hat, the unmistakable uniform of a Texas ranger, and a brace of pistols around their waists, [...] were occupied drying their blankets, cleaning and fixing their guns, and some employed cooking at different fires, {{while others were}} grooming their horses. A rougher-looking set we never saw. They were without tents, and a miserable shed afforded them the only shelter. Captain McCulloch <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> to his officers {{and many of his}} men, who appeared orderly and well-mannered people. But from their rough exterior, {{it was hard to tell}} who or what they were. Notwithstanding their ferocious and outlaw look, there were among them doctors and lawyers and many a college graduate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although his professorial duties were {{demanding}} of his time, {{he kept a}} keen eye on leaving his research legacy. He was simultaneously {{working on a new}} book that expounded on his extensive experience as a researcher at Bell Labs, which he published in 1971 under the title Synergy: Technical Integration and Technological Innovation in the Bell System. Using terms easily accessible even to laymen, he analyzed and expanded on technical and [...] philosophical aspects of systems engineering as practised at Bell Labs. He explained how seemingly different fields of Engineering were merging, guided by the necessity of the flow of information between system components that transcended previously well defined boundaries and thus he <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> to a technological paradigm shift. As {{it is clear from the}} title of the book as well as its contents, he became one of the early exponents of technological convergence, infometrics and information processing before the terms even existed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first section}} <b>introduces</b> <b>us</b> to the {{characters}} as children {{living on a}} farm in the Karoo, and reveals their innermost thoughts and feelings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{introduction}} to {{his radio show}} was usually [...] "Al Read: <b>introducing</b> <b>us</b> to ourselves"; and he himself described his work as [...] "pictures of life".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Doc Pipt, do {{you mean}} to <b>introduce</b> <b>us,</b> or not?" [...] demanded the cat, in a tone of annoyance. [...] "Seems to me you are forgetting your manners." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Let me shed a bit {{of light}} on things here. Martin and Frazer had this band called Hydra back in 84/85. The most {{impressive}} thing about the band {{was the fact that}} Frazer had already printed some 2 colour t shirts and he had a car! I met Frazer at a local Hell gig in Long Eaton and it turned out they were thinking of getting a second guitarist. I heard a tape (which I still have, it's priceless) of a show they did in a pub in Nottingham and decided to have a jam as I was wanting to get some experience playing, after all I was the ripe old age of 15. Hell, two weeks after I joined, the original guitarist quit (i think this was on the cards) and the drummer left (thankfully) after we did our first demo a couple of months later, I think due to me having a go about his girlfriend being in the studio (you see, good work ethic back then!). It was Tim Bowler (the drummer from Hell) who <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> to Simon Negus. The name Sabbat came from a book on witchcraft, but I actually found some old school books of mine with ideas doodled on them so I'm sure I had some doing in suggesting it, but I do remember we liked the way the word looked in the scrawly type of writing so we went with it. Yeah the flexi disc for white dwarf was an odd one, John Blanche, the art editor painted our first cover so it all came about quite easy, it does sound shockingly bad though." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> to Mr. Waterlow and he <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> to--to his friends," [...] she explained, colouring, {{as if it}} were a {{fault for}} the inexactness caused by her magnanimity. [...] "That's why I thought I ought to tell you what you'd like." ...|$|E
60|$|CAESAR. You {{have been}} growing up since the Sphinx <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> the other night; {{and you think you}} know more than I do already.|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. We have met, dear. Don't <b>introduce</b> <b>us</b> any more. [He {{moves away}} to the big chair, and adds] Won't you sit down, Lady Utterword? [She does so very graciously].|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would have}} been ridiculous," [...] Godfrey said. [...] "If we were to blame our friends for the faults of persons to whom they <b>introduce</b> <b>us,</b> {{there would be an}} end to introductions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I think I {{shall have}} to admit you to the Blue Bowl League, Mr. Ericson. Speaking of which----Tell me, who did <b>introduce</b> <b>us,</b> you and me? I feel so apologetic for not remembering." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{closed the}} window, and <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> through it in dumb show; but he {{contrived}} {{to give the}} impression that I was the specimen under glass.|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Kidd, Mr. Woodley." [...] He <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> {{as seriously}} as if the cat had been a human being. Neither Captain Kidd nor I responded very enthusiastically.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wells was a {{pleasant}} man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the typical lawyer's mouth. John <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> both, and explained the reason of our presence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Nash has {{rendered}} us {{the great}} service of <b>introducing</b> <b>us</b> to Madame Carré, and I'm sure we're immensely indebted to him," [...] Mrs. Rooth {{said to her}} daughter with an air affectionately corrective.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1930s, Hepburn home-schooled her two younger daughters, Marion and Margaret. Marion {{considered}} her mother “a natural-born teacher” who was “never happier than when <b>introducing</b> <b>us</b> children to some new book or idea.” ...|$|R
50|$|The Chase is {{a detective}} novel by author Clive Cussler written in November 2007. It <b>introduces</b> <b>us</b> {{to the main}} character, Isaac Bell. Bell is a tall, lean detective {{who works for the}} Van Dorn Detective Agency.|$|R
60|$|As these {{friendly}} reminiscences {{were being}} indulged in, I drew nearer, and {{was introduced to}} Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn, <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye.|$|E
6000|$|The directeur is courteous and sympathetic. He has <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> to the cat, and my 'eart 'as {{turned to}} water, {{for it is}} Alexander. Why has he not been destroyed? ...|$|E
60|$|In {{her deep}} brown eyes there lurked pleased surprise, {{struggling}} with wonder. She looked from {{myself to the}} friend who <b>introduced</b> <b>us</b> with a bewitching smile of incredulity, tempered by hope.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Basil South, M.D.' said Philippa, <b>introducing</b> <b>us.</b> 'Mr. Baby Farmer' (obviously a name of endearment), {{and again}} a rosy blush crept round her neck {{in the usual}} partial manner, which made {{one of her most}} {{peculiar}} charms.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wind {{and weather}} permitting," [...] said Macnab, with his wonted irreverence. [...] "Now, Maxby, my boy, take {{us into the}} house, and <b>introduce</b> <b>us</b> to old Mrs Liston. But what splendid {{creature}} is this coming towards us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're to meet J. P. Morgan this afternoon," [...] says he. [...] "A man I know in {{the hotel}} wants to <b>introduce</b> <b>us.</b> He's a friend of his. He says he likes to meet people from the West." ...|$|R
