40|$|Manufacturing {{industries}} {{strive to}} produce improved component accuracy while not reducing machine tool availability or production throughput. The accuracy of CNC production machines {{is one of}} the critical factors in determining the quality of these components. Maintaining the capability of the machine to produce in-tolerance parts can be approached in one of two ways: run to failure or periodic calibration and monitoring. The problem is analogous to <b>general</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> maintenance, but with the clear distinction that the failure mode of <b>general</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> components results in a loss of production, whereas that of accuracy allows parts to be produced, which are only later detected as non-conforming as part of the quality control processes. This distinction creates problems of cost-justification, since {{at this point in the}} manufacturing chain, any responsibility of the machine is not directly evident. Studies in the field of maintenance have resulted in cost calculations for the downtime associated with machine failure. This paper addresses the analogous, unanswered problem of maintaining the accuracy of CNC machine tools. A mathematical cost function is derived that can form the basis of a strategy for either running until non-conforming parts are detected or scheduling predictive CNC machine tool calibrations. This is sufficiently generic that it can consider that this decision will be based upon different scales of production, different values of components etc. Therefore, the model is broken down to a level where these variables for the different inputs can be tailored to the individual manufacturer...|$|E
40|$|In <b>general,</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> {{structures}} like lathe, milling, broaching, {{and grinding}} machines, etc. {{are subjected to}} regular unwanted vibrations. These machine tool vibrations or chatter are deleterious to machining operations. It results in degraded quality on the machined parts, shorter tool life, and unpleasant noise, hence are to be necessarily damped out. The important characteristics of the machine tool structures for metal cutting are high damping and static stiffness which ensure manufacture of work pieces of the required geometries with acceptable surface finish at the required rate of production in the most economical way. The unwanted vibrations must be arrested in ordet to ensure higher accuracy along with productivity. In the present work, the chatter vibrations on a slotted table Horizontal Milling Machine have been damped out using composite structure {{as a substitute for}} the base of the work piece. Glass Fiber Polyester and Glass Fiber Epoxy plates are fixed on to the slotted table as a secondary bed material and the workpiece is mounted on this bed for feeding to the rotating milling cutter. Initially four holes are drilled on each plate of the composite and a set of five plates of each type of composite are mounted for conducting the experiments. A mild steel specimen of similar dimension of the composite plate is placed on the pile of the composites and the setup is fixed to the slotted table using bolts and nuts. An up milling operation is carried out and the vibration signal is recorded on the screen of the digital phosphorus storage oscilloscope. The signal and RMS amplitude, frequency and time period of vibrations are recorded. The experiment is repeated for different sets of composite plates by decreasing the number and the corresponding readings are recorded and tabulated. Moreover, experiments are also conducted without any composite material below the mild steel specimen. It is observed that the vibration amplitude decreases with increase in number of layers of sheets of composites and then increases with increase in number of plates. Moreover, the optimum number of composites are also experimentally determined. The design of the experimental setup has been modeled using CatiaV 5 R 15. Apart from total damping of the system, emphasis has also been focused to find out the material damping of the composite materials so as to select the same for effective damping of the structures. An energy balance approach has been used for calculating the material damping of the fiber reinforced composites used in the experiment. ...|$|E
40|$|FEM-analysis of {{dynamics}} in the bearing system of a heavy-duty machine tool {{has been carried}} out in the paper. This is a prospective variant for a large-size multi-purpose machine tool with a horizontal sliding ram. A saddle and a ram are moving vertically along a subtle mono-column. A rigid double-column is used in the existing analog machine tool. A static, modal and harmonic analysis of the bearing system with the mono-column has been made in the paper. It has been done with the help of FEM-simulation prior to fabrication of a prototype sample. Previously conducted calculations for the analog machine tool have shown good compatibility of FEM-calculation with experiments. Six common machine tool resonances have been revealed for the bearing system. Their oscillating cutting forces are actively exciting three-four resonance modes. Ranges of a flexure-torsion resonance (20 – 40 Hz) and nose-diving resonances (70 – 90 Hz) have been determined in the paper. The paper shows that the range of multi-wave resonances starts significantly higher from 140 Hz. These resonances are interconnected with bending oscillations of the ram and bucklings of the column walls which are matched with the oscillations. The paper demonstrates stability in resonance pattern. The torsional resonance of the column on the frequency of nearly 40 Hz is considered as the more dangerous one. Spindle rigidity goes down up to 3. 8 Н/μm. It is possible to observe self-stabilization of the torsional resonance. Frequency of the torsional oscillations is practically unchangeable when there is a lifting or lowering down of the saddle and the ram. It is related to the migration of dynamical axis of torsion. Frequency-response characteristics of the bearing system have been constructed for various saddle positions on the column. Three frequency intervals that make it possible to carry out machining operation have been determined in the paper. The first interval is a static one. The machine tool with a mono-column comes short of the analog machine tool in this interval. The main reason of it is low static rigidity of the subtle column. The second interval is narrow and it is located between flexure-torsion and nose-diving resonances. The third interval is considered as the most efficient one. The interval contains a section of inter-range pause between <b>general</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> and multi-wave resonances. In this case it is possible to observe a significant increase of the dynamic rigidity on the spindle that compensates the column subtility. High potential of the dynamic rigidity has been revealed {{in the direction of the}} ram axis (> 2000 Н/μm). The paper shows liability of the machine tool to displacement crossings during oscillations. Peculiar features of this effect have been discussed in the paper. The diagram with a mono-column is recommended for practical application. The main condition is a transition to high-speed drive within the framework of concept on high-speed machining. It is necessary to ensure rigidity of the axial feed drive system. </p...|$|E

40|$|The <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> {{industry}} is tiny but crucial: it supplies the machines to cut, form, and shape metals upon which {{about half of}} the manufacturing industries are dependent. The state of the art of the <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> themselves, their control systems and the organization surrounding them largely determine the productivity and competitiveness of engineering industries in <b>general.</b> The <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> industry faces two major challenges today. One is that technological change in <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> has changed character in recent years. After more than a century of evolutionary progress, mainly involving mechanization and improved control of mass production, the main progress in <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> {{in the last two decades}} has involved automation and mechanization of small and medium scale production, largely in connection with the introduction of numerical control and also other aspects of the microelectronic revolution. This change in the character and direction of technological change is forcing profound changes both within the industry and in its relationship with users. The other problem is that the competitive situation in the world market is changing rapidly, causing severe adjustment problems for most producers. Even though this is an industry in which foreign trade has always been significant, the emergence of new competitors (particularly Japan in numerically controlled <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> and newly industrialized countries in conventional <b>machine</b> <b>tools)</b> with new strategies and new kinds of specialization has made for radical changes in the competitive situation for most <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> firms.

Over the years <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> for manufacturing have developed into two classes. One is the <b>general</b> purpose <b>machine</b> <b>tools,</b> and the other is designed for machining large quantities of a specific part or process. These specialized <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> are very effective, however they have disadvantages. One is that if the product design is changed, the <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> may have to be redesigned and rebuilt. Another problem is the custom built machines usually have long lead-times for their design and build. A solution is to produce a reconfigurable or modular <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> (MMT). Then custom <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> could be designed and built quickly from a library of modular components. Using a library of standard steel components leads to a very interesting discrete structural optimization (DSO) problem. A branch and bound discrete topology and sizing optimization method was applied to this problem. A hybrid approach of first using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) method and then switching to a fast gradient based method proved effective. A neural network (NN) based FEA approximation was developed to evaluate the constraints to the optimization. The results were compared to a more conventional material density topology optimization method. The method was successfully tested on a large scale 3 D MMT component...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{appearance}} of the Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm, extensive theoretical and application studies on it have been conducted. Nowadays, the GP algorithm {{is considered one of}} the most important tools in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Nevertheless, several questions have been raised about the complexity of the GP algorithm and the disruption effect of the crossover and mutation operators. In this paper, the Tabu Programming (TP) algorithm is proposed to employ the search strategy of the classical Tabu Search algorithm with the tree data structure. Moreover, the TP algorithm exploits a set of local search procedures over a tree space in order to mitigate the drawbacks of the crossover and mutation operators. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to study the performance of the proposed algorithm for a set of benchmark problems. The results of those experiments show that the TP algorithm compares favorably to recent versions of the GP algorithm in terms of computational efforts and the rate of success.
