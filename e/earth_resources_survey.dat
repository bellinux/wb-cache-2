40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA problem of routing <b>earth</b> <b>resource</b> <b>survey</b> aircraft, proposed by NASA, is formulated as a traveling salesman problem, {{in which the}} salesman (aircraft) has a range constraint. A heuristic algorithm is presented, which seeks a minimal length set of subtours through n cities. The aircraft begins a subtour at the base location, visits {{a subset of the}} n cities and returns when the range constraint prevents a visit to another city. Additional subtours are created until all cities are visited. The algorithm is programmed in FORTBAN for use on digital computers. The IBM 360 / 67 computer at the Naval Postgraduate School was used to find solutions to three operational problems of size seven, eighteen and twenty-five cities. Computation times for each problem was under 20 seconds and the solutions were significantly better than feasible solutions calculated without the use of the algorithm.
