40|$|When {{using the}} {{conventional}} two-coil inductive link for the simultaneous wireless power and data transmissions in implantable biomedical sensor devices, the strong power carrier could overwhelm the uplink data signal and even saturate the external uplink receiver. To address this problem, we propose a new magnetic-balanced inductive link for our implantable glaucoma treatment device. In this inductive link, an extra coil is specially added for the uplink receiving. The strong power carrier interference is minimized to approach zero by balanced canceling {{of the magnetic}} field of the <b>external</b> <b>power</b> <b>coil.</b> The implant coil is shared by the wireless power harvesting and the uplink data transmitting. Two carriers (i. e., 2 -MHz power carrier and 500 -kHz uplink carrier) are used for the wireless power transmission and the uplink data transmission separately. In the experiments, the prototype of this link achieves as high as 65. 72 dB improvement of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) compared with the conventional two-coil inductive link. Benefiting from the significant improvement of SIR, the implant transmitter costs only 0. 2 mW of power carrying 50 kbps of binary phase shift keying data and gets a bit error rate of 1 × 10 − 7, even though the coupling coefficient is as low as 0. 005. At the same time, 5 mW is delivered to the load with maximum power transfer efficiency of 58. 8 %. This magnetic-balanced inductive link is useful for small-sized biomedical sensor devices, which require transmitting data and power simultaneously under ultra-weak coupling...|$|E

The authors focus on state-of-the-art technology to provide patients and elders with quality care. Besides discussion on design considerations like energy efficiency, scalability, unobtrusiveness, and security, the authors also discuss benefits and drawbacks of the wearable and implantable WBASN systems. In [15], a generalized voltage-driven model of an inductive link for medical implants is presented. In addition, different parameters are analyzed with respect to resonating impedances. The series resonating impedances improve in voltage gain, while not causing the link efficiency to alter. In [16], an inductive power system is presented which combines power transfer with data transmission for implantable microdevices. The implanted devices receive <b>power</b> from an <b>external</b> transmitter through an inductive link between an <b>external</b> <b>power</b> transmission <b>coil</b> and the implanted receiving coil. The authors in [17] design a transcutaneous link for medical implants by using inductively coupled coils. They also describe the design of an indigenously developed transcutaneous link from commercial off-the-shelf components to demonstrate the design process. Moreover, their work provides an outline for inductive coils and optimized parameters of class E amplifiers. Their experimental results show approximately 40 % link efficiency at 2.5 -MHz operating frequency and an output power of 100 mW. In [23], a medical relevance of the monitoring of deformation of implants is presented. It is a powerful tool to evaluate nursing and rehabilitation exercises for tracing dangerous overloads while anticipating implant failure and observing the healing process. The authors also present two implantable wireless designs which are charged via magnetic induction.|$|R
40|$|A small, hermetic, wirelessly-controlled retinal {{prosthesis}} {{has been}} developed for pre-clinical studies in Yucatan minipigs. The device was attached conformally {{to the outside of}} the eye in the socket and received both power and data wirelessly from external sources. Based on the received image data, the prosthesis drove a subretinal thin-film polyimide array of sputtered iridium oxide stimulating electrodes. The implanted device included a hermetic titanium case containing a 15 -channel stimulator and receiver chip and discrete circuit components. Feedthroughs in the hermetic case connected the chip to secondary power- and data-receiving coils, which coupled to corresponding <b>external</b> <b>power</b> and data <b>coils</b> driven by <b>power</b> amplifiers. Power was delivered by a 125 kHz carrier, and data were delivered by amplitude shift keying of a 15. 5 MHz carrier at 100 kbps. Stimulation pulse strength, duration and frequency were programmed wirelessly from an external computer system. The final assembly was tested in vitro in physiological saline and in vivo in two minipigs for up to five and a half months by measuring stimulus artifacts generated by the implant's current drivers.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel inductive link for wireless transmission {{of power and}} data to biomedical implantable micro-electronic devices using multiple carrier signals. Achieving higher data bandwidth without compromising the power efficiency {{is the driving force}} behind using multiple separate carriers. Two sepa-rate pairs of coils have been utilized for inductive power and for-ward data transmission, plus a pair of miniature antennas for back telemetry. One major challenge, however, is to minimize the inter-ference among these carriers especially on the implantable side, where size and power are highly limited. Planar <b>power</b> <b>coils</b> with spiral shape are optimized in geometry to provide maximum cou-pling coefficient. The data coils are designed rectangular in shape and wound across the <b>power</b> <b>coils</b> diameter to be oriented per-pendicular to the <b>power</b> <b>coil</b> planes. The goal is to maximize data coils direct coupling, while minimize their cross-coupling with the <b>power</b> <b>coils.</b> The effects of coils geometry, orientation, relative dis-tance, and misalignments on the coupling coefficients have been modeled and experimentally evaluated.
