40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is the visual damage caused by {{commercial}} signs in <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> <b>centres,</b> and its effects on user perception and evaluation of these places. The research problem concerns the lack of a general approach to guide and control commercial signs in <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> <b>centres,</b> based on the perception and evaluation of users from different urban contexts. The aim {{of this study is}} to identify those aspects related to the operation of commercial signage controls and physical characteristics of commercial signs and buildings that should be taken into account in the development of a general commercial signage approach. This general approach can help national, regional, and local authorities of different urban contexts design and implement commercial signage controls. This research begins with the development of a theoretical and conceptual framework by analysing concepts related to (i) visual quality and user perception and evaluation of the built environment, (ii) formal and symbolic factors linked to the streetscape that influence aesthetic judgments, and (iii) non-physical variables related to the operation of commercial signage controls, such as consumer culture, <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> management, marketing the city and urban tourism, and by reviewing current commercial signage approaches adopted in different urban contexts. The empirical investigation explores user perception and evaluation of commercial signage controls in three different <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> <b>centres.</b> The Environment Behavioural research field, a multiple method survey design, and a multiple case study approach are adopted. The combination of documentation review and archival records, systematic observations of physical characteristics of commercial streets, questionnaires, interviews, and focus group proved to be efficient to answer the research questions and achieve the research aim. The city of Oxford in England, and the cities of Gramado and Pelotas in Brazil were selected as case studies. One of the main conclusions of this research is the definition of a series of aspects related to the operation of commercial signage controls and the physical characteristics of commercial signs and buildings that need to be taken into account in the development of a general commercial signage approach. This study also identifies common patterns of perception and evaluation among individuals from different urban contexts and user groups (lay people and professionals). A possible future stage of research in this topic can be the application of the same methodology in other case studies to verify whether the same universal views found here will be verified. If the findings of this Ph. D. research can be found consistently between users from other urban contexts, then urban design principles that incorporate user perception and evaluation of commercial signage controls and <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> can be addressed as theoretical concepts to combat visual pollution in <b>historic</b> <b>cities</b> across the world. ...|$|R

25|$|Until {{the early}} years of the 20th century, the city was largely limited to the {{neighbourhood}} now known as the <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> (see below), on the mouth of Guanabara Bay. The city's centre of gravity began to shift south and west to the so-called Zona Sul (South Zone) in the early part of the 20th century, when the first tunnel was built under the mountains between Botafogo and the neighbourhood that is now known as Copacabana. Expansion of the city to the north and south was facilitated by the consolidation and electrification of Rio's streetcar transit system after 1905. Botafogo's natural beauty, combined with the fame of the Copacabana Palace Hotel, the luxury hotel of the Americas in the 1930s, helped Rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town (although this reputation has been somewhat tarnished in recent years by favela violence resulting from the narcotics trade).|$|E

40|$|The multi-disciplinary study {{tries to}} {{establish}} interrelations between online mobile technology used for heritage interpretation and visitor mobility behaviour, exploring the implications that the changed behaviour patterns have for applied visitor management in UNESCO World Heritage listed <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> <b>centres.</b> Ubiquitous online mobile technology disperses delimitations between activities, {{time and space}} which affects and fundamentally changes everyday life including touristic utilized spaces and activities. In this ‘liquid modernity’, tourism is perceived as an essential form of mobility, increasingly changing {{under the influence of}} online mobile technologies. With this changing landscape of both, tourism and online mobile technology, interpretation of space, communication of information and the ensuing movement within a destination have to be amended accordingly. Tourism is often considered {{as one of the few}} options for economic vitality in <b>historic</b> <b>cities.</b> However, there is a fine line between tourism being an added value and support to conservation, and tourism becoming the reason for conservation. This study scrutinizes prevailing visitor mobility management strategies in <b>historic</b> <b>cities</b> in the context of changing visitor movement triggered by the increasing influence of online mobile media. For this purpose the technology awareness and acceptance of destination management organisations and the utilization of interpretive online mobile media is explored by conducting an online survey in 127 UNESCO World Heritage <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> <b>centres,</b> followed by an in-depth analysis in selected study areas of the compatibility of currently applied visitor mobility management strategies with prevailing behaviour of ‘connected’ visitors using sentiment analysis on data generated from social media mining...|$|R

40|$|The {{countries}} of the southern Mediterranean enjoy a rich and diverse cultural heritage. At {{the heart of this}} heritage lie the medinas – the <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> <b>centres,</b> often dating back to medieval times. A source of pride and collective belonging, they have nevertheless been subject to neglect and decay under the combined pressures of demographic growth, urbanization and modernization. At present, the <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> are in danger of being irreversibly marginalized. Even though the cultural heritage value of these <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> is now widely recognized, no coherent restoration policy is being implemented – only a number of historic monuments and prestigious buildings are being restored or converted into expensive hotels and restaurants. The dilemma between preserving the physical fabric of the medinas and protecting the social context remains unresolved. The Medina brings together a team of experienced professionals, including urban planners, architects, economists, sociologists, financial experts and representatives from international organizations and Mediterranean governments, to address the pressing problem of how to revitalize and restore the medinas in a sustainable way. Arguing for a comprehensive and integrated approach, the authors set out different scenarios for the development of these historic urban centres and strategies for their restoration. The first part of the book provides an introduction to the problems and issues involved in restoration. Importantly, it does so against a backdrop of the economic, social and urban development that the countries are predicted to undergo. The second part provides examples of different medinas – including Damascus, Cairo, Meknes, Azemmour – and presents important material on the financing of such initiatives. It is expected that by 2030 nearly 80 per cent of the inhabitants of the Mediterranean countries will live in towns. This represents an enormous challenge and suggests that the region’s social and economic future will largely depend on management of the urban reality. Controlling the development of the heart of the towns and cities, and in particular the medinas, will {{play a vital role in}} preserving the cultural and social capital of the Mediterranean countries whilst retaining their considerable potential as attractions. This important and timely book presents a unique and pioneering contribution to realizing that aim...|$|R

The accretion of {{several layers of}} history tends to reveal {{a great deal about}} the city's past, present and even future. <b>Historic</b> <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> are usually endowed with a multitude of historic buildings, heritage sites and the like. However, it is also these historical centres that are most prone to the undesirable and consequential effects of growth and rapid technological advancement, where a range of environmental and developmental challenges find their crude expression. The rehabilitation and conservation of <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> serves as a fundamental catalyst for change. Furthermore, urban regeneration of historical <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> also promotes social interaction between inhabitants of the city, and the adoption of its urban spaces encourages public activity. This paper scrutinizes the <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> of two historical cities which are Barcelona, Spain and Istanbul, Turkey. Successful aspects of their ecological performance are highlighted. The two downtown areas discussed in this paper represent the downtown of two Mediterranean cities, and both are distinguished historical cities who have contextual similarities. The historical <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> of these Mediterranean cities have undergone variety of projects and strategic plans for urban regeneration, development and beautification. Moreover, various attempts have been made for the improvement of their environmental quality and ecological performance. This is through increases in urban green spaces and public parks, increased dependence on renewable energy technologies (RETs) and adopting sustainable transportation modes as opposed to undesirable and harmful vehicular transport. In essence, many urban regeneration plans have been aimed at conserving and preserving buildings and sites that are considered symbolic of the two cities heritage and legacy.
