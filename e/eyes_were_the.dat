500|$|In his memoirs, Ernst {{said he had}} {{difficulty}} persuading Elisabeth to visit her mother. Before one visit, he found the child [...] "whimpering under a sofa, full of despair." [...] He assured Elisabeth that her mother loved her too. [...] "Mama says she loves me, but you do love me," [...] Elisabeth replied. Margaret Eagar thought the child's <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> saddest she had ever seen. [...] "Looking at her I used to wonder what those wide grey-blue eyes saw, to bring such a look of sadness to the childish face," [...] she wrote. Eagar wondered if Elisabeth had a premonition of her own death because she often told her cousin Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia that [...] "I shall never see this again." [...] However, despite Elisabeth's sad eyes, she was generally a sweet, happy child who was a peacemaker when her cousins had a dispute.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced {{in chapter}} fourteen, {{she is a}} {{beautiful}} vampire-like faerie who loves men and gives them talent {{at the cost of}} dying young. She had strong feelings for an old man named Joel Garland, but denied that they were in love as love would meant his inevitable death. Unfortunately, her presence was already killing him unintentionally at a slow rate. After learning this, Chise created a remedy that allowed them to see each other one last time (chapter twenty two). After Joel's passing, she tells Chise she will be living in Joel’s garden and will not look for more lovers anymore. She later received the name, Redcurrant, as Joel and Chise noted her <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> same color as the flower in Joel's Garden ...|$|E
2500|$|In 889, Yasovarman {{ascended to}} the throne. A great king and an {{accomplished}} builder, he was celebrated by one inscription as [...] "a lion-man; he tore the enemy with the claws of his grandeur; {{his teeth were}} his policies; his <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Veda." [...] Near the old capital of Hariharalaya, Yasovarman constructed a new city, called Yaśodharapura. In the tradition of his predecessors, he also constructed a massive reservoir called baray. The significance of such reservoirs has been debated by modern scholars, {{some of whom have}} seen in them a means of irrigating rice fields, and others of whom have regarded them as religiously charged symbols of the great mythological oceans surrounding Mount Meru, the abode of the gods. The mountain, in turn, was represented by an elevated temple, in which the [...] "god-king" [...] was represented by a lingam. In accordance with this cosmic symbolism, Yasovarman built his central temple on a low hill known as Phnom Bakheng, surrounding it with a moat fed from the baray. He also built numerous other Hindu temples and ashrams, or retreats for ascetics.|$|E

2500|$|During her {{reign as}} Miss America Williams was criticized in some venues for winning. She later stated that [...] "there {{were a lot}} of people that did not want me to be {{representative}} of the United States and Miss America. And not just white people alone. There {{were a lot of}} people who had issues [...] I was too light. My <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> wrong color. My hair wasn't the right texture and getting criticism for being who I was." [...] She was also the target of persistent racist hate mail and death threats (which she documented in her memoir, You Have No Idea). Thirty years later, when Miss America 2014 Nina Davuluri (who was also a former Miss New York and Miss Syracuse) became the target of a racist social media backlash, Williams recounted the similarities with her own experiences, stating that she [...] "wrote a book about everything that I went through, and I spent a lot of time talking about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago—the change that was happening and the uproar because of the color of my skin." ...|$|E
