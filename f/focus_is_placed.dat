2500|$|The {{posterior}} dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} creates the appropriate rules for the brain to accomplish the current goal. [...] For the Stroop effect, this involves activating {{the areas of the}} brain involved in color perception, but not those involved in word encoding. [...] It counteracts biases and irrelevant information, for instance, [...] the fact that the semantic perception of the word is more striking than the color in which it is printed. [...] Next, the mid-{{dorsolateral prefrontal cortex}} selects the representation that will fulfil the goal. The relevant information must be separated from irrelevant information in the task; thus, the <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> on the ink color and not the word.|$|E
2500|$|Although letter {{grades are}} given to students, grades are de-emphasized at Reed and <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> on a {{narrative}} evaluation. According to the school, [...] "A conventional letter grade for each course is recorded for every student, but the registrar's office does not distribute grades to students, provided that work continues at satisfactory (C or higher) levels. Unsatisfactory grades are reported directly to the student and the student's adviser. Papers and exams are generally returned to students with lengthy comments but without grades affixed." [...] There is no dean's list or honor roll per se, but students who maintain a GPA of 3.5 or above for an academic year receive academic commendations {{at the end of}} the spring semester which are noted on their transcripts. Many Reed students graduate without knowing their cumulative GPA or their grades in individual classes. Reed also claims to have experienced very little grade inflation over the years, noting, for example, that only ten students graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA in the period from 1983 to 2012. (Transcripts are accompanied by a card explaining Reed's relatively tough grading system so as not to penalize students applying to graduate schools.) Although Reed does not award Latin honors to graduates, it confers several awards for academic achievement at commencement, including naming students to Phi Beta Kappa.|$|E
