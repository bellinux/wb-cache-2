40|$|Kitahara and Mizuno (2010) get two upper bounds for {{the number}} of {{different}} basic feasible solutions generated by <b>Dantzig’s</b> simplex method. The size of the bounds highly depends on the ratio between the maximum and minimum values of all the positive elements of basic feasible solutions. In this paper, we show some relations between the ratio and the number of iterations by using an example of LP, which is a simple variant of Klee-Minty’s LP. We see that the ratio for the variant is equal to the number of iterations by <b>Dantzig’s</b> simplex method for solving it. This implies {{that it is impossible to}} get a better upper bound than the ratio. We also give improved results of the upper bounds...|$|R

25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{the problem}} became {{increasingly}} popular in scientific circles in Europe and the USA after the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica offered prizes for steps {{in solving the}} problem. Notable contributions were made by George <b>Dantzig,</b> Delbert Ray Fulkerson and Selmer M. Johnson from the RAND Corporation, who expressed the problem as an integer linear program and developed the cutting plane method for its solution. They wrote what is considered the seminal paper on the subject in which with these new methods they solved an instance with 49 cities to optimality by constructing a tour and proving that no other tour could be shorter. <b>Dantzig,</b> Fulkerson and Johnson, however, speculated that given a near optimal solution {{we may be able}} to find optimality or prove optimality by adding a small amount of extra inequalities (cuts). They used this idea to solve their initial 49 city problem using a string model. They found they only needed 26 cuts to come to a solution for their 49 city problem. While this paper did not give an algorithmic approach to TSP problems, the ideas that lay within it were indispensable to later creating exact solution methods for the TSP, though it would take 15 years to find an algorithmic approach in creating these cuts. As well as cutting plane methods, <b>Dantzig,</b> Fulkerson and Johnson used branch and bound algorithms perhaps for the first time.|$|E

25|$|Tom Petersson and Jol <b>Dantzig</b> of Hamer Guitars {{created the}} idea for a twelve-string bass. Tom Petersson {{previously}} had used an Alembic and Hagstrom 8-string basses, and asked <b>Dantzig</b> to make a 12-string bass. The company initially made him a 10-string bass. Following the successful trial use of that bass, the prototype 12-string bass, The Hamer 'Quad', was produced. Petersson later used 12-string basses made by Kids (a Japanese guitar maker), Chandler, and signature models from Waterstone and from The Electrical Guitar Company. During 2015 and 2016, his primary 12-string bass was one of a pair of prototype Gretsch White Falcon basses in all white and also cream / green finishes. They have been said to be envisaged as a future 'signature' production model. His primary choice of 4-string bass is a Gibson Thunderbird, though he also owns a very impressive array of 4, 5 and 8 stringed basses from other guitar makers. He is also an endorser of Hofner basses.|$|E
25|$|Like the simplex {{algorithm}} of <b>Dantzig,</b> the criss-cross {{algorithm is}} a basis-exchange algorithm that pivots between bases. However, the criss-cross algorithm need not maintain feasibility, but can pivot rather from a feasible basis to an infeasible basis. The criss-cross algorithm {{does not have}} polynomial time-complexity for linear programming. Both algorithms visit all2Dcorners of a (perturbed) cube in dimensionD, the Klee–Minty cube, in the worst case.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II, <b>Dantzig</b> took {{a leave of absence}} from the doctoral program at Berkeley to join the U.S. Air Force Office of Statistical Control. In 1946, he returned to Berkeley to complete the requirements of his program and received his Ph.D. that year. Although he had a faculty offer from Berkeley, he returned to the Air Force as mathematical advisor to the comptroller.|$|E
50|$|In {{mathematical}} optimization, the Klee-Minty cube is {{an example}} that shows the worst-case computational complexity of many algorithms of linear optimization. It is a deformed cube with exactly 2D corners in dimension D. Klee and Minty showed that <b>Dantzig's</b> simplex algorithm visits all corners of a (perturbed) cube in dimension D in the worst case.|$|R
50|$|In particular, many {{optimization}} algorithms for linear optimization exhibit {{poor performance}} {{when applied to}} the Klee-Minty cube. In 1973 Klee and Minty showed that <b>Dantzig's</b> simplex algorithm was not a polynomial-time algorithm when applied to their cube. Later, modifications of the Klee-Minty cube have shown poor behavior both for other basis-exchange pivoting algorithms and also for interior-point algorithms.|$|R
