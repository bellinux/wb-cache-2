5000|$|Batticaloa Tamil dialect (மட்டக்களப்புப் பேச்சுத் தமிழ்) {{is one of}} the Sri Lankan Tamil dialects, {{which uses}} in Eastern provinces Batti - Ampara districts of Sri Lanka. Batticaloa Tamil dialect {{slightly}} differs from other Sri Lankan Tamil dialects such as Jaffna Tamil dialect, Negombo Tamil dialect, <b>Estate</b> <b>Tamil</b> dialects, Colombo, Trincomalee & Vanni Tamil dialects.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} of D.S. Senanayake passed legislation stripping the <b>estate</b> <b>Tamils</b> of their citizenship in 1949, leaving them stateless.|$|R
50|$|Both the United National Party and the SLFP {{campaigned on}} a {{strongly}} anti-Tamil line, promising to repatriate the <b>estate</b> <b>Tamils</b> to India, and implement the Sinhala Only Act.|$|R
50|$|Not {{content with}} {{stripping}} their citizenship, successive governments tried {{to remove the}} <b>estate</b> <b>Tamils</b> from the country entirely. In 1964, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike {{signed an agreement with}} Indian Prime Minister L.B. Shastri. A second agreement was signed three years later with Indira Gandhi. These provided that 600,000 of the <b>estate</b> <b>Tamils</b> would be expelled and sent to India over a 15-year period, and 375,000 would be restored their Sri Lankan citizenship. Not all of the former group actually returned to India, and remained in Sri Lanka without the ability to vote, travel abroad, or participate fully in Sri Lankan life. It was not until 2003 that full citizenship rights were restored to the remaining Tamils in the hill country.|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>estate</b> <b>Tamils</b> {{had been}} {{stripped}} of their citizenship by the Senanayake government, the Ceylon Indian Congress, which {{most of them had}} supported, was eliminated from Parliament and the Lanka Sama Samaja Party lost seats. The UNP won a majority, mainly at the cost of the CIC and the LSSP.|$|R
50|$|The Sri Lanka Freedom Party, {{which had}} been in disarray since the murder of its leader S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike the {{previous}} year, settled on his widow, Sirimavo, as its new leader. She pledged to continue her husband's policies, notably the Sinhala Only Act, and to proceed with repatriation of the <b>estate</b> <b>Tamils</b> to India.|$|R
50|$|Sri Lanka's {{judiciary}} {{consists of}} a Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Court, {{and a number of}} subordinate courts. Sri Lanka's legal system reflects diverse cultural influences. Criminal law is fundamentally British. Basic civil law is Roman-Dutch, but laws pertaining to marriage, divorce, and inheritance are communal, known as respectively as Kandyan,Thesavalamai (Jaffna Tamil) and Muslim (Roman-Dutch law applies to Low-country Sinhalese, <b>Estate</b> <b>Tamils</b> and others).|$|R
50|$|There is {{a sizable}} {{population}} of Tamils in the Central Province, plantation laborers brought down from India by the British colonial {{authorities in the}} 19th and 20th centuries. These Indian <b>Tamils</b> (or <b>Estate</b> <b>Tamils),</b> as they are called, still work mainly in Sri Lanka’s tea plantations. They have been locked in poverty for generations and continue to experience poor living conditions. Although they speak dialects of the same language, they are usually considered a separate community from the Sri Lankan Tamils of the North and East.|$|R
50|$|After that, Wickremasinghe's {{only real}} hope of victory {{was through the}} support of the island's ethnic minorities, given his {{generally}} more conciliatory stance on the ethnic issue. He secured the endorsement of the main Muslim party, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, and the Ceylon Workers' Congress representing the <b>estate</b> <b>Tamils.</b> He could not, however, obtain the backing of the main Sri Lankan Tamil party, the Tamil National Alliance. Wickremasinghe's hopes for victory were effectively dashed when the LTTE ordered Tamil voters, most of whom would likely have voted for him, to boycott the polls.|$|R
50|$|During {{this time}} Sirimavo was brought forward as {{legitimate}} successor to her husband's party leadership and she entered politics. In 1960 M. P. de Zoysa Jnr {{stepped down from}} his seat in the Senate (appointed upper house of Parliament) {{paving the way for}} Sirimavo to be appointed {{as a member of the}} Senate from the SLFP. She led her party to win the July 1960 elections on the pledge to continue her husband's policies, notably the Sinhala Only Act, and to proceed with repatriation of the <b>estate</b> <b>Tamils</b> to India. On 21 July 1960, as a Senator she became prime minister, thus becoming the first female prime minister in the world.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect was}} to tilt the island's {{political}} balance {{away from the}} Tamils. In 1948, at independence, the Tamils had 33% of the voting power in Parliament.. Upon the disenfranchisement of the <b>estate</b> <b>Tamils,</b> however, this proportion dropped to 20%. The Sinhalese could and did obtain more than a 2/3 majority in Parliament, {{making it impossible for}} Tamils to exercise an effective opposition to Sinhalese policies affecting them. The main reason for the imbalance was that several multi-member constituencies elected a Tamil member of Parliament in a majority Sinhala electorate. The idea in having multi-member constituencies was to prevent domination of minorities by a future nationalist government.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{examines}} the basic aspects of {{standard of living}} of the Indian origin <b>estate</b> sector <b>Tamil</b> society, {{which is a very}} unique social group living in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. The Indian origin <b>estate</b> sector <b>Tamils</b> are the people, who were brought by the colonial British from South India with the purpose of satisfying the increasing labour needs in the nineteenth century Sri Lankan plantations. Even after spending nearly two centuries in the island, this group of people still lives in a poor condition with many unchanged socio-economic structures of life. Trying to understand the living condition of this distinct social group, this work has been done by referring to their all socio-economic performances through an in depth analysis...|$|R

5000|$|Even {{though the}} Donoughmore Constitution had granted {{universal}} franchise to Ceylonese, {{this was not}} applied to the Indian <b>Estate</b> <b>Tamils,</b> due to opposition from caste-conscious Colombo Tamils, vote conscious Kandyan Sinhalese, as well as due to the general opposition to any form of universal franchise. The latter was named [...] "mob rule" [...] by Arunachalam Ponnambalam. Thus, even by 1939, {{only a fraction of}} the Hill-country Tamils had been granted the franchise. The fear of Marxist control of the estates, as well as the pressure of Kandyan politicians, led to attempts to not to extend citizenship to the Indian Tamils of the newly independent nation, except under very stringent conditions. In effect, the Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948 and the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act No.3 of 1949 were passed by the Sri Lankan Parliament and simply reinforced the status quo of the harsher pre-Donoughmore era prior to Universal Franchise (see Sri Lanka Tamils (Indian origin) for more details of dis-enfranchisement).|$|R

50|$|However, the dispossessed {{peasantry}} {{were not}} employed on the plantations: The Kandyan villagers refused {{to abandon their}} traditional subsistence holdings and become wage-workers in the harsh conditions that prevailed on these new estates, despite all the pressure exerted by the colonial state. The British therefore had to draw on its reserve army of labour in India, to man its lucrative new outpost to the south. An infamous system of contract labour was established, which transported {{hundreds of thousands of}} Tamil 'coolies' from southern India into Sri Lanka for the coffee <b>estates.</b> These <b>Tamil</b> labourers died in tens of thousands on the journey {{as well as on the}} plantations.|$|R
25|$|At the 1952 general election, {{there was}} a setback for the party. The country was {{relatively}} prosperous due {{to the price of}} natural rubber being driven up by the Korean War. Also, the disenfranchisement the Indian <b>Tamil</b> <b>estate</b> workers by the UNP government deprived the LSSP of one of its main bases. Moreover, it damaged the electoral fortunes of its ally, the CIC, which went unrepresented.|$|R

40|$|The {{mountains}} {{interior of}} Sri Lanka {{is one of}} the world's great tea-producing areas. The labour force on the tea estates consists of a population which has migrated from Tamil Nadu, in southern India, over the last one hundred years. This migrant population is known as 'Indian Tamils' and is largely drawn from the two largest Harijan castes of agricultural labourers in Tamil Nadu. On the now government owned estates, they have formed a kind of industrial proletariat, living in long estate line housing where each family has one or two rooms. The women, who are the tea pickers, work longer hours than do the men. The Indian Tamils have been characterized by markedly higher mortality than the indigenous population (Sinhalese, Sri Lankan Tamils and Moors). This paper reports a research program which was carried out in 1987 and which employed both anthropological and demographic survey techniques in an attempt to explain these higher mortality levels. The research identified the origins of higher mortality, both in limited access to health provision and in the social characteristics and economic circumstances of the community.
