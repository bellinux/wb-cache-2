60|$|Two <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly,</b> {{the boys}} and girls {{spending}} their time in getting settled and renewing old acquaintances. The girls went shopping with their mothers, while the lads visited the offices of The Rover Company in Wall Street to see with their own eyes how matters were going.|$|E
60|$|After that Geoffrey {{recovered}} vigor rapidly, and the <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly</b> for Helen as {{she watched}} over him in the dilapidated frame house {{to which he had}} been removed after the accident. No word of love passed between them, nor was any word necessary. The man, still weak and languid, appeared blissfully contented to enjoy the present, and Helen, who was glad to see him do so, abided her time.|$|E
60|$|The two <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly.</b> The boy hunters saw {{and heard}} {{nothing of the}} Spink crowd and almost forgot about them. They went out for game, and managed to bring down some rabbits, {{squirrels}} and some fine quail, and also a pinemarten. They took over a dozen pictures {{of the game and}} also of the scenery, and Shep managed to get a fine photograph of an old owl as he sat on a tree limb. The boys made no effort to shoot the owl, for he really seemed friendly and did not offer to fly away.|$|E

60|$|The <b>day</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly.</b> Mr Waller, in the {{intervals}} of work, talked a good deal, mostly of Edward, his doings, his sayings, and his prospects. The {{only thing that}} seemed to worry Mr Waller was {{the problem of how}} to employ his son's almost superhuman talents to the best advantage. Most of the goals towards which the average man strives struck him as too unambitious for the prodigy.|$|R
60|$|He assumed command {{as nearly}} {{in the manner}} of the old-time {{teachers}} as he could recall, and the work of his teaching was begun. The <b>day</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly,</b> and as he walked homeward again there stood that rotting church, and in his mind there rose a surging emotion larger than he could himself comprehend--a desire to rebuild it by uniting the warring factions, of whose lack of Christianity it was fatal witness.|$|R
6000|$|And {{then the}} hands {{appeared}} carrying torches, and conducted the Prince and the White Cat {{to a long}} gallery which overlooked the river, from the windows of which they saw a magnificent display of fireworks of all sorts; after which they had supper, which the Prince liked even better than the fireworks, for it was very late, and he was hungry after his long ride. And so the <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly</b> as before; {{it was impossible to}} feel dull with the White Cat, and she had quite a talent for inventing new amusements--indeed, she was cleverer than a cat has any right to be. But when the Prince asked her how it was that she was so wise, she only said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gloriani 's an ass!" [...] said Roderick, almost fiercely. He hired a {{horse and}} began to ride with Rowland on the Campagna. This delicious {{amusement}} restored him in a measure to cheerfulness, but seemed to Rowland on the whole not to stimulate his industry. Their rides were always very long, and Roderick insisted on making them longer by dismounting in picturesque spots and stretching himself in the sun among a heap of overtangled stones. He let the scorching Roman luminary beat down upon him with an equanimity which Rowland {{found it hard to}} emulate. But in this situation Roderick talked so much amusing nonsense that, {{for the sake of his}} company, Rowland consented to be uncomfortable, and often forgot that, though in these diversions the <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly,</b> they brought forth neither high art nor low. And yet it was perhaps by their help, after all, that Roderick secured several mornings of ardent work on his new figure, and brought it to rapid completion. One afternoon, when it was finished, Rowland went to look at it, and Roderick asked him for his opinion.|$|E
60|$|To Meriem, {{in her new}} home, the <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly.</b> At {{first she}} was all anxiety to be off into the jungle searching for her Korak. Bwana, as she insisted upon calling her benefactor, dissuaded her from making the attempt at once by {{dispatching}} a head man with a party of blacks to Kovudoo's village with instructions {{to learn from the}} old savage how he came into possession of the white girl and as much of her antecedents as might be culled from the black chieftain. Bwana particularly charged his head man with the duty of questioning Kovudoo relative to the strange character whom the girl called Korak, and of searching for the ape-man if he found the slightest evidence upon which to ground a belief in the existence of such an individual. Bwana was more than fully convinced that Korak was a creature of the girl's disordered imagination. He believed that the terrors and hardships she had undergone during captivity among the blacks and her frightful experience with the two Swedes had unbalanced her mind but as the days passed and he became better acquainted with her and able to observe her under the ordinary conditions of the quiet of his African home he was forced to admit that her strange tale puzzled him not a little, for there was no other evidence whatever that Meriem was not in full possession of her normal faculties.|$|E
5000|$|Banerjee has {{summed up}} her {{philosophy}} in the words, “Do the job you like, enjoy your life but {{never give up}} your work. If work is fun, if your <b>days</b> are <b>passing</b> <b>quickly,</b> you must be happy, right?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{picked it}} up myself, sir," [...] Harry replied, [...] "from a book father bought me. You see I {{have plenty of time}} on my hands; I don't get out much, except just along the street, for I can't very well get across {{crossings}} by myself. The wheels go well enough on a level, but I cannot push them up a curb-stone. But what with reading and fiddling the <b>days</b> <b>pass</b> <b>quickly</b> enough, especially when mother is at home; she is out two or three days a week, and then the time seems rather long." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was a hard}} day, {{that day}} of being among them, with the first {{reservation}} of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious. But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him resolute not {{to tell her what}} impended (he had been half moved to do it, so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and the <b>day</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly.</b> Early in the evening he embraced her, and her scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets, with a heavier heart.|$|R
6000|$|A saunter {{into other}} meadows, and through {{part of the}} village, with {{a visit to the}} stables to examine some improvements, and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about, brought them to four o'clock, when Catherine {{scarcely}} thought it could be three. At four they were to dine, and at six to set off on their return. Never had any <b>day</b> <b>passed</b> so <b>quickly!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|The <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> very <b>quickly</b> now, for {{everyone}} seemed anxious {{to have the}} parting over and preparations went on rapidly. The big house was made ready to shut up for a year at least, comforts for the long voyage laid in, and farewell visits paid. The general activity and excitement rendered it impossible for Charlie to lead {{the life of an}} artistic hermit any longer and he fell into a restless condition which caused Rose to long for the departure of the Rajah when she felt that he would be safe, for these farewell festivities were dangerous to one who was just learning to say [...] "no." ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> very <b>quickly</b> at Croker's Hall, but not {{so quickly}} but that Mary knew well {{what was going on}} in Mr Whittlestaff's mind. How is it that a girl understands to a {{certainty}} the state of a man's heart in regard to her,--or rather, not his heart, but his purpose? A girl may believe that a man loves her, and may be deceived; but she will not be deceived as to whether he wishes to marry her. Gradually came the conviction on Miss Lawrie's mind of Mr Whittlestaff's purpose. And, as it did so, came the conviction also that she could not do it. Of this he saw nothing; but he was instigated by it to be more eager,--and was at the same time additionally abashed by something in her manner which made him feel that the task before him was not an easy one.|$|R
60|$|Next morning {{my friend}} Kua-ko, taking his zabatana, {{invited me to}} go out with him, and I consented with some misgivings, {{thinking}} he had overcome his superstitious fears and, inflamed by my account of the abundance of game in the forest, intended going there with me. The previous day's experience had made me {{think that it would be}} better in the future to go there alone. But I was giving the poor youth more credit than he deserved: it was far from his intention to face the terrible unknown again. We went in a different direction, and tramped for hours through woods where birds were scarce and only of the smaller kinds. Then my guide surprised me a second time by offering to teach me to use the zabatana. This, then, was to be my reward for giving him the box! I readily consented, and with the long weapon, awkward to carry, in my hand, and imitating the noiseless movements and cautious, watchful manner of my companion, I tried to imagine myself a simple Guayana savage, with no knowledge of that artificial social state to which I had been born, dependent on my skill and little roll of poison-darts for a livelihood. By an effort of the will I emptied myself of my life experience and knowledge--or as much of it as possible--and thought only of the generations of my dead imaginary progenitors, who had ranged these woods back to the dim forgotten years before Columbus; and if the pleasure I had in the fancy was childish, it made the <b>day</b> <b>pass</b> <b>quickly</b> enough. Kua-ko was constantly at my elbow to assist and give advice; and many an arrow I blew from the long tube, and hit no bird. Heaven knows what I hit, for the arrows flew away on their wide and wild career to be seen no more, except a few which my keen-eyed comrade marked to their destination and managed to recover. The result of our day's hunting was a couple of birds, which Kua-ko, not I, shot, and a small opossum his sharp eyes detected high up a tree lying coiled up on an old nest, over the side of which the animal had incautiously allowed his snaky tail to dangle. The number of darts I wasted must have been a rather serious loss to him, but he did not seem troubled at it, and made no remark.|$|R
6000|$|Five more <b>days</b> <b>passed,</b> all too <b>quickly,</b> {{and once}} more Monday came round. It was the 22nd of October, and the Michaelmas Sittings began on the 24th. On the morrow, Tuesday, Geoffrey was to return to London, there to meet Lady Honoria {{and get to work}} at Chambers. That very morning, indeed, a brief, the biggest he had yet received--it was marked thirty guineas--had been {{forwarded}} to him from his chambers, with a note from his clerk to the effect that the case was expected to be in the special jury list {{on the first day of}} the sittings, and that the clerk had made an appointment for him with the solicitors for 5.15 on the Tuesday. The brief was sent to him by his uncle's firm, and marked, [...] "With you the Attorney-General, and Mr. Candleton, Q.C.," [...] the well-known leader of the Probate and Divorce Court Bar. Never before had Geoffrey found himself in such honourable company, that is on the back of a brief, and not a little was he elated thereby.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, {{the cost}} of an adult <b>day</b> <b>pass</b> at Disneyland was $34.00, and a Disneyland Annual Pass was $99.00. There was only one type of annual pass--as opposed to the current tiered system--and most Southern California locals had <b>passes.</b> Tomorrowland <b>quickly</b> became a local hang out for many local junior high and high school {{teenagers}} residing in Southern California. Teenagers congregated near the Tomorrowland Terrace, which featured a live band every night.|$|R

6000|$|Near by, Miss Allan {{was reading}} her letters too. They were not {{altogether}} pleasant, {{as could be}} seen from the slight rigidity which came over her large fine face as she finished reading them and replaced them neatly in their envelopes. The lines of care and responsibility on her face made her resemble an elderly man rather than a woman. The letters brought her news of the failure of last year's fruit crop in New Zealand, which was a serious matter, for Hubert, her only brother, made his living on a fruit farm, and if it failed again, of course, he would throw up his place, come back to England, and what were they to do with him this time? The journey out here, which meant the loss of a term's work, became an extravagance and not the just and wonderful holiday due to her after fifteen years of punctual lecturing and correcting essays upon English literature. Emily, her sister, who was a teacher also, wrote: [...] "We ought to be prepared, though I have no doubt Hubert will be more reasonable this time." [...] And then went on in her sensible way to say that she was enjoying a very jolly time in the Lakes. [...] "They are looking exceedingly pretty just now. I have seldom seen the trees so forward at this time of year. We have taken our lunch out several days. Old Alice is as young as ever, and asks after every one affectionately. The <b>days</b> <b>pass</b> very <b>quickly,</b> and term will soon be here. Political prospects not good, I think privately, but do not like to damp Ellen's enthusiasm. Lloyd George has taken the Bill up, but so have many before now, and we are where we are; but trust to find myself mistaken. Anyhow, we have our work cut out for us. [...] . Surely Meredith lacks the human note one likes in W. W.?" [...] she concluded, and went on to discuss some questions of English literature which Miss Allan had raised in her last letter.|$|R
