Some 40,000 malgré-nous ("against our will", citizens of the re-annexed Alsace-Lorraine province drafted into the Wehrmacht) became casualties. Civilian casualties amounted to around 150,000 (60,000 by aerial bombing, 60,000 in the resistance and 30,000 murdered by German occupation forces). Prisoners of war and <b>deportee</b> totals were around 1,900,000. Of these, around 240,000 died in captivity.

This caused much confusion during the operation. Local MGB offices would prepare summary certificates for each family and send them for approval to the republican MGB office. For example, by 14 March, Estonian MGB approved summary certificates for 9,407 families (3,824 kulaks and 5,583 nationalists and bandits) which created a reserve of 1,907 families above the quota. Overall, {{due to the lack}} of time, the files on deportees were often incomplete or incorrect. Therefore, from April to June, retrospective corrections were made – new files were added for people deported but not on <b>deportee</b> lists and files of those who escaped deportations were removed.|$|E
25|$|Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Netherlands on 10 May 1940 and {{took control of}} the country. Some Amsterdam {{citizens}} sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to a high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. More than 100,000 Dutch Jews were deported to Nazi concentration camps, of whom some 60,000 lived in Amsterdam. In response, the Dutch Communist Party organised the February strike attended by 300,000 people to protest against the raids. Perhaps the most famous <b>deportee</b> was the young Jewish girl Anne Frank, who died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. At the end of the Second World War, communication {{with the rest of the}} country broke down, and food and fuel became scarce. Many citizens travelled to the countryside to forage. Dogs, cats, raw sugar beets, and Tulip bulbs—cooked to a pulp—were consumed to stay alive. Most of the trees in Amsterdam were cut down for fuel, and all the wood was taken from the apartments of deported Jews.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} {{is shaped}} like a ship's prow; the crypt is accessible by two staircases and a lowered square protected by a metal portcullis. The crypt leads to a hexagonal rotunda that includes two chapels containing earth and bones from concentration camps. The walls display literary excerpts. Pingusson intended that its long and narrow subterranean space convey a feeling of claustrophobia. The memorial's entrance is narrow, marked by two concrete blocks. Inside is the tomb of an unknown <b>deportee</b> who was killed at the camp in Neustadt. Along both walls of the narrow, dimly lit chamber are 200,000 glass crystals with light shining through, meant to symbolize each of the deportees {{who died in the}} concentration camps; {{at the end of the}} tunnel is a single bright light. Ashes from the camps, contained within urns, are positioned at both lateral ends. Both ends of the chamber have small rooms that seem to depict prison cells.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the way the}} integration of former political <b>deportees</b> into the Republic of Lithuania is being handled. The author seeks to throw light on {{the workings of the}} state‘s system of social services and other measures and of the institutions administering them; to identify problematic aspects; and to evaluate the implementation of policies. The main fo¬cus is on a 16 -year-old program involving the return of political deportees: this program not only encourages political <b>deportees</b> and their families to return to Lithuania but also helps them to integrate into Lithuanian society after their return. An analysis of the way the integration of political <b>deportees</b> is carried out reveals that Lithuania‘s integration policy can be evaluated as a series of efforts by institutions admin¬istering an active policy to empower political <b>deportees.</b> Nevertheless, the goal of having as many political <b>deportees</b> as possible return to Lithuania is determined not only by the effectiveness of implementing an integration policy but also by political decisions having especially to do with the issue of granting citizenship to political <b>deportees</b> and with inter¬national political and economic changes...|$|R
