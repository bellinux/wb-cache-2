Cultivars with higher N use efficiency (NUE) might be characterized (i) by higher leaf expansion and N uptake efficiency until flowering and/or (ii) by longer duration of leaf area (LAI) and photosynthetic activity, and/or (iii) by more efficient remobilisation of N reserves from source leaves to sink organs during reproductive growth phase.

40|$|Objetive. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to review the evidence, and determine the effectiviness of the nurse’s role on education and maintenance of Kangaroo Mother Care on neonatal infants. Background. KMC was developed in Bogota, Colombia in 1978 by Dr. Edgar Rey to help increase the survival rate among both preterm and low body weight infants. The purpose of KMC is to involve mothers in being “natural incubators” to provide warmth to their infants by skin-to-skin contact. The problem we are facing today is once these infants are born, they are sent immediately to the NICU where they spend long periods of time. The long term care of infants in the NICU is costly whereas with KMC it is less cost effective and they will be discharged earlier. Methods. For this study systematic reviews were used. Results. Sufficient evidence exists to support the capacity of the KMC method for enhancing bonding and attachment between a parent and infant. KMC has many benefits such as reducing maternal post-partum depression and reducing infant pain. In addition, KMC has been associated with <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> extended <b>duration</b> of breastfeeding, resulting in a positive effect on infant developmental and parental bonding. KMC has been shown to fulfill the emotional needs of both the infant and the mother. ” Conclusion. Healthcare providers play a pivotal role in supporting and educating parents about the benefits of KMC. Grants. This study was not funded by a grant...|$|R

40|$|Background It is {{now well}} {{established}} that persistent nonsynaptic neuronal plasticity occurs after learning and, like synaptic plasticity, {{it can be}} the substrate for long-term memory. What still remains unclear, though, is how nonsynaptic plasticity contributes to the altered neural network properties on which memory depends. Understanding how nonsynaptic plasticity is translated into modified network and behavioral output therefore represents an important objective of current learning and memory research. Results By using behavioral single-trial classical conditioning together with electrophysiological analysis and calcium imaging, we have explored the cellular mechanisms by which experience-induced nonsynaptic electrical changes in a neuronal soma remote from the synaptic region are translated into synaptic and circuit level effects. We show that after single-trial food-reward conditioning in the snail Lymnaea stagnalis, identified modulatory neurons that are extrinsic to the feeding network become persistently depolarized between 16 and 24 hr after training. This is delayed with respect to early memory formation but concomitant with the <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of long-term memory. The persistent nonsynaptic change is extrinsic to and maintained independently of synaptic effects occurring within the network directly responsible for the generation of feeding. Artificial membrane potential manipulation and calcium-imaging experiments suggest a novel mechanism whereby the somal depolarization of an extrinsic neuron recruits command-like intrinsic neurons of the circuit underlying the learned behavior. Conclusions We show that nonsynaptic plasticity in an extrinsic modulatory neuron encodes information that enables the expression of long-term associative memory, and we describe how this information can be translated into modified network and behavioral output...|$|E
40|$|The natural {{eutrophication}} {{of lakes}} {{is still an}} accepted concept in limnology, arising as it does from the earliest efforts to classify lakes {{and place them in}} an evolutionary sequence. Recent studies of newly formed lakes at Glacier Bay, Alaska, only partially support this idea, and suggest more variable trends in lake trophic development which are under local (catchment-level) control. Here we use sediment cores from several lakes in Glacier Bay National Park {{to examine the relationship between}} successional changes in catchment vegetation and trends in water-column nitrogen (a limiting nutrient) and lake primary production. Terrestrial succession at Glacier Bay follows several different pathways, with older sites in the lower bay being colonized directly by spruce (Picea) and by-passing a prolonged alder (Alnus) stage that characterizes younger upper-bay sites. Sediment cores from three sites spanning this successional gradient demonstrate that the variability in nitrogen trends among lakes is a consequence of the <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of N-fixing alder in the lake catchment. In the lower-bay lakes, diatom-inferred nitrogen concentrations rise and then fall in concert with the transient appearance of alder in the catchment, while in the upper bay, high nitrogen concentrations are sustained by the continuous dominance of alder. Diatom accumulation, a proxy for whole-lake biological productivity, increases steadily at all three sites during the first century following lake formation, but declines in more recent times at the lower-bay sites in apparent response to the disappearance of alder and decreasing lake-water nitrogen. These results demonstrate a tight biogeochemical coupling between terrestrial succession and lake trophic change during the early developmental history of Glacier Bay lakes...|$|E

Os dados referem-se a todas as crianças da família que à data do estudo tinham até 2 anos de idade. Os dados foram coletados por meio de formulários aplicados às mães ou responsáveis pelo menor, no período de 1988 a 1989. A tábua de vida foi o recurso estatístico utilizado para o cálculo da duração mediana do evento. Das 226 crianças que integraram o estudo, 91, 6 iniciaram a amamentação ao peito. A duração mediana do aleitamento total foi de 90, 28 dias e o aleitamento exclusivo apresentou duração mediana de 0, 1 dia. Ainda que o estabelecimento da amamentação ao peito possa ser considerado alto, a duração mediana do aleitamento total foi extrememente curta, e o aleitamento exclusivo foi desprezível. A Research {{project in}} the <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of total and {{exclusive}} breast-feeding in rural communities of Cansação, BA, Brazil, is presented. It included 226 children, from zero to two years old, of families of peasants living on small-holdings {{in one of the}} driest and poorest regions of the Brazilian Northeast. The data were collected through questionnaires answered by mothers or any adult responsible for the child during 1988 and 1989. It relates to all children from these families who were two years of age {{at the time of the}} study. The survival time was the statistical method used to calculate the median duration of breast-feeding; 91. 6 % of the 226 children started to be breast-fed. This finding shows that the establishment of the breast-feeding was high. The median duration of total breast-feeding was of 90. 28 days and exclusive breastfeeding presented a median duration of 0. 1 day. Through the establishment of breast-feeding can be considered high, the median duration of total breast-feeding is extremely short and that of exclusive breast-feeding insignificant...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Rising {{temperatures}} {{and changes in}} the pre-cipitation regime will have a strong impact {{on the quality of the}} snow cover in the Arctic. A snow cover of good quality protecting lemmings from cold {{temperatures and}} predators is thought to be an important factor for main-taining the cyclic dynamic of their populations in the tundra. We examined if the characteristics of annual fluc-tuations (amplitude and shape of phases) in brown lem-ming (Lemmus trimucronatus) density could be determined by snow depth, snow density, sub-nivean temperature and persistence of snow. Using an 18 -year time series of brown lemming abundance on Bylot Island in the Canadian Arc-tic, we tested if snow variables could explain the residual variation between the observed lemming density and the one predicted by models where cyclicity had been accounted for. Our analysis provides support for the hypothesis that snow cover can affect the amplitude and possibly also the periodicity of lemming population cycles in the High Arctic. Summer abundance of brown lemmings was higher following winters with a deep snow cover and a low-density snow pack near the ground but was unaffected by the date of <b>establishment</b> or melting <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of the snow cover. Two snow variables showed a temporal trend; mean winter snow depth tended to increase <b>and</b> date of <b>establishment</b> of the hiemal threshold occurred earlier over time. These temporal trends, which should be favourable to lemmings, may explain why healthy population cycles have apparently been maintained at our study site contrary to other Arctic sites...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the experiences of}} women with breastfeeding difficulties following a caesarean section under regional anaesthesia. Further, this research aimed to explore the difficulties women experienced initiating and establishing breastfeeding when their babies seemed indifferent or unable to latch to the breast. Caesarean delivery rates have increased progressively in Australia {{over the last decade}} creating new challenges for breastfeeding mothers and caregivers. The advantages of breastfeeding to both the mother and baby are well recognised. However, breastfeeding problems are common in the initial postpartum period, particularly with mothers who have had a caesarean section. Despite high breastfeeding initiation rates, duration rates of exclusive breastfeeding continue to fall. An extensive review of the literature revealed {{that there are a number}} of factors that lead to difficulties breastfeeding following a caesarean section. These included the effects of caesarean delivery and regional anaesthesia, lack of skin to skin contact, formula supplementation, and inadequate postnatal care on infant behaviour and the initiation, <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of breastfeeding. However, no qualitative research was identified specifically relating to the lived experience of women having difficulties breastfeeding after caesarean section, identifying a significant gap in the literature. This study explores the lived experience of a group of mothers with breastfeeding difficulties after delivering by caesarean section under regional anaesthesia. The difficulties they were having centred on problems initiating and establishing breastfeeding their babies who seemed indifferent or unable to latch to the breast. Interpretive phenomenology was considered the most relevant approach for this research due to the methodologies ability to produce rich data in order to explore the essence of the lived experience. Purposeful sampling was employed to select eight participants who were interviewed in their homes two to three weeks after birth. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using van Manen’s circular process of hermeneutical writing, underpinned by Heidegger’s hermeneutic V circle of understanding. The hermeneutical circle is a circle of interpretation that moves forward and backward between the parts and the whole. Through this interaction and understanding the data was reflected on and sub themes and themes were identified. Key themes included Unnatural birth, Natural instincts compromised, Helping mothers to mother, and Sabotage and defeat. These themes reflected the mothers’ journey through birth, the baby’s difficulty feeding, postnatal challenges and how the mothers’ felt in response to these challenges. Overall, the data illustrated that the mode of birth can interfere with the normal mechanisms of birth and the intrinsic desire of a baby held skin to skin to effectively latch and suckle. The key findings of the study included the concept that the four themes are bound inextricably together. Unnatural birth causes natural instincts to be compromised. Helping mothers to mother in a sensitive and supportive manner will help those instincts both maternal and infant, to be strengthened. Ensuring only breastmilk is consumed by breastfed infants helps ensure breastfeeding is not compromised and mothers can be assisted in their desire to breastfeed. These findings were further synthesised to create a supportive framework for breastfeeding after caesarean section. Central to this framework is the notion that encouraging and valuing normal birth, supporting the natural instincts of mother and baby and increasing breastfeeding support for mothers who birth by caesarean section is fundamental to midwifery care. These concepts formed the basis of recommendations for changes to midwifery clinical practice that could improve breastfeeding outcomes for women...|$|E
