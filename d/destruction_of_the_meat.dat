40|$|Detailed {{investigations}} into the time-dependent changes of pork meat quality and composition {{have been carried out}} using standard analytical techniques and Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy. Characteristic changes in soluble protein content, microbial load and biogenic amine content have been measured in the time period from slaughter up to 20 to 30 days post mortem on samples of porcine musculus longissimus dorsi. Characteristic behaviour indicative of a deterioration of meat quality and an increase in microorganism population on the meat surface has been observed. Fluorescence and Raman optical signals have been identified which change over this time period, correlating with the standard measurements and these can be used as indicators of meat properties. These signals can be measured rapidly and without the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> sample allowing non-invasive testing. The combination of these two powerful measurement techniques provides a pathway to comprehensive meat quality monitoring. Furthermore we have developed a hardware concept for carrying out these spectroscopic measurements using a compact and light handheld device and we present concepts for the use of such a device in the logistic chain in combination with a transponder chip and integrated sensors which provide product identification and information about storage conditions along the entire logistic chain to the supermarket shelf...|$|E
