25|$|Air-air heat pumps, that extract {{heat from}} outside air and {{transfer}} this heat to inside air, {{are the most}} common type of heat pumps and the cheapest. These are similar to air conditioners operating in reverse. Air-water heat pumps are otherwise similar to air-air heat pumps, but they transfer the extracted heat into a water heating circuit, floor heating being the most efficient, and they can also transfer heat into a domestic hot water tank for use in showers and hot water taps of the building. However, <b>ground-water</b> heat pumps are more efficient than air-water heat pumps, and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and domestic hot water systems.|$|E

The Appalachian oak-pine forest has a tree canopy of one or more oak species, primarily black oak, white oak, and red oak (Quercus velutina, Quercus alba, and Quercus rubra); these are mixed with pitch pine and some white pine, and a shrub layer dominated by heath shrubs, typically blueberries and black huckleberry.

40|$|International audienceA new {{portable}} {{sampling system}} {{was developed to}} extract Radium isotopes from large volumes (up to 300 L) of fresh surface- and <b>ground-waters</b> of low Ra-activities (< 5 mBq/L). Ra is quantitatively adsorbed on a small amount (6. 5 g) of MnO 2 -coated acrylic fibers, which are then dried and burned at 600 °C in the laboratory. The resulting Mn-oxide powder (about 2 cm 3 when compacted) is then analyzed through gamma-ray spectrometry which allows measurement of the whole Ra quartet (226 Ra, 228 Ra, 224 Ra and 223 Ra) in a single counting of a few days. The usual relative standard combined uncertainties (1 σ) are 2 – 3 % for 226 Ra, 228 Ra and 224 Ra; and less than 10 % for 223 Ra. This method {{was applied to the}} analysis of Ra in karstic waters of the Lez aquifer, and surface- and <b>ground-waters</b> of the upper and middle Vidourle watershed (South of France). The analyzed waters have relatively low 226 Ra activities (1 – 4 mBq/L) in both cases, regardless of the contrasted geology (Mesozoic limestone vs crystalline Variscan basement), but clearly distinct (228 Ra/ 226 Ra) ratios in agreement with the differences in Th/U ratios of the two drained areas. Short-lived Ra isotopes (224 Ra and 223 Ra) appear to be mainly influenced by near-surface desorption/recoil processes for most of the sampling sites...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} of the environmental scientists and policy makers {{is related to the}} environmental compatibility of current agricultural systems and, in particular, to the losses of chemical fertilizers and manure in surface and <b>ground-waters,</b> as a consequence of run-off and leaching phenomena. In most cases European recent agrienvironmental schemes envisaged specific measures for the reduction of fertilizer rates and the control of manure applications, in order to limit the releases of nutrients in surface and <b>ground-waters.</b> Substantial financial resources are invested in those measures and therefore the issue raises interest in monitoring and evaluating their effectiveness. Nutrient balance indicators are often used for quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of the measures in limiting the environmental impact of farming activities. N-surplus {{is one of the most}} commonly used indicators. The paper refers the results of a research project aimed at assessing the outcomes of agri-environmental measures implemented in the Venice Lagoon Watershed with an approach based upon the gross nitrogen balance, called &ldquo;Nboxes&rdquo;. The results of applying the Nboxes procedure to a sample of 550 farms set are presented, evidencing the expectations of greater effectiveness in terms of nitrogen surplus reduction from the measure C. 5. 1. 3 a and C. 5. 1. 3 b (low input farming and buffer strips). Measures supporting improved irrigation systems, controlled drainage and more rational livestock nutritional programmes and technologies, showed instead only limited potential for tangible contributions to the reduction of nitrogen surplus in cultivated soils...|$|R

Much of this information is required by law under the provisions of a number of European Directives to be reported both to Parliament and to Europe and to be made public.

Another way of environmental management includes programs like mining and environmental zoning and regional mining director plans.

2500|$|The Columbia Basin Project {{in central}} Washington changed the {{character}} of Crab Creek substantially. The Crab Creek irrigation-return drainage basin covers an irrigated area of 296mi² (767km²). A large earthfill dam, the O'Sullivan Dam (also {{referred to as the}} Potholes Dam) was constructed from 1947 to 1949, forming Potholes Reservoir, which serves as a central point in the CBP for storage of irrigation water, natural runoff, and irrigation-return flow, allowing irrigation water reuse throughout the southern CBP area. Potholes Reservoir releases water through canals and has no perennial outlet to Lower Crab Creek. Hence today the water in Lower Crab Creek comes from <b>ground-water</b> seepage from Potholes Reservoir and irrigation, from the Goose Lake Wasteway, and from tributary inflows downstream of the O’Sullivan Dam. [...] The water table in this section is variable but generally high due to the low elevation and irrigation runoff. Many lakes, including Merry, Lenice and Nunally Lakes, drain into Crab Creek.|$|E
2500|$|Microalgae {{production}} {{also includes}} {{the ability to use}} saline waste or waste [...] streams as an energy source. [...] This opens a new strategy to produce biofuel in conjunction with waste water treatment, while being able to produce clean water as a byproduct. [...] When used in a microalgal bioreactor, harvested microalgae will capture significant quantities of organic compounds as well as heavy metal contaminants absorbed from wastewater streams that would otherwise be directly discharged into surface and <b>ground-water.</b> [...] Moreover, this process also allows the recovery of phosphorus from waste, which is an essential but scarce element in nature – the reserves of which are estimated to have depleted in the last 50 years. [...] Another possibility is the use of algae production systems to clean up non-point source pollution, in a system known as an algal turf scrubber (ATS). [...] This has been demonstrated to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus levels in rivers and other large bodies of water affected by eutrophication, and systems are being built that will be capable of processing up to 110 million liters of water per day. [...] ATS can also be used for treating point source pollution, such as the waste water mentioned above, or in treating livestock effluent.|$|E

Rivers are spatially and timely structured ecological systems exhibiting hot spots and hot moments that contribute to their overall health status. However, current programsfor monitoring water quality (grab samples and laboratory analysis) are based on sampling strategy that do {{not take into account the}} spatial and temporal heterogeneity of a water body. To reflect their actual dynamics, a paradigm shift is essential. This requires the development of new monitoring strategies and therefore new instrumentation. This new instrumentation must be able to measure at time scales appropriate to phenomena monitored and at a cost low enough to allow a sufficiently dense deployment in water bodies. We propose to enhance developing wireless networks of autonomous micro-sensors associated with mathematical processing of the collected data. The distinctive feature of this kind of smart sensor comes from the complete monitoring network expected, associating surface- and <b>ground-waters</b> chemistry, electronics and energy harvesting with smart data processing aiming to represent dynamic of basic ecological functions...|$|R
