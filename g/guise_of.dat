5|$|Both the 31st and 51st Battalions {{were later}} re-raised as {{separate}} units when Australia's part-time military was re-raised in 1948 under the <b>guise</b> <b>of</b> the Citizen Military Forces.

A further re-organisation saw the units split again in 1965 and re-raised as battalion-level formations under their old numerical designations. They have remained separate since then.|$|E

5|$|It's a touching, believable, often funny but {{ultimately}} sad tale {{of how one}} class {{can take advantage of}} another, even in the <b>guise</b> <b>of</b> patronizing benevolence. Though sometimes shifting abruptly in time, Vanaja is an arresting story of modern-day hardship and class exploitation, recalling Charles Dickens as well as Western fairy-tale lore. Domalpalli's settings are ultra-real in detail and color, from the crude, almost feudal deprivations of Vanaja's dirt-floor background to the stately rituals and autocratic entitlement of the well-to-do.|$|E

Another notable aspect of the book is its focus on the desperate plight of the serfs (the peasants).|$|E
