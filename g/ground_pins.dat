5000|$|Two <b>ground</b> <b>pins,</b> and one pin {{for each}} {{supplied}} voltage, support hot-plug precharging. <b>Ground</b> <b>pins</b> 4 and 12 in a hot-swap cable are the longest, so they make contact first when the connectors are mated. Drive power connector pins 3, 7, and 13 are {{longer than the}} others, so they make contact next. The drive uses them to charge its internal bypass capacitors through current-limiting resistances. Finally, the remaining power pins make contact, bypassing the resistances and providing a low-impedance source of each voltage. This two-step mating process avoids glitches to other loads and possible arcing or erosion of the SATA power connector contacts.|$|E

50|$|Though {{the number}} of wires doubled, {{the number of}} {{connector}} pins and the pinout remain the same as 40-conductor cables, and the external appearance of the connectors is identical. Internally, the connectors are different; the connectors for the 80-wire cable connect {{a larger number of}} ground wires to the <b>ground</b> <b>pins,</b> while the connectors for the 40-wire cable connect ground wires to <b>ground</b> <b>pins</b> one-for-one. 80-wire cables usually come with three differently colored connectors (blue, black, and gray for controller, master drive, and slave drive respectively) as opposed to uniformly colored 40-wire cable's connectors (commonly all gray). The gray connector on 80-conductor cables has pin 28 CSEL not connected, making it the slave position for drives configured cable select.|$|E

50|$|Because {{both ends}} of the RS-232 circuit depend on the <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> being zero volts, {{problems}} will occur when connecting machinery and computers where the voltage between the <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> on one end, and the <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> on the other is not zero. This may also cause a hazardous ground loop. Use of a common ground limits RS-232 to applications with relatively short cables. If the two devices are far enough apart or on separate power systems, the local ground connections {{at either end of the}} cable will have differing voltages; this difference will reduce the noise margin of the signals. Balanced, differential serial connections such as RS-422, RS-485, and USB can tolerate larger ground voltage differences because of the differential signaling.|$|R

50|$|Removing the <b>grounding</b> <b>pin</b> of the {{appliance}}’s plug is unsafe, {{and leaves}} the appliance without proper grounding even when relocated and plugged into a properly grounded three-prong receptacle. Additionally, since most NEMA 5-15P plugs have both current-carrying prongs the same width and rely on the <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> for correct orientation, removing it allows insertion of the plug with hot and neutral wires reversed, creating an additional hazard. In most cases it also invalidates the manufacturer's warranty against defects as an unsupported modification of the appliance.|$|R

Of the 40 available pins, 32 are used for I/O, four for power and <b>ground</b> <b>pins,</b> two for an external crystal (if used), one to enable power outage and brownout detection, and one for reset.|$|E
5000|$|Simple three light testers cannot detect two {{potentially}} serious house wiring errors: (1) {{neutral and}} ground reversed at the receptacle. (2) a bootleg ground, where the neutral and <b>ground</b> <b>pins</b> have been connected {{together at the}} receptacle. This may be done by someone fitting 3-prong receptacles on a circuit that has no ground wire. These errors can be detected with a multimeter and a test load, to verify that the ground connection is separate from the neutral and is not carrying normal circuit current.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} PC/104 bus {{derives from}} the ISA bus. It includes all the signals found on the ISA bus, with additional <b>ground</b> <b>pins</b> added to ensure bus integrity.

The 8-bit version corresponds to the IBM XT and consists of 64 pins. The 16-bit version corresponds to the IBM AT and adds 40 additional pins, bringing the total to 104 (hence the name [...] "PC/104").|$|E

50|$|Modern {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} have incorporated a third pin for a safety ground connection and are {{commonly referred to}} as two <b>pin</b> and <b>ground</b> (2P&G) to distinguish them from their ungrounded two-pin predecessors. The <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> is situated between the line and neutral pins and closer to the latter. This asymmetrical configuration effectively polarizes the connector ensuring that the line and neutral conductors are not exchanged in a properly wired installation. The <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> is also longer than the other two, ensuring that the safety ground connection is made first when making a connection.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study on}} the effectiveness of <b>grounding</b> <b>pins</b> and high-frequency absorbers to reduce the emissions of heatsinks up to 20 GHz. The study considers four different types of excitations, namely a direct excitation, an excitation by a patch antenna, an excitation by a microstrip below the center of the heatsink, and an excitation by a microstrip that was off-set with respect {{to the center of the}} heatsink. Grounding post are positioned equidistantly along the edges of the heatsink and the number of <b>grounding</b> <b>pins</b> per side is varied. Adding <b>grounding</b> <b>pins</b> significantly reduces the emission of the heatsink below 1 - 2 GHz. At higher frequencies, they lose their capability to reduce the heatsink emission and even introduce extra resonance frequencies where the emission is higher compared to the ungrounded heatsink. Three different possible arrangements for the application of absorbing material were considered, namely a thin flat absorber just below the heatsink, a ring absorber between the heatsink and the PCB, and a collar absorber around the heatsink. The absorber succeeds in reducing the heatsink’s emission above 1 - 2 GHz, but has little of no positive effect on the emissions below 1 - 2 GHz. Only by the combination of the <b>grounding</b> <b>pins</b> and the absorber material, a reduction of the heatsink’s emission is achieved over the full frequency range. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The VGA {{interface}} is not {{engineered to}} be hotpluggable (so that the user cannot connect or disconnect the output device while the host is running), although in practice {{this can be}} done and usually does not cause damage to the hardware or other problems. However, nothing in the design ensures that the <b>ground</b> <b>pins</b> form the first make or the last break in the connection, so hotplugging may introduce surges in signal lines {{that may or may not}} be adequately protected against damage. Also, depending on the hardware and software, monitor detection is sometimes unreliable when hotplugging a VGA connection.|$|E
5000|$|The IBM DA15 PC game {{connector}} {{has been}} modified {{to add a}} (usually MPU-401 compatible) MIDI interface, and this is often implemented in the game connectors on third-party sound cards, for example the Sound Blaster line from Creative Labs. The [...] "standard" [...] straight game adapter connector (introduced by IBM) has three <b>ground</b> <b>pins</b> and four +5 V power pins, and the MIDI adaptation replaces one of the grounds {{and one of the}} +5 V pins, both on the bottom row of pins, with MIDI In and MIDI Out signal pins. (There is no MIDI Thru provided.) Creative Labs introduced this adaptation.|$|E
50|$|The SPD EEPROM is {{accessed}} using SMBus, {{a variant}} of the I²C protocol. This reduces the number of communication pins on the module to just two: a clock signal and a data signal. The EEPROM shares <b>ground</b> <b>pins</b> with the RAM, has its own power pin, and has three additional pins (SA0-2) to identify the slot, which are used to assign the EEPROM a unique address in the range 0x50-0x57. Not only can the communication lines be shared among 8 memory modules, the same SMBus is commonly used on motherboards for system health monitoring tasks such as reading power supply voltages, CPU temperatures, and fan speeds.|$|E

25|$|The NEMA 5-15 plug has two flat {{parallel}} blades like NEMA 1-15, {{but also}} adds a <b>ground</b> (earth) <b>pin.</b> It is rated 15A at 125 volts. The <b>ground</b> (earth) <b>pin</b> {{is longer than}} the line and neutral blades, so the device is grounded before the power is connected. Both current-carrying blades on grounding plugs are normally narrow, since the <b>ground</b> (earth) <b>pin</b> enforces polarity. NEMA 1-15 plugs are also compatible with NEMA 5-15 sockets.|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} feature a <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> that {{is longer than}} the line and neutral pins, ensuring that the ground connection is made first, and thus the safety ground is in place before line voltage {{is applied to the}} downstream equipment.|$|R
