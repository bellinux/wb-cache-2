40|$|Traditional {{algorithms}} {{for detecting}} differences in source code focus on differences between lines. As such, little {{can be learned}} about abstract changes that occur over time within a project. Structural differencing on the program's abstract syntax tree reveals changes at the syntactic level within code, which allows us to further process the differences to understand their meaning. We propose that <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> by some metric of similarity, followed by pattern extraction via antiunification {{will allow us to}} identify patterns of change within a software project from the sequence of changes contained within a Version Control System (VCS). Tree similarity metrics such as a tree edit distance can be used to group changes in order to identify groupings that may represent a single class of change (e. g., adding a parameter to a function call). By applying antiunification within each group we are able to generalize from families of concrete changes to patterns of structural change. Studying patterns of change at the structural level, instead of line-by-line, allows us to gain insight into the evolution of software. Comment: 7 pages, submitted to document changes 201...|$|E

40|$|Poisson bracket {{relations}} for generators of canonical transformations are derived {{directly from the}} Galilei and Poincaré <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> space-time coordinates. The method is simple but rigorous. The meaning of each step is clear because it corresponds to an operation in the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> space-time coordinates. Only products and inverses are used; differences are not used. It is made explicitly clear why constants occur in some bracket relations but not in others, and how some constants can be removed, {{so that in the}} end there is a constant in the bracket {{relations for}} the Galilei group but not for the Poincaré <b>group.</b> Each <b>change</b> <b>of</b> coordinates needs to be only to first order, so matrices are not needed for rotations or Lorentz transformations; simple three-vector descriptions are enough.

40|$|Since the {{creation}} of the state productive sector in post-war France there have passed already almost thirty years. Stabilization of the scope of public property in that time and efforts to an active stimulation of the private and capitalist economy by the state have made it necessary to introduce few corrections in functioning of the state sector in order to maintain by the state a position of a serious partner of the private sector. The first <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> consist <b>of</b> structural <b>changes.</b> They embrace from the one side — concentration and centralization of output and capital of state firms and on the other one — strengthening of co-operation with the private sector via {{the creation}} of common subsidiaries or the conclusion of co-operation agreement. The second <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> — these are changes in management and social policy in the state firms. The third group concerns changes in the directions of state investments which shift from traditional fields (power supply and transport) into modern ones (chemical industry, electrotechnology) as well as new aspects of influencing economic growth through active promotion of scientific and technological progress and regional policy of state firms.

In this thesis we investigate approaches for providing grammar engineers with greater feedback on the impact <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> made to grammars. We describe two different visualisations which are created by comparing parser output from two different states of the grammar. The first involves the ranking of features found in parser output according to their magnitude <b>of</b> <b>change</b> so as to provide a low-level picture of the affected parts of the grammar. The second involves performing clustering over sentences whose parsability has changed {{in an attempt to}} find related <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> and accompanying sentences which exemplify each locus <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> These approaches provide complimentary avenues of feedback which can hopefully improve the efficiency of the grammar engineering development process.
