This variable loading affects the amplifier's performance both because the amplifier has nonzero output impedance (it cannot keep its output voltage perfectly constant when the speaker load varies) {{and because the}} phase of the speaker load can change the stability margin of the amplifier. The influence of the speaker impedance is different between tube amplifiers and transistor amplifiers. The reason is that tube amplifiers normally use output transformers, and cannot use much negative feedback due to phase problems in transformer circuits. Notable exceptions are various [...] "OTL" [...] (output-transformerless) tube amplifiers, pioneered by Julius Futterman in the 1950s, or somewhat rarer tube amplifiers that replace the impedance matching transformer with additional (often, though not necessarily, transistorized) circuitry in order to eliminate parasitics and musically unrelated magnetic distortions.

A paradigm of the interactions between the neuroendocrine and immune system is sophisticatedly represented in the thymus. Indeed, receptors for these molecules are heterogeneously expressed in all subsets of thymic cells, and the communications are tuned by <b>feedback</b> <b>circuitries.</b> Herein, we focus on somatostatin (SS), a ubiquitous peptide that regulates several physiological cell processes and acts via five specific receptor (SSR) subtypes (sst(1 - 5)). Neuronal and accessory cells, so-called neuroendocrine cells, and immune cells, heterogeneously express SSRs. The functional characterization of SSRs in vivo by nuclear medicine techniques opened a complex scenario on the significance of SS/SSR pathway in immune system and related diseases. Several studies have established that SSR scintigraphy may benefit patients with chronic inflammatory and granulomatous diseases, as well as lymphoproliferative diseases. The results are sufficiently promising to warrant larger studies aimed at defining the exact role of these techniques. The development of SS analogs with antisecretory and antiproliferative effects has radically changed the management of neuroendocrine tumors. Moreover, very important recent findings, emerging from in vitro studies on SSR physiology in immune cells, will certainly expand the potential applications of SS analogs for in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic options. Indeed, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of these drugs remain incompletely understood, but may prove useful {{in a number of}} autoimmune diseases. Because SS expression is absent in different immune tissues where SSRs are present, the existence of another ligand was hypothesized. In fact, it has been recently demonstrated that human lymphoid tissues and immune cells may express cortistatin (CST). CST is known to bind SSRs and shares many pharmacological and functional properties with SS. However, CST has also properties distinct from SS, and the higher expression of CST in immune cells supports the hypothesis that CST rather than SS may act as a potential endogenous ligand for SSRs in the human immune system...|$|R

In two different needle-free injection systems, full control of injection pressure over time is enabled in a more compact package than previously possible.

The review synthesizes current understanding on motor unit recruitment and rate coding during voluntary contractions, briefly describes the techniques used to record motor unit activity, and then evaluates the adaptations that have been observed in motor unit activity during maximal and submaximal contractions. Relatively few studies have directly compared motor unit behavior before and after training. Although some studies suggest that the voluntary activation of muscle can increase slightly with strength training, it is not known how the discharge of motor units changes to produce this increase in activation. The evidence indicates that the increase is not attributable to changes in motor unit synchronization. It has been demonstrated, however, that training can increase both the rate of torque development and the discharge rate of motor units.
