500|$|Shostakovich is in {{many ways}} a polar counter-force for Stravinsky. [...] When <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the 7th symphony of Shostakovich is a dull and {{unpleasant}} composition, people have responded: [...] "Yes, yes, but think of the background of that symphony." [...] Such an attitude does no good to anyone.|$|E
2500|$|I {{have not}} said that Thierry Henry will be punished, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Thierry Henry will be {{examined}} ...it's {{not a question}} of this player or another – it was blatant unfair play and was seen all around the world...let [...] make the decision. Fair play must be maintained in our game ...|$|E
2500|$|I come {{to answer}} your question, [...] "If the consecration made by Pope John Paul II on 25 March 1984 in union with all the bishops of the world, {{accomplished}} the conditions for the consecration of Russia according to the request of Our Lady in Tui, Spain on 13 June 1929?" [...] Yes, it was accomplished, and since then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it was made.|$|E
60|$|Surprised at this speech, I {{begged him}} {{to tell me what}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> was wrong.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should not}} be shocked, but I was, terribly--more than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{believed}} <b>I</b> could be by anything not connected with Percy.|$|R
6000|$|LADY BROCKLEHURST. I mean I wouldn't. Now if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> {{what would}} <b>have</b> made me say it? (Suspiciously.) George, is Mary all we think her? ...|$|R
2500|$|Madame Vigée Le Brun also {{describes}} the empress at a gala: [...] "The double doors {{opened and the}} Empress appeared. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> she was quite small, and yet on the days when she made her public appearances, with her head held high, her eagle-like stare and a countenance accustomed to command, all this gave her such an air of majesty that to me {{she might have been}} Queen of the World; she wore the sashes of three orders, and her costume was both simple and regal; it consisted of a muslin tunic embroidered with gold fastened by a diamond belt, and the full sleeves were folded back in the Asiatic style. Over this tunic she wore a red velvet dolman with very short sleeves. The bonnet which held her white hair was not decorated with ribbons, but with the most beautiful diamonds." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{nothing that}} he could have done would have {{surprised}} me. Rather should <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> nothing would have surprised me save the thing he did.|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the telephone-bell had rung once more. Suddenly I heard Challenger's {{tremendous}} {{voice from}} the hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "About the letter?" [...] said Molly. [...] "Yes, {{what was}} the trouble about the letter? I knew {{something}} was wrong directly <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wrote it." ...|$|R
5000|$|I didn't say it and Elie Wiesel wasn't even in {{the meeting}} ... That meeting was held {{three weeks before the}} Bitburg summit was held. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> it would <b>have</b> been out of there within hours and on the news.|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{personality}} would <b>have</b> been {{a disturbing}} element.|$|R
60|$|MISS SUSAN. Phoebe, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{you will}} not take the Latin class to-day, and I am dismissing them.|$|E
60|$|But for awhile, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> darkness, solitude, {{and silence}} {{were to be}} sought in the grot, not in the grove.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I understand. Do not let us {{discuss it}} [...] . a moment's weakness. My {{father was a}} great man." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I went foreboding evil, and Guatemoc {{also looked}} downcast. Bitterly did I curse the hour when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was of the}} Spanish blood and yet no Spaniard. Had I known even what I knew that day, torture would not have wrung those words from me. But now it was too late.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{beg your}} pardon, <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> you <b>had</b> {{accepted}} my affront. [...] . I admit {{it was an}} affront; I did not think to apologise, but I do, I ask your pardon; {{it will not be}} so again, I pass you my word of honour. [...] . <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> admired your magnanimity with—this—offender,” Archie concluded with a gulp.|$|R
60|$|As I {{walked away}} he called after me, but I refused to return. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the feeling {{in spite of}} all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he would attempt to rustle a little grub and make his start on the trail. The whole goldseeking {{movement}} was, in a way, a craze; he was simply an extreme development of it.|$|R
60|$|But for a while, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> darkness, solitude, {{and silence}} {{were to be}} sought in the grot, not in the grove.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{perceive}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> in mere convention! Honestly I don't think I am sorry. It {{does not}} matter, either way, sad to say!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I {{began to}} laugh, and now I kept on. I just {{sat down and}} roared, so that the people looked at me.|$|E
2500|$|On {{explaining}} the thinking that {{led her to}} found a backup day-care option for Princeton employees introduced in 2007, an idea that reflected her own career management while raising two children, Tilghman said, [...] ""For years, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> retired, I would start a company that hired retired people to sit for working mothers..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{his sister}} {{the other day}} spent every {{shilling}} of her fortune in paying them. She gave him £40,000! Do you {{think she would have}} married Kennedy but for that? I don't. I could not prevent her. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would not cripple my remaining years of life by raising the money, and I could not go back from my word." ...|$|R
60|$|BRASSBOUND (penning up his fury with difficulty). As <b>I</b> <b>have</b> already <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> remark <b>has</b> no {{application}} to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Ray is not here, and you are," [...] the Duke answered. [...] "Remember that I am no trifler with words. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I insist. I repeat it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have not the pale-faces stolen {{enough from}} the red men, that you come so far to carry a lie? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> this is a hunting-ground of my tribe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you laugh}} so?" [...] asked Hilda, reddening; {{for she was}} a little {{disturbed}} at Kenyon's ridicule, however kindly expressed. [...] "What can <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> you think so very foolish?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> eccellenza, <b>that</b> she {{was heading}} across toward Ischia," [...] {{answered}} Raoul, {{with an air}} of obtuse innocence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Strange! It is {{the thought}} of old times, I suppose,' said Honor, smiling, 'but <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> was Owen Sandbrook's ring.' ...|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{great artists}} work unconsciously, {{that they were}} 'wiser than they knew,' as, I think, Emerson remarks somewhere.|$|R
6000|$|... [282] It was at Penshurst that {{he wrote}} the only {{specimen}} that has [...] come down to us, and bad enough it is. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> some of [...] Sidney's are pleasing.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{the town}} is {{sometimes}} full of snow. One frosty Saturday, seven years ago, I trudged into it from the schoolhouse, and on the Monday morning we could not see Thrums anywhere.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> a {{combination}} of poetry with doctrines, {{is one of the}} characteristics of the Christian muse; but I think Dante has not succeeded in effecting this combination nearly so well as Milton.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Gilbert, {{you are not}} 'going off mad.' Sit {{down here}} and I'll apologise bee-YEW-ti-fully, <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that.</b> But--oh, if you knew--" ...|$|R
60|$|But, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> in <b>that</b> spirit-land wither <b>I</b> <b>had</b> journeyed is to {{be found}} neither time nor space nor any other {{familiar}} thing.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> just <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Warden Atherton {{came into}} my cell intent on murder. His face showed it. His actions proved it.|$|R
