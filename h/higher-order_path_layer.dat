40|$|The {{notion of}} computability closure has been {{introduced}} for proving the termination of the combination of higher-order rewriting and beta-reduction. It is also used for strengthening the <b>higher-order</b> recursive <b>path</b> ordering. In the present paper, we study in more details {{the relations between the}} computability closure and the (<b>higher-order)</b> recursive <b>path</b> ordering. We show that the first-order recursive path ordering is equal to an ordering naturally defined from the computability closure. In the higher-order case, we get an ordering containing the <b>higher-order</b> recursive <b>path</b> ordering whose well-foundedness relies on the correctness of the computability closure. This provides a simple way to extend the <b>higher-order</b> recursive <b>path</b> ordering to richer type systems...|$|R

Several efforts that employ “data mining” techniques have contributed to this field, but few focus on discovering patterns in sets of higher-order links, which can reveal hidden or indirect relationships in data. In this work we focus on the discovery and analysis of <b>higher-order</b> <b>path</b> patterns in a supervised learning dataset. We first analyze higher-order links in the leaf nodes of a decision tree and find evidence for distinguishing between nodes of different classes.

40|$|It {{is known}} that latent {{semantic}} indexing (LSI) takes advantage of implicit higher-order (or latent) structure in the association of terms and documents. Higher-order relations in LSI capture "latent semantics".

In this paper, we present a novel semantic smoothing method named Higher-Order Smoothing (HOS) for the Naive Bayes algorithm. HOS is built on a similar graph based data representation of the HONB which allows semantics in <b>higher-order</b> <b>paths</b> to be exploited. We take the concept one step further in HOS and exploit the relationships between instances of different classes.

40|$|The {{deployment}} of encrypted transport protocols imposes new challenges for network operations. Key in-network {{functions such as}} those implemented by firewalls and passive measurement devices currently rely on information exposed by the transport layer. Encryption, in addition to improving privacy, helps to address ossification of network protocols caused by middleboxes that assume certain information {{to be present in}} the clear. However, “encrypting it all” risks diminishing the utility of these middleboxes for the traffic management tasks for which they were designed. A middlebox cannot use what it cannot see. We propose an architectural solution to this issue, by introducing a new “path layer” for transport-independent, in-band signaling between Internet endpoints and network elements on the paths between them, and using this layer to reinforce the boundary between the hop-by-hop network layer and the end-to- end transport layer. We define a <b>path</b> <b>layer</b> header on top of UDP to provide a common wire image for new, encrypted transports. This <b>path</b> <b>layer</b> header provides information to a transport- independent on-path state machine that replaces stateful handling currently based on exposed header flags and fields in TCP; it enables explicit measurability of transport layer performance; and offers extensibility by sender-to-path and path-to-receiver communications for diagnostics and management. This provides not only a replacement for signals that are not available with encrypted traffic, but also allows integrity-protected, enhanced signaling under endpoint control. We present an implementation of this wire image integrated with the QUIC protocol, as well as a basic stateful middlebox built on Vector Packet Processing (VPP) provided by FD. io...|$|R

Consistent with everyday experience, these parameters vary smoothly in space, aiding compression. Scene geometry (‘Deck’) is {{shown on the}} left, followed by a 2 D slice of the parameter fields for a single source (blue dot). Direct sound loudness (LDS) exhibits strong shadowing while early reflection loudness (LER) captures numerous scattered/diffracted paths, and consequently shadows less. Low LDS combined with high LER conveys a distant and/or occluded source. Early decay time (TER) and late reverberation time (TLR) together indicate scene size, reflectivity and openness. TLR is spatially smoother than TER, being determined by many more weaker and <b>higher-order</b> <b>paths</b> in this complex space.
