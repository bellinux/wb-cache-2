30|$|Females {{and males}} in the sample were {{approximately}} {{of the same age}} (21.39  years of age among females, 21.30 among males). Young women and men were also similar in terms of their visitation to a place of worship, with the average respondent doing so several times each year. Males and females were also similar in regards to their dating relationships, with most having had a relationship lasting, on average, a few months. The desire among either sex to date someone from outside their own social groups (including religion, race/ethnicity, and nationality) was rather low. Of course, this must be taken {{in the context of the}} available pool of potential <b>eligible</b> <b>dating</b> partners, such that there is a general lack of such diversity in most Chinese university populations. Peer pressure to be involved in an intimate relationship may be somewhat tangible, as females and males reported that, on average, approximately half of their friends were currently in a dating relationship. Young men do express a significantly greater willingness to kiss on a first date, as compared to young women. While the difference between the sexes in this regard is not entirely surprising, it does, nonetheless, represent a possible departure from more conservative Chinese dating practices.|$|R

40|$|The {{early stage}} of partner {{selection}} is conceptualized as a decision-making process amenable to at least two types of influence: contextual and procedural. An example of contextual influence is the asymmetric dominance effect. According to this effect, introduction in a twoperson field of eligibles of a third eligible, who is dominated (i. e., is inferior) on an attribute by the first eligible but not by the second one, will tip the scale toward selecting the first eligible. An example of procedural influence is the prominence effect. According to this effect, participants {{will be more likely}} to select in choice rather than in matching the eligible who is superior on an attribute important to the participants. On the other hand, participants {{will be more likely to}} select in matching rather than in choice the eligible who is superior on an attribute unimportant to the participants.

40|$|The present {{economic}} {{level of}} concentrate supplementation for finishing steers offered silage ad libitum {{is in the}} range 4 to 7 kg per head daily depending on factors such as concentrate costs, type of animal being finished and anticipated carcass price (Keane, 1998). Concentrates are normally fed at a flat rate throughout the finishing period either as one or two discrete meals per day {{or as part of}} a mixed ration. In recent years, mainly because of the need to hold cattle until specific dates to collect premia, the practice of varying the level of concentrates throughout the finishing period has developed. Feeding a lower level early on prevents animals being finished before their <b>eligible</b> premia <b>dates,</b> and then if they are not finished as the <b>eligible</b> premia <b>date</b> approaches, the level of concentrates is increased to permit rapid disposal after the retention date has passed. As animals mature and fatten, their rate of gain declines even when energy intake remains constant. This could have an adverse effect on meat quality as there is evidence that a declining rate of gain before slaughter predisposes to poorer quality meat. Furthermore, Mediterranean markets in which Irish beef processors are showing increasing interest require carcasses with muscle which is light red in colour and fat which is white in colour. These colour traits are more likely when animals are fed a high level of concentrates {{towards the end of the}} finishing period. The objectives of the present study were 1) to compare different distribution patterns of supplementary concentrates for finishing steers, and 2) to ascertain if there were interactions between concentrate feeding pattern and breed type.

40|$|Background: Overexpression of {{phosphatase}} of regenerating liver 3 (PRL- 3) {{has been}} implicated in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. Epidemiological studies have evaluated the relationship between PRL- 3 expression and prognosis in GC. However, results still remains controversial. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association of PRL- 3 expression with overall survival (OS) and clinicopathological characteristics. Methods: Literature databases were searched to identify <b>eligible</b> studies <b>dated</b> until April 2013.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{mortality rates}} {{in patients with}} acute renal failure during the past decades. METHODS: We performed a MEDLINE search using the keywords "acute renal failure" crossed with "outcome," "mortality," "ICU," "critically ill" or "prognosis" in the period from January 1970 to December 2004. Abstracts and full articles were eligible if mortality rates were reported. We also reviewed the bibliographies of available studies for further potentially <b>eligible</b> studies. The <b>dates</b> of the observation period for each study and not the publication dates were considered for the analysis, so the earliest data were from 1956. RESULTS: Of 85 articles fulfilling the criteria, 5 {{were excluded because of}} duplicate publications using the same database, so that 80 were included in our review with a total of 15 897 patients. Mortality rates in most studies exceeded 30 %, and there was no consistent change over time.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Team-based {{approaches}} to patient care are {{a relatively recent}} innovation in health care delivery. The effectiveness of these approaches on patient outcomes has not been well documented. This paper reports a systematic review {{of the relationship between}} team-based care and patient satisfaction. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and PSYCHOINFO for <b>eligible</b> studies <b>dating</b> from inception to October 8, 2012. Eligible studies reported (1) a randomized controlled trial, (2) interventions including both team-based care and non-team-based care (or usual care), and (3) outcomes including an assessment of patient satisfaction. Articles with different settings between intervention and control were excluded, as were trial protocols. The reference lists of retrieved papers were also evaluated for inclusion. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 319 citations, of which 77 were screened for further full-text evaluation. Of these, 27 articles were included in the systematic review. The 26 trials with a total of 15, 526 participants were included in this systematic review. The pooling result of dichotomous data (number of studies: 10) showed that team-based care had a positive effect on patient satisfaction compared with usual care (odds ratio, 2. 09; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 54 to 2. 84); however, combined continuous data (number of studies: 7) demonstrated that {{there was no significant difference}} in patient satisfaction between team-based care and usual care (standardized mean difference, - 0. 02; 95 % confidence interval, - 0. 40 to 0. 36). CONCLUSIONS: Some evidence showed that team-based care is better than usual care in improving patient satisfaction. However, considering the pooling result of continuous data, along with the suboptimal quality of included trials, further large-scale and high-quality randomized controlled trials comparing team-based care and usual care are needed...|$|R
40|$|Obstructive sleep apnoea is {{recognised}} as {{a common}} but under-diagnosed health issue. Currently, {{there is very little}} published data relating to the burden and impact of obstructive sleep apnoea among indigenous populations. The purpose of this review was to investigate the prevalence, impact, risk factors and treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in indigenous populations in high-income countries. An integrative review was conducted on 25 English language studies and reports that investigated obstructive sleep apnoea among indigenous populations in high-income countries. Studies that did not focus on indigenous populations in the results or discussion were excluded. Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases and reference lists of <b>eligible</b> studies. Publication <b>dates</b> range from 1998 to 2012. Synthesis of studies indicates the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea is higher and severity is greater in indigenous populations compared with non-indigenous populations. Comparable risk factors for obstructive sleep apnoea were identified in indigenous and non-indigenous populations, with only three studies identifying ethnicity as an independent risk factor. Indigenous populations in high-income countries are subject to an overall greater prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea that is also more severe. A higher prevalence of obesity, alcohol and tobacco use and comorbid medical conditions associated with low socioeconomic status rather than indigenous status per se appears to explain this disparity...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} whether sleep disturbances are bidirectionally related to anxiety and depression, and thus identify potential {{risk factors for}} each problem. DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted on 9 studies (8 longitudinal, 1 retrospective) that assessed bidirectionality between a sleep disturbance, and anxiety or depression. Treatment studies were excluded, along with those solely based on clinical samples or cohorts {{at high risk of}} suffering from a sleep disturbance, anxiety and depression. Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, and Scopus databases, and reference lists of <b>eligible</b> studies. Publication <b>dates</b> ranged from the beginning of each database to December 2011. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Syntheses of longitudinal studies suggested insomnia and sleep quality were bidirectionally related to anxiety and depression, and depression/anxiety, respectively. Childhood sleep problems significantly predicted higher levels of depression and a combined depression/anxiety variable, but not vice-versa. A one-way relationship was found where anxiety predicted excessive daytime sleepiness, but excessive daytime sleepiness was not associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Definitive conclusions regarding bidirectionality cannot be made for most sleep disturbances due to the small number and heterogeneity of cohort samples used across studies. Nevertheless, best available evidence suggests insomnia is bidirectionally related to anxiety and depression. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed. Pasquale K. Alvaro, Rachel M.

DMTs can {{be associated with}} cutaneous adverse events, which may influence treatment adherence and patient quality of life. In this systematic review, we aimed to provide an overview of the clinical spectrum and the incidence of skin reactions associated with DMTs. A systematic literature search was performed up to May 2011 in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases without applying restrictions in study design, language, or publishing <b>date.</b> <b>Eligible</b> for inclusion were articles describing any skin reaction related to DMTs in MS patients. Selection of articles and data extraction were performed by two authors independently. One hundred and six articles were included, of which 41 (39 %) were randomized controlled trials or cohort studies reporting incidences of mainly local injection-site reactions. A large number of patients had experienced some form of localized injection-site reaction: up to 90 % for those using subcutaneous formulations and up to 33 % for those using an intramuscular formulation. Sixty-five case-reports involving 106 MS patients described a wide spectrum of cutaneous adverse events, the most frequently reported being lipoatrophy, cutaneous necrosis and ulcers, and various immune-mediated inflammatory skin diseases. DMTs for MS are frequently associated with local injection-site reactions and a wide spectrum of generalized cutaneous adverse events, in particular, the subcutaneous formulations. Although some of the skin reactions may be severe and persistent, most of them are mild and do not require cessation of DMT...|$|R

40|$|Medicaid {{has emerged}} as a payment reform {{innovator}} with Value Based Purchasing (VBP) efforts. This paper examines whether current Medicaid policies help or hinder these efforts and whether these current policies impact cost goals, quality improvement goals and improved access in those states that have expanded Medicaid versus those that have not expanded Medicaid coverage. Cost, quality and access to care challenges are constant in the Medicaid program due to lack of program funding, lack of continuity in programming across states, Medicaid’s revolving enrollee eligibility and the general health of the Medicaid <b>eligible</b> population. To <b>date,</b> thirty one states have begun Medicaid expansion efforts, which allows for full Federal funding for a period of three years, phasing down to 90 % funding by 2020. There are additional options for funding through delivery system transformation efforts, and expansion states must use these and other opportunities to control costs, improve quality and allow access to services. Input from many different stakeholders, in conjunction with support from the policy side have given rise to “out of the box” thinking on how to best support delivery system reform and transformation towards a value based system in programming. In Medicaid expansion states, these types of policies and activities advance innovation in cost reduction, quality improvement and access to services. Two examples are the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) efforts, and the Medicaid Innovation Accelerator Program (IAP). Through examination of these policies and their achievement, there is room for additional policy enhancement in order to foster the culture of sustainability, collaboration and alignment and to create overall improvements in cost, quality of care rendered and access to services for Medicaid beneficiaries.

40|$|Radiocarbon dating {{was long}} {{neglected}} in Iron Age research, with dates on the ‘Hallstatt plateau’ (800 – 400 BC) considered too broad {{to be useful}} compared to artefact typo-chronologies. Such views are now untenable. Around fifty British Iron Age settlements and cemeteries have been dated using Bayesian methodologies, yielding two important general results: (1) typological dating produces sequences that are regularly too late; and (2) many phenomena, from chariot burials to settlement shifts, represent brief horizons, rather than being long lived. Drawing on a selection of studies, this article explores the impact of Bayesian modelling on British Iron Age studies. It highlights potential pitfalls and issues that must be considered when dating the period, illustrates some major successes and looks to the future. The recent dating programmes for Broxmouth were made possible through funding from Historic Scotland and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). The dates for Stanwick were funded through English Heritage (EH). The Dating Celtic Art project involved individuals in museums, universities and archaeological units across Britain and was funded through the AHRC. The new dates generated by the project were funded by NERC and AHRC via the NRCF (formerly ORADS) programme. The dating of the East Yorkshire burials was funded {{from a variety of}} sources over the years. Small grants were received from the East Riding Archaeological Society, the East Riding Archaeological Trust, and CBA Yorkshire. The stable isotope research was partly funded by AHRB and the Department of Archaeological Sciences at the University of Bradford. The 10 new dates for Wetwang Slack were funded through the NRCF scheme, apart from two dates funded by the University of Leicester.
