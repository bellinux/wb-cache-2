50|$|In 1960, Penn invents a {{more durable}} <b>felt</b> <b>cover</b> for the tennis ball by weaving New Zealand wool and {{artificial}} fibers together.|$|E
50|$|Traditional yurts {{consist of}} an {{expanding}} wooden circular frame carrying a <b>felt</b> <b>cover.</b> The felt {{is made from}} the wool of the flocks of sheep that accompany the pastoralists. The timber to make the external structure {{is not to be}} found on the treeless steppes, and must be obtained by trade in the valleys below.|$|E

50|$|Narvel <b>Felts</b> <b>covered</b> {{the song}} in 1978 {{and took it to}} #30 on the Hot Country Songs charts.|$|R
50|$|Narvel <b>Felts</b> <b>covered</b> {{the song}} in 1982. His version went to number 64 on the Hot Country Singles chart in 1982.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{a closer}} {{approximation}} to the Mongolian and Central Asian yurt is in production in several countries. These tents use local hardwood, and often are adapted for a wetter climate with steeper roof profiles and waterproof canvas. In essence they are yurts, but some lack the <b>felt</b> <b>cover</b> and ornate features across the exterior that {{is present in}} traditional yurt. There are UK-made yurts that feature a metal frame in use {{in at least two}} glamping sites in Somerset and Dorset.|$|E
40|$|A yurt is a {{portable}} tent-like dwelling structure favored by Mongolian nomads {{for more than}} three millennia and it can be favorably used even at a harsh environment as low as – 50 degrees. The paper concludes that the multi-layer structure of the <b>felt</b> <b>cover</b> is the key for weatherproofing. A fractional differential model with He’s fractional derivative is established to find an optimal thickness of the fractal hierarchy of the <b>felt</b> <b>cover.</b> A better understanding of the yurt mechanism could help the further design of yurt-like space suits and other protective clothing for extreme cold region...|$|E
40|$|An {{explicit}} finite-element (FE) {{model of}} a pressurised tennis ball, consisting of an airbag, rubber core and <b>felt</b> <b>cover,</b> was produced in Ansys/LS-DYNA. The model was validated by comparing FE simulations of rubber cores and tennis balls, impacting on a rigid surface with experimental data. The laboratory investigation was undertaken by firing the balls and cores with an air cannon on to a force plate, at a range of velocities between 5 and 30 m. s- 1. Values of force and contact times {{were obtained from the}} force plate data whilst the inbound and rebound velocities were recorded using a set of light gates. A Phantom high-speed video camera recording 6000 fps was used to capture a number of impacts; this footage was then used to calculate the deformation of the balls and cores. The FE simulations were in good agreement with the experimental data for the range of impact speeds tested...|$|E
50|$|The {{platforms}} were {{of standard}} length and had large open fronted waiting areas of concrete walls and <b>felt</b> <b>covered</b> wooden roof {{with a long}} single bench along the rear wall. These were demolished when the station was rebuilt.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to clothing, wool {{has been used}} for blankets, horse rugs, saddle cloths, carpeting, insulation and upholstery. Wool <b>felt</b> <b>covers</b> piano hammers, and it is used to absorb odors and noise in heavy machinery and stereo speakers. Ancient Greeks lined their helmets with felt, and Roman legionnaires used breastplates made of wool felt.|$|R
5000|$|First {{authorized}} {{and issued}} in late 1918 or early 1919, this pilots' double wing {{was made in}} a style similar to the officer's cap and collar badges. It consisted of a copper back with overlays of two silver wings with a silver [...] "CAF" [...] monogram superimposed over a copper maple leaf. Black <b>felt</b> <b>covered</b> the back and a brass metal support strip was added under the fasteners. The design of the wings made the structure fragile.|$|R
50|$|George Smart (1774-1846) was an English tailor and Folk Artist {{notable for}} his cloth collage portraits and <b>felt</b> <b>covered</b> dummyboards. He lived in Frant, {{a village in}} East Sussex, England. His artworks were {{mentioned}} in several guidebooks {{of the time that}} encouraged tourists to visit his shop. His most notable subjects were Old Bright, the local postman and The Goosewoman. The Tunbridge Wells Museum owns nine examples of his work and Compton Verney Art Gallery in Warwickshire has two pictures.|$|R

50|$|The mound is {{supported}} on the outside by a wall of chalk blocks. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch with the roofing <b>felt</b> <b>covered</b> cap resting of a dead curb of wooden blocks. The four common sails with Van Bussel leading edges and air brakes have a span of 24.6 m. They are carried on a cast-iron windshaft which also carries the brake wheel which drives the wallower {{at the top of}} the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel drives the one pairs of mill stones of 1.50 m diameter via a lantern pinion stone nut.|$|R

5000|$|The {{song was}} covered by Fozzy with Butch Walker on vocals and guitar on their debut album, Fozzy, on 24 October 2000. [...] In his review of the album, Steve Huey of Allmusic <b>felt</b> the <b>cover</b> had a [...] "...tendency {{to go a little}} too far over the top..." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Asia, early solid-treed saddles {{were made}} of <b>felt</b> that <b>covered</b> a wooden frame. These designs date to {{approximately}} 200BC [...] One of the earliest solid-treed saddles in the west was first used by the Romans {{as early as the}} 1st century BC, but this design also did not have stirrups.|$|R
50|$|De Zwaan is a four storey brick tower mill {{built on}} a small natural hill. The shape of the tower is {{regarded}} as a transition between the earlier thick walled cylindrical tower mills and the later thinner walled more conical shaped tower mills. The mill is winded internally by winches in the roofing <b>felt</b> <b>covered</b> cap which rests on a live curb with cast iron rollers. The four Common Sails have a span of 26.8 m and are carried in a cast-iron windshaft cast by De Prins van Oranje in 1869. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which drives the wallower {{at the top of the}} upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel drives the two pairs of mill stones of 1.40 m and 1.50 m diameter via a lantern pinion stone nuts.|$|R
40|$|Hat of red straw. The hat {{has a high}} {{crown of}} finely woven red straw, with {{flattened}} top. The sides of the crown have diagonal ridges forming a "zig-zag" around the crown. At it's base, the crown curves in and under, forming a "waist" around which is tied a band of ribbed knit(?) fabric, with bow at back. The shallow brim curves downwards. From the band around crown extends a gray/black veil which extends from slightly over 1 / 2 of the circumference of the hat. The hat is lined in red fabric, and has an inner hatband of red grosgrain ribbon around the inside base of the crown. Maker's label sewn to inner hatband: "Otto Lucas / Bond Street London / Made in England". The hat is accompanied by one short hatpin with red <b>felt</b> <b>covered</b> head to match hat...|$|R
60|$|With great rapidity {{the sails}} {{of the fleet}} came down, and in five minutes its whole aspect was changed; but quickly as the sailors had done their work, the storm was even more rapid in its progress. Some of the ships whose crews were slower or less {{skillful}} than the others were caught by the gale before they could get their sails snug, and the great sheets of white canvas were blown from the bolt-ropes as if made of paper, and a blackness which could almost be <b>felt</b> <b>covered</b> the sea, the only light being that given by the frothing waters. There was no longer any thought of order. Each ship had to shift for herself; and each captain to do his best to save those under his charge, without thought of what might befall the others.|$|R
2500|$|Early solid-treed saddles {{were made}} of <b>felt</b> that <b>covered</b> a wooden frame. Asian designs {{appeared}} during the Han dynasty approximately 200 BC. [...] One of the earliest solid-treed saddles in the west was the [...] "four horn" [...] design, first used by the Romans {{as early as the}} 1st century BC. Neither design had stirrups.|$|R

It has two runways: 4L/22R is 4,499 by 150 feet (1,371 x 46 m) concrete and 4R/22L is 2,650 by 75 feet (808 x 23 m) asphalt. It has a seaplane landing area designated 3W/21W, 6,000 by 100 feet (1,829 x 30 m).|$|R
50|$|Dionysia is a genus {{containing}} 49 {{species of}} flowering {{plants in the}} family Primulaceae. They are small, cushion-forming alpines native to mountains in central Asia. They are usually evergreen perennials with <b>felted</b> leaves, <b>covered</b> with bright yellow or pink, five-petalled flowers in spring. They are often difficult to cultivate if the correct conditions are not provided.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} covered on Stryper's album The Covering on 15 February 2011. In {{his review of}} the album, Mark Allen of Hardrock Haven <b>felt</b> the <b>cover</b> version was a misstep and that [...] "there are far better Ozzy offerings than [...] "Over the Mountain."" [...] But Morgan Y. Evans of MetalRiot thought the cover version was [...] "...well suited to the {{signature}} soaring Stryper vocals you love or hate)." ...|$|R
50|$|Ca Cappello was purchased, at a date given {{variously}} as 1874 and 1878 by sources, by the English archeologist, diplomat and politician Austen Henry Layard, {{with the}} help of the doyen of the British community in Venice, the historian Rawdon Brown. Layard, who had shipped his great collection of Italian Renaissance paintings to Venice in 1875, inhabited the palazzo stably following his withdrawal from the diplomatic career after political debacle in Istanbul and deep disagreement with Gladstone until his death by cancer, on the occasion of a rare visit to London, in 1894. The frescoes by Zelotti and Veronese were no longer visible, but Layard managed significant renovation works in the palace. Red, yellow and green <b>felt</b> <b>covered</b> the walls inside, and Spanish silks festooned outside of balconies and windows gave the palazzo an unmistakable appearance. Assyrian reliefs from Niniveh and a Hellenistic funary piece from Samos were installed into the staircase wall, though these were in 1892 donated to the Museo Civico Correr, and replaced with floral paintings by Neapolitan artist Francesco Lavagna.|$|R
5000|$|A sound-alike cover {{appeared}} on the 1970 album Top of the Pops, Volume 10, with one reviewer using terms like [...] "laryngitic croak" [...] and [...] "gargling gargoyles" [...] to describe how he <b>felt</b> about the <b>cover.</b>|$|R
60|$|The Chemist stooped {{upon the}} ground beside the boy, and, {{with the same kind}} of {{compassion}} for him that he now <b>felt</b> for himself, <b>covered</b> him as he slept, and no longer shrank from him with abhorrence or indifference.|$|R
6000|$|... "Methinks," [...] said Cnut, [...] "that we {{are about}} to have a storm. A few minutes ago scarce a cloud was to be seen; now that bank over there has risen half-way up the sky. The sailors are {{accustomed}} to these treacherous seas, and the warnings which we have not noticed have no doubt been clear enough to them." [...] With great rapidity the sails of the fleet came down, and in five minutes its whole aspect was changed; but quickly as the sailors had done their work, the storm was even more rapid in its progress. Some of the ships whose crews were slower or less skilful than the others, were caught by the gale before they could get their sails snug, and the great sheets of white canvas were blown from the bolt ropes as if made of paper, and a blackness which could almost be <b>felt,</b> <b>covered</b> the sea, the only light being that given by the frothing waters.

6000|$|Winston said nothing, {{but by and}} by {{poured a}} little of the spirit into a rusty can, and the girl, who {{understood}} why he did so, <b>felt</b> that it <b>covered</b> several of his offenses. [...] "Now," [...] she said graciously, [...] "you may smoke if you wish to." ...|$|R
40|$|Hat {{of brown}} felt and brown {{feathers}}. The hat is styled as a calotte (also spelled "calot") with shaped close crown of brown <b>felt</b> totally <b>covered</b> with long brown feathers laid lengthwise across crown and forming "petals" at edges.

50|$|Small {{branches}} {{covered in}} a whitish <b>felt.</b> Older branches <b>covered</b> in stringy and flaky brown bark. Leaves alternate, entire, wavy edged. White underneath, dull green above. 15 to 24 cm long and 2 to 4 cm wide. The midrib is sunken on the top side, but raised on the lower side.|$|R
60|$|A solitary horseman--a {{youth in}} early manhood--riding at a snail's pace over the great plains, or karroo, of South Africa. His chin on his breast; {{his hands in}} the pockets of an old shooting-coat; his legs in ragged trousers, and his feet in {{worn-out}} boots. Regardless of stirrups, the last are dangling. The reins hang on the neck of his steed, whose head may be said to dangle from its shoulders, so nearly does its nose approach the ground. A <b>felt</b> hat <b>covers</b> the youth's curly black head, and a double-barrelled gun is slung across his broad shoulders.|$|R
50|$|Asimov {{published}} three {{volumes of}} autobiography. In Memory Yet Green (1979) and In Joy Still <b>Felt</b> (1980) <b>cover</b> his life up to 1978. The third volume, I. Asimov: A Memoir (1994), covered {{his whole life}} (rather than following on from where the second volume left off). The epilogue was written by his widow Janet Asimov after his death. The book won a Hugo Award in 1995. Janet Asimov edited It's Been a Good Life (2002), a condensed version of his three autobiographies. He also published three volumes of retrospectives of his writing, Opus 100 (1969), Opus 200 (1979), and Opus 300 (1984).|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} 1955, after the Korean War had ended, that a need arose for {{continued}} expansion of Navy officer numbers. The new Navy officer numbers now extended to a cap of 800,000; service numbers had reached #670,900 by the year 1963. In 1971, with the service number cap of 800,000 nearly reached, the Navy extended officers numbers one final time to 999,999 which the Navy <b>felt</b> would <b>cover</b> all future officers {{to the end of}} the 20th century. Only a handful of numbers above 800,000 were ever issued and the Navy discontinued service numbers in January 1972.|$|R
