25|$|Taste, {{gustatory}} perception, or <b>gustation</b> {{is one of}} {{the five}} traditional senses that belongs to the gustatory system.|$|E
25|$|Various organic {{diseases}} {{may cause}} parosmias (distortion {{of the sense}} of smell). Also, since smell and taste are intimately linked senses, disorders of <b>gustation</b> (e.g. dysgeusia- taste dysfunction) can present as a complaint related to smell, and vice versa. These conditions, collectively termed chemosensory dysfunctions, are many and varied, and they may trigger a person to complain of an odor than is not present, however the diagnostic criteria for ORS require the exclusion of any such causes. They include pathology of the right hemisphere of the brain, substance abuse, arteriovenous malformations in the brain, and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|Humans have a {{multitude}} of sensors. Sight (vision), hearing (audition), taste (<b>gustation),</b> smell (olfaction), and touch (somatosensation) are the five traditionally recognized senses. The ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by these most broadly recognized senses also exists, and these sensory modalities include temperature (thermoception), kinesthetic sense (proprioception), pain (nociception), balance (equilibrioception), vibration (mechanoreception), and various internal stimuli (e.g. the different chemoreceptors for detecting salt and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood, or sense of hunger and sense of thirst). However, what constitutes a sense {{is a matter of}} some debate, leading to difficulties in defining what exactly a distinct sense is, and where the borders between responses to related stimuli lie.|$|E
2500|$|Taste or <b>gustation</b> (adjectival form: gustatory) {{is one of}} the {{traditional}} five senses. It refers to the capability to detect the taste of substances such as food, certain minerals, and poisons, etc. The sense of taste is often confused with the [...] "sense" [...] of flavor, which is a combination of taste and smell perception. Flavor depends on odor, texture, and temperature as well as on taste. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called taste buds, or gustatory calyculi, concentrated on the upper surface of the tongue. There are five basic tastes: sweet, bitter, sour, salty and umami. Other tastes such as calcium and free fatty acids may also be basic tastes but have yet to receive widespread acceptance. The inability to taste is called ageusia.|$|E
2500|$|Catfish {{may have}} up to four pairs of barbels: nasal, maxillary (on each side of mouth), and two pairs of chin barbels, even though pairs of barbels may be absent {{depending}} on the species. Catfish barbels always come as pairs. Many larger catfish also have chemoreceptors across their entire bodies, which means they [...] "taste" [...] anything they touch and [...] "smell" [...] any chemicals in the water. [...] "In catfish, <b>gustation</b> plays a primary role in the orientation and location of food". Because their barbels and chemoreception are more important in detecting food, the eyes on catfish are generally small. Like other ostariophysans, they are characterized {{by the presence of}} a Weberian apparatus. Their well-developed Weberian apparatus and reduced gas bladder allow for improved hearing as well as sound production.|$|E
2500|$|We {{experience}} the world subjectively thus we create subjective representations of our experience. These subjective representations of experience are constituted {{in terms of}} five senses and language. That is to say our subjective conscious experience {{is in terms of}} the traditional senses of vision, audition, tactition, olfaction and <b>gustation</b> such that when we—for example—rehearse an activity [...] "in our heads", recall an event or anticipate the future we will [...] "see" [...] images, [...] "hear" [...] sounds, [...] "taste" [...] flavours, [...] "feel" [...] tactile sensations, [...] "smell" [...] odours and think in some (natural) language. [...] Furthermore it is claimed that these subjective representations of experience have a discernible structure, a pattern. It is in this sense that NLP is sometimes defined as the study of the structure of subjective experience.|$|E

50|$|Recognition {{memory is}} not {{confined}} to the visual domain; we can recognize things in each of the five traditional sensory modalities (i.e. sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste). Although most neuroscientific research has focused on visual recognition, there have also been studies related to audition (hearing), olfaction (smell), <b>gustation</b> (taste), and tactition (touch).|$|E
50|$|Dr. Doty has {{published}} over 400 papers in peer-reviewed journals related to olfactory and gustatory function, {{and is the}} editor or author of nine books.

50|$|Muco-inositol is {{typically}} phosphorylated (becoming muco-inositol phosphate) {{in the process}} of being attached to a lipid of the outer lemma of the sensory neurons of taste. The final chemical is phosphatidyl muco-inositol (PtdIns). PtdIns occurs in a specialized area of the cilia of the sensory neurons where it exists in a liquid crystalline form. In this form, it is the sensory receptor of the sensory neuron forming the initial element of the sodium ion sensitive channel of <b>gustation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Roland L. Fischer (1915 in Budapest, Hungary - 1997 in Majorca, Spain) was an {{experimental}} psychiatrist and psychopharmacologist {{known for his}} early work on schizophrenia, the perception-hallucination continuum model of altered states of consciousness, and {{for his work on}} <b>gustation</b> which later contributed to research supporting supertasting. Fischer was formerly professor of experimental psychiatry and associate professor of pharmacology at Ohio State University (1958-1971), and also held academic posts at George Washington University, Georgetown and Johns Hopkins University.|$|E
5000|$|Taste receptors in the {{gustatory}} system: The {{primary use}} of <b>gustation</b> {{as a type}} of chemoreception is for the detection of tasteants. Aqueous chemical compounds come into contact with chemoreceptors in the mouth, such as taste buds on the tongue, and trigger responses. These chemical compounds can either trigger an appetitive response for nutrients, or a defensive response against toxins depending on which receptors fire. Fish and crustaceans, who are constantly in an aqueous environment, use their gustatory system to identify certain chemicals in the mixture for the purpose of localization and ingestion of food.|$|E
5000|$|The {{visual system}} in fish is {{augmented}} by other sensing systems with comparable or complimentary functions. Some fish are blind, and must rely entirely on alternate sensing systems. Other senses {{which can also}} provide data about location or distant objects include hearing and echolocation, electroreception, magnetoception and chemoreception (smell and taste). For example, catfish have chemoreceptors across their entire bodies, which means they [...] "taste" [...] anything they touch and [...] "smell" [...] any chemicals in the water. [...] "In catfish, <b>gustation</b> plays a primary role in the orientation and location of food".|$|E

50|$|When muco-inositol is {{combined}} with a yet to be specifically defined phosphatidyl moiety, {{it is capable of}} forming the receptor for the sodium sensitive neural pathway (N or Na-path) in <b>gustation.</b> If it is phosphorylated at position #1 of the chair configuration shown at upper right, it presents two receptor sites (the hydroxyl pair at position #3 & #4, and the pair at position #4 & #5) to the fluid environment (mucosa) external to the sensory receptor neuron. At the same time, it suppresses the susceptibility of its two intrinsic sweet (or G-path) neural pathway receptors (the hydroxyl pair at positions #1 & #2 and at #6 & #1).|$|E

50|$|Special visceral {{afferent fibers}} (SVA) are the afferent fibers that develop in {{association}} with the gastrointestinal tract. They carry the special senses of smell (olfaction) and taste (<b>gustation).</b> The cranial nerves containing SVA fibers are the olfactory nerve (I), the facial nerve (VII), the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), trigeminal nerve (V) and the vagus nerve (X). The facial nerve receives taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue; the glossopharyngeal from the posterior third. SVA fibers in the vagus originate in the larynx and pharynx. The sensory processes, using their primary cell bodies from the inferior ganglion, send projections to the medulla, from which they travel in the tractus solitarius, later terminating at the rostral nucleus solitarius.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} sensations is the olfactory sensation. Evolutionary, <b>gustation</b> and olfaction developed together. This multisensory integration was necessary for early humans {{in order to ensure}} that they were receiving proper nutrition from their food, and also to make sure that they were not consuming poisonous materials. There are several other sensory integrations that developed early on in the human evolutionary time line. The integration between vision and audition was necessary for spatial mapping. Integration between vision and tactile sensations developed along with our finer motor skills including better hand-eye coordination. While humans developed into bipedal organisms, balance became exponentially more essential to survival. The multisensory integration between visual inputs, vestibular (balance) inputs, and proprioception inputs played an important role in our development into upright walkers.|$|E
50|$|Sensory {{processing}} {{deals with}} how the brain processes sensory input from multiple sensory modalities. These include the five classic senses of vision (sight), audition (hearing), tactile stimulation (touch), olfaction (smell), and <b>gustation</b> (taste). Other sensory modalities exist, for example the vestibular sense (balance {{and the sense of}} movement) and proprioception (the sense of knowing one's position in space) Along with Time (The sense of knowing where one is in time or activities). It is important that the information of these different sensory modalities must be relatable. The sensory inputs themselves are in different electrical signals, and in different contexts. Through sensory processing, the brain can relate all sensory inputs into a coherent percept, upon which our interaction with the environment is ultimately based.|$|E
5000|$|Drosophila melanogaster {{males are}} known for their {{elaborate}} courtship rituals, where they follow a female, tap on her with his forelegs and “sing” a courtship song through rapid wing clapping sounding much like a vibration sound in an attempt to entice her. [...] He then proceeds to contact her genitalia with his mouth and curve his abdomen to induce copulation. During the early stages of courtship where the male taps the female with his forelegs, males are able to sense the gender and species type of a potential female through the use of non-volatile (i.e. cuticular) pheromones and gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) located on the males forelegs. This process is known as <b>gustation</b> where non-volatile pheromones are detected by the GRNs and processed later inducing courtship.|$|E

50|$|The {{parameter}} {{of primary}} interest in <b>gustation</b> is {{the distance between}} the oxygen atoms of the pair O3 and O4 and the pair O4 and O5 in 3D space. This distance is defined as the d-value of the sensory receptor. This value cannot be obtained from the various Zig-Zag and Haworth representations commonly used in chemistry. Currently, the mean of the d-value of muco-inositol is between 3.3 Angstrom (0.33 nm) and 3.66 Angstrom (0.366 nm). The latter value is computed using the 3D structures found in the Jmol and Protein Data Bank libraries of Biochemistry. In both cases, another digit of precision is needed in the calculations to resolve this spread. Such precision is difficult to obtain in bond length measurements. The d-value of the O3 and O4 pair and the O4 and O5 pair are equal.|$|E
