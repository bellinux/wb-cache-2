500|$|In Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010), the Court of Appeal had to {{determine}} the validity of a differentiating factor prescribed by the legislature for distinguishing between different classes of offenders for sentencing purposes. In that case, the differentiating factor {{was found in the}} Misuse of Drugs Act ("MDA"), which stipulated that an accused trafficking in more than [...] of diamorphine (heroin) would result in him or her facing a mandatory death penalty upon conviction. Following its previous decision in Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor (2005), which had applied Ong Ah Chuan, the Court applied the rational nexus test and found that the 15-gram differentia bore a reasonable relation to the social object of the MDA. The Court also noted that the [...] "quantity of addictive drugs trafficked is not only broadly proportionate to the quantity of addictive drugs brought onto the <b>illicit</b> <b>market,</b> but also broadly proportionate to the scale of operations of the drug dealer and, hence, broadly proportionate to the harm likely to be posed to society by the offender's crime."

40|$|Abstract Laws that prohibit, regulate, or tax {{cigarettes}} {{can generate}} <b>illicit</b> <b>markets</b> for tobacco products. <b>Illicit</b> <b>markets</b> both reduce {{the efficacy of}} policies intended to improve public health and create harms of their own. Enforcement can reduce evasion but creates additional harms, including incarceration and violence. There is strong evidence that more enforcement in <b>illicit</b> drug <b>markets</b> can spur violence. The presence of licit substitutes, such as electronic cigarettes, {{has the potential to}} greatly reduce the size of <b>illicit</b> <b>markets.</b> We present a model demonstrating why enforcement can increase violence, show that states with higher tobacco taxes have larger <b>illicit</b> <b>markets,</b> and apply the findings to discussion of public policy toward a potential ban on menthol cigarettes.

40|$|What role does {{social capital}} {{play in the}} use of {{violence}} in <b>illicit</b> <b>markets?</b> Social capital is a multi-dimensional concept that includes networks, trusts and norms, and researchers have made great progress identifying the role social capital plays in economic development. Economies embedded within a social context characterized by high levels of social capital benefit from lower transactions costs, increased efficiency, and increased innovation. Nevertheless, a sticking point in the literature remains, namely, {{that it is difficult to}} disentangle the effects of social capital from the effects of formal institutions. We argue this ambiguity is the result of social capital studies that focus almost exclusively on licit markets with formal institutions. To remedy this, we look at markets with no formal institutions: <b>illicit</b> <b>markets.</b> We focus on the role of networks and find that social capital can reduce transaction costs and consequently levels of violence, but only if network ties are “bridging” and thus weak. However, if network ties are “bonding” and thus strong, social capital in <b>illicit</b> <b>markets</b> encourages exclusionary relationships and the regular use of violence...|$|R

5000|$|Between 1971 and 1995, {{there was}} a nearly fivefold {{increase}} in the number of amphetamine-type stimulants under international control[...] [...] ecstasy and related designer drugs are under schedule one of the 1971 Convention, because they have virtually no medical use, while amphetamine and methamphetamine are under schedule 2 because they began life with medical use. But even though they are scheduled, the system is not really working for these illegally produced drugs.

5000|$|... meta-Methoxyamphetamine (MMA), {{also known}} as 3-methoxyamphetamine (3-MA), is a {{stimulant}} drug from the amphetamine family. It has similar effects in animal drug discrimination tests to the more widely known derivative 4-methoxyamphetamine (PMA), although with a slightly different ratio of monoamine release, being a combined serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine releasing agent rather than a fairly selective serotonin releaser like PMA. 3-Methoxyamphetamine has similarly appeared on the <b>illicit</b> <b>market</b> as a designer drug alternative to MDMA, although far more rarely than its infamous positional isomer.

40|$|Tobacco smoking harms health. Taxes and {{regulations}} can reduce that harm. But evasion reduces {{the efficacy of}} taxes {{and regulations}} and creates harms of its own {{in the form of}} <b>illicit</b> <b>markets.</b> Enforcement can reduce evasion but creates additional harms, including incarceration and violence. Peter Reu-ter has pointed out that a flat ban on cigarettes would be likely to generate illicit-market harms similar to the harms of existing <b>illicit</b> drug <b>markets.</b> Taxes and regulations {{can be thought of as}} “lesser prohibitions,” subject to the same sorts of risks. Minimizing total harm means minimizing the sum of abuse harms and control harms. Tighter regulations and higher taxes on cigarettes risk increasing the size of the existing <b>illicit</b> tobacco <b>markets,</b> which are already substantial. That risk can be somewhat blunted by increasing enforcement effort, but doing so can be costly on several dimensions and might, under plausible assumptions, lead to an increase in violence. Tobacco policymaking should therefore consider <b>illicit</b> <b>markets</b> and the need for enforcement; some of the health benefits of regula-tion and taxation may be offset by increased illicit-market side effects and enforcement costs. The presence of licit substitutes, such as e-cigarettes, can greatly reduce the size of the problem; the regulation of e-cigarettes should take this effect into account. If enforcement is to be increased to counterbal-ance tightened controls, positive-feedback dynamics suggest that the enforcement increase should precede, rather than follow, the tightening...|$|R

Summary The advent of the Internet has created opportunities for the global exchange of information and purchase of goods and services.

50|$|Acetylfentanyl (acetyl fentanyl) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug {{that is an}} analog of fentanyl. Studies have estimated acetylfentanyl to be fifteen times more potent than morphine.

Acetylfentanyl was discovered {{at the same time}} as fentanyl itself and had only rarely been encountered on the <b>illicit</b> <b>market</b> in the late 1980s. However, in 2013, Canadian police seized 3 kilograms of acetylfentanyl. As a μ-opioid receptor agonist, acetylfentanyl may serve as a direct substitute for heroin or other opioids. Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.|$|E

50|$|Like other opiates, {{hydromorphone}} {{can be used}} recreationally. Its reinforcing {{effects are}} mediated via its strong affinity for the μ-opioid receptor, inducing euphoria, sedation, reduced anxiety, respiratory depression, and other prototypical morphinian effects. Such effects make it particularly susceptible to abuse, although many patients using it for analgesia are {{able to use it}} for extended periods of time without developing drug-seeking behavior. In abusers, there can be a strong psychological dependence, thus creating an addiction with repeated use. Physical dependence causes withdrawal, while psychological dependence can create strong compulsions to use the drug, which can persist for days or weeks after the physical dependence is broken, and has been known to induce anxiety, insomnia, depression, and a range of other persistent mental illnesses. For this reason, psychotherapy is often included in detox programs, sometimes augmented with pharmacological therapies. Hydromorphone is more expensive on the <b>illicit</b> <b>market</b> than heroin, despite producing similar effects, thus causing the abuse rates of hydromorphone to be lower than heroin and similar opioids in many areas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{structure}} of <b>illicit</b> drug <b>markets</b> {{is not well}} defined. This is particularly true of <b>illicit</b> <b>markets</b> that operate, at least in part, above the retail level. In this paper we contrast two hypotheses concerning how such markets are structured. The first posits an oligopolistic market composed of a relatively small set of large, hierarchically organized distribution networks. The second hypothesis posits a cottage industry of drug trafficking composed of many small groups of traffickers that form and break-up easily. Using data collected from federal, state and local drug investigators in the Washington-Baltimore area, we examine the behaviors of traffickers investigated in 1995, 1996 and 1997. These {{data suggest that the}} cottage-industry hypothesis is a better characterization of drug trafficking in the Washington-Baltimore area than the concentrated-industry hypothesis.
