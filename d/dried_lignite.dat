40|$|The present paper {{includes}} {{the results of}} the combustion tests with Greek <b>dried</b> <b>lignite</b> performed at a 1 MWth semi industrial scale pulverized coal combustion facility. Scope of the campaign is the investigation of the combustion behaviour of Greek lignite, i. e. temperature fields, ignition, burnout, emissions, as well as slagging and fouling tendency, while firing with varying levels of recirculated flue gas. Dry coal co-firing conditions in a large scale boiler are simulated by adjusting the volume flow of recirculated flue gas. Two test series representing different boiler operation modes are performed. During the first series the maximum flue gas temperature increase, when co-firing dry coal, is determined, while in the second test series the needed load decrease. in order to keep constant furnace outlet temperature in dry coal co-firing conditions is recorded. A detailed measurement set is carried out including temperature profiles, emissions, fuel, fly ash sampling and slagging and fouling investigations through the installation of dedicated deposition probes. The anticipated increase of the furnace temperature profiles by decreasing the inserted recirculated flue gas is confirmed by the experimental results. No clear trend of dry coal co-combustion on the emissions' behaviour is noticed, while dry coal firing appears to have a moderate effect on the deposition behaviour of Greek lignite. These preliminary investigations indicate that no significant operational problems are expected during a potential future demonstration of dry lignite co-firing in a Greek large scale boiler.

The integration of a predrying system in future lignite power plants, which utilizes low temperature steam for the drying process, combined with the further thermal utilization of lignite's evaporated moisture, may bring an efficiency increase of four to six percentage points compared with today's state of the art. Firing predried lignite is however expected to cause certain changes in the combustion behavior of large scale boilers. The investigation of these changes in an existing Greek utility boiler through experimental activities and numerical simulations is the scope of the present work. The investigations take place in a 75 MWth lignite fired Greek boiler. The specific unit is equipped with dedicated <b>dry</b> <b>lignite</b> burners. The measurements are performed with a <b>dry</b> <b>lignite</b> thermal share of 6 %. Higher cofiring thermal shares of up to 20 % are further simulated and the effect of cofiring on the combustion behavior is evaluated by specific parameters including temperature fields, wall heat flux, fuel's burnout, and NOx emissions. No clear effects of cofiring on boiler operation are observed during the experimental campaign indicating that the operational behavior in low cofiring shares remains constant. Some trends are observed in the simulations of the dry coal cofiring cases. Increased temperature peaks in the near burner region and higher furnace outlet temperatures are predicted. A clear increase of the total fuel burnout when firing dry coal is also foreseen by the simulations, which is a strong argument for the coutilization of <b>dry</b> <b>lignite</b> as a supportive fuel.

The pre-drying concept is of particular importance in Greek boilers firing lignite with a high water and ash content.

Lignite, from the opet pit mine Šikulje, lignite ore „Kreka“, Bosnia and Herzegovina, was fragmented and sieved to the appropriate size and used as a base material. The isolation of humic acid was carried out from pre-oxidized and <b>dried</b> <b>lignite</b> after which it was refined. Identification thus obtained humic acids was carried out by FTIR spectroscopy and its characterization of UV analysis which is determined by optical density of isolated humic acid and its complexation with metal cations. Data obtained by FTIR spectroscopic analysis of isolated humic acids show no significant structural and chemical difference in relation to the spectrum obtained for standard humic acids (Sigma Aldrich). UV analysis showed that isolated and standard humic acid have E 4 /E 6 ratio in an appropriate range of 3 – 5, which indicates the presence {{of a large number of}} aliphatic structure. Based on the degree of humification was found that the isolated humic acids belong to the type B standard while humic acids belong to type A. The most important property of the humic substances is the ability to interact with the metal ions forming soluble or insoluble complexes which possess different chemical and biological properties and stability. The nature of the complex between humic acid and metal cation derived from the heterogeneous, polyelectric and polydispersive character humic acids that occurs due to the presence of a large number of functional groups. Complexation of humic acid is carried out with different concentrations of metal nitrate solutions and at different pH values. Different amounts of humic acids were used for the complexation. The amount of the free metal ions was measured with the ICP-OES methode. The data were also statistically analyzed with ANOVA. The results showed that increasing the pH reduces the concentration of metal ions adsorbed on humic acid and by increasing the concentrations and amounts of metal humic acid that power increases.

40|$|The ELFUEL coal drying {{facility}} {{is designed to}} utilize the high heat transfer characteristics of a moving packed bed counter-current heat exchanger to efficiently "hot-water dry" lignite coal. Past research into hot water <b>drying</b> of <b>lignite</b> indicates the process is energy inefficient, requiring greater energy input than what can be extracted from the treated lignite. The novel approach of the ELFUEL coal drying facility utilizes the high heat transfer characteristics of a counter-current solid/liquid packed bed to efficiently add and later remove heat to and from descending coal in a pressurized cylindrical vessel. This approach uses raw coal continuously descending in a vertical cylindrical refractory. Coal, upon entering the refractory at the top, gradually heats to process temperatures near the location of hot water injection through contact with hot water flowing upward. Below the point of hot water injection, cool water is forced upward past the descending coal to trap or conserve heat or energy in the system. Sufficient energy is conserved by this design to economically hot-water <b>dry</b> <b>lignite</b> coal. Design of a counter-current energy efficient system which adds and then removes heat has not {{been reported in the}} literature. Wonchala and Wynnyckyj (1986) reports counter-current packed bed processes are common in the metallurgical industries. Some important example include the iron blast furnace and iron-ore pelletizing shaft furnace which are very useful since they exhibit a very high potential heat transfer efficiency.

The chemical reactions (devolatilization and char burnout), convective and radiative heat transfer, fluid and particle flow fields (homogenous and heterogenous processes), and turbulent models were employed in 3 -D hybrid unstructured grid CFD simulations. The available experimental results from a lab-scale 100 KW firing lignite unit (Chalmer's furnace) were selected for the validation of these simulations. The aerodynamic effect of primary and secondary registers of the burner was included through swirl at the burner inlet {{in order to achieve}} the flame stability inside the furnace. Validation and comparison of all the combustion cases with the experimental data were made by using the temperature distribution profiles and species concentration (O 2, CO 2, and H 2 O) profiles at the most intense combustion locations of the furnace. The overall visualization of the flame temperature distributions and oxygen concentrations were presented in {{the upper part of the}} furnace. The numerical results showed that the flame temperature distributions and O 2 consumptions of the OF 25 case were approximately similar to the reference combustion case. In contrast, in the OF 27 and OF 29 combustion cases, the flame temperatures were higher and more confined in the closest region of the burner exit plane.

40|$|In {{the work}} at hand basic {{experimental}} results are presented for the mechanical/thermal dewatering (MTE, German abbreviation for ‘Mechanisch/Thermische Entwässerung’, also used for ‘mechanical/thermal expression’ in English), during which lignites or other moisture containing materials are dewatered by the combined application of heat and mechanical forces. Models are developed for {{the description of the}} kinetics during the dewatering of the different materials based on soil-mechanical fundamentals, rheology and rate-process-theory. Using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), helium pycnometry, CO 2 adsorption and other techniques, it is investigated, how MTE process conditions, such as temperature and pressure, affect the physical properties pore size distribution and pore diameters, specific surface area, skeletal and ‘true’ density, hardening, compressibility and shrinkage behaviour of low rank coals from Australia, Greece and Germany. The results provide a detailed insight in process kinetics and mechanism, in coal structure and structural changes during the dewatering process. Additionally re-hydration and combustibility of MTE products as well as the removal of minerals from lignites during the MTE process is investigated. Results from the mechanical/thermal dewatering and water leaching tests are compared, which prove, that the MTE process is a powerful technique for the removal of both water and alkali components from lignite and younger biomass fuels like straw. Reductions of the concentration of sodium in lignite and potassium in straw between 70 and 85 % are obtained. The results thus demonstrate, that the MTE process is also suitable for the upgrading of lignites and biomass fuels to prevent corrosion and slagging in power plants. The development of the plant and process engineering for the dewatering of lignite and for the combined leaching and dewatering of biomass fuels is presented and technological modifications required for the dewatering of waste materials and suspensions like galvanising sludge are described. The technical implementation is demonstrated based on the laboratory and technical scale dewatering units at the University of Dortmund and the pilot and demonstration plants located in Frechen and at the power plant Niederaußem. Efficiencies for different <b>dry</b> <b>lignite</b> fired power plant concepts with integrated mechanical/ thermal lignite dewatering are calculated and compared to the results obtained for other drying and dewatering processes. Depending on the origin and water content of the lignite, power plant efficiencies can be increased by up to 20 percent and specific CO 2 emissions can be reduced by the same amount by the implementation of the MTE process in technical scale power plants. The results prove, that the MTE process is a remarkable advance compared to the existing methods...|$|R
50|$|In September 1915 {{the mining}} company {{applied to the}} mining {{authorities}} in Senftenberg {{for the construction of}} a Bertzit unit (named after the Bertzit procedure described below). The Bertzit tower was built in 1920 on the initiative of the management of the company running the mine Ada. It is 35 meters high and situated in close proximity to the mine.The tower has a square floor plan with a skeleton construction made of reinforced concrete. It was intended to be part of a coal drying plant, which would use the Bertzit procedure invented by Camillo Mahnhardt from Munich, to <b>dry</b> the <b>lignite.</b> This procedure was developed for the drying of inferior and moister fuels such as peat. The procedure was tested in Pasing near Munich and seemed to be more appealing financially. It promised a cost efficient product enhancement through the doubling of the fuel value. Furthermore, the mine had high lignite deposits, which were ideal for this procedure. It was intended to extract a high quality, anthracite coal-like product using an air-sealed reaction between 250 °C and 300 °C. The majority shareholders of the project were the Bertzit-Aktiengesellschaft in Berlin-Charlottenburg and the Bertzit-Gesellschaft mbH in Munich. The Döllinger mining company was probably just a minority shareholder, but was still a board member. In later years the headquarters of the young company moved to Munich.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{procedure}} and system of drum drying technology are introduced for <b>lignite</b> <b>drying</b> and upgrading with high temperature flue gas. The total moisture and inherent moisture of lignite decrease significantly after being dried {{and the lower}} heat value(LHV) increases greatly, {{which means that the}} quality of lignite is improved obviously. Both the moisture and air dried volatile of the dried product coal decrease gradually when increasing the drum inlet temperature. However, only the moisture decreases and the volatile varies little when increasing the drum outlet temperature. The rotating speed of drum will make a few impact on the drying degree. Because the combustion load and the drying output will affect each other, it is recommended that the independent pulverized coal system is added. The key factors affecting the system material balance are the ratio of fine-grained powder and lower heat value. The appropriate ratio of fine-grained powder is suggested. The inert atmosphere feeding system which can control the oxygen content independently must be designed...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} drying upon the macro- and partly meso-pore {{structure}} of Greek <b>lignite</b> was investigated. <b>Drying</b> of <b>lignite</b> lumps (∼dp: + 3 - 15 mm) {{placed on a}} fixed bed arrangement, was carried out under vacuum (∼ 0. 2 Torr) in a constant-temperature (100 - 250 °C) environment, for varying drying times (5 - 180 min). Drying caused a considerable particle contraction (by ∼ 1 / 3 of its original size), a minor decrease in the macro- and partly meso-pore volume and a marked increase in the relevant surface area, particularly {{in the range of}} high weight losses (35 - 40 %). Residual moisture contents ranged from ∼ 0 % to 42 %, specific pore volume fell in the range 0. 20 - 0. 25 cm 3 /g (dry sample), and specific surface area in the range 9 - 17 m 2 /g (dry sample). Pore volume and surface area frequency distributions, determined from mercury porosimetry (MP) measurements done on raw or partially dried samples, clearly indicate the formation of pores in the size range Dp: + 75 - 1500 Å at the expense of pores in the range Dp: + 1500 - 104 Å. This observation might be the result of pore shrinkage and pore emptying due to the counteraction of particle contraction and moisture removal respectively. Mercury penetration - retraction hysteresis was evident in every MP run. Mercury entrapment drop (from 85 % to 38 %) varied with residual moisture content, an indication that drying favours the formation of a more regular and less complex physical pore structure. © 1986...|$|R
40|$|Lignite {{is one of}} {{the three}} columns of Germany’s energy mix and has the {{potential}} to affect the entire national economy. It accounted for approximately 40 % of Germany’s primary energy production in 2007 equivalent to 180 million tons. Almost all of this fuelled conventional power plants while a small portion was converted to pulverised lignite or briquettes. In order to use lignite in the existing boiler systems efficiently, it is dried prior to combustion. This creates a higher gross calorific value and shifts the water molecules within the lignite matrix or vaporises them. To achieve a combustible product several processes are employed. The power plants in the Rhineland use either mill drying or the fluidised bed dryer with internal heat recovery. This thesis examines an alternative pre-combustion drying procedure which utilises microwaves at frequency of 2, 45 GHz. These heat the water in the lignite above the boiling point and generates, {{by the nature of the}} process, a volumetric drying instead of a convection heat transfer. Due to the excess energy in such a system, local overheating can occur that may lead to degradation of the carbon structure within the coal molecules. Taking this into consideration the volatile matter of each sample was surveyed. The microwave drying process was conducted in two steps. The first focussed on the fundamentals of the process while the second addressed the up-scaling feasibility. The initial research was carried out on a laboratory scale utilising a modified household microwave. The industrial up-scaling tests were conducted in an industrial microwave oven. The drying tests in the laboratory were accompanied by an ultimate analysis to check for any alteration in coal properties due to microwave radiation. The microwave was set to 900 W for a maximum of 7. 5 minutes at intervals of 30 seconds. Within 6. 6 minutes the moisture content of a 100 g sample dropped to the targeted 14 %. The ultimate analysis proved that the only hydrogen removed from the samples was that due to the evaporation of water, not from the carbon structure. Furthermore the volatile matter slightly decreased but this was not mirrored by a decrease in carbon content or calorific value. The experiments on a pilot plant scale confirmed the results from the laboratory and further experience was gained about the <b>drying</b> behaviour of <b>lignite</b> treated at 5 kW and 10 kW. As expected the process speeds up but without the loss of volatile matter from the coal. As well as a drying effect the microwaves change the porosity of the coal matrix that shows up as enlarged pore sizes and radii. The macro pores could be significantly enlarged by the radiation. The energy balance is considered to be a crucial criterion when assessing any drying technology. The general requirements for an industrial scale microwave drying plant were calculated using data gathered from an operating lignite fuelled power plant in the Rhineland. Employing this information the capital and operating costs of a microwave drying plant under variable conditions were deduced with reference to the energy balance and the laboratory data. The energy content of a hard coal equivalent served as the economic benchmark for the process. Real and idealised microwave <b>lignite</b> <b>drying</b> processes were compared to hard coal in order to evaluate their economical viability. The results showed that to derive an equal amount of energy the real microwave process costs 2. 39 times more than the hard coal alternative and the idealised one 2. 13 times more. Even if the investment cost were ignored the cost for supplying the same amount of hard coal equivalent would be 1, 84 times higher. The process becomes economically viable if the price for the hard coal equivalent exceeds 181 €/t and the price for installed microwave radiation is below 50 €/kW. Lignite fuelled power plants will come under increasing pressure because they have higher CO 2 emissions than hard coal plants. The cost of the necessary Carbon Emission Certificates worsens the economic case for the microwave drying process. Based on the work carried out in this thesis the conclusion is that the <b>drying</b> of <b>lignite</b> from the Rhenish Basin by microwave methods is not currently economical nor is it likely to be in the foreseeable future...|$|R

Research on drying of low-rank coals, such as lignites and subbituminous coals, {{has been conducted}} {{for nearly half a}} century. Although partial <b>drying</b> of Dakota <b>lignite</b> is practiced for freeze-proofing by mixing partially dried coal with run-of-mine coal, full scale drying of low rank coals has never been practiced commercially in this country. The reasons are: (1) drying of low rank coals by conventional methods results in severe degradation of coal particles; (2) dried coals are thus dusty and difficult to handle; (3) reabsorption of moisture in storage and transit defeats the drying process. In addition the dry coal particles will react with ambient oxygen, and heat up enough to ignite. It appears that large-scale development of Alaskan coals may have to await solutions to these problems. Our Mineral Industry Research Laboratory at the University of Alaska is making a comprehensive literature search seeking solutions to these problems and identifying areas of research that should be undertaken...|$|R

40|$|The drying {{kinetics}} of Chinese lignite in nitrogen fluidized-bed, {{superheated steam}} fluidized-bed and microwave were investigated. The {{changes in the}} mass {{as a function of}} drying time were measured under various drying conditions. The variations of moisture ratio with time were used to test ten different thin-layer empirical drying models given in the literature. In studying the consistency of all the models, some statistical tests, such as χ², residual sum of squares (RSS) and F-value were also used as well as coefficient of determination R². In nitrogen fluidized-bed and superheated steam fluidized-bed, the Midilli–Kucuk model best described the <b>lignite</b> <b>drying</b> process. Drying data in microwave were best described by the Page model, indicative of a difference in kinetics between the two drying methods. This difference was attributed to different heat transfer mechanisms under conventional and microwave drying conditions. The effects of drying parameters in nitrogen fluidized-bed, superheated steam fluidized-bed and microwave drying on the constants and coefficients of the selected models were studied by multiple regression analysis.

40|$|At present, fossil-fuel {{power plants}} supply the {{majority}} of the world’s demand of electric energy. The environmental and health threats from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) of these power plants have been considered as {{one of the main reasons}} for global climate change. In order to make the existing fossil fuel energy sources more environmentally friendly, a new generation of advanced power plant with increased output and environmental performance is required to be built. Oxy-fuel combustion technique can potentially provide significant opportunities for near-zero emissions from the existing and new-build power plants by capturing and storing the carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels and biomass. To obtain a better understanding of the overall oxy-fuel combustion process, it is important to investigate the effects of oxy-fuel-fired conditions on the combustion characteristics and heat transfer performance as innovations in the energy used. As a first step in developing and validating a computational tool to numerically model combustion of gaseous fuel, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling study has been carried out involving propane combustion with associated chemical reactions, radiative heat transfer, and turbulence. Three different combustion environments that were adopted experimentally in a 100 kW drop tube firing unit, were examined. One air-fired (reference case) and two oxy-fuel-fired cases (21 vol. % O 2 for one combustion case (OF 21) and 27 vol. % O 2 for the other combustion case (OF 27)) were investigated. The irreversible singlestep and reversible multi-step reaction mechanisms were considered. The results obtained with the multi-step chemistry mechanism showed improved agreement, particularly in the flame zone. The unburnt fuel in air-fired and OF 27 cases was less than that of the OF 21 case due to the low oxygen concentration used in the latter combustion case. As a second step of this research program, a comprehensive CFD modelling study was undertaken by integrating the combustion of pulverized <b>dry</b> <b>lignite</b> in several combustion environments. Four different cases were investigated: an air-fired and three different oxy-fuel combustion environments (25 % vol. O 2 concentration (OF 25), 27 % vol. O 2 concentration (OF 27), and 29 % vol. O 2 concentration (OF 29) were considered. The available experimental results from a lab-scale 100 kW firing lignite unit (Chalmers’ furnace) were selected for the validation of these simulations. The findings showed reasonable agreement with the qualitative and quantitative measurements of temperature distribution profiles and species concentration profiles at the most intense combustion locations inside the furnace. Through the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), it is concluded that the resident time, stoichiometry, and recycled flue gas rates are relevant parameters to optimize the design of oxy-fuel furnaces. Under the same oxy-fuel combustion conditions as above, the appropriate mathematical models with the related kinetics parameters were implemented. The purpose was to accurately calculate the temperature distributions, species concentrations (O 2, CO 2, CO, H 2 O, and H 2), NOx emission concentrations, and the radiation heat transfer. In this step of the modelling investigation, the multi-step chemical reaction mechanisms were conducted on the gas-phase and solid-phase of the coal reaction in one-, two-, and three-step reaction schemes. The predicted results showed a reasonably good agreement against the measured data for all the combustion cases, but in the three-step scheme the results were highly improved, particularly in the flame envelope zone. In the final step of the investigation, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling study has been developed to investigate Victorian brown coal combustion in a 550 MW utility boiler under air-fired and three oxy-fuel-fired scenarios. User-defined functions (UDFs) were written and incorporated into the CFD code in order to calculate the following mathematical models: the PC devolatilization, char burnout, multi-step chemical reactions, mass and heat transfer, carbon in fly-ash, and NOx formation/destruction. A level of confidence of the CFD model was achieved by validating four different parameters of the conventional combustion case. The numerical results of OF 29 combustion condition were considerably similar to the reference firing results in terms of gas temperature levels and radiative heat transfer relative to the OF 25 and OF 27 combustion cases. In addition, a significant increase in the CO 2 concentrations and a noticeable decrease in the NOx formation were observed under all oxy-fuel combustion scenarios. This study of oxy-fuel combustion in a large-scale tangentially-fired boiler is important prior to its implementation in real-life...|$|R
