50|$|The style drew upon Swiss chalet architecture, {{which had}} been {{introduced}} to America by Andrew Jackson Downing around 1850. Log construction was popularized by Downing's protégé, Calvert Vaux, in his pattern book Villas and Cottages in 1857. Downing's design principles emphasized utility, structural expression, and conformity to natural surroundings. The building form was influenced by Stick style, but using log framing instead of dimensional lumber to express the structural system of the buildings. Charles Eastlake's book Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and other Details also influenced the Adirondack rustic style. Interior decorations such as rustic and Mission Style furniture, mounted trophies of fish <b>and</b> game, Japanese <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> <b>screens,</b> <b>and</b> American Indian artifacts were influenced by Eastlake's ideas.|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the consumption, collection, and display of one body of material culture prominent in late nineteenth-century British interiors, namely Japanese textiles, including plain, figured and embroidered fabrics, embroidered <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> <b>screens,</b> <b>and</b> kimonos. During this period, these objects featured in heated debates {{on issues of}} taste. A growing middle class sought to find and exert its place in society, and as Dianne Sachko Macleod had argued, their progress was related to material abundance visible in consumption and display (Macleod, 1996, 277). While the rare European and non-European antiques that formed the heart of so many aristocratic collections continued to be unaffordable to many, {{the combination of a}} disposable income and the availability of inexpensive imports or imitation handmade or mass-produced items, such as Japanese or Anglo-Japanese textiles, carried the desired connotations of luxury and exoticism...|$|R

It was named for the two (or [...] "twin") bridges which carry U.S. Highway 60 over arms of the lake which connect to the Neosho River and the Spring River. Twin Bridges State Park is known for its quiet country {{atmosphere}} and excellent fishing for trophy-sized bass, catfish, bluegill, and spoonbill. A fishing center with bait, tackle, and enclosed fishing dock is located within the park. Lighted boat ramps, picnic areas, RV and tent campgrounds, snacks, lake huts, playgrounds, volleyball court, and horseshoe pits are also available. Picnic facilities include tables, individual shelters, and group picnic shelters for larger gatherings. Campsites range from semi-modern RV sites to tent camping and offer comfort stations with showers. The park also offers one-room lake huts with electricity, ceiling <b>fans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>screened</b> windows, grills, tables, water, and restroom facilities. The park is also home to the Wildlife Department's Paddlefish Research & Processing Center which collects important biological data, processes paddlefish meat for anglers, and salvages paddlefish eggs.

40|$|A {{commonly}} utilized BMP in MS 4 s and {{new construction}} is a <b>screened</b> hydrodynamic <b>separator.</b> These devices {{are intended to}} separate gross solids and associated pollutants without providing hydrologic restoration. This case study examines {{the performance of a}} common screened (2400 µm <b>screen)</b> hydrodynamic <b>separator</b> with <b>and</b> without maintenance (cleaning). The design of experiments was based on utilizing flow rates ranges from less than 10 % to 125 % of manufacturer design flow and followed regulatory protocols (Indianapolis). Results were also modeled through computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling. Results indicate that for the class of hydrodynamic separators examined, that while gross solids can be removed, regular maintenance or cleaning is critical to maintain effluent quality. The case study illustrates, from measured and modeled data that lack of maintenance can lead to significant scour (and partitioning) of existing loads from a <b>screened</b> hydrodynamic <b>separator.</b> Results suggest that structural BMP systems must include hydrologic restoration, frequent maintenance, sludge/solute management and should be considered only after source control measures have been shown not to be effective in an MS 4...|$|R
50|$|Finer {{particle}} sizes (>40 µm) {{are able}} to be separated with the gyratory separator than with a trommel screen. The size of the gyratory <b>screen</b> <b>separator</b> can be adjusted through removable trays, whereas the trommel screen is usually fixed. Gyratory separators can also separate dry and wet materials like trommel screens. However, {{it is common for}} the gyratory separators to separate either dry or wet materials only. This is because there are different parameters for the gyratory screen to have the best separation efficiency. Therefore, two separators would be required for the separation of dry and wet materials, while one trommel screen {{would be able to do}} the same job.|$|R

40|$|Vetiveria zizanioides is {{popularly known}} as Khas Khas, Khas or Khus grass in India. It is a densely tufted grass, found {{throughout}} the plains and lower hills of India, particularly on the riverbanks and in rich marshy soil. Vetiver {{has been known to}} India since ancient times. It has been considered as a high-class perfume and copper plate inscriptions list the perfume as one of the articles used by royalty. Two species of Vetiveria are found in India, of which V. zizanioides is the common source of the well-known oil of vetiver, which is used in medicine and in perfumery. Khas grass grows wild in many states, namely Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh and throughout South India.

40|$|Issue: When rubber {{articles}} {{are removed from}} service or scrapped, they are usually too large {{to use in the}} recycling process as is. Therefore it is necessary to produce a raw material for further downstream processing whether that be ambient, cryogenic, or wet grinding technique. This best practice discusses some of the factors related to production of feed material. Best Practice: Tires are by far the largest rubber item recycled. The first step in the production of raw material from tires is shredding. The details on shredding are covered in another Best Practice. Basically the tire is cut into small pieces. The size of the pieces is controlled by a screen with openings {{on the bottom of the}} shredder. There are four types of screens commonly used. These are single deck disc, double deck disc, tommel <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> rotary <b>screen.</b> These are discussed in paper 82 given by Charles Astafan on Machines Used for Processing Whole Tires at the ACS Rubber Division Meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, in October of 1995. As the tire is reduced in size and the pieces reach their desired size, they are allowed to fall from the shredder. The most common size produced from the shredder is 2 ” x 2 ” and 1 ” x 1 ”. These are then used for further size reduction in cryogenic and ambient grinding into moderately coarse rubber particles. Production of smaller chips is hard on the equipment and shortens tool life. Much of the chips produced from shredding are burned and used as TDF. Another common source of feed material is buffings from the production of other rubber goods, especially tires. These are good materials for use in cracker mill grinding. These commonly vary in size from small pieces 1 / 8 ” to 1 / 4 ” in length down to 4 to 6 mesh if they are produced with a fine grinder rather than a rasp tool. The rasp tool produces the former sizes. In addition some processors of fine material like to start with a 4 to 8 mesh cryogenically ground feed material and then produce 60 to 200 mesh material from this starting point. Various types of <b>screens</b> <b>and</b> <b>separators</b> are used to size the feed material for most efficient production in downstream processing...|$|R

40|$|In this Bureau of Mines investigation, {{production}} was monitored for 1 year at over 30 coalbed gas-drainage boreholes located in Alabama, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Results {{indicate that the}} quality of data gathered from such wells can be improved greatly if potential problems are anticipated and prevented {{in the early stages of}} well production. Major water-monitoring problems include solids buildup, freezing, the presence of gas in surface waterlines, and improper pumping interval settings.

Problems related to measurement of coalbed gas flow include large quantities of water vapor contained in the gas, especially during winter months; freezing and subsequent obstruction of flow; sudden, uncontrolled release of gas pressure; and solids buildup in metering equipment.
