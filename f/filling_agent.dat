The sensitive layer of the microbolometer arrays in question is composed of an electrically conductive polymer composite. Semi-conducting tellurium and vanadium dioxide, as well as metallic silver, are evaluated concerning their suitability as conductive <b>filling</b> <b>agents.</b> The composites with the semi-conducting <b>filling</b> <b>agents</b> display the higher temperature dependence of electrical resistance, while the silver composites exhibit better noise performance. The particle alignment – homogeneous and chain-shaped alike – within the polymer matrix is characterized regarding the composites' electrical properties. For the production of microbolometer arrays, a technology chain is introduced based on established coat-forming and structuring standard technologies from the field of polymer processing, which are suitable for the manufacture of a number of parallel structures. To realize the necessary thermal isolation of the sensitive area, all pixels are realized as self-supporting structures by means of the sacrificial layer method. Exemplarily, 2 × 2 arrays with the three <b>filling</b> <b>agents</b> were manufactured. The resulting sensor responsivities lie in the range of conventional microbolometers. Currently, the comparatively poor thermal isolation of the pixels and the high noise levels are limiting sensor quality.

Homogeneous radiation protective materials of the Abris type were used in the studies, the manufacturing technology for which makes it possible to obtain the required concentrations of <b>filling</b> <b>agents.</b> The attenuating capacity of a radiation protective material with the barite, lead and tungsten concentrations of 20 – 80 % was estimated using high-precision codes. Experimental studies into the protective properties of the Abris material with different concentrations of <b>filling</b> <b>agents</b> were conducted to verify the calculation results. For the experiment, five sources of gamma radiation (60 Co, 58 Co, 198 Au, 54 Mn, 24 Na) with typical radiation energies were generated in the IVV- 2 M research reactor. A dedicated facility and a DKS-AT 1123 measuring device were also used. As the result of an integrated research, calculated dependences of the attenuation factors have been obtained for the radiation produced by typical radiation sources, and for different RPM compositions and thicknesses. This data forms the input for the optimization of radiation protection. The design of the homogeneous RPM composition is highly promising in terms of the approach to radiation protection optimization. As follows from a comparison of the investigation results for the γ-radiation dose attenuation factors for homogeneous protective materials of the Abris type, depending on composition and thickness, the experimental data differs from the values obtained by calculation by not more than 5 %.

Healing of pathological fractures through the femoral neck is a difficult scenario, as we report only one patient (case 6) with a fair outcome. Furthermore, cement is not a biological material and it is strong in compression but relatively weak when subjected to shear and torsion. Hence, its use in lesions involving the head and neck of the femur may result in an increased chance of fractures through cement.|$|E

In 28 % (n = 24) of the cases, patients reported the onset of complications after dental procedures, additional injections with fillers, or other invasive treatments in the facial area. Forty-eight (57 %) patients required invasive treatment. Abscess formation was significantly more frequent in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and facial lipoatrophy (p =. 001). The intrinsic characteristics of the injected filler and the immune status of the patient play important roles in the diversity of time of onset and type of delayed-onset adverse events observed.

40|$|Millions {{of people}} all over the world are granted better vision thanks to a {{seemingly}} magic molecule. The molecule makes it possible to remove the eye’s lens and replace it with an artificial one. Cataracts are the cause of most lens replacements. The disease clouds the lens which in turn blurs vision. Until the early 1980 ’s, lens transplants were a very complicated affair, so much so that many eye surgeons avoided the procedure altogether. The revolutionary events that have taken place since, now allow surgeons to perform a lens transplant in less than 15 minutes, the results of which are successful nearly every single time. This medical breakthrough was made possible by the magic molecule described in this book. The same molecule has also helped to ease ailing knees affected by arthritis. Despite the controversial nature of the molecule’s use in treating arthritis, the fact remains that many of the millions of people treated yearly report significant relief as a result. Furthermore, the molecule’s use in treating joints is not limited to those of humans, but also includes horses. Then working as product manager for the Swedish pharmaceutical company Pharmacia, I was personally involved in introducing Healonid® Vet., a product based on the magic molecule, into the French equestrian market some forty years ago. As if eyes, knees and horses were not enough, the magic molecule has even revolutionized the global beauty industry during the past twenty years. Commonly used as the main ingredient in dermal fillers, the molecule has enabled many of the most successful wrinkle reducing products developed by world leading companies. The magic molecule I speak of is a sugar molecule called hyaluronic acid. The modern term for the molecule is hyaluronan, often shortened HA. For the purposes of this book, the term hyaluronic acid will be used, since this is still the term most frequently used. Hyaluronic acid is found in a number of areas within the human body. In the human skin, hyaluronic acid works as a moisturizing and <b>filling</b> <b>agent.</b> In the human joint it acts as a lubricant and shock absorber. It is also found in the eye and the umbilical cord. Hyaluronic acid is also found in sources outside the human body. The hyaluronic acid described in this book originates from rooster combs or synthetically, through a process of bacterial fermentation. Hyaluronic acid was discovered in 1934 by Karl Meyer and John Palmer, researchers at Columbia University. A Hungarian researcher by the name of Endre Balazs was the first to develop hyaluronic acid for commercial use. In 1943, Balazs received a patent for a method using fluid from knee joints of cows to be used as an egg white substitute in baking. The product itself was not very successful, but Balazs was inspired to search for other commercial uses for hyaluronic acid. In particular, he was eager to discover medical benefits of its use. Endre Balazs is still driven by this eagerness, at 95 years of age. Throughout his career, he has successfully transformed research into practical benefit to an extent that most researchers only dream of...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve total energy {{efficiency}} the use of effective heat insulation materials produced with local raw materials may positively affect domestic economic development. While reviewing such raw materials and resources in Latvia which could be potentially used for heat insulation materials production, there should be focus on peat {{as well as on}} the wood-processing and agriculture by-products. In Latvia the minimum of peat level in bogs is 30 cm, if such layer is thinner, the area is considered a wetland. The chemical variety of peat indicates the potential of the resource, but in the meantime it restricts one to develop a homogenous technology for production of peat base heat insulation materials. In spite of various peats’ advantages - it is mostly uses in two ways – in farming and as a combustible. New types of peat usage may be found by peat activation which improves the existing features of the materials and reveals new ones. It is possible to influence on the specific properties of raw materials by using various types and modes of activation. The activation of raw materials not only opens new possibilities in terms of use of such materials, but also allows using them more efficiently. Mechanically-thermal activation of peat in the planetary ball mill in the water environment was used to obtain peat binder. Such binding agent is ecologically clean and environmentally friendly which is especially important considering the current binding agents available in the heat insulation materials in the market. The extraction of peat binding agent may be implemented not only by activating in planetary ball mills, but also via the use of cavitations’ device (Цыфанский, 2008). Within the research were obtained various insulation building materials: peat glue was used as a binder and agricultural waste - various fraction wood chips, hemp sheaves and peat – as filler, which is not only technically, but also economically more beneficial solution thus the high likeliness of natural raw materials and the low density allows one to produce efficient heat insulation materials. Upon reviewing the information available in literature, composites have been also created in the course of studies conducted by the Scientific construction materials institute of Russia, where a previously mechanically activated peat was used as a binding agent component and planer chips due to the fact that wood is a porous material. (Копаница et al. 2009). As a result of the research it was found that chemically mechanic activation facilitates an intensive reaction between urea and the hydroxide in peat, as well as between the functional carbonyl groups and polysaccharide. It must be noted that the biggest effect was achieved only with high grade peat because it is more saturated with organic compounds any may form various chemical bonds with introduced modifiers. (Саркисов et al. 2008). According to the conducted research, the increase of peat activation duration improves the compression strength of composite material. The observed increasing of compression strength was in the accordance with the results, obtained by other researchers. Produced peat-woodchip/hemp composite material is 100 % recyclable in a form of a <b>filling</b> <b>agent</b> for production of similar materials. A wide use of the obtained material produced fully with locally extracted raw materials, allows solving building and structure energy efficiency issues with the use of Latvia’s internal resources which would generate additional employment and facilitate economic growth. The use of such material shall enable to solve building energy efficiency problems by using only domestic resources. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{sidewall}} core {{samples from}} well 299 -E 24 - 19, which were comprised of {{a mixture of}} bentonite and silt lens material, had an average porewater chloride concentration of 376 mg/L. The sidewall core samples collected from well 299 -E 25 - 46 had calculated porewater chloride concentrations ranging from 1, 200 to more than 10, 000 mg/L. Clearly, the sidewall core samples tested were capable of generating porewaters with sufficient chloride concentrations to cause corrosion of the stainless steel well casing. Furthermore, analysis of the sidewall core samples yielded a clear relationship between chloride concentration and well casing corrosion. The sidewall core samples containing {{the greatest amount of}} chloride, 3000 {micro}g/g of sediment, came from the well that experienced the longest length of casing failure (4. 2 feet in well 299 -E 25 - 46). All of the sidewall core samples tested from both decommissioned wells contained more chloride than the Wyoming bentonite test material. However, since chloride was present as a trace constituent in all of the sidewall core samples (less than 0. 4 weight percent), it is possible {{that it could have been}} introduced to the system as a ''contaminant'' contained in the bentonite backfill material. Therefore, it is likely that chloride leached from the bentonite material and/or chloride carried by/as a constituent of the liquid waste stream caused the advanced well casing corrosion found at wells 299 -E 24 - 19 and 299 -E 25 - 46 via crevice corrosion and stress corrosion cracking. The sample of Enviroplug{trademark} No. 8 high swelling Wyoming bentonite was characterized for its potential to generate porewaters of sufficient chlorinity to lead to accelerated corrosion of type 304 L stainless steel. Overall, the bentonite sample had considerably high water extractable concentrations of sodium, chloride, fluoride, sulfate, and alkalinity (measured as calcium carbonate). Interpretation of the laboratory data indicated that the Wyoming bentonite test sample was capable of generating localized vadose zone porewater with chloride concentrations in excess of 700 mg/L. However, the vadose zone at Hanford is primarily composed of coarse-grained sands with an in-situ moisture content ranging from 5 - 12 %. Therefore, it is doubtful enough moisture will be available throughout the majority of the vadose zone to sufficiently ''wet'' the bentonite and leach chloride from the material. Consequently, Wyoming bentonite material should be suitable as an annulus <b>filling</b> <b>agent</b> in all low-moisture zones and those regions that lack the potential to accumulate perched water. This report contains all the geochemical and selected physical characterization data collected on archived vadose zone sediment recovered during the early 1990 s installation of four RCRA monitoring wells: 299 -E 24 - 19, 299 -E 24 - 20, 299 -E 24 - 22, and 299 -E 25 - 46, sidewall core samples collected during the decommissioning (in 2004) of wells 299 -E 24 - 19 and 299 -E 25 - 46, splitspoon core samples collected during the installation (in 2004) of two RCRA monitoring wells: 299 -E 24 - 33 and 299 -E 25 - 95, a sample of Wyoming bentonite, as well as a perched water sample collected during the installation of well 299 -E 24 - 33. Laboratory tests were conducted to characterize the sediment and to identify water-leachable constituents. Testing consisted primarily of 1 : 1 sediment:water extractions, which were used to calculate the elemental concentrations of water soluble constituents in the solid and to estimate in-situ porewater chloride concentrations. Additionally, 8 M nitric acid extractions and X-ray diffraction analysis of the solids were used to provide a measure of the total leachable sediment content of constituents and to search for the formation of new crystalline phases that may have formed during the corrosion process, respectively...|$|E

The choice of tripoli as a silica component for insulating <b>filling</b> <b>agents</b> on the technology of low temperature foaming is caused by a high content of active silica in the rock, the constancy of the composition and porous structure. The quality (density, strength and thermal conductivity characteristics) of the developed heat insulating crystalline granulated material is comparable to the best foreign models...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionAs osteoclast, giant cell tumors express {{calcitonin}} receptors. The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess treatment using salmon calcitonin after curettage. Material and methodsWe retrospectively reviewed 25 patients with giant cell tumor of the appendicular skeleton treated with a single protocol of calcitonin administration following curettage in order to assess the effectiveness of calcitonin in reducing the rate of local recurrence. ResultsThe mean duration follow-up was 68 months. Thirteen patients (52 %) had local recurrence. Eight of them were treated successfully after repeated curettage and calcitonin. Four patients had bone resection and one patient had curettage and cement filling. All patients with cavity left empty had ossified and the functional score as assessed by the MSTS score was 28. 02 / 30. ConclusionThis study suggests that the use of calcitonin as adjuvant is not effective and that <b>filling</b> <b>agents</b> are not required after curettage of giant cell tumors.
