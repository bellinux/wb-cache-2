25|$|The first clear {{evidence}} of absinthe in the modern sense of a distilled spirit containing <b>green</b> <b>anise</b> and fennel, however, dates to the 18th century. According to popular legend, absinthe began as an all-purpose patent remedy created by Dr. Pierre Ordinaire, a French doctor living in Couvet, Switzerland, around 1792 (the exact date varies by account). Ordinaire's recipe was {{passed on to the}} Henriod sisters of Couvet, who sold absinthe as a medicinal elixir. By other accounts, the Henriod sisters may have been making the elixir before Ordinaire's arrival. In either case, a certain Major Dubied acquired the formula from the sisters and in 1797, and with his son Marcellin and son-in-law Henry-Louis Pernod, opened the first absinthe distillery, Dubied Père et Fils, in Couvet. In 1805, they built a second distillery in Pontarlier, France, under the new company name Maison Pernod Fils. Pernod Fils remained {{one of the most popular}} brands of absinthe up until the drink was banned in France in 1914.|$|E
2500|$|Absinthe is {{traditionally}} prepared from a distillation of neutral alcohol, various herbs, spices and water. Traditional absinthes were redistilled {{from a white}} grape spirit (or eau de vie), while lesser absinthes were more commonly made from alcohol from grain, beets, or potatoes. The principal botanicals are grande wormwood, <b>green</b> <b>anise,</b> and florence fennel, which are often called [...] "the holy trinity." [...] Many other herbs {{may be used as}} well, such as petite wormwood (Artemisia pontica or Roman wormwood), hyssop, melissa, star anise, angelica, peppermint, coriander, and veronica.|$|E
2500|$|Absinthe ( [...] or French: [...] ) is {{historically}} {{described as a}} distilled, highly alcoholic (45–74% ABV / 90–148 U.S. proof) beverage. It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals, including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium ("grand wormwood"), together with <b>green</b> <b>anise,</b> sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs. Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as [...] "" [...] (the green fairy). Although it is sometimes mistakenly {{referred to as a}} liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed.|$|E
40|$|Aspergillus steynii and Aspergillus westerdijkiae are {{the main}} {{ochratoxin}} A (OTA) producing species of Aspergillus section Circumdati. Due to its recent description, few data are available {{about the influence of}} cophysiological factors on their growth and OTA production profiles. In this work, the effect of temperature (20, 24 and 28 ºC) and water activity (aw) (0. 928, 0. 964 and 0. 995) on rowth, sporulation and OTA production by these fungi was examined in CYA and media prepared from paprika, <b>green</b> coffee, <b>anise,</b> grapes, maize and barley. Growth was positively affected by the highest temperature and aw values indicating that both species might be expected in warm climates or storage conditions. However, optimal growth conditions showed differences depending on the medium. OTA production was markedly affected by substrate and showed qualitative and quantitative differences. Both species, especially A. steynii, represent a great potential risk of OTA contamination due to their high production in a variety of conditions and substrates, in particular in barley and paprika-based media. Additionally, neither growth nor sporulation did result good indicators of OTA production by A. steynii or A. westerdijkiae;therefore, specific and highly-sensitive detection methods become essential tools for control strategies to reduce OTA risk by these species...|$|R

50|$|Lucid is {{distilled}} {{entirely from}} all natural ingredients {{and is the}} first genuine absinthe distilled with real Grande Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) available in the United States in more than 95 years. Lucid is made with historically accurate volumes of Grande Wormwood, {{as well as other}} botanicals, such as <b>green</b> <b>anise</b> and sweet fennel that are traditional to the spirit. The recipe was developed by T.A. Breaux, an absinthe expert and historian. Lucid’s green color is derived directly from the botanicals, without any artificial coloring added - a key feature of genuine absinthe. Lucid’s natural color requires a dark bottle because exposure to light will cause the natural color to fade, which explains why so many traditional absinthes were bottled in dark glass.|$|E

5000|$|Pastis {{is often}} {{associated}} with its historical predecessor, absinthe, yet the two are in fact very different. Pastis does not contain grand wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), the herb from which absinthe derives its name. Also, pastis obtains its anise flavor from a distillation (or industrially prepared distillates) of star anise, a herb of Asian origin, whereas absinthe traditionally obtains its base flavor from <b>green</b> <b>anise,</b> a European herb. Furthermore, pastis traditionally exhibits the distinct flavor of licorice root (another herb of Asian origin), which is not a part of a traditional absinthe. Where bottled strength is concerned, traditional absinthes were bottled at 45-74% ABV, while pastis is typically bottled at 40-50% ABV. Finally, unlike a traditional absinthe, pastis is a [...] "liqueur", which means it is always bottled with sugar.|$|E

A case of a 4 -month-old infant with hypertransaminasemia, severe coagulopathy, non ketotic hypoglycemia, moderated metabolic acidosis and neurologic symptoms such as seizures and nistagmus is described.
