5|$|Varner's second monograph, Personhood, <b>Ethics,</b> <b>and</b> Animal Cognition: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare, was {{published}} in 2012 by Oxford University Press. Varner {{had been working on}} questions about R. M. Hare and animals since 2001, when he taught a graduate class exploring the subject; given that Peter Singer was a student of Hare, Varner was interested in exploring whether Hare's philosophy endorsed Singer's conclusions about animal liberation. A project entitled Harey Animals: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare was submitted to Oxford University Press, but this was subsequently split into two books; Personhood, <b>Ethics,</b> <b>and</b> Animal Cognition was the first, while the second, the forthcoming Sustaining Animals: Envisioning Humane, Sustainable Communities, in under contract with the publisher. While Personhood, <b>Ethics,</b> <b>and</b> Animal Cognition addresses theoretical issues in Hare's philosophy, Sustaining Animals is more practically focussed, exploring the applicability of the Harean philosophy developed in Personhood, <b>Ethics,</b> <b>and</b> Animal Cognition to real-world issues concerning human-animal relationships. Varner is also co-authoring a textbook under contract with Cambridge University Press entitled Environmental Ethics for Environmentalists with the University of Guelph ecologist Jonathan Newman and the Guelph philosopher Stefan Linquist.|$|E

5|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the mismanagement behind Enron’s fall {{to a variety}} of ethical and political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation <b>ethics,</b> <b>and</b> get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron’s collapse resulted from the company’s reliance on political lobbying, rent-seeking, and the gaming of regulations.|$|E
5|$|Ethical {{decision-making}} {{is strongly}} emphasized at the school: undergraduate {{students are required}} to complete 14 hours of religion coursework for graduation, all Marriott School students must take at least one course in management <b>ethics,</b> <b>and</b> both students and faculty must commit to abide by the university's honor code. The school also exhibits a unique culture because the majority of its student and faculty bodies are members of the LDS Church.|$|E
5|$|From 2001, Varner {{embarked}} on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. Personhood, <b>Ethics,</b> <b>and</b> Animal Cognition, published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, {{and the lives of}} merely sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial comments were offered in Personhood, <b>Ethics,</b> <b>and</b> Animal Cognition, will be explored in Sustaining Animals, forthcoming with Oxford University Press.|$|E

5|$|In Environmental <b>Ethics</b> <b>and</b> Process Thinking, Palmer {{examines}} whether process philosophy, {{in particular}} the philosophies of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne, can provide an appropriate background for engaging in environmental ethics. Process thought, Clark notes, has frequently appealed more to theologically-inclined environmental ethicists than classical theism; in particular, the views of Hartshorne and Cobb have been influential.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to contextual animal <b>ethics</b> <b>and</b> her exploration {{of animals in}} environmental ethics, Palmer has written on disenhanced animals (i.e., animals that have been engineered to lose certain capacities) and companion animals. The latter topic {{was the focus of}} her co-authored text Companion Animal Ethics, which explores ethical issues concerning companion animals, including feeding, medical care, euthanasia and others.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to writing on process {{approaches to the}} environment, Palmer has contributed to Christian environmental ethics more broadly, urban environmental <b>ethics,</b> <b>and</b> scholarship on the environment {{in the work of}} English writers. Much of her work in environmental ethics has explored questions concerning animals, including the tension between protecting individuals and protecting species.|$|E

5|$|Palmer {{does not}} {{explicitly}} connect Environmental <b>Ethics</b> <b>and</b> Process Thought to Animal Ethics in Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, {{insofar as it}} offers an attempt to bridge environmental <b>ethics</b> <b>and</b> animal ethics. In contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on the ethics of harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal Ethics in Context, about the ethics of aiding animals, {{with a focus on}} the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E

The parts of the game analysed is split in to two main groups: the Abrahamic religion’s position in the <b>ethic</b> <b>and</b> moral dilemmas in question, and how the discussions regarding the <b>ethic</b> <b>and</b> moral-compatible portrayals and thematics in upper-secondary school classroom’s could evolve. I concluded that the video game would be compatible with education in the upper-secondary school, though it’s up to the responsible teacher, regarding the time aspect, and how the teacher would consider the game to be received by pupils...|$|R
