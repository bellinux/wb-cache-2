40|$|The {{replication}} of seven rabies virus strains (CVS, HEP, PV, ERA, WIRAB, CPZ and BOLIVAR) in BHK cells and the inactivation dynamics of these strains by beta-propiolactone, acetylethylenimine, and ethylenimine were studied {{to find the}} most immunogenic strain and the most economic and stable <b>inactivating</b> <b>agent</b> for the production of an inactivated tissue culture rabies vaccine for animal use. The seven strains reached the peak of virus production 3 to 5 days after inoculation of the cell culture; PV yielded the highest virus titer (10 (9) plaque-forming units/ml). The infectivity of virus suspensions containing 10 (7) to 10 (8) plaque-forming units/ 0. 1 ml was inactivated by beta-propiolactone in 0. 5 h, acetylethylenimine in 3. 0 h, and ethylenimine in 1. 0 h. Most of the vaccine lots prepared with the different strains and <b>inactivating</b> <b>agents</b> passed a modified National Institutes of Health potency test. The vaccines prepared with the PV strain had consistently higher antigenic values (equal or better than four) than the other six strains. This difference was highly significant (F 6, 12 = 59. 8), whereas there were no statistically significant differences among the antigenic values of the vaccine lots prepared with the three <b>inactivating</b> <b>agents.</b> Batches of lyophilized and liquid vaccine stored at 4 C maintained potency for over 1 year. Ten dogs vaccinated with a vaccine prepared with the PV strain and inactivated with ethylenimine developed a good antibody response and resisted challenge 60 days after vaccination, while seven of eight nonvaccinated controls died of rabies. This information indicates that an inactivated, stable, economic, and easy-to-prepare rabies vaccine can be produced in BHK cells by using the PV strain and ethylenimine as an <b>inactivating</b> <b>agent...</b>|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} the regulation of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activity in the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles of Xenopus laevis eggs and oocytes. To this end, we developed a method for the small scale extraction of eggs and oocytes and measured MPF activity in extracts by a dilution end point assay. We find that in oocytes, MPF activity appears before germinal vesicle breakdown and then disappears rapidly {{at the end of}} the first meiotic cycle. In the second meiotic cycle, MPF reappears before second metaphase, when maturation arrests. Thus, MPF cycling coincides with the abbreviated cycles of meiosis. When oocytes are induced to mature by low levels of injected MPF, cycloheximide does not prevent the appearance of MPF at high levels in the first cycle. This amplification indicates that an MPF precursor is present in the oocyte and activated by posttranslational means, triggered by the low level of injected MPF. Furthermore, MPF disappears approximately on time in such oocytes, indicating that the agent for MPF inactivation is also activated by posttranslational means. However, in the absence of protein synthesis, MPF never reappears in the second meiotic cycle. Upon fertilization or artificial activation of normal eggs, MPF disappears from the cytoplasm within 8 min. For a period thereafter, the <b>inactivating</b> <b>agent</b> remains able to destroy large amounts of MPF injected into the egg. It loses activity just as endogenous MPF appears at prophase of the first mitotic cycle. The repeated reciprocal cycling of MPF and the <b>inactivating</b> <b>agent</b> during cleavage stages is unaffected by colchicine and nocodazole and therefore does not require the effective completion of spindle formation, mitosis, or cytokinesis. However, MPF appearance is blocked by cycloheximide applied before mitosis; and MPF disappearance is blocked by cytostatic factor. In all these respects, MPF and the <b>inactivating</b> <b>agent</b> seem to be tightly linked to, and perhaps participate in, the cell cycle oscillator previously described for cleaving eggs of Xenopus laevis (Hara, K., P. Tydeman, and M. Kirschner, 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77 : 462 - 466) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: The current {{recommended}} <b>inactivating</b> <b>agent</b> for the rabies virus, beta propiolactone (BPL) is {{very expensive}} and potentially carcinogenic. There {{is a need to}} evaluate alternative chemicals, which will inactivate the virus without affecting its antigenicity. In this study the effect of ascorbic acid on the infectivity of the rabies virus has been investigated. Method: Vero cell grown fixed rabies virus CVS strain was treated with 0. 1 mg/ml, 0. 5 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml final concentrations of ascorbic acid and 5 μg/ml of copper sulfate and kept at 4 °C along with untreated virus material. Each aliquot was titrated after various intervals for viral infectivity using both mice inoculation and titration in vero cells. The antigenicity of the virus material was determined by antibody induction in mice and modified NIH tests in parallel with virus material inactivated with a 1 : 4000 concentration of BPL. Results: An optimal concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml of ascorbic acid and 5 μg/ml of copper sulfate completely inactivated the virus after 72 hours. The inactivated virus retained good antigenicity and potency value, which was comparable with using BPL. Conclusion: These findings suggest that ascorbic acid can be used as an <b>inactivating</b> <b>agent</b> for fixed rabies virus grown in cell culture particularly for the preparation of diagnostic reagents. Further studies are required to evaluate its effect on the cell associated virus, probable therapeutic potential and feasibility of replacing BPL in production of inactivated rabies vaccine...|$|R
