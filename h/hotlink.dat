50|$|Other {{solutions}} usually combine URL rewriting {{with some}} custom complex server side scripting to allow hotlinking {{for a short}} time, or in more complex setups to allow the hotlinking but return an alternative image with reduced quality and size and thus reduce the bandwidth load when requested from a remote server.

40|$|Consider a DAG (directed acyclic graph) G = (V, E) {{representing}} a collection V of web pages connected via links E. All web pages {{can be reached}} from a designated source page, represented by a source node s of G. Each web page carries a weight representative of {{the frequency with which}} it is visited. By adding <b>hotlinks,</b> at most one per page, we are interested in minimizing the expected number of steps needed to visit a selected set of web pages from the source page. For arbitrary DAGs we show that the problem is NP-complete. We also give algorithms for assigning <b>hotlinks,</b> as well as upper and lower bounds on the expected number of steps to reach the leaves from the source page s located {{at the root of the}} tree. Depending on the probability distribution (arbitrary, uniform, Zipf) the expected number of steps is at most c Œî n, where c is a constant less than 1.
