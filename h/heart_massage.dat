The heart usually continues to beat for some minutes after it ceases to affect a mercury manometer, and resuscitation of it within this period by extra-thoracic massage and artificial respiration is sometimes successful. 5. Resuscitation of the <b>heart</b> by direct <b>massage</b> is the most certain method at our command. 6.

40|$|Advanced {{resuscitation}} {{techniques are}} dependent on drug therapy to increase survival. Because drugs must reach their site of action instantaneously, the choice of appropriate route of administration may be critical. To study the pharmacokinetics of drug administration by peripheral and central venous routes during resuscitation, nine mongrel dogs were studied. Arterial blood pressure and electrocardiograms were monitored continuously. Cardiac output was evaluated before resuscitation to determine control levels. After thoracotomy and fibrillation of the <b>heart,</b> cardiac <b>massage</b> was started with a frequency of compression maintained at 60 /min. Bolus injections of two different radioisotopes were given simultaneously through a peripheral and a central vein. Isotope activity was sampled through a catheter in the right femoral artery at 5 second intervals for 90 seconds and at 30 second intervals for 210 seconds. The major {{differences between the two}} routes of administration were that central injection produced a 270 % higher peak concentration (p < 0. 001) and significantly shorter lag times to the first appearance of tracer (16 ± 7 versus 38 ± 13 seconds, p < 0. 05) and times to peak concentration (13 ± 5 versus 27 ± 12 seconds, p < 0. 01). In contrast, {{there were no significant differences}} in area under the time-counts curve, mean residence time, total body clearance and steady state volume of distribution. The central compartment volume of distribution was significantly smaller after central than after peripheral injection (26. 1 ± 56 versus 76. 3 ± 16. 5 ml, p < 0. 01). The therapeutic implications of these findings must be investigated for individual drugs used during cardiorespiratory resuscitation to determine the most appropriate route and dosage for each agent...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 This study {{reports the}} design, construction, and {{evaluation}} of an automatic cardiac massage device and support system. The design incorporates the principle of a cardioplethysmograph operated in reverse, such that pneumatic power fed to the prosthesis will mechanically impart a massaging action to the heart. Basically, the prosthesis is a flexible sac inside a rigid housing which extends from the base to {{the apex of the}} heart. Pulsating pneumatic pressure, fed through an aperture in the outer housing, causes the inner sac to squeeze the intact ventricles resulting in a period corresponding to normal systole. The compression of the ventricles during the automatic massage procedure tends to eject the heart from the prosthesis; therefore, in order to resist this ejection force the prosthesis is firmly secured around the heart by utilizing the pericardium as a support. An attachment ring is sutured to the pericardium near the base of the ventricles, and the prosthesis is sutured to the ring. Thus the forces tending to eject the heart from the prosthesis are resisted by the entire circumference of the pericardium rather than by local sutured areas. Pericardial strength tests were conducted and the results of these studies indicated that this method of securing the prosthesis is feasible. In order to test the prosthesis under actual working conditions, a prosthesis was implanted in a Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and the <b>heart</b> was <b>massaged</b> for one hour; during this time an appreciable arterial pulse was maintained, indicating a successful massaging action. The pericardium showed no signs of stress or fatigue during or after massaging and no lesions or rupture were observed. All indications were that the massaging could have been continued for several hours. On the basis of the results obtained, this method of prosthesis attachment and the prosthesis design were considered to be successful and workable...|$|R
2500|$|Beck {{realized}} that ventricular fibrillation often occurred in hearts that were basically sound and he coined the phrase [...] "Hearts {{too good to}} die." [...] In 1947, Beck accomplished his first successful resuscitation of a 14-year-old boy using open chest massage and internal defibrillation with alternating current. The boy was being operated on for a severe congenital funnel chest. In all other respects the boy was normal. During {{the closure of the}} large incision in the chest, the pulse suddenly stopped and the blood pressure fell to zero. The boy was in cardiac arrest. Dr. Beck immediately reopened the chest and began manual <b>heart</b> <b>massage.</b> As he looked at and felt the heart, he {{realized that}} ventricular fibrillation was present. Massage was continued for 35minutes at which time an electrocardiogram was taken that confirmed the presence of ventricular fibrillation. Another 10minutes passed before the defibrillator was brought to the operating room. The first shock using electrode paddles placed directly {{on the sides of the}} heart was unsuccessful. Beck administered procaine amide, a medicine to stabilize the heart’s rhythm. Beck gave a second shock that wiped out the fibrillation. In a very few seconds a feeble, regular, and fast contraction of the heart occurred. The blood pressure rose from zero to 50millimeters of mercury. Beck noted that the heartbeat remained regular and saw that the pressure slowly began to rise. Twenty minutes after the successful defibrillation, the chest wound was closed. By three hours, the blood pressure rose to a normal level, and the child awoke and was able to answer questions. The boy made a full recovery, with no neurological damage.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Breast {{cancer is}} {{the most common type of}} cancer in females. The effect of massage in the field of {{oncology}} has been investigated to some extent. The present thesis explored the effect of light pressure effleurage massage in women with breast cancer in six main domains; nausea, anxiety, depression, quality of life, stress and cellular immunity. It also described the experience of massage during chemotherapy. 	The effect of light pressure effleurage was investigated on nausea, anxiety and depression in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Five part-body massage treatments were given during chemotherapy infusion. Massage significantly lowered nausea (p= 0. 025) compared with control group. No significant differences were shown between study groups on anxiety and depression. 	The experience of light pressure effleurage during chemotherapy treatment was studied using phenomenology as theoretical framework. The essential meaning of receiving massage during chemotherapy was described as a retreat from the feeling of uneasiness toward chemotherapy. Results revealed five themes: a distraction from the frightening experience, a turn from negative to positive, a sense of relaxation, a confirmation of caring and finally they just felt good. 	The effect of light pressure effleurage on immunity was investigated in women with breast cancer undergoing radiation. Ten part-body massage treatments, 20 minutes duration, were given during three weeks. Main variables were NK (Natural Killer) and T cells. The effect of massage on cortisol, oxytocin, anxiety, depression and quality of life was also studied. We were not able to demonstrate any significant differences between study groups on any of the variables in this study. 	The immediate effect of light pressure effleurage on immunity was also investigated. Patients received one full-body massage, 45 minutes duration. Main variable was NK cells, secondary variables cortisol, blood-pressure and <b>heart</b> rate. <b>Massage</b> treatment had significant effect on NK cell function compared with the control group (p= 0. 03). Furthermore, massage significantly lowered systolic blood-pressure (p= 0. 03) and heart rate (p= 0. 04) compared with the control group. No significant effects were demonstrated on cortisol or diastolic blood-pressure. 	In conclusion, the present thesis demonstrated that light pressure effleurage could be effective in reducing nausea in breast cancer patients during chemotherapy. A single full-body light pressure massage had short term effects on NK cell function, it decreased heart rate and systolic blood pressure significantly compared with visit only. It appears that repeated part-body light pressure massage did not affect cellular immunity during radiation, possibly due to secondary effects of radiation on immunity. Altogether, it might be speculated that the intensity of part-body massage was too low to affect cellular immunity compared with full-body massage. Furthermore, the amount of pressure used might bear impact on results. Patients with breast cancer however, experienced light pressure massage as a retreat from uneasy, unwanted, negative feelings connected with chemotherapy treatment...|$|R

Dr. Beck immediately reopened the chest and began manual <b>heart</b> <b>massage.</b> As he looked at and felt the heart, he {{realized that}} ventricular fibrillation was present. Massage was continued for 35 minutes at which time an electrocardiogram was taken that confirmed the presence of ventricular fibrillation. Another 10 minutes passed before the defibrillator was brought to the operating room. The first shock using electrode paddles placed directly {{on the sides of the}} heart was unsuccessful. Beck administered procaine amide, a medicine to stabilize the heart’s rhythm. Beck gave a second shock that wiped out the fibrillation. In a very few seconds a feeble, regular, and fast contraction of the heart occurred. The blood pressure rose from zero to 50 millimeters of mercury. Beck noted that the heartbeat remained regular and saw that the pressure slowly began to rise. Twenty minutes after the successful defibrillation, the chest wound was closed. By three hours, the blood pressure rose to a normal level, and the child awoke and was able to answer questions. The boy made a full recovery, with no neurological damage.|$|E
40|$|Pregnant {{women are}} exposed to an {{increased}} risk for developing pulmonary embolism (PE), a main cause for maternal mortality. Surgical pulmonary embolectomy is one important therapeutic and potential life-saving armamentarium, considering pregnancy as a relative contraindication for thrombolysis. We present {{a case of a}} 36 -year-old woman with massive bilateral PE after emergent caesarean delivery, requiring reanimation by external <b>heart</b> <b>massage.</b> The onset of massive intrauterine bleeding contraindicated thrombolysis and emergency surgical pulmonary embolectomy, followed by a hysterectomy, were preformed successfully. Acute surgical pulmonary embolectomy may be an option in critically diseased high-risk patients, requiring a multiteam approach, and {{should be part of the}} therapeutic armamentarium of the attending cardiac surgeon...|$|E
