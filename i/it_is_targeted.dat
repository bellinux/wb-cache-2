5|$|Hobgood et al. {{argue that}} one key {{component}} in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems {{is to identify}} the aspects of training that are essential for health care providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues, even if countries have very different needs and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to {{the specific needs of}} the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{receiving}} a pro-mitotic extracellular signal, G1 cyclin-CDK complexes become active {{to prepare the}} cell for S phase, promoting the expression of transcription factors that in turn promote the expression of S cyclins and of enzymes required for DNA replication. The G1 cyclin-CDK complexes also promote the degradation of molecules that function as S phase inhibitors by targeting them for ubiquitination. Once a protein has been ubiquitinated, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> for proteolytic degradation by the proteasome. However, results from {{a recent study of}} E2F transcriptional dynamics at the single-cell level argue that the role of G1 cyclin-CDK activities, in particular cyclin D-CDK4/6, is to tune the timing rather than the commitment of cell cycle entry.|$|E
25|$|The psy and crtI genes were {{transferred}} into the rice nuclear genome and {{placed under the}} control of an endosperm-specific promoter, so that they are only expressed in the endosperm. The exogenous lcy gene has a transit peptide sequence attached, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> to the plastid, where geranylgeranyl diphosphate is formed. The bacterial crtI gene was an important inclusion to complete the pathway, since it can catalyze multiple steps in the synthesis of carotenoids up to lycopene, while these steps require more than one enzyme in plants. The end product of the engineered pathway is lycopene, but if the plant accumulated lycopene, the rice would be red. Recent analysis has shown the plant's endogenous enzymes process the lycopene to beta-carotene in the endosperm, giving the rice the distinctive yellow color for which it is named. The original golden rice was called SGR1, and under greenhouse conditions it produced 1.6µg/g of carotenoids.|$|E
25|$|In Xenopus oocytes, β-catenin is {{initially}} equally localized to all {{regions of the}} egg, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> for ubiquitination and degradation by the β-catenin destruction complex. Fertilization of the egg causes a rotation of the outer cortical layers, moving clusters of the Frizzled and Dsh proteins closer to the equatorial region. β-catenin will be enriched locally {{under the influence of}} Wnt signaling pathway in the cells that inherit this portion of the cytoplasm. It will eventually translocate to the nucleus to bind TCF3 in order to activate several genes that induce dorsal cell characteristics. This signaling results in a region of cells known as the grey crescent, which is a classical organizer of embryonic development. If this region is surgically removed from the embryo, gastrulation does not occur at all. β-Catenin also plays {{a crucial role in the}} induction of the blastopore lip, which in turn initiates gastrulation. Inhibition of GSK-3 translation by injection of antisense mRNA may cause a second blastopore and a superfluous body axis to form. A similar effect can result from the overexpression of β-catenin.|$|E

500|$|Harmless to humans, the whiskery shark is fished commercially for its meat, {{which is}} sold fresh. It {{is one of}} the shark species marketed as [...] "flake". Along with the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and the gummy shark (Mustelus antarcticus), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> by a shark fishery {{operating}} off Western Australia, currently managed as the Western Australian Joint Authority Southern Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Fishery. The fishery began in the 1940s with a small number of demersal longline vessels, though the whiskery shark was not caught in substantial numbers until the 1970s, with the introduction of monofilament gillnets, hydraulic net haulers, and additional vessels. Catches peaked in the early 1980s, when 400–600 tons were taken annually. Overfishing reduced the population to <30% of pre-exploitation levels by the mid-1980s, prompting the Western Australian government to enact a management plan that stabilized the population at 25–30% of pre-exploitation levels.|$|E
500|$|Since 1996, the Moupin pika {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it is a}} {{widespread}} species and its population is not known to be suffering a serious decline. Although its current population trend is unclear, it is common throughout its distribution. It experiences a threat from habitat destruction due to small-scale deforestration of bamboo and Rhododendron woodlands, and grazing by livestock. Due to destruction of habitat, the Sikkim pika may be endangered, but the other forms {{do not appear to be}} threatened according to IUCN. The Red List of China's Vertebrates also lists the Moupin pika as a species of least concern. It occurs in the protected areas of the Changshanerhai,Jiuzhaigou,Nujiang, Wanglang, Wawushan, Wolong, and Zhumulangmafeng Nature Reserves. However, deforestation may pose a threat throughout its range in southern China. It occurs extremely rarely in northeastern India. It has also been stated that almost all of its habitat in India has been destroyed, locally making it [...] "critically endangered."

2500|$|During the Al-Aqsa Intifada in 2003, the Knesset made a {{temporary}} {{amendment to the}} Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law which prohibited Palestinians married to Israelis from gaining Israeli citizenship or residency. Critics argue {{that the law is}} racist because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> at Israeli Arabs who {{are far more likely to}} have Palestinian spouses than other Israelis; defenders say the law is aimed at preventing terrorist attacks and preserving the Jewish character of Israel. [...] The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination unanimously approved a resolution saying that the Israeli law violated an international human rights treaty against racism. The Israeli Ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Yaakov Levy, said the resolution was [...] "highly politicized", citing the committee's failure to grant Israel's request to present evidence of the [...] "legislation's compliance with existing international law and practice", examples of [...] "numerous concrete instances [...] granting of a legal status to Palestinian spouses of Israeli residents [...] abused by Palestinian residents of the territories for suicide terrorism", and also ignoring the fact that at the time of the UN resolution the matter was under review by the Israeli High Court of Justice.|$|E
2500|$|ATK and DEF points: These {{are short}} for [...] "attack" [...] and [...] "defense", and {{determine}} {{the result of a}} battle between two monster cards (see more about attacking below). When a monster is involved in a battle while in Attack Position (whether attacking or being attacked), only its ATK points are applied and its DEF points are ignored. The reverse is also true: when a monster is attacked while in Defense Position, only its DEF points are applied and its ATK points are ignored. Monsters summoned in Defense position are placed face down unless otherwise stated (for example, monsters that are special summoned from the Extra Deck in Defense position are summoned face up), and remain face down until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> by an opponent's monster or changed into Attack position. This is known as [...] "flip summoning", which can activate effects in certain monsters. During the Main Phases of each turn, players can choose to change the battle position of their monsters that were not summoned that turn, unless that monster has already changed its battle position that turn or has already declared an attack. Unlike monsters of other categories, Link Monsters have no DEF points listed and can not be placed in Defense Position.|$|E
