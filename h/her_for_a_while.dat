5|$|Abi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she {{has plans}} of her own. The {{launderette}} closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is {{too busy to}} visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her now-deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children {{that they are in}} heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an appropriate way to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns {{but it turns out that}} he's only back for his son. Dot's step granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> but moves out with Dot's blessing. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but is left upset when Charlie leaves to go back to Ireland with Mathew, also upsetting Jack. Dot and Jack are unaware this is part of Max Branning's (Jake Wood) evil revenge for his false imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|By 1859, his illnesses, his {{long-term}} use of laudanum, his life {{of stress and}} poverty had taken a toll and Baudelaire had aged noticeably. But at last, his mother relented and agreed to let him live with <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> at Honfleur. Baudelaire was productive and at peace in the seaside town, his poem Le Voyage being one example of his efforts during that time. In 1860, he became an ardent supporter of Richard Wagner.|$|E
25|$|Several weeks later, {{she runs}} away from Fatboy's house without warning, {{returning}} to Walford and {{spending the night}} at Shirley's flat. Leon and Fatboy track her down and she apologises for disappearing. Shirley decides to let her stay with <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and attempts to get Zsa Zsa into a local school. This fails, so she asks Phil for a favour, and he speaks to the headmaster Mr Allcock (Bill Buckhurst). Shirley tells Zsa Zsa she has an appointment with Mr Allcock {{but she is not}} interested until she sees him and takes a liking to him. She befriends Whitney and gives her relationship advice. Mr Allcock visits and Zsa Zsa flirts with him, but she gets a place in the school due to Phil's intervention. Zsa Zsa receives a letter from her mother asking her to join her in Spain, but she does not want to go, so tries to prove she is useful by babysitting Shirley's housemate Heather Trott's (Cheryl Fergison) baby George and saying it is a shame after Shirley went to all the trouble to get her into school. Shirley acts like she does not care if Zsa Zsa stays or goes but after she tears up Tina's letter, she lets on to Heather that she would have missed Zsa Zsa.|$|E

500|$|In 1936, {{she became}} the {{youngest}} pupil to graduate from the Guildhall School of Music at the time, and the following year she won the Dawn Beauty Competition, winning £50. As she matured into a young woman, O'Hara, like many actresses, became increasingly self-conscious, which affected <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> In one performance, which was watched by her father {{from the back of}} the theatre, O'Hara [...] "sensed there was someone out front watching me, perhaps critically. My arms felt like lead. I gave a rotten show that night. I grew up with the terrible feeling that I was being laughed at".|$|E
500|$|Born 15 March 2000, Flower {{became the}} fearless and {{formidable}} {{leader of the}} Whiskers in 2002. During {{the course of the}} series, Flower gave birth to numerous litters of pups, and is believed to have delivered 70 pups over the course of her lifetime. As the dominant female, Flower had the right to kill any pups born to other females in the group, but she did not exercise that right when her daughters, Tosca and Mozart, had pups at the same time early in the first series. [...] Seven weeks after the pups were born, however, she evicted both daughters and forced them to leave their pups behind. [...] (Tosca later died on her own, after Carlos of the Lazuli group had joined up with <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.)</b> Flower allowed Mozart back into the group, but evicted her permanently after two more temporary evictions during the first and second series. [...] Twice, Flower initiated burrow moves that would force a female who had given birth to choose between their new pups or their family. [...] Flower's daughter, Daisy, left her pups to die and rejoined her family, while Mozart accepted eviction and being alone to stay with her pups.|$|E
500|$|While he {{was still}} on bail on 16 February 1990, during his third {{interview}} with police, Webster admitted to killing Leigh. In the interview transcript, Webster initially denied killing Leigh, then [...] "without being asked a further question" [...] he stated, [...] "Well, I did it. But I just can't believe ... it happened. It's just unbelievable." [...] Webster went on to state that he saw Leigh while {{he was looking for}} his stash of beers. According to Webster, they walked to the saltbushes together, where he pulled off her clothes and stuck a finger in her vagina. Webster stated he lost his temper when Leigh rebuffed him, choking <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> before killing her with a rock, specifically saying he killed Leigh because he [...] "thought she would squeal on [...] for trying to rape her". After spending the weekend in a police cell, Webster appeared in court on 19 February where he was refused bail. On 21 March, while in custody, Webster was convicted and fined $250 for offensive behaviour in the 28 January assault. On 17 July Shearman was given a 12-month good behaviour bond for the 31 January assault; the judge did not record a conviction, taking into consideration that he had been provoked into attacking Wilson.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{leaving the}} Normal School of Science, Wells was {{left without a}} source of income. His aunt Mary—his father's sister-in-law—invited him to stay with <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> which solved his {{immediate}} problem of accommodation. During his stay at his aunt's residence, he grew increasingly interested in her daughter, Isabel. He would later go on to court her. To earn money he began writing short humorous articles for journals such as The Pall Mall Gazette, later collecting these in volume form as Select Conversations with an Uncle (1895) and Certain Personal Matters (1897). So prolific did Wells become at this mode of journalism {{that many of his}} early pieces remain unidentified. According to David C Smith, [...] "Most of Wells's occasional pieces have not been collected, and many have not even been identified as his. Wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so ... As a result, many of his early pieces are unknown. It obvious that many early Wells items have been lost." [...] His success with these shorter pieces encouraged him to write book-length work, and he published his first novel, The Time Machine, in 1895.|$|E
2500|$|A {{similar case}} {{involved}} Clive Wearing, an accomplished musicologist who contracted a cold sore virus that attacked his brain, causing herpes simplex encephalitis. As a result, Wearing developed both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, {{so he has}} little memory of what happened before the virus struck him in 1985, and cannot learn new declarative knowledge after the virus struck him either. As a result of anterograde amnesia, Wearing repeatedly [...] "wakes up" [...] every day usually in 30-second intervals. [...] He {{has a history of}} repeatedly recording these moments of waking up in his journal (e.g., On Sept 2, 2013 I woke up, etc. etc.) and crossing out prior entries, as if the other moments of waking up were not real. [...] His episodic memory is nonfunctional (so he does not consciously recall having woken up 30 seconds prior). [...] Clive is often elated to see his wife, as if he has not seen <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> [...] Despite this, however, Wearing maintained his ability to play the piano and conduct choirs. This case is significant because it demonstrates declarative and procedural memory are separate. Therefore, despite anterograde amnesia preventing Wearing from learning new bits of information that can be explained in words (declarative memory), and also preventing him from storing new memories of events or episodes (also part of declarative memory), he has little trouble in retaining his musical abilities (procedural memory), though he has no conscious memory of having learned music.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Brand walked beside <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> in silence; Gertrude {{wished he}} would go away. [...] "He is {{certainly}} very accomplished. But I think I ought to advise you." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{songwriter}} {{promised to}} let the idea stew in <b>her</b> head <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> And soon, she remembered, the lyrics tumbled onto the page. [...] "The song just started singing. It sort of wrote itself..." ...|$|R
60|$|Then their spokesman, {{an old man}} of high rank, with a {{withered}} hand, {{stepped forward}} from the line of his companions, stared at <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and saluted again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if your devotion is hurtful to her?" [...] he asked. [...] "Send {{some one}} else to <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Any one {{can take care of}} her for a few hours." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{they went}} into the drawing-room Challoner sat talking with <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and then she was asked to sing. An hour passed before Blake had an {{opportunity}} for exchanging a word with her.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Deringham {{went on with}} <b>her</b> {{embroidery}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>While,</b> {{and then}} glanced at the man again. [...] "I wonder {{if any of them}} were connected with the sale of Townshead's ranch?" [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|George {{followed}} <b>her,</b> but <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> he {{was conscious}} of a certain restraint, which he fancied was shared by Bland. It was difficult to talk about indifferent subjects, and he took out some papers.|$|R
50|$|At the funeral, Jackie {{refuses to}} leave Monique’s resting place just yet so Eli leaves <b>her</b> alone <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Eli then bumps into his {{father-in-law}} who swears {{that he and}} Mateo will pay for his wife’s death.|$|R
60|$|Grisel {{had taken}} her brother's place, with a little pile of {{needlework}} {{beside her on the}} grass, when Lawford again opened his eyes under the rosy shade of a parasol. He watched <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> without speaking.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{does n't}} hear from us. My mother used to write to <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> after she left Europe, but she has given it up." [...] She paused a moment, and then she added--"Blanche is too silly!" ...|$|E
60|$|Aladdin comforted her, {{and left}} <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> He changed clothes {{with the first}} person he met in the town, and having bought a certain powder {{returned}} to the princess, who let him in by a little side door.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Merchison {{stared at}} <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while,</b> and indeed {{when she was}} angry Jane was {{beautiful}} enough to make any one stare, then he said simply, [...] "Oh, indeed. I don't meddle with politics, so I didn't know." ...|$|R
50|$|In April 2003, Connecticut {{surfaced}} {{through the}} Arctic ice at the University of Washingtons Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station (APLIS). While there, she {{came under attack}} by a polar bear, which gnawed on <b>her</b> rudder <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> before disengaging.|$|R

6000|$|... "That," [...] {{said the}} lady, [...] "is just the point. You would {{naturally}} prefer {{him to be}} an eligible person. Now, {{if you let me}} have <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> I could promise that she would meet nobody who didn't answer that description." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{recovered}} herself immediately, {{and made}} no further demonstration of the kind.
