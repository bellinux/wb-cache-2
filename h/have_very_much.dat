5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Noel Lee wanted {{to improve the}} sound quality from his home audio equipment. He didn't <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> money, so Lee experimented with ways to create a better sound by {{improving}} inexpensive cabling. At first he worked out of his family's apartment and later in his in-laws' garage, which they rented from family after moving to the Richmond district in 1978. Lee experimented with different widths, winding methods, and qualities of copper and insulation in audio cables to find {{an alternative to the}} zip cord audio vendors gave out for free. He compared different wire constructs, while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.|$|E
25|$|With La jeunesse de Spirou (1987), Tome and Janry set out {{to imagine}} Spirou's youth. This idea was later {{developed}} into a spin-off series, Le Petit Spirou ("Young Spirou"), which details the antics of the character as an elementary school boy. A lot of the gags center around the character's interest in the opposite sex. It is generally acknowledged, however, that the Petit Spirou doesn't <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in common, psychologically speaking, with the adult character.|$|E
500|$|It {{took about}} six weeks to write the Blood Beast script. It was written under the working title Creature from Galaxy 27, which was {{conceived}} by Varno, but the Corman brothers later changed it to Night of the Blood Beast. Gene Corman received film credit for conceiving the film's story, but Varno claimed he wrote the film almost entirely himself and that Corman {{had little to do}} with the story: [...] "He had some rambling ideas but they didn't <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to do with the movie that became Night of the Blood Beast." [...] Varno also said of him: [...] "Gene didn't open his mouth, really, until Roger told him he could." [...] Varno said he wrote the screenplay alone and showed parts of it to Roger and Gene Corman as he went along. Varno researched medical and aerospace technology at a library in Hollywood near Vine Street. The story, which fictionally portrays America's manned voyage into space, was heavily influenced by the real life Space Race ongoing between the United States and Soviet Union at the time. Gene Corman said another major inspiration was The Thing from Another World (1951), a Howard Hawks-directed science fiction film about a group of soldiers and scientists threatened by an alien creature in a remote Arctic research outpost. He said of the film, [...] "How could you not be ? We had to be, if only indirectly or subconsciously. That was a classic film then, a classic film today." [...] However, Varno said any influence from The Thing was only subconscious: [...] "I loved some of the scenes in The Thing and I'm sure that crept in one way or another, but not overtly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{writers were}} more {{critical}} on the character. Nicoletta Browne of THEM Anime Reviews found him [...] "a frustrating protagonist" [...] {{based on his}} fits of rage often seen as childish. Elliot Gray from Japanator called him a [...] "typical shonen manga lead" [...] based on some of his cliche traits and instead found Mikasa and Armin more appealing. Similarly, Anna Neatrour from Manga Bookshelf called him a [...] "fairly typical brash and opinionated shonen hero" [...] and considered the manga design of the humans to be [...] "drawn stiffly and not in proportion. For {{much of the time}} Eren and his comrades are yelling at each other, with facial expressions that don’t <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> variation". On the other hand, Justin Wu from The Artifice saw Eren's hotheadness as a positive trait of the character. Chapman found Papenbrook's child Eren forced but noted his performance once the character grew up was far better.|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{evidence}} that the boat's men had known {{they had been in}} trouble was presented to the local county coroner. [...] Men searching the Ottawa County beaches for bodies found a bobbing, splintered plank or piece of board siding. On the wood was written, with pencil, a note: [...] "Worst storm I have ever been in. [...] Can’t stay up much longer. [...] Hope to God we are saved. A.L.A." [...] Albert L. Anderson was the ship's captain. [...] The note was treated as evidence by many, and deprecated by others. [...] Skeptics said that the ship's master, a man with forty years' experience on the Great Lakes (and thirty of them with captain's papers), would have been likely to try to write down the exact time the note was written, the condition of the boat at the time of writing, and the location of the boat as it labored through its final moments. [...] In any case, the coroner's inquiry into the vessel's sinking - which would <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> liked to have had this information - did not have it. [...] At the inquest, held September 24 in Grand Haven, the coroner's jury was forced to conclude that the lost boat had sunk for unknown reasons at an unknown location.|$|E
