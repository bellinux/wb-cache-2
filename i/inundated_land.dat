It is situated between the seasonally <b>inundated</b> <b>land</b> of the river bank called Gerif (جرف) and the traditional [...] "waterwheel land" [...] called Saqiah (ساقية).Date palm trees and Doum palms (Hyphaene thebaica) are perfectly adapted to the regional climate of Dar al-Manasir. They are drought resistant and can withstand the exceptionally hot dry and rainless summers and cold dry winters. The proximity of Ashu land to the river Nile makes the water table accessible to the deeply penetrating roots of fully grown palm trees throughout the year, making it the most valuable class of land. Since dates constitute the most relevant cash crop in Dar al-Manasir their cultivation is not limited to Ashu land only, but expands along the irrigation channels of the Saqiah land. During recent years date trees even substitute seasonally irrigated crops such as wheat, beans and okra on the traditional Saqiah land.|$|E
40|$|The {{changing}} {{spatial and}} temporal patterns in land use/land cover surrounding Zandvlei estuary were investigated over the period 1944 to 2005. Changes in the extent of four terrestrial and two aquatic land use/land cover categories were mapped from high quality aerial photographs using ArcView GIS. Basic spatial analyses were performed to quantify changes in area, 'edge-effects' and relative dominance through time. Semi-natural and seasonally inundated classes accounted for over 70 % of land cover in 1944, but declined steadily as urban land use and permanently <b>inundated</b> <b>land</b> cover expanded to a present-day extent of 42 % and 19 % respectively. The following major drivers of change were identified: 1) {{the construction of the}} railway embankment bisecting Westlake wetland and Zandvlei estuary, which led to sedimentation and a change in plant species composition of the wetland, but decreased nutrient inflows into the vlei; 2) agricultural practices within the catchment {{at the start of the}} 20 th century which increased sediment and nutrient inflows; 3) elevated water levels due to dredging operations between 1947 and 1961, which resulted in a significant loss of seasonally <b>inundated</b> <b>land</b> cover with concomitant changes in species composition and nutrient dynamics; and 4) urban development surrounding the vlei (with particular reference to Marina da Gama), which has expanded at the expense of semi-natural areas and significantly increased effluent and litter inputs into the vlei.

An earlier study in 1975 predicted that a failure of Folsom Dam alone would result in over 250,000 deaths.

The results obtained by sequential extraction {{before and after the}} simulation experiment were compared {{in order to determine the}} substrates of the heavy metals in <b>inundated</b> <b>land</b> and to evaluate their mobility. Samples of various soils were collected from the region of the future accumulation Lake Bogovina (Serbia) and analysed for ten elements using AAS, GFAAS and ICP. Investigation of the nature of the association of heavy metals and the identification of their substrates were provided by a five-step sequential extraction. Correlation analysis was used as a method for the determination of the substrates for heavy metals. The good correlation among the microelements and certain macroelements indicated the substrates of the microelements. Manganese and iron had a good correlation with most of the microelements. Calcium had only a few correlations with some microelements. Some elements, such as nickel and cadmium, had one substrate before and another after the simulation experiment...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s managed realignment, where {{formerly}} reclaimed land is re-exposed to tidal inundation through breaching of coastal embankments, has been increasingly used throughout Northern Europe {{as a cost}} effective and sustainable response to biodiversity loss and flood management. This study aimed to evaluate the success of managed realignment schemes that resulted in salt-marsh development {{for the restoration of}} spider assemblages. Restoration of saltmarsh fauna was studied by comparing ground-active spiders between recently <b>inundated</b> <b>land</b> (3 – 14 years old) and pairmatched, adjacent natural salt marshes. Natural reference salt marshes were characterized by a relatively low species richness, the dominance of late-successional stage species such as Pirata piraticus (Clerck 1757), and the presence of species preferring a closed vegetation canopy like Arctosa fulvolineata (Lucas 1846) and Pardosa nigriceps (Thorell 1856). Restored habitats were characterized by greater species richness than in reference habitat and by the presence of halophilic species (Enoplognatha mordax (Thorell 1875) and Erigone longipalpis (Sundevall 1830)) and abundance of Pardosa purbeckensis (Westring 1861). These preliminary results argue for maintaining a maximum of successional stages in salt marshes, as they increase the diversity of halophilic spider...|$|E
40|$|The {{fishing method}} of trawling, or dragging, {{has long been}} shown to be harmful to a plethora of sea life inhabiting the world?s oceans and inland waterways. Fishing nets scour the seabed, {{disturbing}} everything in their path, while usually in search of only one type of bottom-dwelling species. Impacts to the seafloor include a removal of topographic features, disturbance of the upper sediment layers, including deep furrows, as well as physical and chemical changes to sediment morphology. While biological organisms and communities can potentially recover from this destruction, archaeological data cannot. Fishermen have been raising important artifacts in their nets for over a century. These finds have helped archaeologists locate significant sites, but they also have the adverse effect of irreparably damaging these sites. This thesis explores the impacts of bottom trawling on underwater cultural heritage. The methods and gear used by trawlers and their documented effects upon the sea floor are identified. Examples of the types of damage shipwreck sites receive after being impacted by trawling are presented. Instances where fishermen have raised prehistoric artifacts from <b>inundated</b> <b>land</b> sites are also introduced. The fishing and archaeological communities must cooperate to limit further damage to underwater cultural heritage around the globe...|$|E
30|$|Even {{the concept}} of a “soft” path is not new to {{engineers}} and was realized for a long time by designing the infrastructures for different flood reoccurrence frequencies. Establishing flood re-occurrence metrics from river flow observations served as a basis for differentiated flood protection. Water managers would rarely deploy the same level of efforts to prevent floods along the full length of the river, but put more emphasis on areas that have high values (human settlements, industrial developments, etc.) and possibly allow flooding less important areas (agricultural lands, forests, etc.). Engineers were taught to leave areas less protected for the very reason that wetland rehabilitation intends to achieve. One could question not only the difference between using the “ecosystem services” of wetlands versus accepting flood damages over less valued land cover types such as croplands, but the notion that flood mitigation is primarily an “ecosystem service” in the first place. Wetlands store water just as any other inundation and the primary mechanism is rather the abiotic planetary service of spreading water over the <b>inundated</b> <b>land</b> and hence reducing flooding levels. Forested wetlands might evaporate more water over longer periods of time, but that has less impact on the rapid raising phase of flooding although they can slow down and attenuate floods due to log jamming and debris flow.|$|E

Obviously, the way in which water is managed has changed considera-bly over the time that human beings started intervening in its natural course.

The flood water was held until the fertile sediment had settled before the surplus was returned to the watercourse. There is evidence of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhet III in the twelfth dynasty (about 1800 BCE) using the natural lake of the Faiyum Oasis as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry seasons. The lake swelled annually from flooding of the Nile.The Ancient Nubians developed a form of irrigation by using a waterwheel-like device called a sakia.
