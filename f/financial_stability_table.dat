Our data source is a new, richer and updated dataset The Global Financial Development Database available at World Bank. Due to the specifics of this dataset we are able to use new combinations of measures of <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> and of bank competition and to study their relationship in greater depth. We find a positive link between <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> and bank competition. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that it matters what measures of <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> and bank competition we apply.

40|$|This {{research}} analyses {{central bank}} communication on <b>financial</b> <b>stability.</b> First, most important international comparable {{features of the}} communication are identified, such as <b>Financial</b> <b>Stability</b> Reports, Stress tests, Financial soundness indicators, etc. These are then used {{for the construction of}} <b>Financial</b> <b>stability</b> transparency index (FST index) for 110 countries from 2000 to 2011.

In particular, the level of transparency towards <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> depends most on monetary policy transparency, size and development of the economy. Finally, the impact of <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> transparency on <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> is under investigation.

40|$|The ECB {{has been}} arguing {{in the past}} that since there is no {{trade-off}} between price <b>stability</b> and <b>financial</b> <b>stability,</b> the pursuit of price stability is the best a central bank can do to also maintain <b>financial</b> <b>stability.</b> We argue that there is a potential trade-off between price <b>stability</b> and <b>financial</b> <b>stability.</b> In order to make this trade-off less constraining we propose that the two-pillar strategy of the ECB should be reformed.

40|$|The {{literature}} on <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> {{in the context}} of South Asian economies is limited. The current research is an attempt to fill this gap by making some contribution to the research in this area. The objective of this research is to explore the determinants of <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> and its consequences on South Asian economies over the period 1980 - 2012. For this purpose, an aggregate <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> (AFSI) index which describe the financial condition of South Asian economies is constructed and computed. The constructed aggregate index successfully captures the period of Asian financial crisis and financial disturbances in USA. It employs both time-series and panel data econometric techniques to estimate the targeted research objectives. In evaluating the relationship between macroeconomic environment and <b>financial</b> <b>stability,</b> the results suggest that high economic growth rate, low level of inflation, balanced in the external flow of goods and services and the inflow of foreign direct investment are among the factors that determine <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> in South Asian economies. Further, the assessment of the relationship between economic integration, financial integration and <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> show that the process of economic integration and financial integration are not helpful for increasing <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> in South Asia.
