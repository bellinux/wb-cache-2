40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} about the microstructuring of {{polyimide}} foils for the fabrication of <b>embossing</b> masters for rotary hot <b>embossing</b> processes. The polyimide masters are fabricated by structuring of a commercial polyimide foil with standard microfabricationtechniques such as photolithography and dry etching.

Two <b>embossing</b> moulds with thicknesses of 260 μm (thin) and 500 μm (thick) made of Al 6061 -T 6 are fabricated using micro-milling process. The thin and thick moulds subsequently {{will be used for}} hot roller <b>embossing</b> process and conventional hot <b>embossing</b> process respectively to produce PMMA microfluidic devices. The performance of the micro-milled thin <b>embossing</b> mould in the hot roller <b>embossing</b> process will be compared with the thick mould used in hot <b>embossing</b> process.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} work, {{a constant}} temperature <b>embossing</b> process {{was developed and}} investigated. By softening and crystallizing a supercooled polymer at the same temperature, the <b>embossing</b> and solidification stages {{can be carried out}} isothermally without thermal cycling. The new process was demonstrated for replicating rectangular trenches with different aspect ratio for two different polymers PET and PEEK. The raw materials were characterized for their thermal and rheological properties to determine the processing parameters. The polymers were also characterized by a modified tensile testing apparatus to determine the tensile properties of the film during <b>embossing.</b> The processing parameters including <b>embossing</b> temperature, <b>embossing</b> pressure and <b>embossing</b> time were varied based on the material properties and optimized. A semi-empirical model was established to correlate the crystallizing kinetics of the materials to the change in rheological properties during <b>embossing.</b> The model was used as a tool to predict the rheological properties of the polymer at conditions where experimental determination is difficult. Finally, <b>embossing</b> simulations with the semi-empirical rheological model were conducted to study the unique process dynamics of constant-temperature <b>embossing</b> and verify some experimental findings. Different cases of constant-temperature <b>embossing</b> involving low to high rates of crystallization were simulated and compared with the conventional <b>embossing</b> process.

To overcome these limitations, three new technical approaches two-station <b>embossing,</b> rubber-assisted <b>embossing,</b> and through-thickness <b>embossing</b> were developed and investigated.

40|$|The micro <b>embossing</b> {{process on}} {{polymethylmethacrylate}} (PMMA) is demonstrated experimentally to {{be a useful}} process to produce micro fluidic and optical devices. Because this process is a one step thermoplastic deformation process, {{it is possible to}} reach high production rates and low cost in manufacturing compared to the standard clean room processes. Currently, the research about this process is still on the feasibility level, with not a quantitative work to optimize the process parameters and assure product quality. In this thesis, an experimental study on process window and variation of Micro <b>Embossing</b> is presented. This study includes the design and manufacturing of an <b>embossing</b> die, the development of an <b>embossing</b> product quality assessment protocol, the process window characterization and the process variation identification. The research results based on the experimental set up in this thesis show that we should apply constant 800 N <b>embossing</b> force at an <b>embossing</b> velocity of 1000 N/min in order to obtain well formed parts to maintain low process cycle time. (cont.) An <b>embossing</b> temperature of 120 °C and de-embossing temperature of 55 °C are shown to be the optimal <b>embossing</b> condition to yield good replication and repeatability.

40|$|The microstructures were {{fabricated}} by hot <b>embossing</b> method using biodegradable material PLGA poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), {{to serve}} as the drug carriers in the drug delivery system. The <b>embossing</b> process was studied in a combination of simulations and experiments. Firstly, the viscoelastic model of PLGA was built after testing the material properties. Secondly, the hot <b>embossing</b> process was simulated by ABAQUS finite element software. The deformation rules of PLGA during hot <b>embossing</b> were then achieved. The pressures inside the PLGA materials were different at various places during hot <b>embossing,</b> which lead to the differences of the filling speeds. As a result, the inner structures were easier to get formed than the outer structures. And the fluidity of PGLA would increase with the raising temperature, which however caused serious material overflow. Finally the hot <b>embossing</b> experiments were presented to verify the simulation results. Agreed with the filling rules of the simulation, enough duration was necessary to let the outer corners of the microstructures be formed completely. Moreover the trapped air in the grooves was compressed into small bubbles at the corners.
