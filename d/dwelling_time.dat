30|$|The {{major part}} of {{performed}} works about capacity {{does not take into}} account uncertainty related to <b>dwelling</b> <b>times,</b> although there are some exceptions. In [18], dwell time variability is considered by gathering real-world data to calculate the conflict probability in a timetable. A revision of train dwell time models is performed in [25]. They all gather real-world data from several installations, the work concludes that the amount of passengers getting on and off and waiting at platforms are the most influencing parameters. Some of the works in the literature are completely centered on the study of passengers influence on <b>dwelling</b> <b>times</b> [4, 13, 22, 32].|$|R
40|$|The {{regularity}} {{is a key}} {{performance in}} the operation of a metro service, because it is normally affecting a large set of secondary performances: e. g. punctuality, energy efficiency, economic efficiency and vehicles availability. Human behaviours are affecting the regularity, by introducing deviations between panned and actual times in various operational phases of metro services: e. g. <b>dwelling</b> <b>times,</b> acceleration/deceleration times, inversion times at terminus, headways themselves. The variability in passengers’ flows {{is one of the most}} relevant parameters affecting mainly <b>dwelling</b> <b>times</b> and finally headways themselves. In this framework, this paper is specifically presenting the results of experimental surveys on metro services operated in Rome (Lines A and B). On these lines, it has been performed a systematic counting of passengers boarding and alighting in the most crowded stations, combined with simultaneous measurement of actual <b>dwelling</b> <b>times</b> and headways. The collected results have been analysed, cleaned by inconsistent data and statistically interrelated looking for significant trends to compare with the most consolidated theoretical models and to quantify the effects in line with the literature developments, including those by the authors themselves. Finally, the focus is on the most relevant quantitative outputs and the main identified and outlined further research needs...|$|R

50|$|First {{phase of}} the project has {{completed}} in 2016, which has helped to improve {{the performance of the}} port. <b>Dwelling</b> <b>time</b> in the port which was once 7 days, now reduced to almost 3 days. The port now can accommodate container ships with capacity up to 14,000 TEUs. In 2016, the port loaded and unloaded 6.2 million TEUs of cargo, out of a total capacity of about 8 million TEUs.|$|E
50|$|Christmas Day 1939 fell on a Monday, {{which many}} {{families}} and soldiers {{used as a}} long weekend. Because of the Second World War, spare locomotives or coaches for relief trains were not available, so the existing trains were overcrowded. Express train D 10 (23:15 from Berlin Potsdamer Bahnhof to Cologne) had left Berlin on time, but due to excessive <b>dwelling</b> <b>time</b> and the Verdunkelung (most lights at stations were turned off) it was quickly delayed to up to 30 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Cikarang Dry Port (CDP) is a {{dry port}} located within Kota Jababeka at Cikarang, West Java, Indonesia. CDP was {{established}} in 2010 with a total area of 200 hectares. It is operated by PT Cikarang Inland Port, a subsidiary of publicly listed PT Jababeka Tbk, and becomes {{the first and only}} Integrated Customs Services Zone in Indonesia. As an inland dry port model, CDP serves as a port extension providing solution to chronic congestion and delays at the major import export gateway of Tanjung Priok. The main objective is simply to cut the <b>dwelling</b> <b>time</b> from 3.2 days to the government target of 2.5 days.|$|E

30|$|An {{effective}} {{procedure to}} calculate the compressed time and the maximum capacity {{is the use of}} simulation models that allow reproducing the full railway system at a micro level (using tools like OpenTrack or MultiRail). This is accomplished by approximating the trains until they could not get closer without affecting each other (conflict-free compressed time). Some works present their own simulation tool [2, 10, 17]. Goverde et al [10] calculates capacity using the compression method. It considers uncertainty by means of Weibull distributions line entry <b>times,</b> but <b>dwelling</b> <b>times</b> are considered fixed.|$|R
5000|$|To proceed 2.5 days <b>dwelling</b> <b>time,</b> CDP is {{involved}} {{by the government}} to maximize its function. It has been designed in such a way to integrate with Tanjung Priok. The concept is that when Tanjung Priok has completely accomplished the loading and unloading activities, then CDP runs the next stage i.e. port clearance. To accelerate its process, a freight train will carry containers from the seaport to CDP for inspection, administration, and quarantine purposes. For export, the similar process can also be done. The integration between Tanjung Priok and CDP is believed to be able to increase port capacity up to 8 million TEUs per year. [...] With CDP, the entire supply chain is coordinated and synchronized to facilitate productivity - a crucial matter for an industrial business development. CDP itself is able to accommodate 250 thousand TEUs.|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} radio {{frequency}} sputtering {{at room temperature}} to prepare a zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film. After deposition, the thin film {{was placed in a}} high-temperature furnace to undergo thermal annealing at different temperatures (300, 400, 500, and 600 °C) and for different dwelling times (15, 30, 45, and 60 [*]min). The objective was to explore the effects that the described process had on the thin film’s internal structure and luminescence properties. A scanning electron microscope topographic image showed that the size of the ZnO crystals grew with increases in either the thermal annealing temperature or the <b>dwelling</b> <b>time.</b> However, significant differences in the levels of influence caused by increasing the thermal annealing temperature or <b>dwelling</b> <b>time</b> existed; the thermal annealing temperature had a greater effect on crystal growth when compared to the <b>dwelling</b> <b>time.</b> Furthermore, the crystallization directions of ZnO (002), (101), (102), and (103) can be clearly observed through an X-ray diffraction analysis, and crystallization strength increased with an increase in the thermal annealing temperature.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The opening rate of voltagegated {{potassium}} ion channels exhibits a characteristic, knee-like turnover where the common exponential voltage-dependence changes suddenly into a linear one. An explanation of this puzzling crossover is put forward {{in terms of}} a stochastic first passage time analysis. The theory predicts that the exponential voltagedependence correlates with the exponential distribution of closed residence times. This feature occurs at large negative voltages when the channel is predominantly closed. In contrast, the linear part of voltage-dependence emerges together with a non-exponential distribution of closed <b>dwelling</b> <b>times</b> with increasing voltage, yielding a large opening rate. Depending on the parameter set, the closed-time distribution displays a power law behavior which extends over several decades...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} notion of {{stability}} for Stochastic Hybrid Systems. The uncertainty is introduced in the discrete jumps between the domains, {{as if we had}} an underlying Markov Chain. The jumps happen every fixed time T; moreover, a result is given for the case of probabilistic <b>dwelling</b> <b>times</b> inside each domain. Unlike the more classical Hybrid Systems setting, the guards here are time-related, rather than space-related. We shall focus on vector fields describing input-less dynamical systems. Clearly, the uncertainty intrinsic to the model forces to introduce a fairly new definition of stability, which can be related to the classical Lyapunov one though. Proofs and simulations for our results are provided, as well as a motivational example from finance...|$|R
