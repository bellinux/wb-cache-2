5|$|Martín de Ursúa was now {{convinced}} that Kan Ek' would not surrender peacefully, {{and he began}} to organise an all-out assault on Nojpetén. Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch'ich' the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes <b>gathered,</b> <b>and</b> the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, 1914, he {{returned}} to Veracruz with the information he had <b>gathered</b> <b>and</b> presented it to his commanders. The invasion plan was eventually scrapped when authorities loyal to Victoriano Huerta detained a small American naval landing party (that had gone ashore to buy gasoline) in Tampico, Mexico, which led to {{what became known as}} the Tampico Affair.|$|E

5|$|The Texas {{pocket gopher}} avoids {{emerging}} {{onto the surface}} to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has <b>gathered</b> <b>and</b> eats the nutritious items.|$|E
5|$|The last {{scheduled}} passenger service left Quainton Road in {{the afternoon}} of 30 November 1935. Hundreds of people <b>gathered,</b> <b>and</b> a number {{of members of the}} Oxford University Railway Society travelled from Oxford in an effort to buy the last ticket. Accompanied by firecrackers and fog signals, the train ran the length of the line to Brill, where the passengers posed for a photograph.|$|E

5|$|There was a {{tremendous}} public outcry when Ward was found not guilty. Newspapers across the nation condemned the verdict and Crittenden {{for his role in}} securing it. Only Prentice, in the Courier-Journal, defended Crittenden and the Ward family. Several public meetings passed resolutions calling for Crittenden's resignation from the Senate. After one such meeting, a mob <b>gathered</b> <b>and</b> Crittenden, Prentice, the Wards, and the twelve jurors were burned in effigy.|$|E
5|$|At the foundry {{near the}} Carey Street Bridge, {{a crowd of}} more than 100 <b>gathered</b> <b>and</b> {{threatened}} to {{set fire to the}} area. A contingent of the 5th under Captain Lipscomb arrived, and a volley fired {{over the heads of the}} crowd was sufficient to dissuade the crowd. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to burn a B transportation barge at Fell's Point. The news reported that 16 were arrested in a confrontation between citizens and the police at Lee and Eutaw, and that during the night, three separate attempts were made to set fire the 6th Regiment armory, but all were frustrated by the remaining garrison there.|$|E
5|$|For five months, Henry took {{no action}} on the accusations against his archbishop. The {{conspiracy}} was finally revealed to Cranmer by the king himself. According to Cranmer's secretary, Ralph Morice, sometime in September 1543 the king showed Cranmer a paper summarising the accusations against him. An investigation was to be mounted and Cranmer was appointed chief investigator. Surprise raids were carried out, evidence <b>gathered,</b> <b>and</b> ringleaders identified. Typically, Cranmer put the clergymen involved in the conspiracy through immediate humiliation, but he eventually forgave them and continued to use their services. To show his trust in Cranmer, Henry gave Cranmer his personal ring. When the Privy Council arrested Cranmer {{at the end of}} November, the nobles were stymied by the symbol of the king's trust in him. Cranmer's victory ended with two second-rank leaders imprisoned and Germain Gardiner executed.|$|E

5|$|German {{literature}} can {{be traced}} back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level. The Grimms also <b>gathered</b> <b>and</b> codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches Wörterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.|$|E
5|$|Hotham and Osborn {{discussed}} {{the situation and}} determined to destroy the wreck to deny it to the French. To this end, three cutters were <b>gathered</b> <b>and</b> a boarding party under Lieutenant Edward Grey sent in to attack Preneuse at 20:00. This party came under fire from the batteries but was able to successfully access the battered French frigate at 21:00, finding that only the officers {{and a handful of}} sailors remained, the others having been given the opportunity to escape to the shore in boats rather than become prisoners of war. Among the captives was Lhermitte, who was permitted to bring his personal baggage with him before he was brought to the British squadron as a prisoner. Grey then set the wrecked ship alight before returning to Adamant, having executed his orders without losing a single man.|$|E
5|$|In {{retaliation}} for his dismissal and his son's virtual demotion, Qasim al-Ahmad organized the a'ayan (notables) of Nablus, Hebron and Jerusalem against Ibrahim Pasha. On 19 May 1834, the notables <b>gathered</b> <b>and</b> notified Egyptian officials {{that they were}} not able to conscript the Palestinian Arab peasantry into the army or collect taxes from them, claiming that the peasantry had taken up arms and fled to the mountains which were difficult to access. At the time of the notables' stated failure to conscript local peasants, Ibrahim Pasha had been in need of new troops to replenish his army in preparation for further advances against the Ottomans. He considered the notables' position to be treasonous and amounting to an insurrection.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the sinking, several ships sailed to the disaster area to recover victims' bodies. The White Star Line chartered the cable ship Mackay-Bennett from Halifax, Nova Scotia to retrieve bodies. Three other ships followed in the search: the cable ship Minia, the lighthouse supply ship Montmagny and the sealing vessel Algerine. Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Upon recovery, each body retrieved by the Mackay-Bennett was numbered and given as detailed a description as possible to help aid in identification. The physical appearance of each body—height, weight, age, hair and eye colour, visible birthmarks, scars or tattoos, was catalogued and any personal effects on the bodies were <b>gathered</b> <b>and</b> placed in small canvas bags corresponding to their number.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{belief in}} the Mandate of Heaven granted to the ailing Tang was also {{challenged}} when natural calamities occurred, forcing many to believe the Heavens were displeased and that the Tang had lost their right to rule. Then in 873 a disastrous harvest shook {{the foundations of the}} empire; in some areas only half of all agricultural produce was <b>gathered,</b> <b>and</b> tens of thousands faced famine and starvation. In the earlier period of the Tang, the central government was able to meet crises in the harvest, as it was recorded from 714–719 that the Tang government responded effectively to natural disasters by extending the price-regulation granary system throughout the country. The central government was able then to build a large surplus stock of foods to ward off the rising danger of famine and increased agricultural productivity through land reclamation. In the 9th century, however, the Tang government was nearly helpless in dealing with any calamity.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} Bukovsky had <b>gathered</b> <b>and</b> {{sent to the}} West galvanized {{human rights}} activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also struck a chord among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation, without access to a lawyer, to be tried {{and sent to the}} camps or a special psychiatric hospital.|$|E

Accompanied by firecrackers and fog signals, the train ran to Brill, where the passengers posed for a photograph. Late that evening, a two-coach staff train pulled out of Brill, accompanied by a band bearing a white flag and playing Auld Lang Syne. The train stopped at each station, picking up the staff, documents and valuables from each. At 11.45pm the train arrived at Quainton Road, greeted by hundreds of locals and railway enthusiasts. At the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the Tramway to the main line were ceremonially severed.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Medina began in January 627 and lasted for 27 days. Since sieges were {{uncommon}} in Arabian warfare, the arriving confederates were unprepared {{to deal with}} the trenches dug by the Muslims. The Confederates tried to attack with horsemen in hopes of forcing a passage, but the Medinans were rigidly entrenched, preventing such a crossing. Both of the armies gathered {{on either side of the}} trench and spent two or three weeks exchanging insults in prose and verse, backed up with arrows fired from a comfortable distance. According to Rodinson, there were three dead among the attackers and five among the defenders. On the other hand, the harvest had been <b>gathered</b> <b>and</b> the besiegers had some trouble finding food for their horses, which proved of no use to them in the attack.|$|E

Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch'ich' the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes <b>gathered,</b> <b>and</b> the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance.|$|E
