This Fusarium species has, until recently, been considered to be the same as the species known as <b>Fusarium</b> graminearum (<b>head</b> <b>blight</b> of wheat) due to many similar characteristics.

Production of the trichothecene 3 -acetyldeoxynivalenol (3 -ADON) versus 15 -acetyldeoxynivalenol (15 -ADON) is an important phenotypic difference within and among some Fusarium species. However, until now, the genetic basis for this difference in chemotype has not been identified. Here, we identified consistent DNA sequence differences in the coding region of the trichothecene biosynthetic gene TRI 8 in 3 -ADON and 15 -ADON strains. Functional analyses of the TRI 8 enzyme (Tri 8) in F. graminearum, the predominant cause of wheat <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> in North America and Europe, revealed that Tri 8 from 3 -ADON strains catalyzes deacetylation of the trichothecene biosynthetic intermediate 3, 15 -diacetyldeoxynivalenol at carbon 15 to yield 3 -ADON, whereas Tri 8 from 15 -ADON strains catalyzes deacetylation of 3, 15 -diacetyldeoxynivalenol at carbon 3 to yield 15 -ADON. Fusarium strains that produce the trichothecene nivalenol have a Tri 8 that functions like that in 15 -ADON strains.

Compared with FHB, CR symptom development occurs slowly, usually taking 4 to 8 weeks to become visible. To characterize CR development, we used histological and real-time quantitative {{polymerase chain reaction}} analyses to assess fungal colonization during a timecourse of infection. Three distinct phases of infection were identified: i) initial spore germination with formation of a superficial hyphal mat at the inoculation point, ii) colonization of the adaxial epidermis of the outer leaf sheath and mycelial growth from the inoculation point to the crown, concomitant with a drop in fungal biomass, and iii) extensive colonization of the internal crown tissue. Fungal gene expression was examined during each phase using Affymetrix GeneChips. In total, 1, 839 F. graminearum genes were significantly upregulated, including some known FHB virulence genes (e. g., TRI 5 and TRI 14), and 2, 649 genes were significantly downregulated in planta compared with axenically cultured mycelia.

5000|$|Vomitoxin, {{also known}} as {{deoxynivalenol}} (DON), is a type B trichothecene, an epoxy-sesquiterpenoid. This mycotoxin occurs predominantly in grains such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, and corn, and less often in rice, sorghum, and triticale. The occurrence of deoxynivalenol is associated primarily with Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae) and F. culmorum, {{both of which are}} important plant pathogens which cause <b>fusarium</b> <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> in wheat and gibberella or fusarium ear blight in corn. A direct relationship between the incidence of <b>fusarium</b> <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> and contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol has been established. The incidence of <b>fusarium</b> <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> is strongly associated with moisture at the time of flowering (anthesis), and the timing of rainfall, rather than the amount, is the most critical factor. However, increased amount of moisture towards harvest time has been associated with lower amount of vomitoxin in wheat grain due to leaching of toxins. Furthermore, deoxynivalenol contents are significantly affected by the susceptibility of cultivars towards Fusarium species, previous crop, tillage practices, and fungicide use. [...] It occurs abundantly in grains in Norway due to heavy rainfall.|$|E

40|$|Cereals contain {{xylanase}} inhibitor proteins (XIs) which inhibit microbial xylanases from {{glycoside hydrolase}} families 10 and 11. In wheat, {{three types of}} XIs have been identified: Triticum aestivum XI (TAXI), xylanase inhibitor protein (XIP) and thaumatin-like XI (TLXI). Each type of XIs is represented by a multiple number of genes. These inhibitors are {{considered part of the}} defence mechanisms that plants use to counteract microbial pathogens. Indeed, XIs are induced by pathogen infection and are responsive to mechanical wounding and jasmonic acid and salicylic acid treatments. They are localized in the apoplastic region and are effective against xylanases of microbial origin and not against endogenous plant xylanases. An additional aspect that reinforces the possibility that the XIs are involved in plant defence derives from the observation that xylaneses are important components during pathogenesis for the fungal pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Septoria tritici. Nevertheless, more direct evidences have not been reported yet. Therefore, we produced a number of transgenic plants over-expressing TAXI-III, a member of the TAXI type XIs that is expressed only in developing caryopsis and roots and is induced by pathogen infection, wounding and elicitor treatments. In order to facilitate the understanding of its possible contribution in wheat defence, we designated the transgenic plants to express Taxi-III constitutively. Results showed that TAXI-III accumulated accumulates in all tissues including those that normally do not accumulate it and its presence endows the transgenic wheat with new inhibition capacity. We show also that TAXI-III is correctly secreted into the apoplast and possesses the expected inhibition capacity against microbial xylanases. In particular, total protein wheat extract or purified TAXI-III from transgenic plants inhibits a purified xylanase from Fusarium graminearum and to some extent the total xylanase activity produced in vitro by the fungal pathogens F. graminearum and Bipolaris sorokiniana. The new inhibition properties of the transgenic tissues correlate with a significant reduction of <b>fusarium</b> <b>Fusarium</b> <b>head</b> <b>Head</b> <b>blight</b> Blight (FHB) disease symptom caused by F. graminearum but do not influence significantly leaf spot symptoms caused by B. sorokiniana. Possible differences on the efficacy of TAXI-III to inhibit specific xylanases produced by the two fungal pathogens during host colonization or the presence of additional factors conditioning host colonization at floral or leaf tissues can be responsible for this different outcome. In conclusion, our results provide {{for the first time a}} straight evidence in planta that XIs are involved in plant defence against fungal pathogens and show the possibility to manipulate TAXI-III accumulation to improve wheat resistance against F. graminearum...|$|R
