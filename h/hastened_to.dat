When Basiliscus received news of this danger, he <b>hastened</b> <b>to</b> recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate the Patriarch and the people, but it was too late.|$|E

5|$|In February and March 1913 the Ballets Russes {{presented}} another London season. As in 1911, {{the local}} orchestra engaged was the Beecham Symphony Orchestra.

5|$|Attached to the 5th Light Infantry at Alexandra Barracks were a {{detachment}} of 97 Indian officers and {{men of the}} Malay States Guides Mule Battery. Raised in 1896 for the internal garrisoning of the Federated Malay States, the regiment was recruited from Sikhs, Pathans and Punjabis in both India and Malaya. The British officer commanding the battery was shot dead by an unknown sniper as he <b>hastened</b> <b>to</b> the gun park. The MSG gunners then dispersed when {{a large body of}} 5th LI mutineers approached their lines. The MSG artillery pieces were abandoned but not brought into action by the mutineers.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{had spoken}} out against lynching in his April 1921 speech before Congress and {{supported}} Congressman Leonidas Dyer's federal anti-lynching bill, which passed the House of Representatives in January 1922. When {{it reached the}} Senate floor in November 1922, it was filibustered by Southern Democrats, and Lodge withdrew it so as to allow the ship subsidy bill Harding favored to be debated (it was likewise filibustered). Blacks blamed Harding for the Dyer bill's defeat; Harding biographer Robert K. Murray noted that it was <b>hastened</b> <b>to</b> its end by Harding's desire to have the ship subsidy bill considered.|$|E

5|$|In the 1450s, King Thomas vigorously {{searched for}} {{suitable}} spouses {{for the children}} from his first marriage. Stephen's two sisters were married off in 1451, and in 1453 Stephen too entered his father's considerations. Wishing to gain control over the allodial land of Petar Talovac, who had governed Croatia proper as ban {{on behalf of the}} Hungarian king, Thomas attempted to have Stephen marry Talovac's widow, Hedwig Garai. Kosača too <b>hastened</b> <b>to</b> marry the wealthy widow, leading to an armed conflict, but neither prevailed due to an intervention by the Republic of Venice on behalf of Talovac's heirs.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus {{intended}} {{to spend the}} winter in Laconia, possibly {{with the purpose of}} launching a fresh attack on Sparta and sent his army to begin ravaging the surrounding countryside. At this point, Pyrrhus received an emissary from Aristeas, a prominent citizen of the major Peloponnesian polis of Argos, seeking his assistance to overthrow the regime of Aristippus, which was supportive of Antigonus and the Macedonians. Pyrrhus <b>hastened</b> <b>to</b> seize the opportunity to capture Argos and began to withdraw from Laconia, heading north to Argolis.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Duke's {{marriage}} in 1815, it seemed to have little dynastic significance to Britain. Princess Charlotte of Wales, only child of the Prince Regent, was the King's only legitimate grandchild. The young Princess was expected to have children who would secure the British succession, especially after she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in 1816. Both the Prince Regent and the Duke of York were married but estranged from their wives, while the next two brothers, the Dukes of Clarence and Kent, were unmarried. On 6 November 1817, Princess Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. King George was left with twelve surviving children, and no surviving legitimate grandchildren. Most of the unmarried royal dukes hurriedly sought out suitable brides and <b>hastened</b> <b>to</b> the altar, hoping to father the heir to the throne.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and <b>hastened</b> <b>to</b> Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E
5|$|The Epirote {{successes in}} Macedonia worried the Latins, as {{they opened the}} way to another attack on Thessalonica. The Kingdom of Thessalonica had been much {{weakened}} {{after the death of}} its founder, Boniface of Montferrat, in 1207, since which it had been ruled by a regency for his underage son Demetrius (r. 1207–24). Interrupting a campaign against the Nicaeans in Asia Minor, Henry of Flanders <b>hastened</b> <b>to</b> Thessalonica. He took up contact with Boril and was preparing to march against Theodore when he suddenly died on 11 June 1216, probably of malaria, although poisoning by his second wife Maria of Bulgaria has also been suggested. The death of the warlike Henry, followed by that of Pope Innocent III, the instigator of the Fourth Crusade, a month later, was a major stroke of good fortune for Theodore as it removed two of his most eminent and capable opponents.|$|E

5|$|At 02:00 September 5, Lieutenant Colonel Rollins S. Emmerich, {{one of the}} ROK I Corps KMAG advisers, <b>hastened</b> <b>to</b> Yonil Airfield {{where he}} conferred with Lieutenant Colonel D. M. McMains, {{commanding}} the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry, stationed there, and informed him {{of the situation in}} P'ohang-dong. Emmerich obtained a platoon of tanks and returned with them to the town. He placed the tanks in position and awaited the expected North Korean armored attack. At 05:30 he received information that elements of the ROK 22nd Regiment had retreated in the face of North Korean attack. North Korean troops entered this gap and just before 11:00 the American tanks in P'ohang-dong were under heavy North Korean machine gun fire. Five NK SU-76 self-propelled guns approached and began firing. At a range of one city block the US tanks knocked out the lead gun, killing its three crew members. In the ensuing exchange of fire the other four withdrew. Emmerich then directed air strikes and artillery fire which destroyed the other four guns. But that afternoon at 14:35 the order came to evacuate all materiel and supplies from the Yonil airstrip.|$|E
5|$|While Queen Margaret was hesitating to {{make her}} next move, Warwick and Edward <b>hastened</b> <b>to</b> London. The {{citizens}} of the capital were scared by the brutal conduct of the Lancastrian forces, and were sympathetic to the House of York. On 4March the prince was proclaimed King Edward IV, by an assembly that gathered quickly. The new king now headed north to consolidate his title, and met with the Lancastrian forces at Towton in Yorkshire. Warwick had suffered an injury to the leg the day before, in the Battle of Ferrybridge, and may have played only a minor part in the battle that followed. The unusually bloody battle resulted in a complete victory for the Yorkist forces, {{and the death of}} many important men on the opposing side, such as Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and Andrew Trollope. Queen Margaret managed to escape to Scotland, with Henry and Prince Edward. Edward IV returned to London for his coronation, while Warwick remained to pacify the north.|$|E
