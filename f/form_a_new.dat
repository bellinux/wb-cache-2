5|$|After Abraham Lincoln's {{election}} as president, several Southern states announced their secession from the Union to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> government, the Confederate States of America. Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which he {{regarded as a}} holy crusade against the Slave Power. In April 1861, the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter, {{one of the last}} federal outposts in the South, beginning the Civil War. Although he had no military training, Garfield knew that his place was in the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, {{negotiations}} {{to purchase the}} land at Anfield from Orrell escalated into a dispute between Houlding and the Everton F.C. committee over how the club was run. Events culminated in Everton's move to Goodison Park. Houlding was left with an empty stadium, and decided to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> club to occupy it. The new team was called Liverpool F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd, and the club's first match at Anfield was a friendly played in front of 200 people on 1 September 1892, against Rotherham Town. Liverpool won 7–1.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{video game}} {{developers}} Wolf Team {{signed a deal}} with publisher Namco to release the game that would be Tales of Phantasia, which was later released in 1995 in Japan for the Super Famicom. However, the development cycle for this game was plagued with creative disputes between the developers and publisher, leading {{to much of the}} development team leaving to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> company, which would become tri-Ace, which explains some of the common themes between the games, such as the similar battle systems.|$|E

5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} led to {{the creation}} of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> coalition against France. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes and by April 1805 the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France and keen on revenge, Austria also joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|In February 1940, Glenn Seaborg and Edwin McMillan {{produced}} plutonium-239 {{through the}} bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed {{the creation of}} neptunium, element 93, which then underwent beta-decay to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Kennedy built a series of detectors and counters to verify the presence of plutonium. He used mica sliced razor thin to produce a window to count alpha particle emissions, and ionization chamber with a magnetic field to separate the beta particles from the neptunium from alpha particles from the plutonium.|$|E
5|$|In {{a similar}} reaction, pentaisopropylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate PF6 can be {{synthesised}} from pentamethylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate PF6 in 80% yield. These reactions {{demonstrate that the}} acidity of the methyl hydrogens in a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl complex can be considerably increased {{by the presence of}} the metal centre. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds with potassium hydroxide deprotonating a methyl group and the resulting carbanion undergoing nucleophilic substitution with methyl iodide to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> carbon–carbon bond.|$|E

5|$|In ascomycetes, dikaryotic hyphae of the {{hymenium}} (the spore-bearing tissue layer) form {{a characteristic}} hook at the hyphal septum. During cell division, {{formation of the}} hook ensures proper distribution of the newly divided nuclei into the apical and basal hyphal compartments. An ascus (plural asci) is then formed, in which karyogamy (nuclear fusion) occurs. Asci are embedded in an ascocarp, or fruiting body. Karyogamy in the asci is followed immediately by meiosis {{and the production of}} ascospores. After dispersal, the ascospores may germinate and <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> haploid mycelium.|$|E
5|$|In this session, the remodelled Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway got its authorising Act of Parliament (on 13 August or 16 July), {{to build}} from Horsecleugh (near Cumnock, the {{southern}} {{limit of the}} GPK authorisation) to Gretna Junction, reaching Carlisle from Gretna over the Caledonian Railway line. The Act stipulated that on actual completion of the construction, the GD should merge with the GPK to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> company, the Glasgow and South Western Railway.|$|E
5|$|McGivney {{traveled}} to Boston {{to examine the}} Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters and to Brooklyn, New York {{to learn about the}} recently established Catholic Benevolent League, both of which offered insurance benefits. He found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day. He explored establishing a New Haven Court of the Foresters, but the group's charter in Massachusetts limited them to operating within the Commonwealth. McGivney's committee of St. Mary's parishioners decided to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> club.|$|E

5|$|On 1 July 1940, the 7th Infantry Division was {{reactivated}} at Camp Ord, California Under {{the command}} of Major General Joseph W. Stilwell. The Headquarters element, 13th and 14th Brigades did not reactivate, however, and the division was instead centered around three infantry regiments; the 17th Infantry Regiment, the 32nd Infantry Regiment, and the 53rd Infantry Regiment. The 13th Brigade was not activated {{for the duration of}} the war and its headquarters formation was not used to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> unit.|$|E

5|$|Stojadinović sought {{authority}} from Prince Paul to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> cabinet, however Korošec {{as head of}} the Senate advised the prince to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> government around Cvetković. Prince Paul dismissed Stojadinović and appointed Cvetković in his place, with a direction that he reach an agreement with Maček. While these negotiations were ongoing, Italy invaded Albania. In August 1939, the Cvetković–Maček Agreement was concluded to create the Banovina of Croatia, which was to be a relatively autonomous political unit within Yugoslavia. Separatist Croats considered the Agreement did not go far enough, and many Serbs believed it went too far in giving power to Croats. The Cvetković-led cabinet formed {{in the wake of the}} Agreement was resolutely anti-Axis, and included five members of the HSS, with Maček as deputy Prime Minister. General Milan Nedić was Minister of the Army and Navy. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, German pressure on the government resulted in the resignation in mid-1940 of the Minister of the Interior, Dr. Stanoje Mihaldžić, who had been organising covert anti-Axis activities. In October 1940, Simović was again approached by plotters planning a coup but he was non-committal. From the outbreak of war British diplomacy focused on keeping Yugoslavia neutral, which the Ambassador Ronald Campbell apparently still believed possible.|$|E
