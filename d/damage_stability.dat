25|$|The first Finnish {{statutory}} regulation for ships navigating in ice was given on 27 March 1890. It was primarily intended {{to increase the}} safety and set a number of requirements for passenger ships operating regularly in winter conditions. These included double bottom in way of the engines and boilers, construction {{according to the rules}} of Lloyd's Register or Bureau Veritas, at least five transverse watertight bulkheads, and sufficient <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> to survive the flooding of two compartments without sinking.

50|$|Ship {{stability}} {{is an area}} of naval architecture and ship design that deals with how a ship behaves at sea, both in still water and in waves, whether intact or <b>damaged.</b> <b>Stability</b> calculations focus on the center of gravity, center of buoyancy, and metacenter of vessels and on how these interact.|$|R

They have a bow thruster for maneuvering in crowded anchorages and channels. They also have small underwater fins, for coping with the rolling and pitching caused by large waves. They are equipped with a stern launching ramp, like the [...] and the eight failed expanded Island-class cutters. They are manned by a crew of 22. [...] The Fast Response Cutter deploys the 26'Cutter Boat - Over the Horizon (OTH-IV) for rescues and interceptions. According to Marine Log, modifications to the Coast Guard vessels from the Stan 4708 design include an increase in speed from , fixed-pitch rather than variable-pitch propellers, stern launch capability, and watertight bulkheads. The vessels are built to ABS High Speed Naval Craft rules and {{some parts of the}} FRC also comply to ABS Naval Vessel Rules. The vessels meet NAVSEA standards for two compartment damaged stability and also meet the Intact and <b>Damage</b> <b>Stability</b> and reserve buoyancy requirements in accordance with the “Procedures Manual for Stability Analyses of U.S. Navy Small Craft". The vessels have space, weight, and power reserved for future requirements which includes weapons and their systems.|$|E

5000|$|Transverse and {{longitudinal}} waterproof bulkheads {{were introduced}} in ironclad designs between 1860 and the 1880s, anti-collision bulkheads having been made compulsory in British steam merchant ships prior to 1860. [...] Before this a hull breach {{in any part of}} a vessel could flood {{the entire length of the}} ship. Transverse bulkheads, while expensive, increase the likelihood of ship survival in the event of damage to the hull, by limiting flooding to breached compartments separated by bulkheads from undamaged ones. Longitudinal bulkheads have a similar purpose, but <b>damaged</b> <b>stability</b> effects must be taken into account to eliminate excessive heeling. Today, most ships have means to equalize the water in sections port and starboard (cross flooding), which helps to limit the stresses experienced by the structure and also to alter the heel and/or trim of the ship.|$|R
