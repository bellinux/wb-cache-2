6000|$|... "I do, indeed; {{and if we}} do get a gale, it {{is likely}} to be a serious one. The Cape, you know, was much feared for its terrible storms by the Portuguese, and it has kept up its {{reputation}} ever since. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to give us a taste of its quality." ...|$|E

6000|$|Friday.--We {{have all}} got our photographs; {{it is pretty}} fair, they say, of me and as they are {{particular}} {{in the matter of}} photographs, and besides partial judges I suppose I may take that for proven.

6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} am," [...] was Slaty's prompt response. [...] "It {{will take}} pretty bad weather {{to drive me}} away from here. If the snow gets too deep I'll just go up to Farmer Brown's barnyard. I can always pick up a meal there, for Farmer Brown's boy {{is a very good}} friend of mine. I know he won't let me starve, no matter what the weather is. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to snow some more. I like the snow.

5000|$|Five years later, {{singer and}} co-writer Ron Peno said the album {{remained}} the band's creative watermark. [...] "Now there's an album {{that should have}} done something," [...] he told the Daily Telegraph.

5000|$|In the {{aftermath}} of his death, one Irish newspaper described him as [...] "the greatest loss to National Hunt racing since Arkle" [...] whilst another quoted a leading trainer as saying [...] "They {{say that there is}} always another one around the corner but somehow <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be a very long corner before we see another Golden Cygnet." [...] Timeform's assessment would seem to confirm this view, as almost 40 years later he is still their highest rated novice hurdler.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2012, it was {{announced}} that the Specials would perform at Hyde Park with Blur and New Order to celebrate the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. Panter said that the band were excited to be involved in such a momentous event: [...] "We have been keeping it under our pork pie hats for a month or so now. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be the only chance people get to see the Specials performing in the UK this year." [...] The Specials' performance was said to have remained synonymous with Britain's political and social upheaval of the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|At Christian Music Review, Liz Haveman {{rated the}} album three-and-a-half stars, and criticized the album because [...] "some {{of the songs}} are {{confusing}} in their message. They are a little too vague to really grasp what these guys are trying to say." [...] However, she highlighted how [...] "the music itself is really enjoyable. It has a “Jack Johnson”-ish quality to its laid back candor. Over all, the album is really enjoyable and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to satisfy the Needtobreathe fan base." [...] Ian Webber at Cross Rhythms rated the album {{nine out of ten}} squares, and underscored how the band [...] "have crafted an excellent collection of tracks that wrestle with issues of faith and doubt in an honest and accessible way." [...] At Indie Vision Music, Joshua Clark rated the album four stars, and felt that the [...] "lyrics seem a lot more ambiguous", yet called the release [...] "near-perfect".|$|E

25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> at that stage something takes hold of most climbers... And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> therefore taking all those circumstances in view... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a lovely thought and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that is something one just cannot know.|$|R

5000|$|Belmont {{had to pay}} a $200,000 exit fee to the Atlantic Sun. However, Belmont AD Mike Strickland said, [...] "...ballpark, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be {{well over}} $250,000 a year in savings because we fly {{a lot in the}} Atlantic Sun. Half the places in the OVC we won't spend the night, so it will be a great savings and {{hopefully}} we can reinvest that in our programs." [...] Fisher shared that sentiment, adding, [...] "We will more than make that up in travel costs the first year. We don't have to get on an airplane. The longest trip we have to take in the OVC is about the same distance as our shortest trip outside of Nashville to play an A-Sun team." [...] Although Belmont left behind an in-city rival in Lipscomb, all involved with the move wished that rivalry to continue. Ultimately, both Belmont and Lipscomb announced their basketball series would continue with home-and-home games each season, unusual among non-conference rivalries.|$|E
5000|$|These demonstrations {{caused an}} outcry from the Jewish community; several evangelicals {{and other members}} of the Christian clergy called Hymers an [...] "anti-Semite". Jonathan Rauch later {{referred}} to Hymers as a [...] "religious zealot" [...] for saying [...] "I think the movie is filthy! I think it is ugly! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to bring God's fiery judgment upon America." [...] Irv Rubin, who was at the time the national chairman of the Jewish Defense League, maintained that he [...] "sympathized" [...] with the concerns of evangelicals, [...] "but Hymers wants to make a Jew-hating thing out of it". The entire episode led to a break between Hymers and Moishe Rosen of Jews for Jesus—who had actually performed Hymers' wedding ceremony. They were later reconciled, and Hymers and his family had lunch with Rosen at his San Francisco home in 2009. Hymers and his wife attended Rosen's funeral the following year.|$|E
5000|$|Murry: [...] Hello, My name is Harold Murry, I am {{a family}} law {{attorney}} in Alexandria, I am {{also on the}} Supreme Courts domestic violence along with Anne Styre, who {{is a friend of}} mine, who I believe is speaking in favor of the bill.My problem with this bill, is I think it started out as a really good idea, if you go look at the web site, you see that it started out as the Uniform International Child Abduction prevention act.Because that is a huge problem, I have had cases where the father of the kid for instance is an exchange student from Jordan or he is a merchant from Pakistan and the people split and {{he is not going to}} get custody, he takes the kids to that country, and all we can do is write a couple of letters to the consulate, the mom never sees them again, there is no way to get them back.and that is why there is so much in this about the Hague treaty on child abduction, whether or not somebody is from one of these countries where you can take kids and never get them back. At some point, I think in August 2004, somebody appended some additional language to this, to make this solve all problems, and they took the International, the word international out and they added this thing that if you are from another state or have strong cultural ties to another state, that you are suspect, just like somebody who is from another country and really has the ability to do this sort of thing.I tell my clients, there are always these threats that well, I am going to take the kid, no I am going to take the kid and you'll be darned if you see him again. I say, let him take the kid to Mississippi, we will have the kid back in two weeks and the judge will put him in jail. I'd love it. Don't worry about it.We have all the laws we need. We have the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act; We have the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act - which is the federal statute to prevent children from being snatched from State to State.They talk about strong cultural ties to another State should make you suspect. Well, I can't imagine them saying that somebody in Nebraska has cultural ties to Kansas that are suspect, they don't even have culture. I mean, its all the same, they are from the mid-west. (audience laughter) I mean, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be used against Cajuns or something, I don't know. If you live in Houston and you have LSU season tickets you are suspect.This should be, we need to send a message back to the committee to fix this thing back the way it was, to strike out the provisions that are just pasted in there where it says things like from another country or state, that that should be taken out and it should be an International act.We need this protection, but this is going to be abused, I mean, lawyers love ex-parte custody orders. When I started practicing in '85 that was part of your stock in trade, if you could get your party ex-parte custody before the hearing came up a month later, your phone did not ring, the other attorney's phone would ring.We went to a lot of trouble, you guys passed Code of Civil Procedure Article 3945 a few years ago making it extremely difficult to come in and get temporary custody, you had to show immediate irreparable harm.And this has these factors like um, has previously abducted or attempted to abduct that could be taking the kid on a day when it wasn't your day. There is all sorts of things, Ms. Bowler is absolutely right, there is no number, what if you just meet two of them, I mean you don't have to meet them all, they terminate a lease, all of the things that happen when you are going through a divorce are present here.I think it had the potential to be a very great act, but it is now extremely flawed by adding the business about the state, being from another state will trigger these incredible sanctions against you. I don't know if it is appropriate to amend a Uniform Act it's been done before because I remember the UCCJA when it was first passed, there were a couple of states with asterisk's by their name because they had taken some provisions out of it. {Rep Walker sits down} I think probably the best is to just not pass it, but if you do pass it you can.|$|E
