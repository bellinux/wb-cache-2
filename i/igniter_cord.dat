50|$|<b>Igniter</b> <b>Cord</b> is a {{commercial}} grade of visco fuse {{that is designed}} to ignite multiple safety fuses. Like visco, <b>igniter</b> <b>cord</b> burns with an external, visible flame. It is often heavily lacquered for water resistance, and sometimes has an inner wire core for mechanical strength.|$|E
50|$|A plastic <b>igniter</b> <b>cord</b> (PIC) {{is a type}} of fuse used to {{initiate}} an explosive device or charge. In appearance <b>igniter</b> <b>cord</b> is similar to safety fuse and when ignited, an intense flame spits perpendicular to the cord at a uniform rate as it burns along its length. <b>Igniter</b> <b>cord</b> in construction is again similar to safety fuse, consisting of a pyrotechnic composition at the core, wrapped with a nylon sheath to provide shape and finally wrapped again in an outer plastic shell to provide water resistance. Normally, <b>igniter</b> <b>cord</b> also consists of a metal wire {{at the very center of}} the pyrotechnic core which also runs the entire length of the cord; the pyrotechnic composition will react with the metal wire (typically aluminum, iron or copper) to increase the energetics of the fuse. There are two types of PICs: the fast type which has nominal burning speed of 30 cm per second, a diameter of about 3 mm, and is brownish in color; and the slow type, which has a diameter of 2 mm, is greenish in color, and has a nominal burning speed of 3 cm per second.|$|E
50|$|An {{expedient}} formerly used {{to ignite}} bickford style safety fuses was {{to split the}} end of a safety fuse, place a match head into the split and tie the split back together, holding the match head against the powder core. This technique was slower, cumbersome and more failure prone than piercing and cross matching. Also, a single length of <b>igniter</b> <b>cord</b> could pass through and serially ignite multiple pieces of safety fuse attached to various charges in more complex, multiple charge blasting schemes. This technique and the several burn rate types of <b>igniter</b> <b>cord</b> manufactured by ICI could be used to implememt quite complex ignition sequences.|$|E
50|$|Adjusting {{graduated}} range {{slide on}} Type 98 50 mm mortar of the charge. Connect each <b>igniter</b> by <b>cord</b> {{to one of}} the two links extending from the barrel collar of the mortar on each side. Insert a pull-type friction primer in the primer seat, which {{is on the side of}} the barrel near the base.|$|R
50|$|Thermalite a {{specific}} type of fuse used in pyrotechnic applications. The product was designed to be used in cross matching safety fuses of the Bickford type. As safety fuse is designed to neither give nor take fire through the heavy fuse jacket, ignition may be achieved by punching a hole perpendicular to and through a safety fuse powder core, threading a piece of Thermalite or similar <b>igniter</b> <b>cord</b> through the hole, then gently squeezing the safety fuse with pliers or similar to bring the powder core into contact with the <b>igniter</b> <b>cord.</b> The Thermalite could be ignited by a match, or more certainly by a purpose made igniter, similar to a wire sparkler.|$|E
50|$|Thermalite igniter cords and {{connectors}} were {{manufactured in}} Quebec by ICA Canada Inc., however in November 1995 they ceased manufacturing <b>igniter</b> <b>cord.</b> Sources for thermalite are increasingly {{hard to come}} by and purchasing it by mail will usually require permits and licenses. As a result, those who want to use thermalite fuses will sometimes make their own.|$|E
