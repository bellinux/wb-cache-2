40|$|This paper {{considers}} a single product inventory control in a Distribution Supply Chain (DSC). The DSC operates {{in the presence}} of uncertainty in customer demands. The demands are described by imprecise linguistic expressions that are modelled by discrete fuzzy sets. Inventories at each facility within the DSC are replenished by applying periodic review policies with optimal order up-to-quantities. Fuzzy customer demands imply fuzziness in inventory positions at the end of review intervals and in incurred relevant costs per unit time interval. The determination of the minimum of defuzzified total cost of the DSC is a complex problem which is solved by applying decomposition; the original problem is decomposed into a number of simpler independent optimisation subproblems, where each retailer and the warehouse determine their optimum periodic reviews and order up-to-quantities. An iterative coordination mechanism is proposed for changing the review periods and order up-to-quantities for each retailer and the warehouse {{in such a way that}} all parties within the DSC are satisfied with respect to total incurred costs per unit time interval. Coordination is performed by introducing fuzzy constraints on review periods and <b>fuzzy</b> <b>tolerances</b> on retailers and warehouse costs in local optimisation subproblems...|$|R

This <b>fuzzy</b> <b>tolerance</b> {{may be related}} to numerical limits for calculating intersections, or related to the variation in the geometry of objects they represent. When the distance between two objects is below the tolerance they are classified as coincident and moved to the same location. Yet using a tolerance as a heuristic to handle decisions of approximate coincidence has some undesirable consequences. Some of the problems encountered are that objects creep outside their allowable tolerance, or the objects geometry is corrupted so that proper topological relations cannot be reconstructed.

The fuzzy goals are transformed to linear constraints by introducing tolerance variables. The program then minimizes {{the values of the}} weighted sum of tolerance allowance variables for the highest membership grades, providing the most satisfactory set of allocations possible. As a measure of sensitivity, the problem is solved using different weight structures specified by the decision maker. A case study is provided to illustrate the usefulness of the method...|$|R
40|$|Data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) is {{a methodology}} {{for measuring the}} relative efficiencies {{of a set of}} decision making units (DMUs) that use multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. Crisp input and output data are fundamentally indispensable in conventional DEA. However, the observed values of the input and output data in real-world problems are sometimes imprecise or vague. Many researchers have proposed various fuzzy methods for dealing with the imprecise and ambiguous data in DEA. In this study, we provide a taxonomy and review of the fuzzy DEA methods. We present a classification scheme with four primary categories, namely, the tolerance approach, the [alpha]-level based approach, the fuzzy ranking approach and the possibility approach. We discuss each classification scheme and group the fuzzy DEA papers published in the literature over the past 20 years. To the best of our knowledge, this paper appears to be the only review and complete source of references on fuzzy DEA.

The capacity of each origin and the demand of each destination are considered random in nature with fuzzy normal stochastic parameters following normal distribution with fuzzy mean and fuzzy variance respectively. These inequality constraints are also considered as fuzzy probabilistic in nature assuming to be triangular fuzzy numbers. Further, the supply and demand constraints are converted into equivalent deterministic forms. Then, we define the <b>fuzzy</b> goal <b>tolerance</b> limit {{of each of the}} objective functions which are then characterized by the associated membership functions.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} general {{discussion}} of the handling of imprecise and uncertain information in temporal reasoning {{in the framework of}} fuzzy sets and possibility theory. The introduction of fuzzy features in temporal reasoning can be related to different issues. First, it can be motivated by the need of a gradual, linguistic-like description of temporal relations {{even in the face of}} complete information. An extension of Allen relational calculus is proposed, based on fuzzy comparators expressing linguistic <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Fuzzy</b> Allen relations are defined from a fuzzy partition made by three possible fuzzy relations between dates (approximately equal, clearly smaller, and clearly greater). Second, the handling of fuzzy or incomplete information leads to pervade classical Allen relations, and more generally fuzzy Allen relations, with uncertainty. The paper provides a detailed presentation of the calculus of fuzzy Allen relations (including the composition table of these relations). Moreover, the paper discusses the patterns for propagating uncertainty about (fuzzy) Allen relations in a possibilistic way...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—DNA {{matching}} is {{a crucial}} step in sequence alignment. Since sequence alignment is an approximate matching process {{there is a need}} for good approximate algorithms. The process of matching in sequence alignment is generally finding longest common subsequences. However, finding a longest common subsequence may not be the best solution for either a database match or an assembly. An optimal alignment of subsequences is based on several factors, such as quality of bases, length of overlap, etc. Factors such as quality indicate if the data is an actual read or an experimental error. <b>Fuzzy</b> logic allows <b>tolerance</b> of inexactness or errors in sub sequence matching. We propose fuzzy logic for approximate matching of subsequences. Fuzzy characteristic functions are derived for parameters that influence a match. We develop a prototype for a fuzzy assembler. The assembler is designed to work with low quality data which is generally rejected by most of the existing techniques. We test the assembler on sequences from two genome projects namely, Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana. The results are compared with other assemblers. The fuzzy assembler successfully assembled sequences and performed similar and in some cases better than existing techniques...|$|R

40|$|Robot {{reliability}} {{has become}} an increasingly important issue {{in the last few}} years, in part due to the increased application of robots in hazardous and unstructured environments. However, much of this work leads to complex and nonintuitive analysis, which results in many techniques being impractical due to computational complexity or lack of appropriately complex models for the manipulator. In this paper, we will consider the application of notions and techniques from fuzzy logic, fault trees, and Markov modeling to robot fault <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Fuzzy</b> logic lends itself to quantitative reliability calculations in robotics. The crisp failure rates which are usually used are not actually known, while fuzzy logic, due to its ability to work with the actual approximate (fuzzy) failure rates available during the design process, avoids making too many unwarranted assumptions. Fault trees are a standard reliability tool that can easily assimilate fuzzy logic. Markov modeling allows evaluation of multiple failure modes simultaneously, and is thus an appropriate method of modeling failures in redundant robotic systems. However, no method of applying fuzzy logic to Markov models was known to the authors. This opens up the possibility of new techniques for reliability using Markov modeling and fuzzy logic techniques, which are developed in this paper.

40|$|Parameter {{selection}} {{is a well-known}} problem in the fuzzy clustering community. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem using a computationally intensive approach. We apply this approach to a new method for clustering recently introduced in the literature. It is the <b>fuzzy</b> c-means with <b>tolerance.</b> This method permits data to include some error, and this is modeled by moving data in a particular direction within a particular range when clusters are defined. The proper application of this approach needs the correct definition of the parameter κ. A value that might be different for each record and corresponds to the maximum shift allowed to the data. In this paper, we review this method and we study the definition of this parameter κ when the same value of κ is used for all data elements. Our approach {{is based on the}} analysis of sets of data with increasing noise and an exhaustive analysis of the behavior of the algorithm with different values of κ. The analysis is motivated in privacy preserving data mining. The same approach can be used for parameter selection in other clustering algorithms. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
