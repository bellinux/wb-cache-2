5000|$|One of {{the areas}} where the concept of {{hormesis}} has been explored extensively with respect to its applicability is aging. Since the basic survival capacity of any biological system depends on its homeodynamic (homeostatic) ability, biogerontologists proposed that exposing cells and organisms to mild stress should result in the adaptive or hormetic response with various biological benefits. This idea has now gathered {{a large body of}} supportive evidence showing that repetitive mild stress exposure has anti-aging effects. Exercise is a paradigm for hormesis in this respect. Some of the mild stresses used for such studies on the application of hormesis in aging research and interventions are heat shock, irradiation, prooxidants, <b>hypergravity</b> and food restriction. Some other natural and synthetic molecules, such as celasterols from medicinal herbs and curcumin from the spice turmeric have also been found to have hormetic beneficial effects.

50|$|Ever since Pearl {{proposed}} {{the rate of}} living theory of aging, numerous studies have demonstrated its validity in poikilotherms. In mammals, however, satisfactory experimental demonstration is still lacking because an externally imposed increase of basal metabolic rate of these animals (e.g. by placement in the cold) is usually accompanied by general homeostatic disturbance and stress. The present study {{was based on the}} finding that rats exposed to slightly increased gravity are able to adapt with little chronic stress but at a higher level of basal metabolic expenditure (increased 'rate of living'). The rate of aging of 17-month-old rats that had been exposed to 3.14 g in an animal centrifuge for 8 months was larger than of controls as shown by apparently elevated lipofuscin content in heart and kidney, reduced numbers and increased size of mitochondria of heart tissue, and inferior liver mitochondria respiration (reduced 'efficiency': 20% larger ADP: 0 ratio, P less than 0.01; reduced 'speed': 8% lower respiratory control ratio, P less than 0.05). Steady-state food intake per day per kg body weight, which is presumably proportional to 'rate of living' or specific basal metabolic expenditure, was about 18% higher than in controls (P less than 0.01) after an initial 2-month adaptation period. Finally, though half of the centrifuged animals lived only a little shorter than controls (average about 343 vs. 364 days on the centrifuge, difference statistically nonsignificant), the remaining half (longest survivors) lived on the centrifuge an average of 520 days (range 483-572) compared to an average of 574 days (range 502-615) for controls, computed from onset of centrifugation, or 11% shorter (P less than 0.01). Therefore, these results show that a moderate increase of the level of basal metabolism of young adult rats adapted to <b>hypergravity</b> compared to controls in normal gravity is accompanied by a roughly similar increase in the rate of organ aging and reduction of survival, in agreement with Pearl's rate of living theory of aging, previously experimentally demonstrated only in poikilotherms.|$|E

Embryonic Aplysia were exposed to normogravity or 3 x g or 5. 7 x g and each day samples were analyzed for changes in statocyst, statolith, and body dimensions until they hatched. In addition, early metamorphosed Aplysia (developmental stages 7 - 10) were exposed to <b>hypergravity</b> (2 x g) for 3 weeks, and statoconia number and statocyst and statoconia volumes were determined. We also determined the effects of <b>hypergravity</b> on statoconia production and homeostasis in statocysts isolated from developmental stage 10 Aplysia.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that exposing flies to <b>hypergravity</b> (3 or 5 g) for two weeks at young age {{slightly}} increases longevity of male flies and survival time at 37 °C of both sexes, and delays an age-linked behavioral change. The present experiments tested whether <b>hypergravity</b> could also protect flies from a non-lethal 37 °C heat shock applied at young, middle or old age (2, 4 or 6 weeks of age). Various durations of exposure at 37 °C had similar deleterious effects on climbing activity, spontaneous locomotor activity and learning in flies that lived or not in <b>hypergravity</b> at young age. Therefore, <b>hypergravity</b> does not protect the behavior of flies from a deleterious non-lethal heat shock. <b>Hypergravity</b> increased longevity of virgin males and decreased that of mated ones; it also increased longevity of virgins at 25 °C, the usual rearing temperature, but not at 30 °C. Thus, the positive effect of <b>hypergravity</b> on longevity is observed only if flies are not subjected to living conditions decreasing longevity, like mating and high temperature. Finally, 4 weeks-old males that lived in <b>hypergravity</b> at young age lived slightly longer (+ 15 %) after a non-lethal heat shock (60 or 90 min at 37 °C) than flies that always lived at 1 g, but this positive effect of <b>hypergravity</b> was not observed in females or in older males. Therefore, all these results show that <b>hypergravity</b> exposure can help male middle-aged flies recovering from a heat shock, but does not protect them from behavioral impairments linked to this shock: a mild stress occurring at young age can partially protect from a moderate stress at middle age. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

In the current study, a similar parallel experimental design {{was employed to}} ascertain the effects of <b>hypergravity</b> on ovarian and hypophyseal function. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that <b>hypergravity</b> exposure during the post-implantation stage of pregnancy would not alter antepartum and postpartum ovarian and hypophyseal function. METHODS: Pregnant rats were assigned to <b>hypergravity</b> (1. 5 G, 1. 75 G, or 2. 0 G), rotational control, or stationary control groups (n = 10 each group) beginning on gestation day 11 and ending on day 20. Hypophyseal and ovarian analyses were conducted on 5 of the animals from each group at day 20. The remaining animals in each group were {{allowed to go to}} term and the same analyses were conducted 3 h postpartum. RESULTS: <b>Hypergravity</b> at all levels decreased the percent body mass gain from gestation day 11 to 20 (p < 0. 05); however, the wet weight of the pituitaries and ovaries was not changed. There was no effect of <b>hypergravity</b> on the number of healthy or atretic antral follicles of any size at gestation day 20 or postpartum. The number of corpora lutea of pregnancy was decreased in all <b>hypergravity</b> groups, but the number of live fetuses at gestation day 20 or pups at term was not altered. Plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, and progesterone were not changed at gestation day 20 or postpartum. Pituitary content of LH, FSH, and prolactin was not altered by <b>hypergravity</b> at gestation day 20, but LH content was significantly increased (p < 0. 05) at 1. 5 and 1. 75 G postpartum. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that <b>hypergravity,</b> up to and including 2. 0 G, is compatible with maintenance of pregnancy and has minimal effects on hypophyseal parameters.

These results indicate that <b>hypergravity</b> modifies the signal transduction of ionizing radiation through p 53 in the cells...|$|E
40|$|Gravity {{alteration}} (micro- and <b>hypergravity)</b> {{is known}} to influence cell functions. As guanosine 3 ', 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) {{plays an important role}} in human melanocyte functions and different guanylyl cyclase isoforms are responsible for cGMP synthesis in human non-metastatic and metastatic melanoma cells, we investigated the effects of <b>hypergravity</b> on the regulation of cGMP levels in cultured human melanocytes and in melanoma cell lines with different metastatic potentials. <b>Hypergravity</b> was produced by horizontal centrifugal acceleration. Here we report that long-term application of <b>hypergravity</b> (up to 5 g for 24 h) stimulated cGMP efflux in cultured melanocytes and in non-metastatic melanoma cells in the presence of 0. 1 mM 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX), a non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. Under these conditions, cAMP synthesis and melanin production were up-regulated in pigmented melanocytes and non-metastatic melanoma cells. <b>Hypergravity</b> also stimulated cGMP transport in the presence of 1 microM trequinsin, an inhibitor of cGMP-binding PDE (PDE 5) and of transport by multidrug resistance proteins MRP 4 / 5, whereas 50 microM trequinsin partially inhibited cGMP transport. Transport was further inhibited by probenecid, an inhibitor of endogenous non-selective transporters as well as of MRP 4 / 5 and by cycloheximide as an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, <b>hypergravity</b> did not affect cGMP efflux in metastatic melanoma cells, which might be related to an up-regulated cGMP efflux at 1 g. The results of the present study indicate that <b>hypergravity</b> may stimulate cGMP efflux in melanocytes and in non-metastatic melanoma cells most probably by an enhanced expression of endogenous transporters and/or MRP 4 / 5. Thus, an altered acceleration vector may induce signaling events in melanocytic cell...|$|E
