40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{numerical}} framework to investigate ship motions in head train waves with sufficient accuracy and least computational and financial effort. OpenFOAM CFD software is utilized along with the waves 2 <b>Foam</b> <b>package</b> to assess the problem. Due {{to the complexity of}} the problem three steps are taken to reach the goal. The first step was a systematic grid refinement study of wave propagation in a two-dimensional wave flume tank. An example ocean wave was defined using a grid with a specific number of divisions over the wave height and with a specific aspect ratio. The cells in the directions of wave height and wavelength are refined four times, each time with factor of square root of two. Two courant numbers were considered, resulting in a total of 50 cases. The results show no adverse effect with long cells meaning higher edge length in the wave-propagation direction. It was found that tall cells (high y-to-x aspect ratio) caused ripples in the free-surface. It was found that the number of cells over the wave height has the most impact on the computed wave amplitude. It was also found that the phase shift {{is a function of the}} time step and the number of cells in the wavelength direction. In the second step, forces on a cylinder in a three-dimensional domain were assessed considering two grids. Comparing the results with experimental data shows an excellent agreement for both cases. The third step was computing ship motions with a constant forward speed in head waves. SST turbulence model is utilized to deal with turbulence features of the problem. The ship is set to pitch and heave freely, but other motion components were fixed. Due to the symmetric nature of the problem, only a half-domain is simulated to reduce the computational effort. The results were compared to experimental data, and favorable accuracy is obtained. At the final stage, the ship model was enlarged with a factor of 5 and assessed with a comparable set-up and mesh to model scale simulation. The result shows higher values of pitch motions. Some possible reasons for these discrepancies between different model scales are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Floating wind {{turbines}} (FWTs) are proposed {{as a method}} to harness the significant wind energy resource in deep water. International research efforts {{have led to the}} development of coupled numerical global analysis tools for FWTs in order to understand their behavior under wind and wave actions. The hydrodynamic models in such tools are typically based on first-(and second-) order potential flow theory, sometimes also including Morison s equation. In order to accurately model highly nonlinear waves, their interaction with a floating platform, and obtain estimates of the resulting loads on the structure, a numerical wave tank approach is generally needed. In this thesis, the response of floating structures to nonlinear wave loading is investigated by means of two different numerical approaches: a fully nonlinear Navier-Stokes/VOF solver and a second-order potential flow theory solver. Firstly, the fully nonlinear Navier-Stokes/VOF numerical wave tank, developed within the open-source CFD toolbox OpenFOAMframework (version 1606 +), is validated against experimental data for two cases. These comprise the response of a 2 D floating box and a 3 D floating vertical cylinder. In order to model the motions of the floating structures, together with the generation and absorption of the waves, the interDyMFoam solver, provided by the OpenFOAMlibrary, is extended with the waves 2 <b>Foam</b> <b>package,</b> developed by Jacobsen at al. (2012). Furthermore, a simple catenary mooring line is implemented for the moored cases. Secondly, a potential flow theory based model of the OC 5 -semisubmersible floating platform is generated. The frequency-domain analysis is done with the Wadam software and the time-domain simulations with SIMO. This model is validated against measurement data from a 1 : 50 scale test campaign performed at the MARIN offshore wave basin and the fully nonlinear validated CFD model. Lastly, both numerical models of the OC 5 -semisubmersible are compared in order to assess the suitability of the diffraction model in two different conditions where nonlinearities are of relevance. The first one involves very long waves, with periods close to 20 s, which are likely to take place under swell wave conditions. These may excite the OC 5 -semisubmersible platform in heave at its natural frequency. The second situation deals with regular waves with increasing steepness. In principle, the fully nonlinear CFD model, if no experimental data is available, is needed to calibrate the diffraction model. However, once the latter is adjusted and validated, results are given at a much lower computational cost. According to the computations throughout this work, when dealing with waves with high steepness and high excitation frequencies, the motions, as well as the peak forces, are properly captured by the diffraction model. However, other local effects of importance for offshore structures, such as wave run-up, or the different components in frequency of the loading, require the use of a fully nonlinear CFD solver. Therefore for preliminary design stages a diffraction model is able to give suitable results regarding the motions and peak inline and vertical forces at a much lower computational cost; however, for detailed design, or optimisation phase stages, where local effects are of relevance, a fully nonlinear CFD model is required...|$|E

Moreover, increasing the PVA ratio ranged from 5 % to 30 % also made the cell sizes became smaller and uniform. The corn granules blended with 15 % PVA (Treatment 26) have potential applications as thermal insulation for their high specific heat values.

Because of its thick peel with high moisture content (75 - 80 %) and water activity (0. 90 - 0. 98), the peel weight accounted for almost half of the total fruit weight. Cell structure and pore size of the peel were examined using the environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). The result showed an open cell foam structure with pore size of approximately 151 ± 31 µm. The pore size was more open and large towards the outer surface. Uniaxial compression tests on pomelo peel samples with and without flavedo showed good reproducible stress-strain curves despite its biological variation. Young’s moduli of both samples were calculated to be 200 - 300 kPa and 110 - 210 kPa, respectively.

While these traditional models are very easy to implement, they have been lacking in benchmarking performance over time. Therefore, this study aims to overcome such limitations of the traditional models by exploring the unknown relationships between performance indicators in five measurement areas: labour, cost, time, utilisation, and administration, throughout five typical steps in warehouse functions (receiving, handling, storing, order picking, and shipping). This study consists of two parts: quantitative study and qualitative study. In quantitative study, the proposed model was generated using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique together with a dataset of 201 warehouses from hard disk drive, animal feed, and <b>foam</b> <b>packaging</b> industries in Thailand. With the use of the AMOS software program, the results show that the SEM model consists of ten indicators that are significant to warehouse performance at level of significance of 0. 05. These indicators are, for example, labour hour, transportation cost, degree of space utilisation, and degree of error-free orders shipped. Importantly, the SEM model was tested whether it was acceptable based on the goodness-of-fit measures. The results show that the values obtained for the five measures: chi-square (p = 0. 217), GFI = 0. 972, NFI = 0. 971, CFI = 0. 995, and RMSEA = 0. 032 indicating that the SEM model was acceptable to measure warehouse performance.

40|$|Fossil-based {{polymeric}} foams, {{based on}} polymers such as polystyrene and polyurethane, {{are important and}} widely employed materials due to their good mechanical properties relative their low density, the low price and the possibility for large-scale production. There are however a few disadvantages with these foamed products. The raw-material originates from a non-renewable resource. In the foaming process some possible less environmentally friendly additives/blowing agents are used. Also, the relatively low price of these foamed articles makes them ideal for single-use packaging and unfortunately they often end up in nature where the slow degradation will ensure that they stay for a long time. One possible way to solve {{at least some of}} the issues relating to fossil-based foamed products would be to use a renewable, non-fossil, raw material. There are several polymers of a non-fossil origin which could serve a primary material for foams and in this thesis two different types of cellulose derivatives were chosen as possible and interesting candidates; hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose (EHEC). The foaming ability of nine different grades of the two cellulose derivatives, five HPMCs and four EHECs, was initially evaluated using a hot-mould process with water as the only blowing agent and plasticiser. The rheological properties of the derivative-water mixtures during a simulated foaming process was assessed using dynamical mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The final foams were characterised with regard to their apparent density. Overall, the HPMC derivatives performed significantly better than the EHECs and a few of the former were therefore selected for extrusion experiments. Three of the HPMC derivatives were evaluated in a small-scale batch extrusion experiment using a capillary viscometer. The results pointed towards the existence of a possible processing window for foaming and one of the derivatives were selected for continuous extrusion trials with water as the only added plasticiser and blowing agent. Foams could be produced using a single-screw extruder and the density of the final foams was assessed. Although some instabilities seemed to exist in the extrusion process, processing conditions giving the best results could be found. In conclusion, HPMC cellulose derivatives could be suitable candidates for production of lightweight, <b>foamed</b> <b>packaging</b> material originating from non-fossil, renewable resources. The material could be processed in a continuous extrusion process, with only water as plasticiser and blowing agent.

Recent developments in the field of PP foams are also considered, focusing on the combination of cellular structure control via foaming and the incorporation of micro and nanosized functional fillers, with the ultimate objective of developing PP-based foams with a wide range of properties and unique characteristics, from electrically conductive foams through the incorporation of conductive carbon-based nanofillers to foams with direction-dependent transport properties.
