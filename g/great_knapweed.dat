50|$|Cuddington Meadows is a Grade I Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation. The {{site was}} shown as two {{enclosures}} {{on the open}} Banstead Downs on an early nineteenth century map, and it was later part of Walnut Tree Farm, which became Cuddington Hospital in 1897. The hospital closed in 1984, and in the late 1990s the land was transferred to Sutton Council to be managed for nature conservation. It is mainly chalk grassland with some scrub. Its most important feature is a variety of unusual flowering plants, including <b>greater</b> <b>knapweed,</b> lady's bedstraw and field scabious.|$|R
50|$|Botanically, three {{different}} zones can be distinguished: the shore area, the raised bog and {{the slopes of}} the maar basin. In the shore area, as well as the reeds there are communities of yellow iris, white water-lily, yellow loosestrife, purple loosestrife and club-rush. The slopes of the maar basin are dominated by a mix of dry grassland and woodland edge vegetation. In addition to Breckland thyme and oregano, there is restharrow, hare's-foot clover, hop trefoil, narrow-leaved everlasting pea, musk mallow, clustered bellflower, downy hemp-nettle, fox and cubs, brown <b>knapweed,</b> <b>greater</b> <b>knapweed,</b> small scabious, woodruff and large communities of rosebay willow-herb. Neophytes that may be seen include garden lupins and large-flowered mountain trumpets.|$|R
50|$|Succisa pratensis is a {{perennial}} herb up to 1m tall, growing from a basal rosette of simple or distantly-toothed, lanceolate leaves. Its unlobed leaves {{distinguish it from}} Knautia arvensis (Field scabious). The plant may be distinguished from Centaurea scabiosa (<b>greater</b> <b>knapweed)</b> by having its leaves in opposite pairs, not alternate as in knapweed. The bluish to violet (occasionally pink) flowers are borne in tight compound flower heads or capitula. Individual flowers are tetramerous, with a four-lobed epicalyx and calyx and a four-lobed corolla. Male and female flowers are produced on different flower heads (gynodioecious), the female flower heads being smaller. The flowering period in the British Isles is from June until October.|$|R
5|$|The {{plants and}} animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist {{plants and animals}}, {{some of which are}} rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, <b>greater</b> <b>knapweed,</b> harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious. It is {{one of a series of}} flower-rich habitats, which Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The skylark also nests on the hill.|$|R
50|$|Devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), saw-wort (Serratula tinctoria) and betony (Stachys officinalis) are all {{abundant}} and exemplify the oceanic {{character of the}} chalk grassland on the plain, a feature which is confined to South West England. Similarly restricted is a community in which dwarf sedge Carex humilis forms a conspicuous component. This type of grassland has its stronghold in Wiltshire and occurs on the less disturbed areas of the central ranges. Herb diversity is generally lower in the tall, upright brome-dominated swards, but wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium) and <b>greater</b> <b>knapweed</b> (Centaurea scabiosa) are characteristic. Parasitic on the latter species is knapweed broomrape (Orobanche elatior), occurring in greater quantity on the plain {{than anywhere else in}} Britain. False-oat grass (Arrhenatherum elatius) grassland is also widespread, but is particularly a feature of the western ranges, often indicating areas of past cultivation.|$|R

50|$|Certain knapweeds have a {{tendency}} to dominate large stretches of landscape together with a few other plants, typically one or two grasses and as many other large herbs. The common knapweed (C. nigra) for example is plentiful in the mesotrophic grasslands of England and nearby regions. It is most prominently found in pastures or meadows dominated by cock's-foot (Dactylis glomerata) as well as either of crested dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and false oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius). It is also often found in mesotrophic grassland on rendzinas and similar calcareous soils in association with glaucous sedge (Carex flacca), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), and either tor-grass (Brachypodium pinnatum) and rough hawkbit (Leontodon hispidus), or upright brome (Bromus erectus). In these grasslands, <b>greater</b> <b>knapweed</b> (C. scabiosa) is found much more rarely by comparison, often in association with red fescue (Festuca rubra) in addition to cock's-foot and false oat-grass.|$|R
40|$|Naive {{male and}} female silver Y moths, Autographa gamma (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), were {{attracted}} in a flight tunnel assay to potted creeping thistle, Cirsium arvense (Asteraceae), butterfly-orchid, Platanthera bifolia (Orchidaceae), soapwort, Saponaria officinalis (Caryophyllaceae), <b>greater</b> <b>knapweed,</b> Centaurea scabiosa (Asteraceae), red clover, Trifolium pratense (Fabaceae), and catnip, Nepeta faasseni (Labiatae), plants with flowers. The most attractive plants were C. arvense, P. bifolia and S. officinalis that elicited 87, 78 and 65 %, source contacts, respectively. C. scabiosa was less attractive eliciting 43 %, response. T. pratense and N. faasseni showed the least attraction eliciting 28 and 26 % source contacts, respectively. A cotton plant used as control, was not attractive. Floral volatiles from the investigated plant species were collected using headspace sampling technique. Samples were analysed using gas chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection, and electrophysiologically active compounds were identified by coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Consistent electrophysiological responses were elicited by twelve compounds from headspace of C. arvense, thirteen compounds from P. bifolia, eleven compounds from S. officinalis, nine from C. seabiosa, ten from T. pratense and two from N. faasseni. Most of the active compounds were specific {{for one or two}} species, while benzyl benzoate was present in four and benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol in three species. Floral scents of C. arvense, P. bifolia and S. officinalis, the most attractive flowers, were dominated by aromatic compounds that were not abundant in the scent of other flowers. To conclude, the results demonstrate the absence of a common denominator of odours present in flowers of different plants visited by A. gamma...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by the Society for Range Management and can be found at: [URL] our ability to use invasive plants for producing commodities is central to the agricultural industry. Our objective was to evaluate Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens [L. ] DC.) as a winter feed supplement for ruminant livestock. In Experiment 1, we utilized three ruminally cannulated steers in a completely randomized design to compare the ruminal degradation characteristics of alfalfa and Russian knapweed. In the second experiment, Russian knapweed and alfalfa were compared as protein supplements using 48 midgestation, beef cows (530 ± 5 kg) offered ad libitum hard fescue (Festuca brevipila Tracey) straw in an 84 -d study. Treatments included an unsupplemented control and alfalfa or Russian knapweed provided on an iso-nitrogenous basis. In Experiment 1, the rate and effective degradability of neutral detergent fiber was greater for alfalfa compared with Russian knapweed (P ≤ 0. 02). Ruminal lag time for NDF (period before measurable disappearance began) was <b>greater</b> for <b>knapweed</b> (P = 0. 03). Soluble nitrogen, rate of N degradation, rumen degradable N, and effective degradability of N were all greater for alfalfa compared with Russian knapweed (P < 0. 01). In Experiment 2, supplementation increased (P < 0. 01) cow weight gain and BCS compared to the unsupplemented control with no difference between alfalfa and Russian knapweed (P = 0. 47). There was no difference (P = 0. 60) in the quantity of straw offered between the unsupplemented cows and supplemented groups, but alfalfa fed cows were offered approximately 11...|$|R
40|$|Diffuse {{knapweed}} (Centaurea diffusa) is an introduced annual or short-lived perennial from Eurasia {{that has}} become a threat to native rangelands in the Pacific Northwest. Military training activities on the Yakima Training Center (YTC) increase the likelihood that knapweed will expand its range at YTC. This study, conducted in a major watershed at YTC, focused on: 1) how a variety of environmental variables influences knapweed distribution, 2) the use of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to map existing knapweed populations, and 3) the use of a logistic regression model and geographical information systems (GIS) to create a potential knapweed habitat map. Topographic and climatic factors had the <b>greatest</b> influence on <b>knapweed</b> distribution. Knapweed has a competitive advantage over those which may have some water stress due to increased temperatures (i. e., lower elevations and south slopes). Lower shrub density, greater percent bare ground, and lower percent perennial aerial cover also made for ideal knapweed habitat. Knapweed density decreased as slope steepness, pH, and percent rock cover increased. Using TM imagery to define existing knapweed populations was unsuccessful because most knapweed stands were less than 30 m X 30 m and had little effect on the TM image values. However, the TM imagery was useful in defining potential knapweed habitat along with other variables. Sixty percent of the Selah watershed has the potential to support knapweed. Approximately 68...|$|R
