In the 2000s and 2010s, the show dealt with controversial issues such as homosexuality, gambling, prostitution, surrogacy, and exotic dancing. Health issues were also focused on, including multiple sclerosis, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, amnesia, congenital <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia,</b> and alzheimer's disease.

25|$|A {{congenital}} <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> is {{a distinct}} problem, occurring in up to 1 in 2000 births, and requiring pediatric surgery. Intestinal organs may herniate through several parts of the diaphragm, posterolateral (in Bochdalek's triangle, resulting in Bochdalek's hernia), or anteromedial-retrosternal (in the cleft of Larrey/Morgagni's foramen, resulting in Morgagni-Larrey hernia, or Morgagni's hernia).|$|E
25|$|Other {{anomalies}} of {{the classic}} Potter sequence infant include a parrot beak nose, redundant skin, and the most common characteristic of infants with BRA which is a skin fold of tissue extending from the medial canthus across the cheek. The ears are slightly low and pressed against the head making them appear large. The adrenal glands often appear as small oval discs pressed against the posterior abdomen due {{to the absence of}} upward renal pressure. The bladder is often small, nondistensible and may be filled with a minute amount of fluid. In males the vas deferens and seminal vesicles may be absent, while in females the uterus and upper vagina may be absent. Other abnormalities include anal atresia, absence of the rectum and sigmoid colon, esophageal and duodenal atresia, and a single umbilical artery. Presence of a <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> is also common in these fetuses/infants. Additionally, the alveolar sacs of the lungs fail to properly develop {{as a result of the}} reduced volume of amniotic fluid. Labor is often induced between 22 and 36 weeks of gestation (however, some of these pregnancies may go to term) and unaborted infants typically survive for only a few minutes to a few hours. These infants will eventually die as either a result of pulmonary hypoplasia or renal failure.|$|E
500|$|Skelton was {{delivering}} {{an intense}} performance live each week, and the strain showed in physical illness. [...] In 1952, {{he was drinking}} heavily from the constant pain of a <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> and marital problems; he thought about divorcing Georgia. NBC agreed to film his shows in the 1952–1953 season at Eagle Lion Studios, next to the Sam Goldwyn Studio, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood. Later the show {{was moved to the}} new NBC television studios in Burbank. Procter & Gamble was unhappy with the filming of the television show, and insisted that Skelton return to live broadcasts. The situation caused him to think about leaving television at that point. Declining ratings prompted sponsor Procter & Gamble to cancel his show in the spring of 1953, with Skelton announcing that any future television shows of his would be variety shows, where he would not have the almost constant burden of performing. Beginning with the 1953–1954 season, he switched to CBS, where he remained until 1970. For the initial move to CBS, he had no sponsor. The network gambled by covering all expenses for the program on a sustaining basis; his first CBS sponsor was Geritol. He curtailed his drinking and his ratings at CBS began to improve, especially after he began appearing on Tuesday nights for co-sponsors Johnson's Wax and Pet Milk Company.|$|E

30|$|Bochdalek hernia occurs through {{defects in}} the pars lumbaris and pars costalis {{and is more}} common on the left side.

In adults, Bochdalek hernias are often underreported and can be identified in 0.17 % [37] to 6 % [38] of patients. Acquired hernias represent defects or tears in the diaphragm. <b>Diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> with larger defects have a higher likelihood of being acquired after blunt trauma or a vigorous bout of coughing in a paralysed or thin hemidiaphragm rather than being congenital defects in the diaphragm.|$|R

Surgical correction is recommended in all cases to avoid the risk of complications, especially bowel strangulation. We present a rare case of a 7 months-old male, initially seen by the Emergency Department for respiratory symptoms; a chest X-ray was therefore ordered, which showed a right paracardiac mass (intestinal loops of bowel with gas pattern and air-fluid leve).

2500|$|Injuries to the {{diaphragm}} are usually accompanied by other injuries, and they indicate that more severe injury may have occurred. [...] The outcome often depends more on associated injuries than on {{the diaphragm}}atic injury itself. [...] Since the pressure is higher in the abdominal cavity than the chest cavity, rupture of the diaphragm is almost always associated with herniation of abdominal organs into the chest cavity, which is called a traumatic <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia.</b> This herniation can interfere with breathing, and blood supply can be cut off to organs that herniate through the diaphragm, damaging them.|$|E

2500|$|Hernias {{may also}} {{occur as a}} result of {{congenital}} malformation, a congenital <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia.</b> When the pleuroperitoneal membranes fail to fuse, the diaphragm does not act as an effective barrier between the abdomen and thorax. Herniation is usually of the left, and commonly through the posterior lumbocostal triangle, although rarely through the anterior foramen of Morgagni. The contents of the abdomen, including the intestines, may be present in the thorax, which may impact development of the growing lungs and lead to hypoplasia. This condition is present in 1 out of 2,000 births. [...] A large herniation has a mortality rate of three out of four, and requires immediate surgical repair.|$|E
2500|$|Computed {{tomography}} has {{an increased}} accuracy of diagnosis over X-ray, but no specific findings on a CT scan exist {{to establish a}} diagnosis. [...] Although CT scanning increases chances that diaphragmatic rupture will be diagnosed before surgery, the rate of diagnosis before surgery is still only 31–43.5%. Another diagnostic method is laparotomy, but this misses diaphragmatic ruptures up to 15% of the time. [...] Often diaphragmatic injury is discovered during a laparotomy that was undertaken because of another abdominal injury. Because laparotomies are more common in those with penetrating trauma then {{compared to those who}} experienced a blunt force injury, diaphragmatic rupture is found more often in these persons. Thoracoscopy is more reliable in detecting diaphragmatic tears than laparotomy and is especially useful when chronic <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> is suspected.|$|E

30|$|MRI can {{identify}} non-acute pericardial and <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias.</b> MRI without intravenous contrast can characterise the hernia {{in patients who}} cannot receive contrast for CT (renal failure, history of anaphylaxis after previous contrast medium administration, etc.). Multiple acquisitions can be obtained, which can help characterise herniation of the abdominal contents such as the liver or spleen since these can be suboptimally characterised on a single-phase contrast-enhanced CT examination [3]. Steady-state free-precession sequences are used to identify in utero foetal congenital <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias.</b> T 2 -weighted axial, coronal and sagittal images are helpful in identifying defects in the diaphragm or the chest wall. Contrast-enhanced images after injection of intravenous gadolinium can characterise contents of the hernia sac and also assess for any complications in the herniated solid viscera.

40|$|SUMMARY Respiratory {{function}} {{studies were}} carried out in 22 infants who had successful repair of <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>herniae</b> of the Bochdalek type. Thoracic gas volume was initially reduced in only 3 of these, but subsequent studies showed that improvement occurred. There were no consistent abnormalities in either dynamic compliance or mean pulmonary conductance. This is evidence that there is rapid adaptation which compensates for any alteration in the parenchymatous tissue in the lungs or abnormalities in the bronchial tree in infants soon after the repair of congenital diaphrag-matic herniae. Further studies are necessary to determine the changes in these lungs with growth. There is considerable pathological evidence that significant hypoplasia of both lungs is present in infants who die soon after birth with congenital <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>herniae</b> of the Bochdalek type. However, there have been conflicting reports concerning the type of hypoplasia present.
