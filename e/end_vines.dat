40|$|It {{has been}} shown that vine copulas {{constructed}} from bivariate t copulas can provide good fits to multivariate financial asset return data. However, there might be stronger tail dependence of returns in the joint lower tail of assets than the upper tail. To this <b>end,</b> <b>vine</b> copula models with appropriate choices of bivariate reflection asymmetric linking copulas will be used to assess such tail asymmetries. Comparisons of various vine copulas are made in terms of likelihood fit and forecasting of extreme quantiles...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: higher {{basidium}} fungi. The work {{is aimed at}} studying the xylanase activity of the higher basidium fungi and accumulation of the microbe protein with the bioconversion of the vegetation waste. For the first time, the comparative investigations of the growth and xylanase activity of the higher basidiomycetes with their deepen cultivating {{in the presence of}} the citrus marc and the IFF <b>vine</b> <b>ends</b> have been performed. A comparatively quick-growing strain of the basidiomycetes: a producer of the complex of the out-cell enzymes and protein has been selected. The ability of the basidiomycetes to utilize the citrus marc and the <b>vine</b> <b>ends</b> has been proved. The method of obtaining the complex of the protein-enzyme preparation according to the laboratory specifications has been developed.

50|$|Calamus muelleri, {{commonly}} known as lawyer vine, or wait-a-while, is a vine-like climbing palm with sharp hooks along its leaf sheath, leaf edged, and along flagella that extend from the <b>end</b> of each <b>vine.</b> The palm is common in rainforest in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, especially in National Parks such as Nightcap National Park and Lamington National Park.|$|R
50|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 1800s a strong colony of working artists had {{established}} a small 'Montmartre' on the upper <b>end</b> of <b>Vine</b> Street in Cincinnati. One group of artists gathered informally as the Cincinnati Sketch Club and had its origins in the studio of John Rettig in 1883. The loose collection of artists became the Cincinnati Art Club on 15 March 1890. Its first president was John Rettig and consisted of 14 members (which included a pet dog so the membership number wasn't an unlucky 13). The founding members were: Rettig, Clarence D. Bartlett, James McLaughlin, Edward S. Butler, Matthew A. Daly, Albert O. Elzner, Edward Johnson, Remmington Lane, Leon van Loo, Lewis C. Lutz, William A. McCord, Perry Morris and Joseph Henry Sharp.|$|R
50|$|The vines are {{selected}} by a village elder and matched with each jumper’s weight without any mechanical calculations. The vines {{need to be}} supple, elastic, and full of sap {{in order to be}} safe. The <b>ends</b> of the <b>vines</b> are shredded to allow the fibres to be looped around the ankles of the jumpers. If the vine is too long, the diver can hit the ground hard, but if the vine is too short, then the diver can collide with the tower.|$|R
5000|$|Vine Street and Jefferson Avenue {{were both}} realigned in the 1970s {{to provide a}} bypass around the Corryville Neighborhood Business District. Previously, Vine St and Short Vine formed a five-leg {{intersection}} with Auburn Avenue and East and West Corry Streets. The south legs of Vine and North leg of Auburn were removed {{to make room for}} a commercial shopping center. However, Vine St and Short Vine still divide the east and west sides of Cincinnati. The Jefferson Avenue [...] "bypass" [...] is still {{on the west side of}} the city. The north <b>end</b> of Short <b>Vine</b> connects to Vine Street at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive intersection.|$|R

The annual festival {{has also been a}} launching platform for many Australian artists, with various acts performing on the tour multiple times, such as Silverchair, Regurgitator, Powderfinger, You Am I, The Living <b>End,</b> Jebediah, The <b>Vines,</b> Grinspoon, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Kisschasy, and Wolfmother.|$|R
40|$|Microclimate in Podgorica {{vineyards}} and {{its effect}} on the formation, maturing and rupturing of cleistothecia, and disease outbreak, was studied. An analysis of collected data on minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation over the periods November-April (2001 / 2002, 2002 / 2003 and 2003 / 2004) and April-July (2002, 2003 and 2004) and their comparison with the average values over a 50 -year period, indicate that neither temperature nor precipitation act as a limiting factor for disease outbreak and development in Podgorica vineyards. Over the trial period, conditions were favourable for the formation and maturing of cleistothecia between November and April. Asum of 1100 ºC mean daily temperature was reached by mid-March. From bud burst to <b>end</b> of <b>vine</b> flowering, the conditions were again nearly optimal both for ascospore release from cleistothecia and primary infection, and for secondary infection. Initial symptoms appeared on lower leaves and inflorescences. Cleistothecia appeared inall green parts of grapevine. In 2002, and 2004, conditions were favourable for a secondary infection of bunches, leaves and canes from April to mid-July. Conditions for secondary infection were less favourable {{in the second half of}} June 2003. That year was characterized by warmer weather with less rainfall, especially in June and July. In 2004, precipitation and temperature were lower than in 2002, which resulted in a slightly less severe outbreak of disease...|$|R
6000|$|... "After Baxter and I had {{finished}} our business I {{told him about}} the cot, for if we carried out Anita's plan it would be necessary for him to know where we were. Then, putting on waterproof coats, we rode over to the place which had excited my wife's desire to become a cotter. We found the house small but in good order, with four rooms and an adjunct at one <b>end.</b> There were <b>vines</b> growing over it, and at the side of it a garden--a garden with an irregular hedge around two sides; it was a poor sort of a garden, mostly weeds, I thought, as I glanced at it. The stream of water was a pretty little brook, and Baxter, who rode to the head of it, said he thought it could be made much better.|$|R
50|$|Although nearly 700 years old, {{the rows}} of choir stalls have been {{preserved}} in excellent condition. These were built {{during the period from}} 1300-1370 and they were used by the monks for holding their seven daily prayer services. The stalls were originally placed a few metres eastwards towards the main altar. The reason for the longitudinal positioning of the stalls {{lies in the fact that}} the Gregorian hourly prayers were sung alternately by the monks on either side. The canopies above the stalls, with intricately carved roses, are of the highest quality and were completed around 1380-1400. The ornamental work was done in a style matching the cross altar (1360) and was followed by work done on the octagon (1420). Of special interest are some unique carvings on the pew ends: the pelican style pew <b>end</b> with the <b>vine,</b> ivy and the eagle. Near the lectern are pew ends with carved lilies and monks (1310). The latter ones show, in the upper part, the annunciation of Mary and, in the lower part, St. Benedict, the founder of the Benedictine Order and the author of the rules of monastic life as well as St. Bernard of Clairvaux, the spiritual father of the Cistercian Order.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When {{we were at}} last summoned, {{the fire}} had been burning {{for more than four}} hours. The pit was filled with a {{white-hot}} mass shooting out little tongues of white flame, and throwing out a heat beside which the scorching sun was a pleasant relief. A number of men were engaged, with long poles to which a loop of thick vine had been attached, in noosing the pieces of unburnt wood by twisting the pole, like a horse's twitch, until the loop was tight, and dragging the log out by main force. When the wood was all out there remained a conical pile of glowing stones {{in the middle of the}} pit. Ten men now drove the butts of green saplings into the base of the pile, and held the upper end while a stout vine was passed behind the row of saplings. A dozen men grasped each <b>end</b> of the <b>vine,</b> and with loud shouts hauled with all their might. The saplings, like the teeth of an enormous rake, tore through the pile of stones, flattening them out towards the opposite edge of the pit. The saplings were then driven in on the other side and the stones raked in the opposite direction, then sideways, until the bottom of the pit was covered with an even layer of hot stones. This process had taken fully half an hour, but any doubt as to the heat of the stones at the end was set at rest by the tongues of flame that played continually among them. The cameras were hard at work, and a large crowd of people pressed inwards towards the pit as the moment drew near. They were all excited except Jonathan, who preserved, even in the supreme moment, the air of holy calm that never leaves his face. All eyes are fixed expectant on the dense bush behind the clearing, whence the Shadrachs, Meshachs and Abednegos of the Pacific are to emerge. There is a cry of [...] "Vutu! Vutu!" [...] and forth from the bush, two and two, march fifteen men, dressed in garlands and fringes. They tramp straight to the brink of the pit. The leading pair show something like fear in their faces, but do not pause, perhaps because the rest would force them to move forward. They step down upon the stones and continue their march round the pit, planting their feet squarely and firmly on each stone. The cameras snap, the crowd surges forward, the bystanders fling in great bundles of green leaves. But the bundles strike the last man of the procession and cut him off from his fellows; so he stays where he is, trampling down the leaves as they are thrown to line the pit, in a dense cloud of steam from the boiling sap. The rest leap back to his assistance, shouting and trampling, and the pit turns into the mouth of an Inferno, filled with dusky frenzied fiends, half seen through the dense volume that rolls up to heaven and darkens the sunlight. After the leaves, palm-leaf baskets of the dracaena root are flung to them, more leaves, and then bystanders and every one join in shovelling earth over all till the pit is gone, and a smoking mound of fresh earth takes its place. This will keep hot for four days, and then the masawe will be cooked.|$|R
