5|$|Between 1848 and 1905, {{traffic on}} Beverley Beck more than trebled, from 33,498 tons to 101,540 tons. Coal and other {{minerals}} accounted for around {{one quarter of}} the traffic in 1905, while goods carried in 1906 included fertiliser, burnt ore, <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> scrap metal. Commercial traffic continued into the 1970s, when tolls of £2,365 were collected on 28,169 tons of cargo. Traffic on the Driffield Navigation was relatively steady between 1871 and 1905, falling slightly from 35,654 to 32,666 tons. Goods carried included coal, linseed, cottonseed, wheat, <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> artificial manures. In 1922, £7 of income was received from pleasure craft using the navigation. Traffic declined during the 1930s, with commercial traffic finally ceasing in 1944. The Leven Canal carried 4,242 tons in 1888 and 4,546 in 1905, but then succumbed to road competition, and closed in 1935.|$|E

40|$|Marama bean, an underutilised legume in {{southern}} Africa, {{is a good}} source of protein, fat and phenolic compounds, the latter known to have potential health benefits. Marama flours, sorghum meal, marama– sorghum composite <b>flours</b> <b>and</b> porridges were analysed for proximate composition, amino acid composition, energy value, fatty acid composition, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Compositing sorghum meal (70 %) with marama flours (30 %) significantly increased the protein and fat contents in <b>flours</b> <b>and</b> porridges. Energy values of marama–sorghum composite porridges were 11 – 24 % higher than sorghum porridge. Lysine content was 3 – 4 times higher in marama–sorghum porridges than in sorghum porridge. There was an increase in oleic acid as sorghum meal was composited with marama flour. There was a positive correlation between the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity in all samples. Use of marama flour in sorghum composite <b>flours</b> <b>and</b> porridges improved the nutritional quality and antioxidant activity. This research was sponsored by the EU MARAMA II PROJECT.

5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites.

5|$|According to {{archaeologist}} Karl Lorenz, who excavated several Natchez settlements, {{another factor}} that complicated relations between the Natchez and the colonists {{was the fact that}} the French did not well understand the Natchez political structure.

In truth, each village was semi-autonomous, and the Great Sun's power only extended to the villages of <b>Flour</b> <b>and</b> Tioux (with which the Grand Village was allied) and not to the three pro-British villages of White Apple, Jenzenaque and Grigra. When the Great Sun died in 1728 and was succeeded by his inexperienced nephew, the pro-British villages became more powerful than the pro-French villages centered at Natchez.|$|E
