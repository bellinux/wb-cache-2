5|$|Sanchez entered spring {{practice}} {{after the}} 2008 {{season as the}} front-runner {{to take over the}} starting quarterback position, but faced strong competition from redshirt freshman Aaron Corp and Mitch Mustain, a transfer from Arkansas, where he had been the starting quarterback; Mustain, like Sanchez, was named the top quarterback in the nation upon the conclusion of high school career in 2006. By the end of spring practice, Carroll announced Sanchez would be the starting quarterback heading into the fall. During the first week of fall camp, Sanchez dislocated his left kneecap during warm-ups prior to practice; trainers immediately put the kneecap back into place. After missing nearly three weeks, Sanchez was cleared to play in the opener against Virginia. Before the opener, Sanchez was contacted by USC's previous three quarterbacks—Carson Palmer, Leinart and Booty—who wished him well and offered <b>general</b> <b>advice.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Ambarawa brought Sudirman greater {{attention}} {{at a national}} level, and generally silenced whispers that he was unfit for military command because of his lack of military experience and previous employment as a schoolteacher. Ultimately, Sudirman was chosen as his loyalty was undoubted, while Oerip's former pledge of loyalty to the Dutch led to him being viewed with suspicion. Sudirman was confirmed as commander-in-chief on 18December 1945. He was replaced {{as head of the}} Fifth Division by Colonel Sutiro, and began to focus on strategic problems. This was done partly by establishing a board of advisors, which gave the <b>general</b> <b>advice</b> on both political and military issues. Oerip handled many of the military matters.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, the major {{shipping}} lines financed Swedish emigrant agents {{and paid for}} the production of large quantities of emigration propaganda. Much of this promotional material, such as leaflets, was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by shipping line agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class, which grew increasingly alarmed at seeing the agricultural labor force leave the country. It was a Swedish 19th-century cliché to blame the falling ticket prices and the pro-emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze of emigration, but modern historians have varying views about the real importance of such factors. Brattne and Åkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the ticket prices as a possible third force between push and pull. They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any decisive influence on Swedish emigration. While the companies remain unwilling, , to open their archives to researchers, the limited sources available suggest that ticket prices did drop in the 1880s, but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price-fixing. On the other hand, H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890, encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate. The research of Brattne and Åkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the shipping line agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World, as simply emphasize the comforts and advantages of the particular company. Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished, and the <b>general</b> <b>advice</b> to emigrants brief and factual. Newspaper advertising, while very common, tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content.|$|E

25|$|In many {{countries}} the traditional divisions between barristers and solicitors are breaking down. Barristers once enjoyed {{a monopoly on}} appearances before the higher courts, but in Great Britain this has now been abolished, and solicitor advocates can generally appear for clients at trial. Increasingly, firms of solicitors are keeping even the most advanced advisory and litigation work in-house for economic and client relationship reasons. Similarly, the prohibition on barristers taking instructions directly from the public has also been widely abolished. But, in practice, direct instruction is still a rarity in most jurisdictions, partly because barristers with narrow specializations, or who are only really trained for advocacy, {{are not prepared to}} provide <b>general</b> <b>advice</b> to members of the public.|$|E

500|$|Semi-desert cacti need careful watering. <b>General</b> <b>advice</b> {{is hard to}} give, {{since the}} {{frequency}} of watering required depends on where the cacti are being grown, {{the nature of the}} growing medium, and the original habitat of the cacti. Brown says that more cacti are lost through the [...] "untimely application of water than for any other reason" [...] and that even during the dormant winter season, cacti need some water. Other sources say that water can be withheld during winter (November to March in the Northern Hemisphere). Another issue is the hardness of the water; where it is necessary to use hard water, regular re-potting is recommended to avoid the build up of salts. The <b>general</b> <b>advice</b> given is that during the growing season, cacti should be allowed to dry out between thorough waterings. A water meter can help in determining when the soil is dry.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of prescriptive lifestyle advice with quantifiable dietary and physical goals compared to <b>general</b> lifestyle <b>advice</b> on weight and psychological outcomes in young women with overweight or obesity. A total of 203 women (body mass index 33. 3 _ 0. 3, age 28 _ 0. 3 years) received either prescriptive or <b>general</b> lifestyle <b>advice</b> for weight loss over 12 weeks. Linear mixed models found that the prescriptive lifestyle advice group had significantly greater weight loss (4. 2 _ 0. 4 kg vs 0. 6 _ 0. 2 kg, P_ 0. 001) compared to the <b>general</b> lifestyle <b>advice</b> group. However, the prescriptive lifestyle advice group also had greater attrition (48 % vs 31 %, P_ 0. 05) compared to the <b>general</b> lifestyle <b>advice</b> group. Linear mixed models found that the prescriptive lifestyle advice group had greater improvement in psychological distress (_ 3. 0 _ 0. 04 vs _ 1. 1 _ 0. 01, P_ 0. 05) and in selfesteem (3. 2 _ 0. 8 vs _ 0. 04 _ 0. 04, P_ 0. 001) compared to the <b>general</b> lifestyle <b>advice</b> group. Changes in psychological distress and self-esteem remained significantly different between groups after correcting for weight loss. Food cravings decreased significantly over time without group differences (P_ 0. 001 for time). Weight locus of control remained unchanged in either group (P_ 0. 05). Drop-outs had greater baseline psychological distress (15. 1 _ 0. 7 vs 12. 5 _ 0. 4, P_ 0. 01) and higher food cravings (2. 42 _ 0. 07 vs 2. 24 _ 0. 05, P_ 0. 049) compared to completers. In conclusion, a prescriptive approach is associated with greater weight loss and greater improvements in psychological outcomes in young women compared to <b>general</b> lifestyle <b>advice.</b> However, these quantitative targets should be accompanied with qualitative advice on how they could be met {{in a variety of}} circumstances.

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} <b>general</b> <b>advice</b> related to safe sex, BDSM {{sessions}} often require a wider array of safety precautions than vanilla sex (sexual behaviour without BDSM elements). In theory, to ensure consent related to BDSM activity, pre-play negotiations are commonplace, especially among partners {{who do not}} know each other very well. In practice, pick-up scenes at clubs or parties may sometimes be low in negotiation (much as pick-up sex from singles bars may not involve much negotiation or disclosure). These negotiations concern the interests and fantasies of each partner and establish a framework of both acceptable and unacceptable activities. This kind of discussion is a typical [...] "unique selling proposition" [...] of BDSM sessions and quite commonplace. Additionally, safewords are often arranged to provide for an immediate stop of any activity if any participant should so desire.|$|E

Care is needed with the hand placement when catching with one hand on the disc rim, making sure to catch on the proper side of the disc, according to which way the disc is spinning. When a frisbee is thrown at high speeds, as is frequently the case in a competitive Ultimate game, one side of the frisbee can spin out of the player's hand, and the other side can spin into their hand, which can make a catch far more secure.
