5|$|In DragonFly, each CPU {{has its own}} thread scheduler. Upon creation, threads are {{assigned}} to processors and are never preemptively switched from one processor to another; they are only migrated by the passing of an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) message between the CPUs involved. Inter-processor thread scheduling is also accomplished by sending asynchronous IPI messages. One advantage to this clean compartmentalization of the threading subsystem is that the processors' on-board caches in Symmetric Multiprocessor Systems do not contain duplicated data, allowing for higher performance by giving each processor in the system {{the ability to use}} its own cache to store <b>different</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> work on.|$|E

The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees. The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo, but Michael insists he take the job. Michael brings some of the staff together {{in the conference room}} to help Deangelo get prepared for the show, but he struggles to be humorous. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to help him, saying he should just think of performing like conducting a meeting, but Michael objects, wanting Deangelo to mimic his style. Michael tries a number of <b>different</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> help Deangelo, such as sitting on his stomach and making him listen to a Walkman at full volume so he cannot hear himself think, but none are effective.|$|E

In the context of politically active modern India, where job and school quotas are reserved for affirmative action based on castes, the term has become a sensitive and controversial subject.|$|E

Auden was later to correspond with Tolkien, and they became friends. The Hobbit was nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction of the year (1938).

He thus argued against the idea that the New Age could be considered [...] "a unified ideology or Weltanschauung", although he believed that it could be considered a [...] "more of less unified [...] "movement"". Conversely, various other scholars have suggested that the New Age is insufficiently homogenous to be regarded as a singular movement. As a replacement term, the sociologist of religion Steven Bruce suggested that New Age was better seen as a milieu, while scholar of religion George D.

Exemplifying this theme, [...] "The Modern Age" [...] is a rant about the oddness of modern life.

Discussing its risqué nature, Moretti has stated, [...] "It should be taken the way you interpret it. The lyrics mean <b>different</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> different people." [...] "Alone, Together" [...] continues the sexual theme by dropping hints about cunnilingus, while the yelp at the start of [...] "New York City Cops" [...] was created as a pastiche of rock band Aerosmith. [...] "Soma" [...] takes influence from Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel Brave New World and its featured imaginary drug, soma. Here Casablancas is discussing drug use in order to fit in with the cool crowd. During the studio sessions, Casablancas introduced tracks with comic lines and some quips were used when the album was mixed.|$|E
