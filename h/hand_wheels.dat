5000|$|Trainer : Controls the mount's train angle (bearing). He sits in {{the right}} front corner of the mount. (See the far right man in the Mk21 open mount picture.) In front of him, are his optical sight, <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> and train drive {{controls}}. Between his knees is a large box called the Train Indicator Regulator. (pictured) This box controls the train power drive. On top of the box, is a window {{with a set of}} dials that indicate the train angle of the gun, and the automatic train orders electrically coming from the Fire Control System by synchro. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Match pointers. Switch to Automatic.", he looks down at the dials on his Indicator-Regulator. The dials also tell him the difference between the gun's present train angle and the ordered train angle. He changes the bearing of the gun, by moving his <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> until the dial difference is zero. His dials are now [...] "matched", and he switches the train drive into Auto. This disengages his <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> and gives train angle control to the Fire Control System. Then, he reports back to the Mount Captain, [...] "Train in auto." [...] He may now look through his sight, and if the Sight Setter has matched the sight-setter dial pointers, he will see the target in the cross-hairs. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Switch to Local", he switches the train drive to local.

5000|$|Pointer : [...] Controls the mount's {{elevation}} and firing. He sits in {{the left}} front corner of the mount. In front of him, are his optical sight, <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> and elevation drive controls. To his right, about elbow high, is a large box called the Elevation Indicator Regulator. (pictured) This box controls the elevation power drive. Through a window {{on top of the}} box, he sees a set of dials that indicate the elevation of the gun, and the automatic elevation orders coming from the Fire Control System. Above the Indicator Regulator is the Electrical Fire Select Switch. It is a rotary switch with three positions: Off, Local, and Auto. Off disables the electrical firing system on the mount. Local enables the electric firing key on his right hand wheel. Auto enables the off mount electrical firing circuit from the Fire Control System. Just outside his right knee, is the Percussion Select Lever. This mechanical lever has two positions: Safe, and Armed. When it is in the armed position, the mechanical linkage for percussion firing is enabled. His right footrest is at one end of this linkage, and the firing pin sear in the breech block is at the other. By rocking his right foot forward, he fires the gun. Electrical firing is the primary firing method. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Match pointers. Switch to Automatic.", he looks down at the dials on his Indicator-Regulator.

[...] He may now look through his sight, and if the Sight Setter has matched the sight-setter dial pointers, he will see the target in the cross-hairs. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Switch to Local", he switches the elevation drive and the Electrical Fire Select Switch to local. In local control, he controls the gun's elevation with his <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> to keep his sight's horizontal cross hair on the target. At the command of the Mount Captain, he fires the gun by squeezing the firing key on his right hand wheel.|$|E

When the first appeared, the operator would turn two <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> to move a horizontal and vertical lines on the display, the strobes, so they lay on top of the blip. They then waited for the round to appear in the upper beam, causing another blip to appear. This time they used a second set of wheels to move the strobes to the new location. The entire process takes as little as 20 seconds.|$|E

50|$|The Type 97 is {{approximately}} 120 lb {{lighter than the}} Type 94 90-mm mortar. This weight saving was created largely by {{the elimination of the}} Type 94's recoil mechanism, which weighed 110 lb. The bipod assembly of the Type 97 is 14 lb lighter than that on the Type 94. There is a cover for the level on the yoke of the Type 97 which is not on the Type 94, and the sliding bracket of the Type 97 is hinged to permit its easy removal from the leg of the bipod, whereas it is integral on the Type 94.Certain compromises in material and workmanship were made in the manufacture of the Type 97. The bipod feet and chain hooks were held to the legs of the bipod by pins, joined with solder, whereas on the Type 94 they are welded. No welds were polished on the Type 97, although no indications of fractures were reported despite the poor quality of the welding. The adjusting nut, sliding bracket, and <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> of the Type 97 are made of steel, rather than brass which was utilized in the Type 94.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} assist operators of mobile robots applied for inspection and maintenance in industrial process plants. The proposed method enables the automatic detection of circular objects - specifically circular <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> - by the 3 D-sensors of the robot. The detected objects are illustrated on the graphical user interface by augmenting the camera image of the robot with the detected objects. To compensate inaccuracies, the user can modify the properties of each detected object manually on the screen. Finally he can specify the desired grasping position for the robot manipulator {{on one of the}} detected wheels. Based on the acquired environment information the robot will then be able to grasp this wheel automatically and without collisions with the environment. By controlling the applied forces on the gripper and by using the parameters of the wheel specified previously, the robot is further able to assist the user to rotate the wheel by for example pushing a joystick in the desired rotation direction. Current work focuses on optimizing and integrating the single components...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how height of a hand wheel affects maximum torque production and risk of injury to the shoulders and back of workers. Background: Workers in the processing, refinery, and energy generation industries manually open and close valves with <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> that require high torque. This task is physically strenuous and can lead to shoulder musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Method: Maximum torque exertions in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions at three heights (knee, chest, and overhead) were tested. Results: The torque production in the counterclockwise (left) direction was greater than that of the clockwise (right) direction (150. 5 N·m vs. 141 N·m). This main effect was independent of valve height, as there was no interaction between direction and valve height (p =. 686). Participants exerted at least 10 % greater torque at the overhead level than at the chest level (means of 153. 2 N·m vs. 138. 3 N·m). There was no difference in maximum torque between knee and overhead levels and between knee and chest levels. Conclusion: According to ergonomics principles, the risk of MSDs affecting the shoulder and trunk from turning valves should be lowest at chest height because the postures of the shoulder and trunk are at or near neutral. However, workers exerted greatest torque when the valve was located overhead. Whether valves located at overhead height, compared with chest height, present greater risk of MSDs to workers is not known. Application: Design engineers should avoid placing hand wheel valves at knee height or lower...|$|E

40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2015 Mr. Bernn Hitch, President of Island Ceramic Grinding, tasked team 16 to {{automate}} a manual Chevalier FSG- 618 M Surface Grinder {{so that it}} can run a simple, repetitive program for slicing ceramic pieces with minimal operator interaction besides the initial setup of the program. To accomplish this goal, we were given requirements by our sponsor that include automation of the three axes of the surface grinder through one cohesive interface that allows for editing of the program while it is in use and no measurable increase in tolerance of the parts being manufactured for under $ 5000. Alumina is to be used for all testing, as it will ensure any product that Island Ceramic Grinding currently uses on their grinders will not present any problems for the automation. Engineering specifications were generated according to the requirements such as the tolerance of motion accuracy and precision. After performing a functional decomposition and brainstorming, several of concepts were generated to meet the requirement of our sponsor and the corresponding engineering specifications. Five Pugh Charts were created for different functionalities that need to be realized, with weighting between one and five for each criterion. The five Pugh Charts decided that the transmission would be timing belts, stepper motors would be used for in-out direction and up-down direction, a DC motor would be used for left-right direction, a sealed keypad would be used for interface; the microcontroller would be a PLC, a Hall Effect sensor would be used to control the motion of the grinder. Engineering analysis was implemented to determine the required specifications for motors and transmissions. Theoretical modeling and empirical testing were implemented to find out the maximum torque when turning the <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> during normal operation. The component selection was narrowed down using the specifications from this analysis, and CAD models of mountings for each axis were generated. A detailed plan for the control system is also described. FMEA and risk analyses were done to discover, evaluate, and minimize potential problems. Design verification testing was then performed to verify that the individual components performed as expected and would allow the machine to function as intended. Precision of the Y and Z-axes were confirmed to outperform expectations, and the speed of the X-axis was also deemed acceptable. Verification was unable to be performed on the system as a whole due to additional components that were needed and delays in assembling the electrical system...|$|E
