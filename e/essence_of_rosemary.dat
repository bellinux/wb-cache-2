40|$|To {{study the}} effects of using {{different}} levels manure under salt stress conditions on {{the quantity and quality of}} rosemary a field experiment is conducted in split plot experiment based on randomized complete block design with three replications at Zahedan during fall season of 2013 - 2014. The experimental treatments consisted of salinity with two levels (irrigating the field with drinking water of Zahedan [EC = 1. 1 ds/m (S 1) ] and irrigating the field with salty water of Zahedan [EC = 4. 4 ds/m (S 2) ] considered as the main factor and using manure with four levels (M 1 - without manure, M 2 - 15 t. ha- 1, M 3 - 30 t. ha- 1 and M 4 - 45 t. ha- 1) as sub factor. Traits evaluated were plant height, leaf dry weight, leaf to stem ratio, shoot dry weight, percentage and yield of essence. Experimental results showed the salt stress did not affect significantly plant height, shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, biomass and <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> as comparied with drinking water (non-salinity), but a decreasing effect of saline water was observed. Using 45 t. ha- 1 of manure, in comparison with other manure treatments, did have beneficial effect on most of the traits under study. However, no significant difference was observed between this treatment and with that of 30 t/ha. The simple correlation showed there is a positive and significant relationship between plant biomass and all other traits. The results also showed that there was positive and significant relationship between essence percentage and essence yield...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} the antimicrobial activity <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) and {{to investigate the}} synergistic effects of this extract combined with ceforuxime against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MethodsThe inhibitory and bactericidal activities <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> ethanol extract, alone and in combination with cefuroxime, were studied. ResultsThe minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the ethanol extract <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> were {{in the range of}} 0. 39 – 3. 13 mg/mL. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were usually equal to or double that MICs. The antimicrobial activity of combinations of the ethanol extract <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> and cefuroxime indicated their synergistic effects against all MRSAs. ConclusionsThe present work clearly demonstrates that rosemary has {{a key role in the}} elevation of susceptibility to β-lactams...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Barrier {{properties}} {{are one of}} the most important factors in the edible film. In this study, edible mungbean films were prepared containing (0 %, 15 %, 30 %, 45 %) concentrations <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> aqueous extract. Then the effect <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> was investigated on colorimetric and barrier properties (water vapor permeability, oxygen permeability). Rosemary extract increased the absorption of color in the visible region, which in turn led to increase of the parameters a (index color tends toward green) and b (index color tends towards yellow). The results showed that increasing concentrations <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> extract have a significant effect (p < 0. 05) to reduce the amount of oxygen and water vapor permeability. Also turbidity of mungbean starch was increased with increasing concentrations <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> in the film. Improving barrier properties and the colorimetric properties were showed by rosemary extract compounds that these materials can use as the safety of food and pharmaceutical packaging industry...|$|R
40|$|The Rosemary {{extracts}} (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) {{are famous}} for its antioxidant and preservative properties. The value to flavor of a plant is almost always associated with the essential oil percentage. Essential oils are chemical composites generated during {{the development of the}} plant as secondary biomolecules. Salmonella is considered the main pathogen involved in alimentary toxiinfections. It is very important to have Information regarding the antimicrobials activity of the essential oil <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> related to the interest for its utilization in substitution to chemical additives. In this sense there is also important to evaluate the biotechnological techniques of facilitating and improving the process of production, extraction and application of these composites. In the present study was evaluated the action of antimicrobial activity of essential oil <b>of</b> <b>Rosemary</b> (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) against Salmonella sp [...] Was utilized the filter paper disk method to evaluate the action inhibition of essential oil <b>of</b> <b>rosemary.</b> The results showed the inhibition that pure essential oil <b>of</b> <b>Rosemary</b> (R. officinalis L.) against Salmonella sp was lesser than the inhibition of the antibiotic used as positive control.
