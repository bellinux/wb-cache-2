5|$|Mills' {{troubles}} {{began in}} November 2005, with revelations of large losses on failed projects, a cash crunch and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting. The SEC inquiry was upgraded to a <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> in March 2006. The reclassification as a <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> {{allows for the}} use of additional techniques such as subpoenas. On April 6, 2007 Simon Property Group, Inc. announced the joint acquisition of Mills Corporation along with Farallon Capital Management for $25.25 per share of common stock.|$|E

Through his attorney, Hsu has denied any wrongdoing.|$|E

5|$|Dawson relayed {{this story}} to Bulawayo, where Company {{authorities}} made enquiries. No {{man who had been}} attached to the column corroborated the account. The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this, however, and angrily speculated that if it were true, then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, as historian Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula, not end the war). Lawyers appointed by the Company launched a <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> early in 1894.|$|E
5|$|The {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending, U.S. Representative Jim Jordan held hearings on January 25, 2012, to investigate why the NHTSA opened a <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> only {{five months after the}} first postcrash battery fire occurred in June. The subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform wanted to determine if government officials, including from NHTSA, purposely held back information on the Volt fire for political reasons. Both Daniel Akerson, General Motors CEO, and David L. Strickland, NHTSA administrator, denied any wrongdoing.|$|E

5|$|The killings were publicised in 1997, when {{a wartime}} member of Autumn Rains {{paramilitary}} {{spoke about the}} unit's involvement in killings of civilians in Gospić in an interview to the Feral Tribune. No <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> was launched until 2000, after three former Croatian intelligence and military police officers informed the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia about the killings. Five, including Orešković and Norac, were arrested in 2001 and tried. Orešković, Norac and Stjepan Grandić were found {{guilty of the crime}} and sentenced to 14, 12 and 10 years in prison respectively in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was criticised for its poor planning and execution, insufficient preparation, reconnaissance and training, and inappropriate {{command and control}} methods applied by the Sisak Operational Group {{in charge of the}} offensive. It also lacked clear objectives. Afterwards, Croatian military authorities investigated the offensive, but found that there was very little written documentation, including written unit-level orders, pertaining to the operation. That led Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo to conclude that the offensive was not formally authorised. The <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> did not specifically charge anyone with the failures, simply specifying the problems observed instead.|$|E
5|$|A {{preliminary}} enquiry into Magdalenas {{was held}} at Rio de Janeiro by the British Consul-General, who sent {{a report to the}} Minister of Transport, who ordered that a Court of <b>Formal</b> <b>Investigation</b> be held. The enquiry {{was held at}} the Royal Courts of Justice, London on 26–28 September 1949 with J. V. Naisby KC in charge, assisted by Captains Grimston and Williamson, and a Mr. Gray. Evidence was heard that the ship was seaworthy, and that the provision of rescue equipment on board either met or exceeded the required standard. The course selected was deemed to be correct, but the navigation of the ship was defective, with insufficient attention being paid to compass errors. Her captain had his master's certificate suspended for two years. Her first officer had his certificate suspended for a year, being allowed to hold a second mate's certificate during this time. These suspensions were effective from the date of the report's release on 3 October 1949.|$|E

He left Kentucky {{to live on the}} Indiana frontier but was never fully reimbursed by Virginia for his wartime expenditures. He spent the final decades of his life evading creditors and living in increasing poverty and obscurity. He was involved in two failed attempts to open the Spanish-controlled Mississippi River to American traffic. He became an invalid after suffering a stroke and the amputation of his right leg. He was aided in his final years by family members, including his younger brother William, {{one of the leaders of}} the Lewis and Clark Expedition. He died of a stroke on February 13, 1818.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2009 the ICC Presidency {{assigned}} {{the situation in}} Kenya to Pre-Trial Chamber II and the prosecutor made an application to that chamber for authorisation to open a <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> on 26 November. The judges of the pre-trial chamber granted this authorisation on 31 March 2010. The judges who made this decision, Ekaterina Trendafilova, Hans-Peter Kaul and Cuno Tarfusser noted in their written ruling that while Article 15 of the Rome Statute does allow for the Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute a case of his own volition, {{this is one of}} the more controversial aspects of the ICC. In the ICC's history, this case was the first time the Prosecutor decided to investigate a case in this manner, with all prior cases being referred to the Court either by a national government, or by the United Nations Security Council.|$|E
5|$|Re Lim Chor Pee, {{ex parte}} Law Society of Singapore (1985) {{is another example}} of a case where a {{mandatory}} order was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an advocate and solicitor, had been convicted of several income tax offences and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a Disciplinary Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the Disciplinary Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the statement of case which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of mandamus to direct the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider the matters before it and decide whether or not there should be a <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> by a Disciplinary Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up the charges, and the duty of the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee in the statement of case. Thus, the appellant could not object that some of the charges against him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.|$|E
