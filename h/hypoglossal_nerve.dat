5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerve</b> {{arise from}} the hypoglossal nucleus {{near the bottom of}} the brain stem. The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerve,</b> moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>{{hypoglossal}}</b> <b>nerve</b> (XII) {{exits the}} skull using the hypoglossal canal in the occipital bone and reaches the tongue to control {{almost all of}} the muscles involved in movements of this organ.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} {{description of the}} <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerve</b> was by Herophilos (335–280 BC), {{although it was not}} named at the time. The first use of the name hypoglossal in Latin as nervi hypoglossi externa was used by Winslow in 1733. This was followed though by several different namings including nervi indeterminati, par lingual, par gustatorium, great sub-lingual by different authors, and gustatory nerve and lingual nerve (by Winslow). It was listed in 1778 as nerve hypoglossum magnum by Soemmering. It was then named as the great <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerve</b> by Cuvier in 1800 as a translation of Winslow and finally named in English by Knox in 1832.|$|E

5|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerve</b> arises as {{a number}} of small {{rootlets}} {{from the front of the}} medulla, the bottom part of the brainstem, in the preolivary sulcus, which separates the olive and the pyramid. The nerve passes through the subarachnoid space and pierces the dura mater near the hypoglossal canal, an opening in the occipital bone of the skull.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerve,</b> as {{measured}} {{by the size of the}} hypoglossal canal, has been hypothesised to be associated with the progress of evolution of primates, with reasoning that larger nerves would be associated with improvements in speech associated with evolutionary changes. This hypothesis has been refuted.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerve</b> {{is derived}} from the first pair of {{occipital}} somites, collections of mesoderm that form next to the main axis of an embryo during development. The musculature it supplies develop as the hypoglossal cord from the myotomes of the first four pairs of occipital somites. The nerve is first visible as a series of roots in the fourth week of development, which have formed a single nerve and link to the tongue by the fifth week.|$|E

50|$|Above, it lies {{upon the}} rectus capitis lateralis, behind the {{internal}} carotid artery and the nerves passing through the jugular foramen; lower down, the vein and artery lie upon the same plane, the glossopharyngeal and <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerves</b> passing forward between them; the vagus descends between and behind the vein and the artery in the same sheath (the carotid sheath), and the accessory runs obliquely backward, superficial or deep to the vein.|$|R
40|$|Submandibular gland {{excision}} is {{an operation}} frequently performed by many different surgical specialists. It is {{often associated with}} a variety of postoperative complications, the commonest being neurological deficits related to damage to the marginal mandibular, lingual or <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerves.</b> Other patients develop further problems at a later date due to the development of calculi from gravel retained in the duct remnant. This study aims to discuss how these complications can be avoided...|$|R
5|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerve</b> is one {{of twelve}} cranial nerves found in amniotes {{including}} reptiles, mammals and birds. As with humans, damage to the nerve or nerve pathway will result in difficulties moving the tongue or lapping water, decreased tongue strength, and generally cause deviation away from the affected side initially, {{and then to the}} affected side as contractures develop. The evolutionary origins of the nerve have been explored through studies of the nerve in rodents and reptiles. The nerve is regarded as arising evolutionarily from nerves of the cervical spine, which has been incorporated into a separate nerve over the course of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerve</b> is {{the twelfth}} cranial nerve, and innervates all the {{extrinsic}} and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two hypoglossal nerves in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E
5|$|The vocal {{production}} system {{is controlled by}} the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerve</b> and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, this {{is the result of a}} direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
50|$|In {{the nervous}} system, Rhazes stated that nerves had motor or sensory functions, {{describing}} 7 cranial and 31 spinal cord nerves. He assigned a numerical {{order to the}} cranial nerves from the optic to the <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerves.</b> He classified the spinal nerves into 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 3 sacral, and 3 coccygeal nerves. He used this to link clinical signs of injury to the corresponding location of lesions in the nervous system.|$|R
30|$|Schwannomas and neurofibromas {{are rare}} within the sublingual and submandibular spaces. Arising from {{peripheral}} and sympathetic nerves, schwannomas involving the lingual and <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerves</b> {{can occur in}} {{the floor of the}} mouth. Neurofibromas are associated with known neurofibromatosis. On CT, these lesions are described as enhancing homogenous isoattenuating masses with distinct margins. On MRI, they demonstrate isointense signal on T 1 -weighted imaging and hyperintense signal on T 2 -weighted imaging, relative to the adjacent musculature. Larger lesions can have cystic components [13].|$|R
40|$|The present review gives {{a survey}} of rehabilitative {{measures}} for disorders of the motor function of the mimetic muscles (facial nerve), and muscles innervated by the spinal accessory and <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerves.</b> The dysfunction can present either as paralysis or hyperkinesis (hyperkinesia). Conservative and surgical treatment options aimed at restoring normal motor function and correcting the movement disorders are described. Static reanimation techniques are not dealt with. The final section describes the use of botulinum toxin in the therapy of dysphagia...|$|R
5|$|These {{muscles are}} {{involved}} in moving and manipulating the tongue. The left and right genioglossus muscles in particular are responsible for protruding the tongue. The muscles, attached to {{the underside of the}} top and back parts of the tongue, cause the tongue to protrude and deviate towards the opposite side. The <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerve</b> also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, involved in the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerve</b> are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were {{compression}} by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E
5|$|The <b>{{hypoglossal}}</b> <b>nerve</b> carries {{lower motor}} neurons that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E
5000|$|Wallerian {{degeneration}} {{is named}} after Augustus Volney Waller. Waller experimented on frogs in 1850, by severing their glossopharyngeal and <b>hypoglossal</b> <b>nerves.</b> He then observed the distal nerves {{from the site of}} injury, which were separated from their cell bodies in the brain stem. [...] Waller described the disintegration of myelin, which he referred to as [...] "medulla", into separate particles of various sizes. The degenerated axons formed droplets that could be stained, thus allowing studies of the course of individual nerve fibres.|$|R

Group 1 - 6 was each given GW 4064 and five bile acids of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), cholic acid (CA) as well as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) at different concentrations to identify their specific functions on respiratory rhythm modulations. Group 7 was applied to receive FXR blocker Z-guggulsterone and Z-guggulsterone with the above bile acids separately to explore the role of FXR in the respiratory rhythm modulation. Group 8 was given dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as controls.
