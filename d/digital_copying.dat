5000|$|This {{principle}} is applied digitally, {{such as in}} hard disks, but in a different form. The magnetised data on the disk consists of 1s and 0s. Unlike DNA, it only has two types of information, rather than four types, however, it still has a polar concept of transfer. In this case, the read-write head acts as an intermediary. A data section reading [...] "1", can only trigger one type of response, and [...] "0" [...] for the other. These responses from reading are converted into an electrical form that gets carried through the circuits. Although this can be later converted and processed for other ways of using the data, which can be modified, if a file were being copied from one hard disk to another, the principle ensures that the data is transferred with high fidelity, because only each type of signal can only trigger one type of data write, {{in this case a}} 1 or a 0. This excludes exceptions where the data was written incorrectly or the existing data has been corrupted while on the disk such that no distinction can be made, but usually the hard disk returns the area as unreadable. The other concept that using <b>digital</b> <b>copying</b> is website copy http://www.carboncopyprosites.com, <b>digital</b> <b>copying</b> has more interpretation than just the basic concept of disk read and write itself. Digital Copy is a sample of interpretation of <b>digital</b> <b>copying.</b>|$|E

5000|$|There is an {{increasing}} trend for new photocopiers to adopt digital technology, thus replacing the older analog technology. With <b>digital</b> <b>copying,</b> the copier effectively consists of an integrated scanner and laser printer. This design has several advantages, such as automatic image quality enhancement {{and the ability to}} [...] "build jobs" [...] (that is, to scan page images independently of the process of printing them). Some digital copiers can function as high-speed scanners; such models typically offer the ability to send documents via email or to make them available on file servers.|$|E
50|$|Copying is {{the process}} of {{duplicating}} information with the change of location or format of the original information. The transfer transaction of information through copying {{has been going on for}} ages and there has been many advances in technology to decrease the time it takes to make copies of said information. The art of copying started with people having to write a copy out by hand, then the printing press, all the way to <b>digital</b> <b>copying</b> with ICTs. These developments lead to quicker information-transfer transactions in the form of distributing copies of original information to others through a changes of location or format.|$|E

50|$|This {{opposition}} by CBS softened after Sony, a DAT manufacturer, bought CBS Records in January 1988. By June 1989, {{an agreement}} was reached, {{and the only}} concession the RIAA would receive was a more practical recommendation from manufacturers to Congress that legislation be enacted to require that recorders have a Serial Copy Management System to prevent <b>digital</b> <b>copying</b> {{for more than a}} single generation. This requirement was enacted as part of the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, which also imposed taxes on DAT recorders and blank media. However, the computer industry successfully lobbied to have personal computers exempted from that act, setting the stage for massive consumer copying of copyrighted material on materials like recordable CDs and by extension, filesharing systems such as Napster.|$|E
40|$|One {{concern with}} {{digitization}} {{in the cultural}} sector is that unauthorized, <b>digital</b> <b>copying</b> will disrupt cultural supply. This paper discusses the evidence for an impact of <b>digital</b> <b>copying</b> on the commercial supply of new, copyrighted sound recordings in Germany. The method is an intervention analysis for short time series. In spite of a severe recession in the primary market for sound recordings with the diffusion of <b>digital</b> <b>copying</b> technology, the annual number of new titles released to the market continued to expand. There is no significant deviation from a long-term upward trend. Further empirical research is needed {{on the impact of}} <b>digital</b> <b>copying</b> on the supply of protected works, as well as on intervening factors fostering the supply of copyright works. According to the findings of this paper, it is questionable whether more extensive public expenditure on copyright protection is desirable...|$|E
