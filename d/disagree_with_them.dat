Note, however, that it can only select these (mainly ceremonial) posts on recommendation from other bodies and Court does not usually <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> It also retains the power to remove its own members and those of Council, apart from those whose membership results from their office or from being members of the academic staff of the University. Thus most {{of the members of}} Court are excluded from this provision, though notably not most of Council, a situation the Privy Council does not seem concerned with.|$|E

25|$|However, after {{becoming}} President, Mbeki changed tack and represented {{the views of}} {{a small minority of}} eminent scientists who claimed that AIDS was not caused by HIV. These included Nobel Prize winner Kary Mullis, the U.S.A National Academy of Sciences member Peter Duesberg as well as others with varying degrees of prominence. Mbeki found their views compelling, although the overwhelming majority of scientists <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> On 9 July 2000, at the International AIDS Conference in Durban, President Mbeki made a speech that attracted much criticism in that he avoided references to HIV and instead focused mainly on poverty as a powerful co-factor in AIDS diagnosis. His administration was repeatedly accused of failing to respond adequately to the AIDS epidemic, and including failing to authorise and implement an overall national treatment program for AIDS that included anti-retroviral medicines, and in particular an antiretroviral programme to prevent HIV transmission from pregnant mothers to babies while in the womb.|$|E
500|$|Stimson, who {{had just}} {{finished}} a series of arguments with the British {{about the need for}} an invasion of France, was reluctant to appear to <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> about everything, and spoke in conciliatory terms about the need for good post-war relations between the two countries. For his part, Churchill disavowed interest in the commercial applications of nuclear technology. The reason for British concern about the post-war cooperation, Cherwell explained, was not commercial concerns, but so that Britain would have nuclear weapons after the war. Anderson then drafted an agreement for full interchange, which Churchill re-worded [...] "in more majestic language". News arrived in London of Roosevelt's decision on 27 July, and Anderson was dispatched to Washington with the draft agreement. Churchill and Roosevelt signed {{what became known as the}} Quebec Agreement at the Quebec Conference on 19 August 1943.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, {{following}} Gary Speed's {{departure from}} the job as manager of Sheffield United for the position as the head coach of Wales, Adams {{was one of a}} handful of names linked to the vacant position at United. On Christmas Eve, Vale chairman Bill Bratt announced he had [...] "reluctantly" [...] given Adams permission to talk to Sheffield United. Six days later it was announced that he would be taking the position, and he announced his three aims as manager would be to firstly avoid relegation, to then challenge for promotion, and finally [...] "to develop a structure that will build us a reputation for home grown talent that fans can be proud of in their team". Former United player Alan Cork was installed as his assistant, Cork had worked as Adams' assistant at Fulham, Swansea, Leicester and Coventry. The fourth manager at the club that season, he brought in Dave Bassett in a consultancy role after finding managing the club a bigger task than he had previously assumed. As Adams explained: [...] "When you're manager at Port Vale you probably get three calls a day and one of those is from the wife asking me what time I'm coming home for my tea." [...] His honeymoon period dissipated quickly, as United failed to win in his first eleven games in charge (four draws and seven defeats) and slipped into 23rd spot after letting slip a two-goal lead to lose 3–2 to fellow relegation strugglers Scunthorpe United. Adams told the press that [...] "The fans were singing 'you're not fit to wear the shirt', I cannot <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> That is as disappointing a result as I have ever had in my career." [...] It took three months before he achieved his first win. The victory came on 8 March 2011 (his fourteenth game in charge), as his side came from behind to beat Nottingham Forest 2–1. Sheffield United were relegated to League One at the end of the season, finishing six points short of safety. Adams and United parted company after a meeting with owner Kevin McCabe. McCabe stated that he wished to initiate a [...] "clean sweep at the top and start afresh"; whilst Adams said that whilst he was [...] "very, very disappointed with the decision... I am a Blade and will always be a Blade." ...|$|E

That's obvious – we are adults and our IQs are high enough to understand that." [...] Judt, who had planned {{to argue that the}} Israel lobby in the US often stifled honest debate, called the implications of the cancellation [...] "serious and frightening." [...] He added that [...] "only in America – not in Israel – is this a problem," [...] charging that vigorous criticism of Israeli policy, acceptable in Israel itself, is taboo in the US.

2500|$|In 2006, the ADL, in {{addition}} to the American Jewish Committee, was criticized by academic Tony Judt for allegedly pressuring the Polish Consulate-General in New York to cancel a scheduled appearance by Judt at Network 20/20, a non-profit organization that rents space from the consulate. In an interview with the New York Sun, Foxman claimed that the group [...] "had {{nothing to do with the}} cancellation", insisting that the ADL only called to ask if the event was being sponsored by the Polish government. Polish Consul General Krzysztof Kasprzyk suggested in an interview with The Washington Post that calls by the ADL and the American Jewish Committee were [...] "exercising a delicate pressure". In reference to the role of the ADL and the American Jewish Committee in organizing the cancellations, Judt told The Washington Post: [...] "This is serious and frightening, and only in America—not in Israel—is this a problem.

2500|$|These investigations, however, did not {{go without}} response. In February 2016, on Magha Puja, a protest was held by over a {{thousand}} Thai monks in the Phutthamonthon Park, {{as a response to}} this involvement by the junta. The protest was organized by the Buddhist Protection Center of Thailand, a Red Shirt-oriented network. The protesters demanded that the Thai junta not interfere with the Sangha's affairs, in particular the appointment of the next Supreme Patriarch. After the junta responded by sending soldiers to control the site, the protest ended, but the monks announced they would repeat their protests again if their demands were not met. Wat Phra Dhammakays's involvement was implied by the media. The temple denied organizing the protests, but did not <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> either. At this point, the charges laid by Paiboon and Phra Suwit against the temple were by many interpreted as a way to discredit Somdet Chuang. Somdet Chuang had been abbot of Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen and preceptor ( [...] ; person who ordained him) of Luang Por Dhammajayo during the latter's first years at Wat Paknam.

2500|$|Gabbard, a {{vice-chair}} of the Democratic National Committee, {{was critical}} of the decision by DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to hold only six debates during the 2016 Democratic Party primary season, compared with 26 in 2008 and 15 in 2004. Some {{have argued that the}} number of debates was intentionally limited in order to bolster Secretary Hillary Clinton's position as the Democratic front-runner, citing Wasserman Schultz's previous position as co-chair of Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign as a conflict of interest and a newly created penalty barring further participation in sanctioned debates for any candidate who participates in an unsanctioned debate as an effort to limit public exposure to other candidates. Gabbard appeared on multiple news outlets to express her dissatisfaction with the number of debates. Following her public criticisms, she claimed she was uninvited from attending the Democratic debate in Las Vegas as a result. In a telephone interview with The New York Times, Gabbard stated, [...] "It's very dangerous when we have people in positions of leadership who use their power to try to quiet those who <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> When I signed up to be vice-chair of the DNC, no one told me I would be relinquishing my freedom of speech and checking it at the door." ...|$|E
2500|$|Halleck, more a bureaucrat than a soldier, {{was able}} to impose little {{discipline}} or direction on his field commanders. Strong personalities such as George B.

A telling example of his lack of control was during the Northern Virginia Campaign of 1862, when Halleck was unable to motivate McClellan to reinforce Pope in a timely manner, contributing to the Union defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run. It was from this incident that Halleck fell from grace. Abraham Lincoln {{said that he had}} given Halleck full power and responsibility as general in chief. [...] "He ran it on that basis till Pope's defeat; but ever since that event he has shrunk from responsibility whenever it was possible."In Halleck's defense, his subordinate commanders in the Eastern Theater, whom he did not select, were reluctant to move against General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. Many of his generals in the West, other than Grant, also lacked aggressiveness. And despite Lincoln's pledge to give the general in chief full control, both he and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton micromanaged many aspects of the military strategy of the nation. Halleck wrote to Sherman, [...] "I am simply a military advisor of the Secretary of War and the President, and must obey and carry out what they decide upon, whether I concur in their decisions or not. As a good soldier I obey the orders of my superiors. If I <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> I say so, but when they decide, is my duty faithfully to carry out their decision." ...|$|E
