50|$|Pandinus is a genus {{of large}} {{scorpions}} {{belonging to the}} family Scorpionidae. It contains {{one of the most}} popular pet <b>scorpions,</b> the <b>emperor</b> <b>scorpion</b> (P. imperator). The genus is distributed widely across tropical Africa and the southeastern Arabian Peninsula (Yemen, Saudi-Arabia).|$|R
50|$|The <b>emperor</b> <b>scorpion</b> is an African {{rainforest}} species, {{but also}} present in savanna. It is found {{in a number of}} African countries, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Togo, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone Cameroon.|$|R
50|$|The <b>emperor</b> <b>{{scorpion}}</b> (Pandinus imperator) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} species of scorpion in the world, with adults averaging about 20 cm in length and a weight of 30 g. However, some species of forest scorpions are fairly similar to the <b>emperor</b> <b>scorpion</b> in size, and one scorpion, Heterometrus swammerdami, holds the record for being the world's largest scorpion at 9 inches (23 cm) in length. The large pincers are blackish-red and have a granular texture. The front part of the body, or prosoma, is made up of four sections, each with a pair of legs. Behind the fourth pair of legs are comb-like structures known as pectines, which tend to be longer in males than in females. The tail, known as the metasoma, is long and curves back over the body. It ends in the large receptacle containing the venom glands and is tipped with a sharp, curved stinger. Scorpion stings can be categorized as mild (similar to a bee sting) to severe to humans depending on the species. Most people are not affected by the Emperor Scorpion's sting, though some people may be allergic to scorpion stings in general. Sensory hairs cover the pincers and tail, enabling the <b>emperor</b> <b>scorpion</b> to detect prey through vibrations in the air and ground.|$|R

It is a popular species in the pet trade, and is protected by CITES.|$|R
5000|$|Hemocyanins {{are found}} only in the Mollusca and Arthropoda: the {{earliest}} discoveries of hemocyanins were in the snail Helix pomatia (a mollusc) and in the horseshoe crab (an arthropod). They were subsequently found to be common among crustaceans and are utilized by some land arthropods such as the tarantula Eurypelma californicum, the <b>emperor</b> <b>scorpion,</b> and the centipede Scutigera coleoptrata. Also, larval storage proteins in many insects appear {{to be derived from}} hemocyanins [...]|$|R
50|$|In the wild, <b>emperor</b> <b>scorpions</b> {{primarily}} consume {{insects and}} other terrestrial invertebrates, although termites constitute {{a large portion}} of their diet. Larger vertebrates, such as rodents and lizards, are occasionally eaten.Emperor scorpions will burrow through termite mounds up to 6 feet deep in order to hunt prey. Their large claws help in tearing apart prey while their tail stinger injects venom at the same time for liquifying food.Juveniles rely on their venomous sting to paralyze prey while adults use their large claws to tear apart prey.|$|R
50|$|The {{largest of}} the {{scorpions}} is the species Heterometrus swammerdami of the Indian subcontinent, which have a maximum length of 29.2 cm and weigh around 60 g. Another extremely large scorpion is the African <b>emperor</b> <b>scorpion</b> (Pandinus imperator), which can weigh 57 g but is not known to exceed a length of 23 cm. However, they were dwarfed by Pulmonoscorpius kirktonensis, a giant extinct species of scorpion from Scotland, at an estimated length of 0.7 m and weight of 15 kg, and the aquatic Brontoscorpio, at up to 1 m and a similar weight.|$|R
40|$|Hemocyanins are giant oxygen {{transport}} proteins {{found in}} the hemolymph of several invertebrate phyla. They constitute giant multimeric molecules whose size range up to that of cell organelles such as ribosomes or even small viruses. Oxygen is reversibly bound by hemocyanins at binuclear copper centers. Subunit interactions within the multisubunit hemocyanin complex lead to diverse allosteric effects such as the highest cooperativity for oxygen binding found in nature. Crystal structures of a native hemocyanin oligomer larger than a hexameric substructure have not been published until now. We report {{for the first time}} growth and preliminary analysis of crystals of the 24 -meric hemocyanin (M(W) = 1. 8 MDa) of <b>emperor</b> <b>scorpion</b> (Pandinus imperator), which diffract to a resolution of 6. 5 Å. The crystals are monoclinc with space group C 1 2 1 and cell dimensions a = 311. 61 Å, b = 246. 58 Å and c = 251. 10 Å (α = 90. 00 °, β = 90. 02 °, γ = 90. 00 °). The asymmetric unit contains one molecule of the 24 -meric hemocyanin and the solvent content of the crystals is 56 %. A preliminary analysis of the hemocyanin structure reveals that <b>emperor</b> <b>scorpion</b> hemocyanin crystallizes in the same oxygenated conformation, which is also present in solution as previously shown by cryo-EM reconstruction and small angle x-ray scattering experiments...|$|R
5000|$|The {{dangerous}} {{nature of}} the stunts arguably outstrips that of either Jackass or another similar spin-off, Viva La Bam. In {{the course of the}} show, Steve-O has purposely subjected himself to the relatively mild sting of the <b>emperor</b> <b>scorpion</b> on more than one occasion, and Pontius has nearly been attacked by a wild jaguar and has been bitten by a black bear. One of their most dangerous stunts showed the boys attracting a great white shark while disguised as seals, then later jumping into the open water just 10m away, as well as placing dangling meat attached to a hammock to attract wild lions. In another dangerous stunt, the pair dressed up as fake zebras in the Sahara near a lion den. The supposed sport of [...] "hyena football" [...] also made its debut, which in its earliest form {{was nothing more than a}} game of keep-away with a pack of spotted hyenas using smoked ham as a ball. The [...] "sport" [...] according to its founders, [...] "deserves Olympic status".|$|R
40|$|Activity {{patterns}} of six morphologically similar, homologous muscles were recorded {{from the fourth}} leg pair in two species of arachnids that use different mechanisms to extend the femur-patella (knee) joint during locomotion. The giant whipscorpion Mastigoproctus giganteus (Uropygi) lacks femur-patella extensor muscles but extends this joint with hydraulic pressure, a mechanism {{that appears to be}} phylogenetically primitive in arachnids. The black <b>emperor</b> <b>scorpion</b> Pandinus imperator (Scorpiones) has an unusual muscle that promotes simul-taneous extension at the femur-patella joint and distally adjacent patella-tibia joint. Comparison of electromyograms from freely walking animals revealed similarities in muscle firing {{patterns of}} the two species, including asymmetrical alternation of trochanter-femur levator and depressor muscles, transfemoral muscle activation during protraction and abrupt termination just prior to levator activation, and persistence of flexor activity during retraction (extension). These results indicate that the apparent evolutionary transition from hydraulic to muscular extension occurred without substantial alteration of several com-ponents of the primitive motor programme. It is suggested that the patterns of extension force generated by hydraulic pressure and by bifunctional extensors are similar and that this similarity is associated with conservation of the motor programme...|$|R
50|$|The gene coding for HS-1 {{consists}} of one intron {{flanked by two}} exons. HS-1 is a polypepide consisting of 95 amino acids. The HS-1 protein has a large resemblance to other toxins of the Scorpine family (which is a subgroup of the Beta-KTx toxin family). The polypepides of the Scorpine family possess two structural and functional domains: a N-terminal α-helix (which has a cytolytic and/or antimicrobial activity {{similar to that of}} insect defensins), and a C-terminal region with a CSαβ motif, which causes potassium channel-blocking activity. HS-1 is highly homologous in particular to the Scorpine toxin Panscorpine (from <b>Emperor</b> <b>scorpion)</b> and Opiscorpine (from Opistophthalmus carinatus), with an 80% similarity in amino acid sequence. Opiscorpine and HS-1 are both classified as scorpine-like peptides.Based on its sequence homology with other scorpine-like peptides, HS-1 {{is likely to be a}} voltage-gated potassium channel blocker.HS-1 also has antimicrobial effects on some bacterial species, i.e. Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; it has no inhibitory effects on fungi. The inhibitory effect on bacteria has no gram specificity. Scanning electron microscopy shows that HS-1 causes roughening and blebbing of bacterial cell surfaces. HS-1 contains three disulfide bridges followed by a typical Cys pattern, similar to that of invertebrate defensins. Thus, HS-1 is likely to act accordingly.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{phylogenetic tree}} reconstructions {{that rely on}} {{multiple}} gene alignments that had been deduced from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have become a popular method in molecular systematics. Here, we present a 454 pyrosequencing approach to infer the transcriptome of the <b>Emperor</b> <b>scorpion</b> Pandinus imperator. We obtained 428, 844 high-quality reads (mean length = 223 ± 50 b) from total cDNA, which were assembled into 8334 contigs (mean length 422 ± 313 bp) and 26, 147 singletons. About 1200 contigs were successfully annotated by BLAST and orthology search. Specific analyses of eight distinct hemocyanin sequences provided further proof {{for the quality of}} the 454 reads and the assembly process. The P. imperator sequences were included in a concatenated alignment of 149 orthologous genes of 67 metazoan taxa that covers 39, 842 amino acids. After removal of low-quality regions, 11, 168 positions were employed for phylogenetic reconstructions. Using Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods, we obtained strongly supported monophyletic Ecdysozoa, Arthropoda (excluding Tardigrada), Euarthropoda, Pancrustacea and Hexapoda. We also recovered the Myriochelata (Chelicerata + Myriapoda). Within the chelicerates, Pycnogonida form the sister group of Euchelicerata. However, Arachnida were found paraphyletic because the Acari (mites and ticks) were recovered as sister group of a clade comprising Xiphosura, Scorpiones and Araneae. In summary, we have shown that 454 pyrosequencing is a cost-effective method that provides sufficient data and coverage depth for gene detection and multigene-based phylogenetic analyses...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{composition}} of terrestrial arthropod collections made at Cierva Point Site of Special Scientific Interest, Dance Coast (northern Antarctic Peninsula, 64 degrees 10 'S - 60 degrees 57 'W), during the 1994 / 5 and 1995 / 6 austral summers. A total of 15 free-living micro-arthropod species were found in hand collections and heat extractions of 12 different substrate types, including one Diptera, three Collembala and 11 Acari. In addition, one vertebrate parasitic tick was recorded (Acari, Metastigmata), one probably introduced ''show <b>scorpion</b> fly'' (<b>Insecta,</b> Mecoptera), {{and at least one}} species of Astigmata (Acari), which may be either parasitic or nidicolous. Greatest diversity was found in mosses-and algal mats (13 species), although within individual samples it was similar (5 - 6 species per sample) from most low-altitude vegetated or open habitats. Greatest population densities were recorded from mats of the alga, Prasiola crispa. With the exception of vertebrate-associated species, which were obtained from nest material or in the vicinity of bird colonies, mast micro-arthropods were generally distributed, although with widely-varying abundance. Species diversity was slightly lower than, but similar to, that obtained in recent detailed studies of other sites in the maritime Antarctic. This indicates a terrestrial arthropod fauna representative of the maritime Antarctic in general, although two species, the collembolan Isotoma octooculata and the oribatid mite Globoppia loxolineata, were present more widely than reported eleswhere...|$|R
