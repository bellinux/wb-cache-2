50|$|The <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> is {{much simpler}} to {{construct}} and operate than the steam engine. Boilers require {{at least one person}} to add water and fuel as needed and monitor pressure to prevent overpressure and a resulting explosion. If fitted with automatic lubrication systems and a governor to control engine speed, a <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> could be left running unattended for hours at a time.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engines</b> were {{produced}} as one-cylinder, low-speed two-stroke crankcase scavenged units.|$|R
50|$|From the 1910s to the 1950s, <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engines</b> {{were more}} {{economical}} to manufacture with their low-pressure crude-fuel injection and lower compression ratio than Diesel's compression ignition engines.|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} the engine can be left {{unattended}} for long periods while running made <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engines</b> a popular choice for applications requiring a steady power output, such as farm tractors, generators, pumps and canal boat propulsion.|$|R

5000|$|The {{engine is}} a Ruston & Hornsby [...] "1912" [...] <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine,</b> which was {{despatched}} from Holman's in Canterbury on 7 May 1923.|$|E

50|$|Compared with steam, petrol and {{compression}} ignition <b>engines,</b> <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engines</b> are simpler, and therefore have fewer potential problems. There is no electrical system as {{found on a}} petrol engine, and no external boiler and steam system as on a steam engine.|$|R
5000|$|The Hornsby-Akroyd oil {{engine was}} the first {{successful}} design of internal combustion engine using [...] "heavy oil" [...] as a fuel. It {{was the first}} to use a separate vapourising combustion chamber and is the forerunner of all <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the lengthy}} {{pre-heating}} time, <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engines</b> usually started easily, even in extremely cold conditions. This made them popular choices in cold regions, such as Canada and Scandinavia, where steam engines were not viable and early {{petrol and diesel}} engines could not be relied upon to operate. However it also makes them unsuitable for short time running use especially in automobile.|$|R
50|$|In 1890, Akroyd-Stuart {{patented}} the <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> {{which had}} {{only about a}} 12% thermal efficiency. The reason for this, which {{he was not able}} to identify, was due to the lower pressures used (around 90 PSI) as opposed to the Diesel engine's c. 500 PSI).|$|E
50|$|Another big {{attraction}} {{with the}} <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> was {{its ability to}} run {{on a wide range}} of fuels. Even poorly combustible fuels could be used, since a combination of vaporiser- and compression ignition meant that such fuels could be made to burn. The usual fuel was fuel oil, similar to modern-day diesel fuel, but natural gas, kerosene, crude oil, vegetable oil or creosote could also be used. This made the <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> very cheap to run, since it could be run on readily available fuels. Some operators even ran engines on used engine oil, thus providing almost free power. Recently, this multi-fuel ability has led to an interest in using hot-bulb engines in developing nations, where they can be run on locally produced biofuel.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> shares {{its basic}} layout with nearly all other {{internal}} combustion engines, {{in that it}} has a piston, inside a cylinder, connected to a flywheel by a connecting rod and crankshaft. Akroyd-Stuart's original engine operated on the four-stroke cycle (induction, compression, power and exhaust), and Hornsby continued to build engines to this design, as did several other British manufacturers such as Blackstone and Crossley. Manufacturers in Europe, Scandinavia and in the United States built engines working on the two-stroke cycle with crankcase scavenging. The latter type formed the majority of <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> production. The flow of gases through the engine is controlled by valves in four-stroke engines, and by the piston covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder wall in two-strokes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hot-bulb</b> <b>engines</b> {{were built}} by {{a large number of}} manufacturers, usually in modest series. These engines were slow-running (300-400 rpm) and mostly with {{cast-iron}} parts, including pistons. The fuel pump was usually made with a brass housing and steel plunger, operating with a variable stroke length. This resulted in a simple, rugged heavy engine. Therefore, they could be machined in an average machine shop without special tools.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the engine}} is running, the heat of {{compression}} and ignition maintains the hot bulb at the necessary temperature, and the blow-lamp or other heat source can be removed. Thereafter, the engine requires no external heat and requires only a supply of air, fuel oil and lubricating oil to run. However, under low power the bulb could cool off too much, and a throttle can cut down the cold fresh air supply. Also, as the engine's load is increased, so does {{the temperature of the}} bulb, causing the ignition period to advance; to counteract pre-ignition, water is dripped into the air intake. Equally, if the load on {{the engine is}} low, combustion temperatures may not be sufficient to maintain the temperature of the hot bulb. Many <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engines</b> cannot be run off-load without auxiliary heating for this reason.|$|R
50|$|In 1918, {{the company}} {{restarted}} production, with {{the youngest of}} Guillaume's sons, Paul (born 1893), joining the family firm. They expanded into {{a wide range of}} engine production, including diesel, <b>hot-bulb</b> and electric <b>engines.</b> In the early 1920s the company began production of narrow gauge locomotives using their diesel engines as motive power. These early locomotives had bodies that resembled traditional steam locomotives to encourage the adoption of this new technology. Guillaume died in 1929, and the company was taken over by his three sons.|$|R
5000|$|The Bulldog {{design was}} copied in other {{countries}} by several different manufacturers. While some of these copies were legitimately produced under license from Bulldog, {{most of them were}} built with each respective builders own frame and body design, being powered by unlicensed copies of the patented Bulldog <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine.</b> Some of these examples are: ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} the <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> was invented, its great attractions were its efficiency, simplicity, and ease of {{operation}} {{in comparison to the}} steam engine, which was then the dominant source of power in industry. Condenserless steam engines achieved an average thermal efficiency (the fraction of generated heat that is actually turned into useful work) of around 6%. Hot-bulb engines could easily achieve 12% thermal efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Another {{attraction}} {{was their}} safety. A steam engine, with its exposed fire and hot boiler, steam pipes and working cylinder {{could not be}} used in flammable conditions, such as munitions factories or fuel refineries. Hot-bulb engines also produced cleaner exhaust fumes. A big danger with the steam engine was that if the boiler pressure grew too high and the safety valve failed, a highly dangerous explosion could occur, although this was a relatively rare occurrence by the time the <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> was invented. A more common problem was that if the water level in the boiler of a steam engine dropped too low, the lead plug in the crown of the furnace would melt, extinguishing the fire. If a <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> ran out of fuel, it would simply stop and could be immediately restarted with more fuel. The water cooling was usually closed-circuit, so no water loss would occur unless there was a leak. If the cooling water ran low, the engine would seize through overheating — a major problem, but it carried no danger of explosion.|$|E
50|$|Herbert Akroyd Stuart {{developed}} the first device with a design similar to modern fuel injection, using a 'jerk pump' to meter out fuel oil at high pressure to an injector. This system was {{used on the}} <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> and was adapted and improved by Bosch and Clessie Cummins for use on diesel engines (Rudolf Diesel's original system employed a cumbersome 'air-blast' system using highly compressed air). Fuel injection was in widespread commercial use in diesel engines by the mid-1920s.|$|E
5000|$|HCCI engines {{have a long}} history, {{even though}} HCCI {{has not been as}} widely {{implemented}} as spark ignition or diesel injection. It is essentially an Otto combustion cycle. HCCI was popular before electronic spark ignition was used. One example is the <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> which used a hot vaporization chamber to help mix fuel with air. The extra heat combined with compression induced the conditions for combustion. Another example is the [...] "diesel" [...] model aircraft engine.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> {{is a type}} of {{internal}} combustion engine in which fuel ignites by coming in contact with a red-hot metal surface inside a bulb, followed by the introduction of air (oxygen) compressed into the hot-bulb chamber by the rising piston. There is some ignition when the fuel is introduced, but it quickly uses up the available oxygen in the bulb. Vigorous ignition takes place only when sufficient oxygen is supplied to the hot-bulb chamber on the compression stroke of the engine.|$|E
50|$|The Bulldog {{was similar}} to other European {{hot-bulb}} tractors that were being produced around the same time. Some of these examples are the SF Vierzon from France, the Landini tractor from Italy, and the HSCS from Hungary. The Field Marshall that was produced in England, was a similar design to the Bulldog <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> {{with the exception of}} an internally designed vaporing plate which replaced the conventional externally located hot-bulb, this internal design required ignition papers in place of the external blow lamp to start the engine.|$|E
50|$|A {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} is a diesel engine that works in two strokes. A diesel engine is an {{internal combustion engine}} that operates using the Diesel cycle. Invented in 1892 by German engineer Rudolf Diesel, {{it was based on}} the <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> design and patented on February 23, 1893. During the period of 1900 to 1930, four-stroke diesel engines enjoyed a relative dominance in practical diesel applications. Charles F. Kettering and colleagues, working at the various incarnations of Electro-Motive and at the General Motors Research Corporation during the 1930s, advanced the art and science of two-stroke diesel technology to yield engines with much higher power-to-weight ratios than the two-stroke diesels of old. This work was instrumental in bringing about the dieselisation of railroads in the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|A {{supply of}} {{lubricating}} oil must be fed to the crankcase {{to supply the}} crankshaft bearings. Since the crankcase {{is also used to}} supply air to the engine, the engine's lubricating oil is carried into the cylinder with the air charge, burnt during combustion and carried out of the exhaust. The oil carried from the crankcase to the cylinder is used to lubricate the piston. This means that a two-stroke <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> will gradually burn its supply of lubricating oil, a design known as a [...] "total-loss" [...] lubricating system. There were also designs that employed a scavenge pump or similar to remove oil from the crankcase and return it to the lubricating-oil reservoir. Lanz hot-bulb tractors and their many imitators had this feature. This reduced oil consumption considerably.|$|E
50|$|At {{the foot}} of the dam is the Worsbrough Corn Mill. A mill has been in the {{vicinity}} since at least 1086, but the present mill dates from 1625. A mill house was added in the mid-1700s, and the mill was modified in the 1820s. A steam-powered mill was added in the 1840s, but it ceased to operate in the early 20th century, although the water powered mill remained in use until the 1960s, grinding animal feedstuffs. When West Riding County Council began turning it into a museum in 1972, they installed a Hornsby <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> from Sykehouse windmill to replace the steam engine, which had been scrapped in 1922. It passed to South Yorkshire County Council in 1974, and opened to the public in 1976. It is now the responsibility of Barnsley Council, and is a Grade II* listed building. Nearby is a Grade II listed single span bridge, dating from 1809.|$|E
50|$|The D 9506 {{is built}} using a {{frameless}} block construction. It has a rigid rear axle and a front swing axle. The front axle was available with optional leaf springs. The tractor has air filled tyres. Only the rear tyres are propelled, the D 9506 {{does not have}} a lockable differential. The gearbox is a manual Lanz 3-speed gearbox with a reverse gear and group gear switching, this makes 6 forward gears and 2 reverse gears. Minimum speed is 3,3 km/h in first gear, maximum speed is 16,7 km/h in sixth gear. The foot brake brakes the rear tyres only, the handbrake lockes the gearbox. The standard Lanz <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> with a displacement of 10,3 l is used, it has a thermosiphon cooler. Compared to the predecessor series HR 6 and HR 7 the engine now has a better speed controller, the rated engine speed was increased from 540 min−1 to 630 min−1. Many sorts of diesel oil can be used as fuel. The D 9506 has an electrical system. If a starter motor is used, the lead-battery has a capacity of 94 Ah, without a starter motor the capacity is 75 Ah. The Lanz factory offered additional accessory, such as a cab or fenders.|$|E
5000|$|The lack of {{valves and}} the doubled-up working cycle {{also means that}} a {{two-stroke}} <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine</b> can run equally well in both directions. A common starting technique for smaller two-stroke engines is to turn the engine over against the normal direction of rotation. The piston will [...] "bounce" [...] off the compression phase with sufficient force to spin the engine the correct way and start it. This bi-directional running was an advantage in marine applications, as the engine could, like the steam engine, drive a vessel forward or in reverse {{without the need for}} a gearbox. The direction could be reversed either by stopping the engine and starting it again in the other direction, or, with sufficient skill and timing {{on the part of the}} operator, slowing the engine until it carried just enough momentum to bounce against its own compression and run the other way. This was an undesirable quality in hot-bulb-powered tractors equipped with gearboxes. At very low engine speeds the engine could reverse itself almost without any change in sound or running quality and without the driver noticing until the tractor drove in the opposite direction to that intended. Lanz Bulldog tractors featured a dial, mechanically driven by the engine, that showed a spinning arrow. The arrow pointed in the direction of normal engine rotation; if the dial spun the other way, the engine had reversed itself.|$|E
40|$|Three {{questions}} {{relating to}} the technical progress in the utilization of heavy oils are discussed. The first question considers solid injection in high-speed automobile engines, the second concerns {{the development of the}} <b>hot-bulb</b> <b>engine,</b> and the third question relates to the need for a more thorough investigation of the processes on which the formatation of combustible, rapidly-burning mixtures depend...|$|E
