50|$|Around 960, the Polish Piast dynasty under Mieszko I had {{extended}} the Duchy of Poland beyond the Oder River {{in an effort}} to conquer the Polabian Slavs, who lived along the Elbe River.

Gero defeated Mieszko I in 963 and forced him to recognize Otto I as his overlord.

5000|$|In Hispanic America {{one could}} say He viajado a España varias veces, [...] "I have <b>traveled</b> <b>to</b> Spain several times", to express a {{repeated}} action, as in English.

In Spain, speakers use the compound tense when the period of time considered has not ended, as in He comprado un coche este año [...] "I have bought a car this year". Meanwhile, a Hispanic American Spanish-speaker is more likely to say Compré un carro este año meaning [...] "I bought a car this year".|$|R
