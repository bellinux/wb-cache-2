60|$|In October, Mrs. Crawley {{paid the}} twenty pounds to Fletcher, the butcher, and in November Lord Lufton's cheque was traced {{back through the}} Barchester bank to Mr. Crawley's hands. A brickmaker of Hoggle End, much favoured by Mr. Crawley, had asked for change over the counter of this Barchester bank,--not, as will be understood, the bank on which the cheque was drawn--and had {{received}} it. The accommodation had been refused to the man at first, but when he presented the cheque the second day, bearing Mr. Crawley's name {{on the back of}} it, together with a note from Mr. Crawley himself, the money had been given for it; and the <b>identical</b> <b>notes</b> so paid had been given to Fletcher, the butcher, on the next day by Mrs. Crawley. When inquiry was made, Mr. Crawley stated that the cheque had been paid to him by Mr. Soames, on behalf of the rentcharge due to him by Lord Lufton. But the error of this statement was at once made manifest. There was the cheque, signed by Mr. Soames himself, for the exact amount,--twenty pounds four shillings. As he himself declared, he had never in his life paid money on behalf of Lord Lufton by a cheque drawn by his lordship. The cheque given by Lord Lufton, and which had been lost, had been a private matter between them. His lordship had simply wanted change in his pocket, and his agent had given it to him. Mr. Crawley was speedily shown to be altogether wrong in the statement made to account for possession of the cheque.|$|E

5000|$|But in a tuning that {{maintains}} the pure ratios, the overtones can reinforce each other, {{so that in}} Harrison’s music, perceived pitches sometimes ring out high above the tones he is actually striking on the keyboard. He also employs a technique invented by La Monte Young in which specific sets of pitches are played in fast permutations between both hands, producing [...] "tone clouds." [...] The commas he utilizes in works like Revelation can produce shimmering effects that leave a listener’s body abuzz. These include the well-known Pythagorean comma (the difference between any note and the almost <b>identical</b> <b>note</b> that comes about after the circle of fifths is traversed), the syntonic comma (81:80), and most important to Harrison the pulsing [...] "celestial comma" [...] (64:63, {{also known as a}} [...] "septimal comma").|$|R

50|$|A unison is {{considered}} a harmonic interval, just like a fifth or a third, but is unique {{in that it is}} two <b>identical</b> <b>notes</b> produced together. Many people say harmony must involve intervals like thirds, fifths, and sevenths—but unison counts as harmony and is important, especially in orchestration. In Pop music, unison singing is usually called doubling, a technique The Beatles used in many of their earlier recordings. As a type of harmony, singing in unison or playing the same notes, often using different musical instruments, at the same time is commonly called monophonic harmonization.|$|E
50|$|The table {{shows the}} most widely used {{conventional}} names for the intervals between the notes of a chromatic scale. A perfect unison (also known as perfect prime) is an interval formed by two <b>identical</b> <b>notes.</b> Its size is zero cents. A semitone is any interval between two adjacent notes in a chromatic scale, a whole tone is an interval spanning two semitones (for example, a major second), and a tritone is an interval spanning three tones, or six semitones (for example, an augmented fourth). Rarely, the term ditone is also used to indicate an interval spanning two whole tones (for example, a major third), or more strictly as a synonym of major third.|$|E

50|$|On 29 May, {{not long}} after Italy's entry into the war, the Allied representatives in Sofia {{independently}} presented an <b>identical</b> <b>note</b> proposing an alliance in exchange for Bulgaria's immediate attack on the Ottoman Empire. In return, Bulgaria would receive Eastern Thrace to the Enos-Midia line and the uncontested zone in Macedonia. Bulgaria could occupy Thrace at its earliest convenience, and the gains in Macedonia were contingent upon Serbia receiving land in Bosnia and an outlet on the Adriatic coast. The Allies also promised substantial financial assistance and full support in pressuring Greece to cede Kavalla, whereas Romania was to return Southern Dobrudja. In many respects, this proposal represented {{a turning point in}} the relationship between the Entente and Bulgaria as it offered for the first time a reward close to satisfying all Bulgarian demands. The Allied proposals however had been coordinated with neither Serbia nor Greece and provoked fierce protests from those countries. Naturally this left the Bulgarians with serious doubts about Allied intentions. Radoslavov's reply was received only on 15 June and although friendly, it asked for further clarifications and no commitments at all. In addition, the changing military situation also affected Bulgarian opinions as Italy's entry into the war failed to break Austria-Hungary, the Russians suffered reverses in Galicia and the Allied landings in the Dardanelles proved less successful than expected.|$|R
