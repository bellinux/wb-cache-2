5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3â€“5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E
5|$|Climatic shifts {{may affect}} tornadoes via teleconnections in {{shifting}} the jet stream {{and the larger}} weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> to suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.|$|E

50|$|The {{court held}} that the EPA was correct in {{enforcing}} these regulations upon Chemical Waste Management. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> to expect the firm to report leakage of a substance, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not considered hazardous. It also held that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> to expect Chemical Waste Management to especially report leakages that had breached the two check system and thus were in violation of the old requirements, regardless of it being in a transitional stage.|$|R
5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable,</b> taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity say that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that {{to allow them to}} do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E
5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years. If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{simplest}} methods is linear interpolation (sometimes known as lerp). Consider the above example of estimating f(2.5). Since 2.5 is midway between 2 and 3, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> to take f(2.5) midway between f(2) = 0.9093 and f(3) = 0.1411, which yields 0.5252.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, given Barrientos' close {{relationship}} with the Princes of AragÃ³n, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> to conclude that, at least at first, he was a supporter of the opposition camp.

25|$|Virtually {{all of the}} {{writings}} of Hipparchus are lost, including his work on precession.
