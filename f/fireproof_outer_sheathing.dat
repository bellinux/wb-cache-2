40|$|This device seals {{the sliding}} {{interfaces}} between structural panels that are roughly perpendicular {{to each other}} or whose edges are butted against one another. The nonuniformity of {{the gap between the}} panels requires significant flexibility along the seal length. The seal is mounted in a rectangular groove in a movable structural panel. A plurality of particles or balls is densely packed in an <b>outer</b> <b>sheathing.</b> The balls are laterally preloaded to maintain sealing contact with the adjacent wall using a pressurized linear bellows. Distortions in the adjacent panel are accommodated by rearrangement of the particles within the <b>outer</b> <b>sheathing.</b> Leakage through the seal is minimized by densely compacting the internal particles and by maintaining positive preload along {{the back side of the}} seal. The braid architecture of the <b>outer</b> <b>sheathing</b> is selected to minimize leakage through the seal and to resist mechanical abrasion...|$|R
5000|$|Flat TPS is more common, and is {{used for}} fixed wiring of {{domestic}} and industrial lighting, power outlets and, also, for [...] "hard-wired" [...] appliances and {{heating and air conditioning}} units. Round TPS is less common, and is generally used only where cable glands are required. It may be more difficult to strip the <b>outer</b> <b>sheathing</b> from round TPS than from flat TPS.|$|R
5000|$|The {{roof was}} flat, covered in tar paper and gravel, and emitted radiant heat {{into the top}} floor {{whenever}} the sun shone. The <b>outer</b> <b>sheathing</b> consisted of asbestos-cement shingles painted a dirty white in a vain attempt to reduce solar heat load. The windows were leaky, rattling wooden sash, and bristled with numerous large window-mounted air conditioners, since the interior spaces would otherwise become unbearably hot during warm weather.|$|R
5000|$|Kura {{in rural}} {{communities}} are normally of simpler construction and used for storing grain or rice. Those in towns are more elaborate, with a structural timber frame covered in a <b>fireproof,</b> clay <b>outer</b> coating. Early religious kura were built in a [...] "log cabin" [...] style, whilst those used later to store gunpowder were constructed from stone.|$|R
6000|$|The Hope was now indeed {{getting into}} the heart of those icy regions where ships are in {{constant}} danger from the floating masses that come down with the ocean-currents from the far north. In sailing along she was often obliged to run with great violence against lumps so large that they caused her whole frame to tremble, stout though it was. [...] "Shall we smash the lump, or will it stave in our bows?" [...] was a question that frequently ran in the captain's mind. Sometimes ice closed round her and squeezed the sides so that her beams cracked. At other times, when a large field was holding her fast, the smaller pieces would grind and rasp against her as they went past, until the crew fancied the whole of the <b>outer</b> <b>sheathing</b> of planks had been scraped off. Often she had to press close to ice-bergs of great size, and more than once a lump as large as a good-sized house fell off the ice-fields and plunged into the sea close to her side, causing her to rock violently on the waves that were raised by it.|$|R
5000|$|The Safe Deposit Building was {{finished}} in 1886, was [...] "red brick with light red firestone trim". [...] Around {{the turn of}} the century, the Safe Deposit Company boasted about the security of their vaults. Safe Deposit touted its [...] "Great Vault," [...] whose three <b>fireproof</b> <b>outer</b> doors and two burglar-proof inner ones sat in walls of steel and iron, surrounded by a foot of concrete and 2 feet of brick, according to a company history. [...] Along the street, there were [...] "spy steps" [...] which enabled roving late 19th century policemen to peer into the windows. [...] These [...] "spy steps" [...] provided {{in the center of the}} south part of the west wall, and on each side of the doorway are about three feet from the ground. They are a protruding stone step, and at shoulder height is a bronze ring. This was intended to assist a policeman to look in the windows. [...] The [...] "brass ring at shoulder level was used to balance them on the step. The steps are still jutting out into the sidewalk on both the Calvert and Redwood street sides of the Safe Deposit building. However, metal rings are only on one of the Calvert [...] "spy steps" [...] and on the right-hand side of the Redwood Street main entrance.|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} granular-material scoop and near-vertical lifting feeder/conveyor includes special {{connections and}} skirts between a bullnose rotating scoop and an open-helical screw {{that provides the}} rotations and material lift and evacuation. A conical working-face of the bullnose rotating scoop has symmetrically distributed graters and vents to break loose and force-in granular material from natural deposits and cargo holds. The bullnose rotating scoop and the open-helical screw its attached to move the material into a continuous layer on the inside surface of an <b>outer</b> stationary <b>sheathing.</b> A motor drive attached to the open-helical screw above at the delivery end provides the lifting force necessary...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of wood treated with fire retardant (FR) chemicals in roof systems {{is a problem}} of major national significance. Understanding of this phenomenon is limited by lack of information on how the performance of FR-treated wood in the laboratory correlates to that of FR-treated wood in the field. In this study, five outdoor field exposure cham-bers were constructed near Madison, Wisconsin, in the sum-mer of 1991. These structures were intended to simulate the “attics ” of multifamily structures for which model building codes sometimes allow the use of FR-treated roof sheathing. Interior attic air, exterior air, inner and <b>outer</b> <b>sheathing,</b> and internal rafter temperatures of black- and white-shingled chambers were monitored. Temperatures were measured using thermocouples and recorded over a 3 -year period from October 1991 through September 1994 using a datalogger/multiplexer device. Overall, the plywood sheathing in black-shingled roof systems tended to be 10 ˚F to 15 ˚F (5 ˚C to 8 ˚C) warmer dur-ing the midafternoon of a sunny day than the plywood in comparable white-shingled roof systems. The maximum sheathing temperatures recorded were 168 ˚F (76 ˚C) for black-shingled roofs and 147 ˚F (64 ˚C) for white-shingled roofs. The results suggest that roof-sheathing plywood and roof-truss lumber temperatures, which are the primary factors that influence thermal degrade of FR-treated materials, are primar-ily controlled by solar gain rather than attic ventilation or attic insulation. These results are tempered {{by the fact that the}} effect of moisture content was not evaluated nor was moisture controlled by attic ventilation...|$|R
40|$|The {{emissions}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) from structural insulated panel (SIP) materials were investigated. Specimens of newly produced SIPs and associated panel adhesives were obtained from two relatively large manufacturers. Additionally, specimens of the oriented strand board (OSB) used as the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>sheathing</b> and the extruded polystyrene core for the SIP were obtained from one manufacturer. Using small-scale chambers, {{emissions of}} formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and other VOCs from SIPs, OSB and polystyrene were measured {{over a period of}} four months and from the adhesives over two months. SIP specimens overlaid by gypsum board panels were also tested over four months. The predominant VOCs emitted by the SIPs included acetic acid, pentanal, hexanal and styrene. The emissions of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were relatively low. Acetic acid and the aldehydes derived from the OSB, while styrene derived from the polystyrene. One of the SIPs emitted toluene and methyl acetate. The adhesives primarily emitted a mixture of hydrocarbons. The emission rates of most VOCs from the SIP/gypsum board assemblies were approximately the same or higher than their respective emission rates from the unfinished SIPs. Modeling using VOC emission factors obtained for the SIP/gypsum board assemblies demonstrated the potential for SIP materials to degrade indoor air quality in houses. A field study to investigate VOC concentrations and emission rates in SIP houses relative to closely matched conventionally constructed houses is necessary to determine the actual impacts of SIPs. If significant impacts are observed, to it may be desirable to develop control measures to reduce the emissions of VOCs from SIPs, such as the substitution of lower emitting materials or the use of vapor diffusion barriers...|$|R
40|$|A manuscript, dated 1889, was {{discovered}} among the unpublished papers of James Graves, the first Superintendent at the Valentia Island transatlantic cable station. It {{was intended to}} appear in the Institution's Journal but its publication was blocked by his employer on the grounds of commercial confidentiality. In the paper, Graves hoped to reinforce his claim to the invention of the sea earth. This technique of using the <b>outer</b> metal <b>sheathing</b> of a cable as the earth return connection was to become standard practise in submarine telegraphy, although, {{as a direct result of}} commercial secrecy, its development is still uncertain. In the paper, the basis of Graves's claim is examined in the light of available documentary evidence. The unpublished paper and the correspondence which is generated are presented together. A brief resumé of the financial conditions which led to the suppression of the paper is presented...|$|R
5000|$|The {{protective}} fireproofing {{continues on}} the top of the kura by forming an inner roof covered in the same way as the walls. The timbers for the outer roof then sit on a <b>fireproof</b> box. The <b>outer</b> roof was used to protect the clay finish from rain. In rural areas this outer roof was often constructed of thatch which would burn off in the event of a fire. However, due to their relatively short lifespan and complexity in replacing, thatch roofs are becoming a rarity. [...] In towns the roofs were usually tiled. To prevent fire from destroying the roof timbers supporting the outer roof, the eaves were sometimes thickened up with the plaster coating and extended to the underside of the tiles.|$|R
40|$|To {{address the}} problem of {{defining}} actual field temperatures of various wood components in wood-framed roof systems, roof temperatures were monitored in test structures situated in the northern and southern United States (Madison, Wisconsin, and Starkville, Mississippi, respectively). The field exposure structures were intended to simulate the attics of multifamily wood-framed structures for which Model Building Codes sometimes allow the use of fire-retardant-treated roof sheathing. The structures were instrumented to monitor interior attic air, exterior air, inner and <b>outer</b> plywood roof <b>sheathing,</b> and internal rafter temperatures in dry whiteshingled structures and both dry and heavily humidified black-shingled structures. Temperatures were recorded from January 1992 through December 1999 in Wisconsin and from January 1996 through December 1999 in Mississippi...|$|R
30|$|Covalent {{functionalization}} of SWCNTs using addition {{chemistry is}} believed to be very promising for CNT modification and derivatization. However, it is difficult to achieve complete control over the chemo- and region selectivity of such additions and require very special species such as arynes, carbenes, or halogens, and the reactions often occur only in extreme conditions for the formation of covalent bonds. Furthermore, the characterizatiuon of functionalized SWCNTs and the determination of the precise location and mode of addition are also very difficult [30]. The covalent chemistry of CNTs is not particularly rich with respect to variety chemical reactions to date. As regard to functionalization behavior of SWCNTs and MWCNTs, {{it has been reported that}} functionalization percentage of MWCNTs is lower than that of SWCNTs with the similar process [31], which is assumingly attributed to the larger <b>outer</b> diameter and <b>sheathed</b> nature of MWCNTs that render many of their sidewalls inaccessible; nonetheless, a comparative study on functionalizing single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes is scarce hitherto in open literature.|$|R
