5|$|For {{the first}} six episodes, the show had five corners, or parts, which started with opening {{greetings}} from the hosts {{and went on to}} thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show. This moved on to an <b>informal</b> <b>talk</b> between the hosts, followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts. The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners, and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play. Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast. The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves, or read from submissions by listeners, and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories. The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue takes these submissions and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan {{suggested}} {{on several}} occasions, including at {{his meeting with}} Lloyd to dismiss him as Chancellor, that he felt there was a conspiracy within the party to replace him as Prime Minister. While the run of poor Conservative results led to <b>informal</b> <b>talk</b> among party MPs and ministers, no such conspiracy existed. His intimations of party disloyalty and the speed and surprise of the sackings were particularly hurtful to Lloyd, who was loyal to Macmillan, and remained so even after his dismissal.|$|E
500|$|In Frame Analyses, Erving Goffman {{provides}} {{a platform for}} understanding and interpreting the interaction between individuals engaging speech communication. In the chapter “The Frame Analyses of Talk,” the focus is put on how words are exchanged and what is being said, specifically in <b>informal</b> <b>talk</b> or conversation. The concept of framing is introduced through an exploration of why misunderstandings occur in these basic, everyday conversations. He argues {{that they are more}} errors in verbal framing than anything else. The types of frames Goffman is considering are discussed in previous sections of the book, “fabrications, keyings, frame breaks, misframing, and, of course, frame disputes.” That a frame can assume so many forms is the basis of his analyses, “these framings are subject to a multitude of different ...|$|E

The opportunity came yesterday, and Sir John went fully into your case, showed him the reports, and mentioned how he came to appoint you because of the clear and lucid description you gave of the movements of every division of Moore's army.|$|E

60|$|He {{had never}} shown much {{indication}} of becoming {{anything in the}} nature of a first-class golfer, but he had managed to acquire one or two decent shots. His work with the light iron was not at all bad, and he was a fairly steady putter. But now, under the shadow of this tragedy, he dropped right back to the form of his earliest period. It was a pitiful sight to see this gaunt, haggard man with the look of dumb anguish behind his spectacles taking as many as three shots sometimes to get past the ladies' tee. His slice, of which he had almost cured himself, returned with such virulence that in the list of ordinary hazards he had now to include the tee-box. And, when he was not slicing, he was pulling. I have heard that he was known, when driving at the sixth, to get bunkered in his own caddie, who had taken up his position directly behind him. As for the deep sand-trap in front of the seventh green, he spent so much of his time in it that there was some <b>informal</b> <b>talk</b> among the members of the committee of charging him a small weekly rent.|$|E
6000|$|DEAR HOWELLS,--Get your lecture by heart--it {{will pay}} you. I learned a trick in Vienna--by accident--which I wish I had learned years ago. I meant {{to read from}} a Tauchnitz, because I knew I hadn't well memorized the pieces; and I came on with the book and read a few sentences, then remembered that the sketch needed {{a few words of}} {{explanatory}} introduction; and so, lowering the book and now and then unconsciously using it to gesture with, I talked the introduction, and it happened to carry me into the sketch itself, and then I went on, pretending that I was merely talking extraneous matter and would come to the sketch presently. It was a beautiful success. I knew the substance of the sketch and the telling phrases of it; and so, the throwing of the rest of it into <b>informal</b> <b>talk</b> as I went along limbered it up and gave it the snap and go and freshness of an impromptu. I was to read several pieces, and I played the same game with all of them, and always the audience thought I was being reminded of outside things and throwing them in, and was going to hold up the book and begin on the sketch presently--and so I always got through the sketch before they were entirely sure that it had begun. I did the same thing in Budapest and had the same good time over again. It's a new dodge, and the best one that was ever invented. Try it. You'll never lose your audience--not even for a moment. Their attention is fixed, and never wavers. And {{that is not the case}} where one reads from book or MS., or where he stands up without a note and frankly exposes the fact, by his confident manner and smooth phrasing, that he is not improvising, but reciting from memory. And in the heat of telling a thing that is memorised in substance only, one flashes out the happiest suddenly-begotten phrases every now and then! Try it. Such a phrase has a life and sparkle about it that twice as good a one could not exhibit if prepared beforehand, and it [...] "fetches" [...] an audience in such an enthusing and inspiring and uplifting way that that lucky phrase breeds another one, sure.|$|E
6000|$|I asked Mr. Rupert Sent Leger to dine {{with me at}} {{my office}} alone, as [...] I wished to have a chat with him. To-morrow Sir Colin and I will [...] have a formal meeting {{with him for the}} {{settlement}} of affairs, but I [...] thought it best to have an <b>informal</b> <b>talk</b> with him alone first, as I [...] wished to tell him certain matters which will make our meeting [...] to-morrow more productive of utility, as he can now have more full [...] understanding of the subjects which we have to discuss. Sir Colin is [...] all that can be in manhood, and I could wish no better colleague in [...] the executorship of this phenomenal Will; but he has not had the [...] privilege of a lifelong friendship with the testator as I have had. [...] And as Rupert Sent Leger had to learn intimate details regarding his [...] uncle, I could best make my confidences alone. To-morrow we shall [...] have plenty of formality. I was delighted with Rupert. He is just [...] what I could have wished his mother's boy to be--or a son of my own [...] to be, had I had the good-fortune to have been a father. But this is [...] not for me. I remember long, long ago reading a passage in Lamb's [...] Essays which hangs in my mind: [...] "The children of Alice call Bartrum [...] father." [...] Some of my old friends would laugh to see me write this, [...] but these memoranda are for my eyes alone, and no one shall see them [...] till after my death, unless by my own permission. The boy takes some [...] qualities after his father; he has a daring that is disturbing to an [...] old dryasdust lawyer like me. But somehow I like him more than I [...] ever liked anyone--any man--in my life--more even than his uncle, my [...] old friend, Roger Melton; and Lord knows I had much cause to like [...] him. I have more than ever now. It was quite delightful to see the [...] way the young adventurer was touched by his uncle's thought of him. [...] He is a truly gallant fellow, but venturesome exploits have not [...] affected the goodness of heart. It is a pleasure to me to think that [...] Roger and Colin came together apropos of the boy's thoughtful [...] generosity towards Miss MacKelpie. The old soldier will be a good [...] friend to him, or I am much mistaken. With an old lawyer like me, [...] and an old soldier like him, and a real old gentlewoman like Miss [...] MacKelpie, who loves the very ground he walks on, to look after him, [...] together with all his own fine qualities and his marvellous [...] experience of the world, and the gigantic wealth that will surely be [...] his, that young man will go far.|$|E
