40|$|In {{this thesis}} we explore the {{characteristics}} of strongly interacting matter, described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In particular, we investigate the properties of QCD at extreme densities, a region yet to be explored by first principle methods. We base the study on lattice gauge theory with Wilson fermions in the strong coupling, heavy quark regime. We expand the lattice action around this limit, and carry out analytic integrals over the gauge links to obtain an effective, dimensionally reduced, theory of Polyakov loop interactions. The 3 D effective theory suffers only from a mild sign problem, and we briefly outline {{how it can be}} simulated using either Monte Carlo techniques with reweighting, or the Complex Langevin flow. We then continue to the main topic of the thesis, namely the analytic treatment of the effective theory. We introduce the linked cluster expansion, a method ideal for studying thermodynamic expansions. The complex nature of the effective theory action requires the development of a generalisation of the linked cluster expansion. We find a mapping between <b>generalised</b> <b>linked</b> cluster expansion and our effective theory, and use this to compute the thermodynamic quantities. Lastly, various resummation techniques are explored, and a chain resummation is implemented on the level of the effective theory itself. The resummed effective theory describes not only nearest neighbour, next to nearest neighbour, and so on, interactions, but couplings at all distances, making it well suited for describing macroscopic effects. We compute the equation of state for cold and dense heavy QCD, and find a correspondence with that of non-relativistic free fermions, indicating a shift of the dynamics in the continuum. We conclude this thesis by presenting two possible extensions to new physics using the techniques outlined within. First is the application of the effective theory in the large-N_c limit, of particular interest to the study of conformal field theory. Second is the computation of analytic Yang Lee zeros, which can be applied in the search for real phase transitions...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} study to {{encompass}} {{a wide range of}} coupled snow evolution and microwave emission models in a common modelling framework in order to <b>generalise</b> the <b>link</b> between snowpack microstructure predicted by the snow evolution models and microstructure required to reproduce observations of brightness temperature as simulated by snow emission models. Brightness temperatures at 18. 7 and 36. 5  GHz were simulated by 1323 ensemble members, formed from 63 Jules Investigation Model snowpack simulations, three microstructure evolution functions, and seven microwave emission model configurations. Two years of meteorological data from the Sodankylä Arctic Research Centre, Finland, were used to drive the model over the 2011 – 2012 and 2012 – 2013 winter periods. Comparisons between simulated snow grain diameters and field measurements with an IceCube instrument showed that the evolution functions from SNTHERM simulated snow grain diameters that were too large (mean error 0. 12 to 0. 16  mm), whereas MOSES and SNICAR microstructure evolution functions simulated grain diameters that were too small (mean error − 0. 16 to − 0. 24  mm for MOSES and − 0. 14 to − 0. 18  mm for SNICAR). No model (HUT, MEMLS, or DMRT-ML) provided a consistently good fit across all frequencies and polarisations. The smallest absolute values of mean bias in brightness temperature over a season for a particular frequency and polarisation ranged from 0. 7 to 6. 9  K. Optimal scaling factors for the snow microstructure were presented to compare compatibility between snowpack model microstructure and emission model microstructure. Scale factors ranged between 0. 3 for the SNTHERM–empirical MEMLS model combination (2011 – 2012) and 3. 3 for DMRT-ML in conjunction with MOSES microstructure (2012 – 2013). Differences in scale factors between microstructure models were generally greater than the differences between microwave emission models, suggesting that more accurate simulations in coupled snowpack–microwave model systems will be achieved primarily through improvements in the snowpack microstructure representation, followed by improvements in the emission models. Other snowpack parameterisations in the snowpack model, mainly densification, led to a mean brightness temperature difference of 11  K at 36. 5  GHz H-pol and 18  K at V-pol when the Jules Investigation Model ensemble was applied to the MOSES microstructure and empirical MEMLS emission model for the 2011 – 2012 season. The impact of snowpack parameterisation increases as the microwave scattering increases. Consistency between snowpack microstructure and microwave emission models, and the choice of snowpack densification algorithms should be considered in the design of snow mass retrieval systems and microwave data assimilation systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|Rivers are an {{integral}} part of the earth’s ecological, hydrological and physical systems, and also provide an indispensible range of services to humans. However, despite our strong dependence on rivers, human activities, and particularly the increased pressure on water resources, have resulted in a general degradation of river health world-wide. The long-term sustainability of many river systems is dependent on their successful management, and a key component of river management is to simply and meaningfully order streams into natural or arbitrary groups based on common characteristics. Such classification can assist in the management of rivers by increasing understanding of river form and process amongst the general complexity found in rivers. River classification has been central to developing an understanding of the links between hydrology, geomorphology and ecology and also allows knowledge from a particular river type at one location to be extrapolated to other locations of the same type, thus reducing resourcing requirements. Although possessing a relative abundance of water in comparison to many other regions, north-eastern Tasmanian faces pressures on water resources similar to those experienced elsewhere. In recent years, considerable effort has been directed towards achieving a balance between abstraction and environmental flows in north-eastern Tasmanian rivers, but this process has been complicated by the wide variety of riverine environments and channel and floodplain forms found in the region, and by the relatively few studies that have investigated the region’s geomorphology, hydrology, and ecology. Two approaches to classification have been adopted in the management of Tasmanian rivers. A nested hierarchical river classification system has been developed for Tasmania, and has formed the basis of a comprehensive river health assessment methodology. However this approach is relatively resource intensive, requiring data to be collected and expert analysis to be applied at different scales. In addition the large number of groups (river types) that this model produces means that developing relationships between flow alteration and physical and ecological response for each river type is impractical. A second approach has been the development of a broad two-classed model that classifies rivers on the basis of hydrological variability. Although this is an objective and quantitative model requiring few resources, the wide variety of river types included within each of the two classes mean that only the most <b>generalised</b> models <b>linking</b> hydrology, geomorphology and ecology can be developed. While each of these classification systems could be considered to fulfil the purpose for which they were designed, the lack of a simple and objective method to classify rivers into a reasonable number of meaningful classes on the basis of channel morphology has limited the development of predictive ecosystem models to link the physical and ecological responses of north-eastern Tasmanian rivers to altered flows. The aim of this study was to develop an objective and quantitative method to group north-eastern Tasmanian rivers and streams into hydromorphologically meaningful groups. This was achieved through several sub-studies; estimation of the magnitude and frequency of small floods, investigation of bankfull channel morphometry, analysis of the first order estimates of peak discharge of small floods, and assessment of the hydromorphological characteristics of different river basins. The magnitude-frequency of small floods (average recurrence interval 2 km km- 1, while internally draining catchments were found to have drainage density < 2 km km- 1. The estimation of bankfull discharge in north-eastern Tasmanian rivers was investigated, and peak discharge with an average recurrence interval of two years was proposed as a proxy for bankfull discharge. Attempts to accurately measure bankfull discharge at the study sites using field techniques were unsuccessful, as was the use of commonly used flow resistance equations. Large variances were found between estimates from different flow resistance equations, particularly at sites with deeper channels and high hydraulic radius. Estimates of peak discharge of small floods developed previously were used to develop suitable methods to estimate stream-power values. Substantial variability in downstream trends in stream-power was found in the Pipers, Ringarooma and Scamander rivers. These rivers were found to have different longitudinal trends and to deviate from the general downstream stream power trends found elsewhere. There was some evidence of an association between channel morphology and stream power, with high WD values/ low R values occurring at locations with high stream power. The river and catchment metrics developed in earlier chapters were then used in conjunction with univariate and multivariate statistical analysis in an attempt to develop meaningful hydromorphological groupings of north-eastern Tasmanian rivers. using objective and quantitative methods. A range of univariate and multivariate statistical techniques was applied to a dataset consisting of 164 channel cross-sections from thirteen sites, and the results were assessed against a separate dataset containing 58 cross-sections from 15 sites. A strong source of underlying variability in the channel morphdataset was found to occur along an orthogonal axis which had high values of width-to-depth ratio at one end and high hydraulic radius values at the other. The variability of bankfull channel morphology both along a reach and between sites was examined, and Principal Components Analysis and agglomerative clustering used to examine the underlying structure in the data and identify the best low-dimensional representation of the variability in channel morphology. The river and catchment metrics developed in earlier chapters were then used in conjunction with multivariate statistical analysis of channel cross-sectional data from field surveys to investigate variability in channel morphology and develop a quantitative morphological typology. A strong source of underlying variability in the dataset was found to occur along an orthogonal axis which had high values of width-to-depth ratio at one end and high hydraulic radius values at the other. While analysis was able to identify two groupings with membership based on either high width-to-depth ratio or high hydraulic radius, methods to derive the groupings of sites based on channel parameters using remote parameters were generally unsuccessful; combinations of the remote parameter values were unable to reproduce natural grouping identified using channel parameters. However drainage density was identified as a strong remotely sensed predictor variable. The results suggest that localised and reach scale factors have more influence on channel morphology than catchment scale controls in north-eastern Tasmanian rivers. The overall study results suggest that north-eastern Tasmanian rivers are highly variable and have characteristics different from those found elsewhere. This has implications for the use of remotely sensed data and GIS tools in the study of regional hydromorphological characteristics...|$|R
