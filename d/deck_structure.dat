25|$|Tacoma Narrows Bridge, (USA), 853m – 1940. The Tacoma Narrows {{bridge was}} {{vulnerable}} to structural vibration in sustained and moderately strong winds {{due to its}} plate-girder <b>deck</b> <b>structure.</b> Wind caused a phenomenon called aeroelastic fluttering that led to its collapse only months after completion. The collapse was captured on film.|$|E
25|$|A self-anchored {{suspension}} bridge has some similarity {{in principle to}} the cable-stayed type in that tension forces that prevent the deck from dropping are converted into compression forces vertically in the tower and horizontally along the <b>deck</b> <b>structure.</b> It is also related to the {{suspension bridge}} in having arcuate main cables with suspender cables, although the self-anchored type lacks the heavy cable anchorages of the ordinary suspension bridge. Unlike either a cable-stayed bridge or a suspension bridge, the self-anchored suspension bridge must be supported by falsework during construction {{and so it is}} more expensive to construct.|$|E
25|$|The {{automated}} welding procedures {{used by the}} deck boxes fabricator (Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Co. Ltd.) were frequently performed in the rain. Such welding has been long recognized as leading to the cracking of imperfect welds. Such welds were considered by Caltrans management to be of low criticality in this bridge owing to the compressive forces imposed on the <b>deck</b> <b>structure</b> by this particular design. There are also reports of the vendor being uncooperative {{to the concerns of}} Caltrans inspectors and engineers. Owing to the fragility of the old cantilever structure and the possibility of a destructive earthquake, Caltrans felt motivated to avoid further delays in the new span's completion.|$|E

40|$|Growing {{demand for}} larger {{accommodation}} rooms in superyachts result in larger deck spans {{at the cost}} of increased height of <b>deck</b> <b>structures.</b> (Conventional) aluminium poses a practical limit due to its relatively low stiffness, whereas composites are deemed overly expensive and unsafe in case of a fire. Composite stiffening of the primary stiffeners in aluminium <b>deck</b> <b>structures</b> utilises both material’s best attributes to increase deck spans and/or decrease structural deck height. This research evaluates the concept of composite stiffened <b>deck</b> <b>structures</b> using a cost-benefit analysis to prove the feasibility of the concept of composite stiffening elements in superyachts...|$|R

500|$|Incorporating a roadway only [...] wide, {{and with}} serious {{structural}} weaknesses, {{the bridge was}} ill-equipped {{to cope with the}} advent of the motor vehicle during the 20th century. Despite the many calls for its demolition or pedestrianisation, the Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles throughout its existence, other than for brief spells during repairs, and is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London never to have been replaced. The strengthening work carried out by Bazalgette and the Greater London Council did not prevent further deterioration of the bridge's structure. A series of increasingly strict traffic control measures have been introduced to limit its use and thus prolong its life, making it the least busy Thames road bridge in London, except for the little-used Southwark Bridge. The bridge's condition is continuing to degrade as the result of traffic load and severe rotting of the timber <b>deck</b> <b>structure</b> caused by the urine of the many dogs using it as a route to nearby Battersea Park.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>deck</b> <b>structures</b> {{are located}} at {{elevations}} {{low enough to}} be impacted by large waves. However, due to the highly complex and impulsive nature of the interactions between wave crests and intricate <b>deck</b> <b>structures,</b> establishing reliable estimates of extreme pressures and forces for use in design remains challenging. In this paper, results from an extensive set of three-dimensional scale model tests conducted to support {{the design of a}} large pile-supported pier (or jetty) are presented and discussed. Relationships between maximum wave-in-deck loads and the deck clearance (air gap) are presented and discussed. Results from numerical simulations of the wave-structure interaction process obtained using the three-dimensional CFD software FLOW- 3 D are also presented and discussed. Finally, some initial comparisons between the numerical and physical modelling are also included. This paper provides new insights concerning the character and magnitude of the hydrodynamic pressures and loads exerted on intricate pile-supported <b>deck</b> <b>structures</b> due to impact by non-linear shallow-water waves, and the relationships between the hydrodynamic forcing and the deck clearance or air gap.

2500|$|The 1973 {{lengthening}} {{altered the}} ship's external appearance. The [...] extension meant {{she lost her}} yacht-like looks and now appeared more like a liner. In addition to the lengthening, new spaces were built behind the bridge, which meant the removal of her original stylified dummy funnel.

2500|$|Being asymmetrical, {{the shorter}} western span must be pulled {{down against the}} forces imposed by the longer eastern span. In order to avoid uplift in the {{supporting}} columns, the span is terminated with a massive concrete end weight. This end weight also carries the turning saddles for the main cables. As seen in the northwest corner image above, there is an upward component to the tension force provided by the main cable, {{and it is this}} component that removes most of the weight of the end cap from its columns. (The greater, horizontal, component is countered by the compressive forces exerted by the box <b>deck</b> <b>structure</b> as is characteristic of this type of bridge.) ...|$|E

50|$|In short-span bridges (~10-40m spans), {{prestressing}} {{is commonly}} {{employed in the}} form of precast pre-tensioned girders or planks; for medium-length structures (~40m-200m spans), precast-segmental, in-situ balanced-cantilever and incrementally-launched designs are all efficiently constructed using prestressing; while for the longest bridges, prestressed concrete <b>deck</b> <b>structures</b> often form an integral part of cable-stayed designs.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} underwent {{an evolutionary}} change {{to become an}} enclosed structure, essentially a floodable compartment, for docking amphibious vehicles that in most modern versions has lost its weather deck character even as the more modern commercial ship designs have abandoned the traditional well <b>deck</b> <b>structures</b> that are not typically features of today's bulk cargo ships, Container ships or Passenger ships.|$|R
2500|$|Special lifting hoists {{attached}} to the suspenders or from the main cables are used to lift prefabricated sections of bridge deck to the proper level, provided that the local conditions allow the sections to be carried below the bridge by barge or other means. [...] Otherwise, a traveling cantilever derrick {{may be used to}} extend the deck one section at a time starting from the towers and working outward. If the addition of the <b>deck</b> <b>structure</b> extends from the towers the finished portions of the deck will pitch upward rather sharply, as there is no downward force {{in the center of the}} span. Upon completion of the deck the added load will pull the main cables into an arc mathematically described as a parabola, while the arc of the deck will be as the designer intended – usually a gentle upward arc for added clearance if over a shipping channel, or flat in other cases such as a span over a canyon. Arched suspension spans also give the structure more rigidity and strength.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Oriskany" [...] was {{originally}} assigned to , but that hull was renamed [...] when the keel was laid in 1942. CV-34 was laid down on 1 May 1944 by the New York Naval Shipyard (NYNSY), launched on 13 October 1945, and sponsored by Mrs. Clarence Cannon. Construction was suspended on 22 August 1946, {{when the ship}} was approximately 85% complete. Oriskany was redesigned as the prototype for the SCB-27 modernization program beginning on 8 Aug 1947, and torn down to 60% complete. To handle {{the new generation of}} carrier aircraft, the flight <b>deck</b> <b>structure</b> was massively reinforced. Stronger elevators, more powerful hydraulic catapults, and new arresting gear were installed. The island structure was rebuilt, the anti-aircraft turrets were removed, and blisters were added to the hull. Blistering the hull (also known as adding bulges) increases the cross-sectional area of a ship's hull, thereby increasing its buoyancy and stability. It also provides increased bunker volume. In the case of Oriskany, this would have been for aviation fuel. These features would have been crucial to a ship that had so much topside weight added after its original design. Oriskany was commissioned in the New York Naval Shipyard on 25 September 1950, Captain Percy H. Lyon in command.|$|E
