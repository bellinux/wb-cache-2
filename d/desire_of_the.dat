5|$|In 1913 the Admiralty {{agreed to}} lend Philomel to New Zealand as a {{seagoing}} training cruiser {{to form the}} nucleus of the newly established New Zealand Naval Forces, which was a new division of the Royal Navy. This was in response to the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand Minister of Defence at the time, James Allen, who wanted to establish a local naval force which would co-operate with the fledgling Royal Australian Navy.|$|E
5|$|Ptolemy II Philadelphus, {{emperor of}} Ptolemaic Egypt, may have forged an {{alliance}} with the Lihyanites {{in order to secure}} the incense route at Dedan, thereby rerouting the incense trade from Dedan to the coast along the Red Sea to Egypt. I. E. S. Edwards connects the Syro-Ephraimite War to the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Israelites and the Aramaeans to control the northern end of the Incense route, which ran up from Southern Arabia and could be tapped by commanding Transjordan.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} is a stressor in relationships. People {{are often}} as concerned about failing {{to keep a}} partner satisfied as they are about meeting their own sexual needs. In fact, two of the top reasons people with SCI cite for wanting to have sex are for intimacy and to keep a partner. The frequency of sex correlates with the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uninjured partner.|$|E
5|$|Æthelred (or Ethelred; died 30 June 888) was an Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury {{in medieval}} England. Although one source {{states that he}} was Bishop of Wiltshire prior to his {{elevation}} to Canterbury, this {{has been shown to}} be false. Much of Æthelred's time in office was spent dealing with the dislocations caused by the invasion of England by Vikings. There were also conflicts with King Alfred the Great over ecclesiastical matters as well as the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> papacy to reform the English clergy.|$|E
5|$|Disagreements arose between Allied commanders {{over the}} {{operational}} plan, {{which called for}} a series of dispersed landings, based on the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air, naval, and logistical planners concerning the early capture of ports and airfields. General Bernard Montgomery, the commander of the British Eighth Army, objected to this aspect of the plan, since it exposed the Allied forces to defeat in detail. Montgomery put forward an alternate plan that involved American and British forces landing side by side. He convinced Smith that his alternate plan was sound, and the two men then persuaded most of the other Allied commanders. Montgomery's plan provided for the early seizure of airfields, which satisfied Tedder and Cunningham. The fears of logisticians like Major General Thomas B. Larkin that supply would not be practical without a port were resolved by the use of amphibious trucks.|$|E

5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to the letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency {{had to do with the}} strong <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid offending Marylanders who might be tempted to join Lee's army.|$|E
5|$|The Jersey Act was {{introduced}} to prevent the registration of most American-bred Thoroughbred horses in the British General Stud Book. It had {{its roots in the}} <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British to halt the influx of American-bred racehorses of possibly impure bloodlines during the early 20th century. Many American-bred horses were exported to Europe to race and retire to a breeding career after a number of US states banned gambling, which depressed Thoroughbred racing as well as breeding in the United States. The loss of breeding records during the American Civil War and the late beginning of the registration of American Thoroughbreds led many in the British racing establishment to doubt that the American-bred horses were purebred.|$|E
5|$|The coin {{stems from}} the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Columbian Exposition's {{organizers}} to gain federal money to complete construction of the fair. Congress granted an appropriation, and allowed it {{to be in the}} form of commemorative half dollars, which legislators and organizers believed could be sold at a premium. Fair official James Ellsworth wanted the new coin to be based on a 16th-century painting he owned by Lorenzo Lotto, reputedly of Columbus, and pushed for this through the design process. When initial sketches by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber proved unsatisfactory, fair organizers turned to a design by artist Olin Levi Warner, which after modification by Barber and by his assistant, George T. Morgan, was struck by the Mint.|$|E

5|$|The {{efforts of}} the two monarchs could not yield the desired result because the French, upon {{learning}} of their request, responded promptly to what they perceived {{as a threat to}} their interests in the Pacific. On 27 March 1889, the French warship Dives landed on Rurutu carrying the colonial governor of French Oceania, Étienne Lacascade. British and French sources provide differing accounts of Teuruarii's response to Lacascade's arrival. According to the British, the King was initially reluctant to agree to a French protectorate but ultimately decided to give his acquiescence. According to the French, however, King Teuruarii and his chiefs had personally petitioned Governor Lacascade to take over the islands, largely contrary to the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority of the islanders.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the medieval}} period saw a fresh {{resurgence}} {{in the building of}} keeps in western castles. Some castles continued to be built without keeps: the Bastille in the 1370s, for example, combined a now traditional quadrangular design with machicolated corner towers, gatehouses and moat; the walls, innovatively, were of equal height to the towers. This fashion became copied across French and in England, particularly amongst the nouveau riche, for example at Nunney. The royalty and the very wealthiest in France, England and Spain, however, began to construct a small number of keeps on a much larger scale than before, in England sometimes termed tower keeps, as part of new palace fortresses. This shift reflected political and social pressures, such as the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wealthiest lords to have privacy from their growing households of retainers, as well as the various architectural ideas being exchanged across the region, despite the ongoing Hundred Years War between France and England.|$|E
5|$|The main {{problems}} were {{the pressure of}} time and the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. president for secrecy. The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was only two months away. By the order of the president, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was as tight as General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders got only two or three days' notice.|$|E

5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{execution}} of Joachim III, who had previously saved Theodore Svetoslav from Byzantine captivity, are not entirely clear. Historians Ivan Bozhilov and Vasil Gyuzelev speculate that the Patriarch was among the responsible dignitaries for a Mongol invasion in 1285, after which Theodore Svetoslav had to be sent a hostage in the Golden Horde. John Van Antwerp Fine Jr. suggests that the alleged treachery might {{be linked to the}} obscure period when Smilets overthrew George Terter I. Others believe that the verdict was a result of the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new emperor to seek personal retribution from those who he deemed responsible for the hardships of his youth. However, most agree that the actions of Theodore Svetoslav consolidated the shaken imperial authority and paved the way for his long and successful reign. Bulgaria prospered between 1300 and 1321; the Mongol interference was dealt with and the country even regained Bessarabia from the Golden Horde.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accession}} in Great Britain, George's {{relationship with}} his son (which had always been poor) worsened. George Augustus, Prince of Wales, encouraged opposition to his father's policies, including measures designed to increase religious freedom in Britain and expand Hanover's German territories {{at the expense of}} Sweden. In 1717 the birth of a grandson led to a major quarrel between George and the Prince of Wales. The King, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The King was angered when the Prince of Wales, disliking Newcastle, verbally insulted the Duke at the christening, which the Duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel. The Prince was told to leave the royal residence, St. James's Palace. The Prince's new home, Leicester House, became a meeting place for the King's political opponents. George and his son were later reconciled at the insistence of Robert Walpole and the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Princess of Wales, who had moved out with her husband but missed her children who had been left in the care of the King. However, following the quarrel at the baptism, father and son would never again be on cordial terms.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{thousands}} of settlers, attracted {{in part by}} the lure of free land, began emigrating west over the Oregon Trail. Leaving drought, worn-out farms, and economic problems behind, they emigrated from states like Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa in the Midwest to Oregon, especially the Willamette Valley {{in the western part of}} the state. After passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 and the discovery of gold in the upper John Day basin, a fraction of these newcomers abandoned the Willamette Valley in favor of eastern Oregon. Some established villages and engaged in subsistence farming and ranching near streams. Settlement was made more practical by a supply route from The Dalles on the Columbia River to gold mines at Canyon City in the upper John Day valley. By the late 1860s, the route became formalized as The Dalles Military Road, which passed along Bridge Creek and south of Sheep Rock. Clashes between natives and non-natives and the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Government to populate the region with Euro-Americans led to the gradual removal of native residents to reservations, including three in north-central Oregon: Warm Springs, Burns Paiute, and Umatilla.|$|E

5|$|On July 6, 2016, Wade announced, in {{a letter}} to Miami, that he had agreed to join the Chicago Bulls on a two-year deal worth $47.5 million. Wade said he felt {{unwanted}} and under-appreciated by Heat president Pat Riley, and noted that his relationship with Riley was in tatters by the end of negotiations. On July 15, he officially signed with the Bulls. He made his debut for the Bulls in their season opener on October 27, scoring 22 points with four made three-pointers in a 105–99 win over the Boston Celtics. The next day, Wade was fined $25,000 for making a throat slash gesture after a game-sealing three-point shot. On November 4, he scored 35 points on 12-of-20 shooting in a 117–104 loss to the New York Knicks. He made five three-pointers to give him 10 in five games in 2016–17; he had a total of seven in 2015–16. On January 21, 2017, he had 30 points and two key steals in the final minute of the Bulls' 102–99 win over the Sacramento Kings. After questioning the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team's younger players following a loss to the Atlanta Hawks on January 25, Wade was fined and held out of the starting lineup against Miami on January 27 as punishment. On March 16, 2017, Wade underwent an MRI for a right elbow injury suffered {{in the fourth quarter of}} the Bulls' game against the Memphis Grizzlies the previous night. The results of the MRI showed a sprain and a small fracture in the elbow. Wade returned to action on April 8, 2017, scoring 14 points in a 107–106 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.|$|E
5|$|On June 6, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{returned}} to the Aleutians, occupying Kiska on that day and Attu Island the next. Despite the U.S. not posting any forces to oppose the occupation of those islands, the Japanese public was informed of a great triumph over U.S. forces on the islands. It was the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Joint Chiefs of Staff to recapture these islands as quickly as possible, and on August 30, 1942, 4,500 U.S. Army troops secured the island of Adak, {{to be used as}} a staging post to recapture Kiska. In two weeks, Army engineers had constructed an airfield on the island, and on September 14, a number of Consolidated B-24 Liberators took off from Adak to attack Kiska. Repeated bombings during the fall season convinced the Japanese of the Americans' desire to recapture Kiska and Adak, and by November the Japanese had bolstered troop numbers on the ground on both islands. During the winter months, the short daily sunshine period and inclement weather protected the Japanese from attack.|$|E
