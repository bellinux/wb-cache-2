More indications have been given the Commission in an <b>Inception</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Assessment,</b> published in July 2015. The debate on the revamped proposal will have to address at least five crucial issues. Firstly, the legal form - whether the future online sales law will be a regulation or a directive? Secondly, if the legal form of a directive is chosen, whether total harmonisation or minimum harmonisation would be most appropriate, taking into account the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality? Thirdly, whether it would be sufficient for the instrument to regulate cross-border trade, or should it also extend to purely domestic online transactions? A fourth issue regards the 'country of origin principle' - should traders be allowed to rely on their domestic law when selling to consumers abroad? How would that fit with the current system of Rome I and Brussels Ia Regulations? Finally, the debate must focus on the content of the revamped proposal. Should it be copy-pasted from the original CESL, or perhaps tailor-made to online transactions specifically, where both consumers and traders have different interests and expectations than in offline transactions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract / Summary Health <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> (HIA) is {{a process}} that aims to predict {{potential}} positive and negative effects of project, programme or policy proposals on health and health inequalities. It is recommended by national government and internationally. Supporting health <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> is one of the roles of English Public Health Observatories. The few centres in England with accredited health impact training centres have inadequate resources to meet demand. Currently, the London Health Observatory is providing the bulk of the training nationally. Some Public Health Observatories are currently investigating the preferences for support of those commissioning or conducting health <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> within their regions. The availability of published guidance on how to conduct health <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> has increased substantially over the past few years. The Department of Health has funded a research project led by the London Health Observatory to develop advice for reviewing evidence for use in health <b>impact</b> <b>assessment.</b> Completed health <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> can be useful resources. Evaluation of the process and impact of health <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> is important in order to demonstrate its usefulness and to learn lessons for the future. The focus for Public Health Observatories is to train and support others to conduct health <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> according to good practice, rather than undertaking health <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> themselves. The aim is to create sufficient skilled capacity around the country to undertake health <b>impact</b> <b>assessments.</b> The London Health Observatory plans to share its support models and to roll out a train the trainer programme nationally to enable effective local delivery of their national health <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> programme.

40|$|This paper aims at conceptualising the {{effectiveness}} of <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> processes {{through the development of}} a literature-based framework of criteria to measure <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> effectiveness.

The criteria can be mapped within a cycle/or cycles of evaluation, based on the ‘logic model’, at the stages of input, process, output and outcome to enable the identification of connections between the criteria across the categories of effectiveness.

Here, an <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> framework and practical tools for executing <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> may be useful. <b>Impact</b> <b>assessment</b> is the systematic ex-ante evaluation of the likely or possible consequences of policies, programs, projects, laws and other forms of regulation for, in this case, EU citizenship.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{critically}} {{evaluates the}} development of the <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> instrument in Lithuania’s public administration and suggests improvements to its <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> system. Research question: What interesting conceptual imperatives have appeared in Lithuania’s investigation of the impact of regulatory policy? Methodology: This research study uses positivist methodology to analyse the problems that researchers have identified in Lithuania’s <b>impact</b> <b>assessment.</b> This investigation explains why certain problems have appeared, what has changed and what system changes can be identified traced. The study proceeds as follows. First, the research on <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> carried out in Lithuania is analysed. Second, regulations on <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> in Lithuania are investigated. A substitute for non-existent integrated theory is emphased by the logical structure of the EU administrative system imperatives, principles, and norms, whose modifications have become the basis of <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> system design in Lithuania. The present research combines, integrates and consolidates the theoretical and practical information on <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> into an explanatory scheme, which could be developed into a model in the future. Information from two qualitative interviews conducted in 2009 and 2010 was also used. Conclusions: The present research reveals that Lithuania’s regulatory <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> model is still being constructed and reconstructed towards evidence-based management. A model which revises the old impact stereotype has been designed, based on contemporary methodologies (cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses), consultations with the interested parties, a small but exhaustive legal initiatives <b>impact</b> <b>assessment,</b> and a centralised and institutional coordination of <b>impact</b> <b>assessment.</b> Practical consequences: The present research presents the issues which could be useful for the states that are starting to implement a regulatory <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> model. This study described the pitfalls to avoid in order to implement a successful evidence-based management initiative. Originality: In the present research, regulatory <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> is emphased as an assessment model and normative of the EU administration effectiveness and optimality, which can be used as a good-practice example for the modernisation of administrative activities in Central and Eastern Europe to the level their European counterparts. ...|$|R
