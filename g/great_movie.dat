A month before Woodroof died in September 1992, screenwriter Craig Borten was told about the story by his friend, so he went and interviewed him to create the screenplay; Borten recorded many hours of interviews with Woodroof and had access to his personal journals. Borten wrote a script for what he believed would make a <b>great</b> <b>movie</b> and attempted to attract interest in making the film in mid 1996, with Dennis Hopper attached to direct. Columbia Pictures was set to buy the script but the film was unable to secure financial backing.|$|E

In 1988, MGM/UA responded by filing a lawsuit that claimed Disney violated the agreement by operating a working movie and television studio at the resort. On May 1, 1989, the theme park opened adjacent to the production facilities, with MGM's only affiliation being the original licensing agreement that allowed Disney to use MGM's name and lion logo in marketing, and separate contracts that allowed specific MGM content {{to be used in}} The <b>Great</b> <b>Movie</b> Ride.

[...] Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males {{under the age of}} 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like Iron Man, it is common for boys and men to deny liking Titanic. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. [...] "It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) Titanic an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe," [...] he stated. [...] "Titanic has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe.

David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor {{in the history of the}} cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him [...] "the only actor I ever loved in my whole life", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years.

He predicted that the game would be outclassed by Resident Evil (still in development {{at the time of}} the review), but concluded that D was the best horror game presently on the market. Four reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the Saturn version had reduced the load times seen in the 3DO version to almost nothing. They highly praised the storyline and intelligently designed puzzles, and described it as [...] "scary enough to make you an insomniac." [...] GamePro staff gave positive reviews for both the Saturn and PlayStation versions, recommending it to those looking for a horror experience. Maximum staff likewise gave positive reviews to both versions, saying that D is similar to Myst (1993) and Mansion of Hidden Souls (1993) but ultimately better due to its more enticing story. They also praised the FMV graphics and cinematic presentation, but criticized it for its lack of longevity. The reviewers felt its short length, addictive gameplay, and lack of overly challenging puzzles ensured that the player will be finished with it very quickly. A Next Generation reviewer gave the same praises for the scary storyline and graphics, and also said the puzzles [...] "are just challenging enough to satisfy and yet not so difficult as to impede your progress for very long." [...] However, he felt the slow character movement and lack of longevity kept the game from being truly exceptional. Staff at Game Informer were more critical in their review of the Saturn version. They found the gameplay tedious but did praise the graphics and the storytelling, concluding the [...] "story would make a <b>great</b> <b>movie</b> or book, but not a game." ...|$|E

[...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described the film: [...] "It's a smooth, compelling, almost suspenseful ... and slightly hollow Hollywood period piece—a World War II action-drama in which an intriguing (but not electrifying) star performance is buttressed by stellar support." [...] Burr analyzed Cruise's performance: [...] "... his Claus von Stauffenberg is an honorable conception that's ultimately too thin to fully rise up from the pages of history. This story deserves to be told, but for reasons best known to himself, the star has latched onto a strictly Nietzschean interpretation that he rides into the ground." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today thought of Cruise as [...] "unconvincing and stiff as the disenchanted" [...] von Stauffenberg. She felt that the film started slowly and that [...] "even during scenes of intense action, the visually slick production is only minimally engrossing". She concluded of the film's overall pace, [...] "The action becomes more engrossing during the film's second half, but one expects more depth and nuance, given its pedigree." [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote, [...] " [...] carries the movie, although, once you dig beneath the uniform, there isn’t much for him to get a handle on; the fascination with Stauffenberg resides in what he did, not in who he was." [...] Lane thought that there was [...] "too much" [...] character acting of the British veteran actors and felt of the casting of Nighy, Stamp, and Wilkinson, [...] "These men are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis." ...|$|E
