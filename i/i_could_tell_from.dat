500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E

Judah attacked Meeting Soviet Man for being too sympathetic to the west, and too critical of the Soviet Union. I recall one particularly tense meeting at Judah's house. To lighten up the atmosphere he spent the first hour regaling us with colorful stories about the professional boxing bouts he attended in Melbourne's old Festival Hall. Then he and my father retired to another room to talk the issue out. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the grim expressions as they emerged that there had been no resolution of their differences".|$|E

60|$|Walking {{along the}} Strand one evening last year towards Pall Mall, I was accosted near Charing Cross Station by a strange-looking, middle-aged {{man in a}} poor suit of clothes, who {{surprised}} and startled me by asking if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>from</b> what inn the coach usually started for York.|$|R
60|$|In the {{foreground}} I saw the youth who had discovered us, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> {{the way he}} carried himself that he was quite overcome by his own importance. The warriors about him were all fine looking fellows, though shorter and squatter than the Sarians or the Amozites. Their color, too, was a bit lighter, owing, no doubt, {{to the fact that}} much of their lives is spent within the shadow of the world that hangs forever above their country.|$|E
60|$|A stone-flagged passage, {{with the}} kitchens {{branching}} away from it, {{led by a}} wooden staircase directly {{to the first floor}} of the house. It came out upon the landing opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall.

5000|$|Although The Spoils of Poynton {{is rarely}} {{considered}} one of James' greatest works, most critics have enjoyed the entertaining and well-paced conflict in the novel. The poetic justice of the book's conclusion has also been widely accepted {{as the best way}} to finish the struggle. James' portrayal of Mrs. Gereth has received particular acclaim. She sometimes seems almost unbalanced in her passionate devotion to her fine furniture and art objects: [...] "There isn’t one of them I don’t know and love - yes, as one remembers and cherishes the happiest moments of one’s life. Blindfold, in the dark, with the brush of a finger, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> one <b>from</b> another. They’re living things to me; they know me, they return the touch of my hand." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{never had}} such an awful night. When Joe and Charley weren't {{throwing}} fits they were making believe, and in the darkness the shivers from the cold which I couldn't see seemed like fits, too. And I shivered so hard I thought I was getting fits myself. And little Albert, with nothing to eat, just drooled and drooled. I never seen him as bad as that before. Why, he twisted that left eye of his until it ought to have dropped out. I couldn't see it, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the movements he made. And Joe just lay and cussed and cussed, and Charley cried and wished {{he was back in}} the Home.|$|E
60|$|Now {{in front}} of the gateway of the cattle-kraal, shading it, grew a single big tree of the wild fig order. Passing under this tree I looked and saw that the gateway was quite {{securely}} closed, as now I remembered I had noted at sunset. Then I started to go back but had not stepped {{more than two or three}} paces when, in the bright moonlight, I saw the head of my smallest ox, a beast of the Zulu breed, suddenly appear over the top of the wall. About this there would have been nothing particularly astonishing, had it not been for the fact that this head belonged to a dead animal, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the closed eyes and the hanging tongue.|$|E
6000|$|The {{first time}} that ever I saw these men was one evening after a regatta. They had all been rowing in it, and it had transpired that A could row as much in one hour as B in two, or C in four. B and C had come in dead fagged and C was {{coughing}} badly. [...] "Never mind, old fellow," [...] I heard B say, [...] "I'll fix you up {{on the sofa and}} get you some hot tea." [...] Just then A came blustering in and shouted, [...] "I say, you fellows, Hamlin Smith has shown me three cisterns in his garden and he says we can pump them until to-morrow night. I bet I can beat you both. Come on. You can pump in your rowing things, you know. Your cistern leaks a little, I think, C." [...] I heard B growl that it was a dirty shame and that C was used up now, but they went, and presently <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the sound of the water that A was pumping four times as fast as C.|$|E

6000|$|The more I pondered {{over this}} harpooneer, the more I abominated {{the thought of}} {{sleeping}} with him. It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards.

Naturally I took no more interest in him at first {{than in any other}} of my customers--less, perhaps, since he never in the course of our connection brought his clothes to me himself but always sent them by a boy. When I presently perceived that he was becoming one of my regular customers, I allotted to him his number, Fifty-Six, and began to speculate as to who and what he was. Before long I had reached several conclusions in regard to my unknown client. The quality of his linen showed me that, if not rich, he was at any rate fairly well off. I {{could see that he was}} a young man of regular Christian life, who went out into society to a certain extent; this <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> his sending the same number of articles to the laundry, from his washing always coming on Saturday night, and from the fact that he wore a dress shirt about once a week. In disposition he was a modest, unassuming fellow, for his collars were only two inches high." ...|$|E
6000|$|The twenty bearers having arrived, {{in charge}} {{of five or six}} Arabs armed with guns, we went to inspect them, taking Hassan with us, also the hunters. They were a likely lot of men, though rather thin and scared-looking, and evidently, as I could see from their {{physical}} appearance and varying methods of dressing the hair, members of different tribes. Having delivered them, the Arabs, or rather one of them, entered into excited conversation with Hassan. As Sammy was not at hand I do not know what was said, although I gathered that they were contemplating his rescue. If so, they gave up the idea and began to run away as their companions had done. One of them, however, a bolder fellow than the rest, turned and fired at me. He missed by some yards, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the sing of the bullet, for these Arabs are execrable shots. Still his attempt at murder irritated me so much that I determined he should not go scot-free. I was carrying the little rifle called [...] "Intombi," [...] that with which, as Hans had reminded me, I shot the vultures at Dingaan's kraal many years before. Of course, I could have killed the man, but this I did not wish to do. Or I could have shot him through the leg, but then we should have had to nurse him or leave him to die! So I selected his right arm, which was outstretched as he fled, and at about fifty paces put a bullet through it just above the elbow.|$|E
5000|$|In Cape Town Allan {{was invited}} {{to speak to the}} Cape Town Press Club where the former leader of the opposition, Tony Leon was also in attendance.

She also raised funds for the Big Issue South Africa when they also hosted a book launch and conversation with Viv Horler. Allan was also asked to address the Adele Searll 100 Club at the Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel. Jane Raphaely, {{one of the most influential}} names in South African publishing also addressed the audience to speak about Allan. Raphaely told Allan: “I’m so glad you have written the book because it will lay to rest the ghosts.” She also told the guests that: “Jani did not have an affair with Terre’Blanche. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>from</b> her writing.

6000|$|Two Arabs {{rushed to}} kill him. I shot them both with {{a right and}} left, for {{fortunately}} my rifle was just reloaded. He rose once more and killed a third man. Stephen came to his support and grappling with an Arab, dashed {{his head against the}} gate-post so that he fell. Old Bausi, panting like a grampus, plunged in with his remaining Mazitu and the combatants became so confused in the dark gloom of the overhanging smoke that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>tell</b> one <b>from</b> the other.

6000|$|... "Well, then, I {{have told}} it to no one yet, but I will tell it to you. Many years ago I was a chemist, and among my {{customers}} was Count Leonardo di Marioni. His history was a very sad one, as doubtless you may have heard. When he was quite a young man he was arrested on some political charge, and imprisoned for five-and-twenty years--a cruel time. Well, scarcely more than twelve months ago {{he came to me}} here, so altered that I found it hard indeed to recognize him. Poor old gentleman, when he had talked for a while, I felt quite sure that his long confinement had affected his mind, and his errand with me made me sure of it. He came to buy a celebrated poison which I used at one time to be secretly noted for, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> his manner that he wanted it for some fatal use. Well, I thought at first of refusing it altogether, but what was the use of that? Some one else would have sold him an equally powerful poison, and the mischief would be done all the same. So, after a little consideration, I made up quite an innocent powder, which might cause a little momentary faintness, but which could do no further harm, and I gave it to him as the real thing. I couldn't take money for doing a thing like that, so he pressed this ring upon me. You see, it really has a history." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{they passed}} into the outer room I saw him lay his candle upon the corner {{of one of the}} tables, and he sat himself down, but in such a {{position}} that he was just out of my sight. She moved behind him, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the fact that the light of her taper threw his long, lumpy shadow upon {{the floor in front of}} him. Then he began talking about this man whom he called Edward, and every word that he said was like a blistering drop of vitriol. He spoke low, so that I could not hear it all, but from what I heard I should guess that she would as soon have been lashed with a whip. At first she said some hot words in reply, but then she was silent, and he went on and on in that cold, mocking voice of his, nagging and insulting and tormenting, until I wondered that she could bear to stand there in silence and listen to it. Then suddenly I heard him say in a sharp voice, [...] "Come from behind me! Leave go of my collar! What! would you dare to strike me?" [...] There was a sound like a blow, just a soft sort of thud, and then I heard him cry out, [...] "My God, it's blood!" [...] He shuffled with his feet as if he was getting up, and then I heard another blow, and he cried out, [...] "Oh, you she-devil!" [...] and was quiet, except for a dripping and splashing upon the floor.|$|E
60|$|But in our {{passage to}} the East Indies we were driven by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen's Land. Twelve of our crew died from hard labor and bad food, and the rest were in a very weak condition. On the 5th of November, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock within 120 yards of the ship; but the wind {{was so strong that}} we were driven {{straight}} upon it, and immediately split. Six of the crew, of whom I was one, letting down the boat, got clear of the ship, and we rowed about three leagues, till we could work no longer. We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves; and in about half an hour the boat was upset by a sudden squall. What became of my companions in the boat, or those who escaped on the rock or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but I conclude they were all lost. For my part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was pushed forward by wind and tide; but when I was able to struggle no longer I found myself within my depth. By this time the storm was much abated. I reached the shore at last, about eight o'clock in the evening, and advanced nearly half a mile inland, but could not discover any sign of inhabitants. I was extremely tired, and with the heat of the weather I found myself much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass, which was very short and soft, and slept sounder than ever I did in my life for about nine hours. When I woke, it was just daylight. I attempted to rise, but could not; for as I happened to be lying on my back, I found my arms and legs were fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner. I could only look upward. The sun began to grow hot, and the light hurt my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me, but could see nothing except the sky. In a little time I felt something alive and moving on my left leg, which, advancing gently over my breast, came almost up to my chin, when, bending my eyes downward, I perceived it to be a human creature, not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back. In the meantime I felt at least forty more following the first. I was in the utmost astonishment, and roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground. However, they soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifted up his hands in admiration. I lay all this while in great uneasiness; but at length, struggling to get loose, I succeeded in breaking the strings that fastened my left arm to the ground; and at the same time, with a violent pull that gave me extreme pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches. But the creatures ran off a second time before I could seize them, whereupon there was a great shout, and in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand, which pricked me like so many needles. Moreover, they shot another flight into the air, of which some fell on my face, which I immediately covered with my left hand. When this shower of arrows was over I groaned with grief and pain, and then, striving again to get loose, they discharged another flight of arrows larger than the first, and some of them tried to stab me with their spears; but by good luck I had on a leather jacket, which they could not pierce. By this time I thought it most prudent to lie still till night, when, my left hand being already loose, I could easily free myself; and as for the inhabitants, I thought I might be a match for the greatest army they could bring against me if they were all of the same size as him I saw. When the people observed that I was quiet they discharged no more arrows, but by the noise I heard I knew that their number was increased; and about four yards from me, for more than an hour, there was a knocking, like people at work. Then, turning my head that way as well as the pegs and strings would let me, I saw a stage set up, about {{a foot and a half}} from the ground, with two or three ladders to mount it. From this, one of them, who seemed to be a person of quality, made me a long speech, of which I could not understand a word, though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> his manner that he sometimes threatened me, and sometimes spoke with pity and kindness. I answered in few words, but in the most submissive manner; and, being almost famished with hunger, I could not help showing my impatience by putting my finger frequently to my mouth, to signify that I wanted food. He understood me very well, and, descending from the stage, commanded that several ladders should be set against my sides, on which more than a hundred of the inhabitants mounted, and walked toward my mouth with baskets full of food, which had been sent by the King's orders when he first received tidings of me. There were legs and shoulders like mutton but smaller than the wings of a lark. I ate them two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time. They supplied me as fast as they could, with a thousand marks of wonder at my appetite. I then made a sign that I wanted something to drink. They guessed that a small quantity would not suffice me, and, being a most ingenious people, they slung up one of their largest hogsheads, then rolled it toward my hand, and beat out the top. I drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold half a pint. They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank, and made signs for more; but they had none to give me. However, I could not wonder enough at the daring of these tiny mortals, who ventured to mount and walk upon my body, while one of my hands was free, without trembling at the very sight of so huge a creature as I must have seemed to them. After some time there appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty. His Excellency, having mounted my right leg, advanced to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue, and spoke about ten minutes, often pointing forward, which, as I afterward found, was toward the capital city, about half a mile distant, whither it was commanded by his Majesty that I should be conveyed. I made a sign with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his Excellency's head, for fear of hurting him or his train), to show that I desired my liberty. He seemed to understand me well enough, for he shook his head, though he made other signs to let me know that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment. Then I once more thought of attempting to escape; but when I felt the smart of their arrows on my face and hands, which were all in blisters and observed likewise that the number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased. Then they daubed my face and hands with a sweet-smelling ointment, which in a few minutes removed all the smarts of the arrows. The relief from pain and hunger made me drowsy, and presently I fell asleep. I slept about eight hours, as I was told afterward; and it was no wonder, for the physicians, by the Emperor's orders, had mingled a sleeping draught in the hogsheads of wine.|$|E

60|$|Upon waking {{next morning}} about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown over {{me in the}} most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought I had been his wife.

Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>tell</b> it <b>from</b> the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that Queequeg was hugging me.|$|R

He had glanced at the [...] "Epitome," [...] bought for our voyage, {{knew how to use}} logarithm tables, had seen a sextant at some time, and, what of this and of his seafaring ancestry, he concluded that he did know navigation. But Roscoe was wrong, I still insist. When a young boy he came from Maine to California by way of the Isthmus of Panama, and that was the only time in his life that he was out of sight of land. He had never gone to a school of navigation, nor passed an examination in the same; nor had he sailed the deep sea and learned the art from some other navigator. He was a San Francisco Bay yachtsman, where land is always only several miles away and the art of navigation is never employed.|$|R
60|$|Three Uhlans were at {{the mouth}} of the main street, their horses tethered, and they gossiping together, each with a pipe as long as my sabre. I saw them well in the light of an open door, but of me they could have seen only the flash of Violette's grey side and the black flutter of my cloak. A moment later I flew through a stream of them rushing from an open gateway. Violette's {{shoulder}} sent one of them reeling, and I stabbed at another but missed him. Pang, pang, went two carbines, but I had flown round the curve of the street, and never so much as heard the hiss of the balls. Ah, we were great, both Violette and I. She lay down to it like a coursed hare, the fire flying from her hoofs. I stood in my stirrups and brandished my sword. Someone sprang for my bridle. I sliced him through the arm, and I heard him howling behind me. Two horsemen closed upon me. I cut one down and outpaced the other. A minute later I was clear of the town, and flying down a broad white road with the black poplars on either side. For a time I heard the rattle of hoofs behind me, but they died and died until <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> them <b>from</b> the throbbing of my own heart. Soon I pulled up and listened, but all was silent. They had given up the chase.|$|R
6000|$|One of them threw to {{his rear}} a small branch {{that he had}} just chopped off, and as misfortune would have it, it struck von Schoenvorts across the face. It couldn't have hurt him, for it didn't leave a mark; but he flew into a terrific rage, shouting: [...] "Attention!" [...] in a loud voice. The sailor {{immediately}} straightened up, faced his officer, clicked his heels together and saluted. [...] "Pig!" [...] roared the Baron, and struck the fellow across the face, breaking his nose. I grabbed von Schoenvorts' arm and jerked him away before he could strike again, if such had been his intention, and then he raised his little stick to strike me; but before it descended the muzzle of my pistol was against his belly and he must have seen in my eyes that nothing would suit me better than an excuse to pull the trigger. Like all his kind and all other bullies, von Schoenvorts was a coward at heart, and so he dropped his hand to his side and started to turn away; but I pulled him back, and there before his men I told him that such a thing must never again occur--that no man was to be struck or otherwise punished other than in due process of the laws that we had made and the court that we had established. All the time the sailor stood rigidly at attention, nor <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> his expression whether he most resented the blow his officer had struck him or my interference in the gospel of the Kaiser-breed. Nor did he move until I said to him: [...] "Plesser, you may return to your quarters and dress your wound." [...] Then he saluted and marched stiffly off toward the U-33.|$|R
