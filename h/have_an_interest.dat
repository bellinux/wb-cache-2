5|$|The Mendip Hills Partnership, which {{performs}} {{an administrative}} role, includes the five local authorities {{that cover the}} AONB, statutory bodies such as the Countryside Agency and English Nature, together with parish councils and other organisations and groups that <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in the conservation and care of the area. The Mendip Hills AONB staff unit of the partnership is based at the Charterhouse Centre {{in the heart of}} the AONB. The AONB Unit consists of four staff: a manager, project officer, support officer and part-time planning officer. They are supported by 20 volunteer rangers. In 2005 a proposal was submitted to the Countryside Agency to extend the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to Steep Holm and Brean Down in the west and towards Frome in the east.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} {{a consideration of the}} value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood, including many nonhuman animals and some humans, do not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in liberty or not being used by others, and so have no prima facie right to freedom. They do, however, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed.|$|E
5|$|This {{came to a}} head at {{a meeting}} {{sponsored}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Oxford in 1981. The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes. Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research, which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in the night sky.|$|E

5000|$|In UK local {{authority}} politics, the term prejudicial interest {{is used to}} describe {{a particular type of}} conflict of interest involving councillors. When <b>a</b> councillor <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in <b>a</b> topic under debate that may affect their ability to fairly and objectively consider the subject, he or she is said to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> prejudicial <b>interest.</b> An example would be a councillor discussing a planning application for a company in which he or she <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest.</b> The councillor <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in the plans being approved and is therefore considered to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> [...] "prejudicial interest".|$|R
5|$|Chaos;Head follows Takumi Nishijou, a {{high school}} student living in a cargo crate atop a {{building}} in Shibuya, Tokyo. One day, he is sent pictures over the internet, depicting a murder in an alley; he later witnesses a murder resembling the one in the pictures, and believes the killer to be a pink-haired girl he sees at the crime scene. Because of his presence {{at the scene of the}} crime, he is suspected of being the murderer, and starts suffering from paranoia and experiencing delusions. More murders – referred to as the New Generation serial murders – occur, while Takumi meets a number of girls who <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in him, but who he suspects of being linked to the murders. One of them is the pink-haired girl, named Rimi, who claims to be friends with him despite him not having any previous memory of her.|$|E
5|$|The Watcher and {{his companions}} pursue Thaos {{to the city of}} Twin Elms, where they finally learn the truth behind Thaos' actions. The gods are {{synthetic}} beings created by ancient animancers to serve as a civilizing force for the world, which doesn't have any real gods. Thaos is the last survivor of their order, and has survived the centuries by transferring his soul from one body to the next. His eternal mission is to ensure that no one discovers the gods' secret, because then mortals would question their divine authority, and the world could then regress into sectarianism and barbarism. To this end, he works to discredit and suppress animancy wherever it flourishes, because modern animancers may eventually discover the truth through their science. He stole the souls of the Hollowborn to empower the goddess Woedica, who hates animancy and would see it destroyed. Though the other gods <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in protecting their secret, they do not want Woedica to dominate them, and so they help the Watcher reach Thaos.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Jayanthi (Andrea Jeremiah) arrives in Kochi from Mumbai {{in search of}} her missing husband, Ramesh (Ashvin Mathew), an Indian Revenue Service officer who {{frequently}} disappeared from home for various reasons, but is now {{a suspect in the}} gold smuggling. Jayanthi arranged for a taxi to drive her to various locations in her quest to find Ramesh. The taxi driver Raju (Mohanlal) appears to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> of his own in the circumstances surrounding Ramesh's disappearance. At Jayanthi's bidding, Raju drives her to the home of her mother-in-law (KPAC Lalitha) where he cooks for them and interacts in such a way to earn their trust. Jayanthi then asks Raju to drive her to Kochi to the office of her friend, Chandrasekharan (Vijayaraghavan), assistant commissioner of police. Chandrasekharan promises Jayanthi he will investigate the disappearance of Ramesh. After leaving Chandrasekharan's office, Raju drives Jayanthi to see Chandrasekharan's wife, Advocate Rekha (Muthumany), who is also her friend. During their chat, Jayanthi receives a surprise phone call from Ramesh. He explains that he is in Kovalam for an official meeting but will return home the next day, and insists that Jayanthi return home as well. Chandrasekharan later informs Jayanthi that the phone number Ramesh called from was actually in Kochi, not Kovalam. It is also revealed that Sudheer, Ramesh's brother is involved in the smuggling operation.|$|E

25|$|Singer's Practical Ethics (1979) {{analyzes}} {{why and how}} living beings' interests {{should be}} weighed. His principle of equal consideration of interests does not dictate equal treatment of all those with interests, since different interests warrant different treatment. All <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in avoiding pain, for instance, but relatively few <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in cultivating their abilities. Not only does his principle justify different treatment for different interests, but it allows different treatment for the same interest when diminishing marginal utility is a factor. For example, this approach would privilege a starving person's interest in food over the same interest {{of someone who is}} only slightly hungry.|$|E
25|$|The fishing {{industry}} {{has a strong}} financial incentive to oppose some measures aimed at improving the sustainability of fish stocks. Recreational fisherman also <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in maintaining access to fish stocks. This leads to extensive lobbying that can block or water down government policies intended to prevent overfishing.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 {{the city}} created a Historic Preservation Commission to review {{applications}} for new {{construction in the}} district, or exterior modifications to existing buildings that go beyond routine maintenance. It consists of seven members appointed by the mayor. At least one must be an architect, one a historian, and one live in the district. All must <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in preservation.|$|E
25|$|Many users do not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in {{handling}} their excreta {{which can be}} another hurdle for acceptance of UDDTs. Therefore, provisions {{should be made to}} offer door-to-door/curbside collection of these materials, similar to how existing municipal or private schemes collect household organic waste (from kitchens and gardens, etc.) and transport these materials to a centralized facility for composting or biogas generation.|$|E
25|$|Volume {{collections}} (Hoards): Collectors may <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> {{in acquiring}} {{large volumes of}} a particular coins (e.g., as many pennies as they can store). These usually are not high-value coins, but the interest is in collecting a large volume of them either {{for the sake of}} the challenge, as a store of value, or in the hope that the intrinsic metal value will increase.|$|E

25|$|There are no formalised rules {{regarding}} {{observation and}} monitoring, but many educators <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> {{in working with}} interaction-based observation. It is common for an institution to hold parent consultations, where {{the staff of the}} institution discuss with individual children's parents how children thrive in the institution, what they occupy themselves with, their strong and weak points, and about their social relationship with other children.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way, De Witt {{is thought to}} have lent a hand in {{revising}} a major work by Pieter de la Court, published in 1662: Interest van Hollandt. The disparaging remarks about the stadtholderate in this work, which amounted to the assertion that princes (and by implication stadtholders) <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in keeping the world in perpetual conflict, because they wield more influence in such circumstances, incensed the Orangist public.|$|E
25|$|Groups {{of owners}} that have dogs {{of the same}} breed and <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in dog {{breeding}} can form national Kennel clubs. Kennel Clubs maintain breed standards, record pedigrees in a breed registry (or studbook), and issue the rules for conformation dog shows and trials and accreditation of judges. They often serve as registries, which are lists of adult purebred dogs and lists of litters of puppies born to purebred parents.|$|E

25|$|The dating of the design, the {{original}} construction, and {{the identity of}} the builders of the serpent effigy are three questions still debated in the disciplines of social science, including ethnology, archaeology, and anthropology. In addition, contemporary American Indians <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in the site. Several attributions have been entered by academic, philosophic, and Native American concerns regarding all three of these unknown factors of when designed, when built, and by whom.|$|E

25|$|Defra brought IDBs {{under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) from 1 April 2004, and introduced a model complaints procedure for IDBs to operate. This move was aimed to increase the accountability of IDBs to the general public who <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in the way that IDBs are run and operate by providing an independent means of review. At this time Defra also revised and re-issued model statutory rules and procedures under which IDBs operate.|$|E
