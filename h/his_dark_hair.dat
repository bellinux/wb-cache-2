5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E

His time working on his father's farm had developed his strength. During his first game for South Australia, he was challenged to a naked wrestle by the fast bowler and ex-miner Ernie Jones, an informal initiation into the team. To his team mates' surprise, Darling managed to defeat the much larger Jones.|$|E

500|$|Biographers Morecambe and Stirling {{believe that}} Cary Grant was the [...] "greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known". Schickel stated {{that there are}} [...] "very few stars who achieve the {{magnitude}} of Cary Grant, art of a very high and subtle order", and {{thought that he was}} the [...] "best star actor there ever was in the movies". David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor {{in the history of the}} cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him [...] "the only actor I ever loved in my whole life", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Wansell wrote: [...] "To millions of movie-goers around the world, Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour, and the style, of Hollywood in its golden years. With <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> and even darker eyes, mischievous smile and effortless elegance, he was, is, and always will be indelibly one of the great movie stars. Since his death in 1986, the incandescence of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment". Kael stated that the world still thinks of him affectionately, because he [...] "embodies what seems a happier time−a time when we had a simpler relationship to a performer." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1793, Hadji Mustafa Pasha was {{appointed}} {{governor of the}} Pashalik of Belgrade. He declared a general amnesty for former rebels and announced that Muslims would no longer serve as tax-collectors in areas where Christians formed {{a majority of the}} population. These changes were part of a plan devised by Sultan Selim to improve relations with the Pashalik's Christian population {{in the aftermath of the}} recent conflict between Austria and the Ottoman Empire. Sensing that it was safe, Petrović returned to Šumadija in 1794, together with his family. He settled in the town of Topola, where he became a livestock merchant and traded with the Austrians. His business dealings led him to establish connections with many Habsburg Serbs. In 1796, Osman Pazvantoğlu, the renegade governor of the Sanjak of Vidin, who had rejected the authority of the Sublime Porte, launched an invasion of the Pashalik of Belgrade. Overwhelmed, Mustafa Pasha formed a Serbian national militia to help stop the incursion. Petrović joined the militia and became a boluk-bashi (...) , leading a military detachment of 100 men. In return for their service, the Serbs of the Pashalik were granted a number of privileges. They were allowed to bear arms and command their own military units independent of Ottoman control. After the Serb militias joined the war on Mustafa Pasha's side, Pazvantoğlu suffered a string of defeats, compelling him to retreat to Vidin, which was subsequently besieged. The war against Pazvantoğlu marked the first time that Petrović distinguished himself in the eyes of the Ottomans, who gave him the sobriquet [...] "Black George" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ), partly because of <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> and partly because of his sinister reputation. His service with the Serbian militia also resulted in him becoming well acquainted with Ottoman military doctrine.|$|E

Due to <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> and eyes, he is known as [...] "Riki the Dark" [...] and is the former gang leader of the Bison gang in Ceres. Considered the [...] "charisma of the slums", Riki was once proud, rebellious, fierce, and defiant, but after his three years of being Iason's pet, he became more mature and quiet. Before {{becoming}} Iason's pet, Riki was once the lover of Guy, the second-in-command of Bison, but their relationship ended once Iason forced Riki to be his pet for three years, which had a crushing effect on his human pride. Throughout the story, Riki is torn between his pride and the feelings he has for Iason that he is unwilling to acknowledge. In the audio book, 1990s OVAs, and the first drama CD, he is voiced by Seki Toshihiko. In the later drama CDs and the remake OVAs, he is voiced by Kentarō Itō. In the English dub, he is voiced by Darren Mitchell.|$|E

2500|$|After {{successfully}} {{running the}} midget at some hillclimbing events in 1951, Brabham {{became interested in}} road racing. He bought and modified a series of racing cars from the Cooper Car Company, a British constructor, and from 1953 concentrated on this form of racing, in which drivers compete on closed tarmac circuits. He was supported by his father and by the Redex fuel additive company, although his commercially aware approach—including the title RedeX Special painted {{on the side of}} his Cooper-Bristol—did not go down well with the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS), which banned the advertisement. Brabham competed in Australia and New Zealand until early 1955, taking [...] "a long succession of victories", including the 1953 Queensland Road Racing championship. During this time, he picked up the nickname [...] "Black Jack", which has been variously attributed to <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> and stubble, to his [...] "ruthless" [...] approach on the track, and to his [...] "propensity for maintaining a shadowy silence". After the 1954 New Zealand Grand Prix, Brabham was persuaded by Dean Delamont, competitions manager of the Royal Automobile Club in the United Kingdom, to try a season of racing in Europe, then the international centre of road racing.|$|E
