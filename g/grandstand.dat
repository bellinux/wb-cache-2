5|$|Construction of the track, on {{the site}} of the former Kaiser Steel Mill, began in 1995 and was {{completed}} in late 1996. The speedway has a <b>grandstand</b> capacity of 68,000 and 28 skyboxes and a total capacity of 122,000. In 2006, a fanzone was added behind the main <b>grandstand.</b> Lights were added to the speedway in 2004 with the addition of a second annual NASCAR weekend. Since 2011, the track has hosted only one NASCAR weekend.|$|E

5|$|In 1860 {{the first}} Harrison County fair {{was held in}} Corydon. The county fair has been an annual event since then and is the longest {{continuously}} running fair in the state. The county fairgrounds {{were built in the}} southwest corner of Corydon where the home of Edward Smith formerly stood. The fair's original <b>grandstand</b> burned in 1960 and the county purchased a new <b>grandstand</b> from the minor league baseball team at Parkway Field in Louisville, Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|Huge new <b>grandstands</b> were {{installed}} in the 1930s, with seating for 14,900 people. They replaced the original <b>grandstands</b> that were built in 1914. A roof was placed over the <b>grandstands</b> in 1938. These <b>grandstands</b> stood until new aluminum <b>grandstands</b> {{were installed}} in September 2002.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, <b>grandstands</b> to {{accommodate}} 1,554 students were erected on the campus, {{since there was}} no auditorium. For safety reasons, these <b>grandstands</b> were dismantled in 1973.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 1970s, {{there were}} not <b>grandstands</b> in all four corners. Most notably the reporters in turn two and turn three did not have <b>grandstands</b> {{to serve as a}} vantage point until later years. Without <b>grandstands,</b> reporters in those turns may be {{stationed}} trackside, in the infield, or perched on a photography platform, with usually limited views.|$|R
5|$|Constructed {{and opened}} in 1906 {{to replace the}} Muntz Street ground, which had become too small to meet the club's needs, the {{original}} St Andrew's could hold an estimated 75,000 spectators, housed in one <b>grandstand</b> and a large uncovered terrace. The attendance record, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341, was set at a 1939 FA Cup tie against Everton. During the Second World War, St Andrew's suffered bomb damage and the <b>grandstand,</b> housing a temporary fire station, burned down in an accidental fire. In the 1950s, the club replaced the stand and installed floodlights, and later erected a second small stand and roofed over the open terraces, but there were few further changes.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the speedway's midway, located {{behind the}} main <b>grandstand,</b> was overhauled. The new midway, called Discover IE FanZone, {{includes}} {{the addition of}} Apex (a Wolfgang Puck restaurant), additional shade and lounge areas, a new retail store and an entertainment stage.|$|E
5|$|The Soccer Village {{consists}} of four indoor pitches in an arena with <b>grandstand</b> spectator seating for 300. It is used for casual, amateur and organised leagues and tournaments.|$|E
50|$|Many of the <b>grandstands</b> {{and other}} {{infrastructure}} were sold off to other venues. Section 10 and Section 20 (the <b>grandstands</b> {{on the east}} side of the arena) at the Paso Robles Event Center (AKA The California Midstate Fair) in Paso Robles, Ca were constructed from <b>grandstands</b> removed from the speedway. Also several ticket booths were relocated from the speedway to the fair grounds.|$|R

25|$|The stadium {{opened in}} 1924 and {{originally}} seated 12,000—the {{lower half of}} the current facility's <b>grandstands</b> on the east and west sidelines. In 1931, 10,000 seats were added to the existing <b>grandstands.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{course was}} {{designed}} to be as spectator-friendly as possible. The athletes passed through the main <b>grandstand</b> area 12 times. The men's triathlon {{was one of the few}} events with free viewing points.|$|E
5|$|The new <b>grandstand</b> was {{completed}} for $3.6 million in 1993. Since Rosecroft had expanded its simulcasting rights, the new <b>grandstand</b> incorporated large-screen televisions and betting windows. For the 1993 season, Rosecroft's officials {{decided to stop}} hosting the five stake races—The Potomac, the Lady Baltimore, The Terrapan, The Turtle Dove, and The North American—inherited when Freestate Raceway closed. The handle was decreasing, and the officials could not afford the purses for the races. To help increase the handle, Maryland racetrack officials voted to allow inter-track simulcasting between all Maryland tracks and authorized off-track betting parlors throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|Though Sega {{themselves}} only {{released the}} SG-1000 in Japan, rebranded versions were released in New Zealand by <b>Grandstand</b> Leisure and in Taiwan by Aaronix. The console enjoyed {{a brief period}} of popularity in Taiwan before the market was taken over by cheaper Famicom clones.|$|E
25|$|When {{it opened}} in 1967, Tampa Stadium {{consisted}} of a matching pair of large arch-shaped concrete <b>grandstands</b> with open endzones. The seating consisted of long, backless aluminum benches that were accessed via short tunnels (vomitoriums) which connected the seating area to wide, open concourses {{at the rear of}} the <b>grandstands.</b> The benches were arranged in two large tiers divided by a horizontal walkway about halfway up the <b>grandstands.</b> The slope of the <b>grandstands</b> was relatively steep, giving every seat a direct and unobstructed view of the field. The official capacity was 46,481, though temporary bleachers could be placed in one or both endzones if needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} baseball <b>grandstands</b> {{were built}} in 1954, {{at a cost of}} $184,000, and located in the southwest corner of the complex. The <b>grandstands</b> housed the original incarnation of the Winnipeg Goldeyes and the Winnipeg Whips, the Class AAA affiliate of the Montreal Expos. The <b>grandstands</b> were demolished in the early 1980s {{to make way for the}} Blue and Gold Room and for nearly a decade, baseball could not be accommodated at the stadium.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grandstands</b> needed repair.|$|R
5|$|As a batsman, Miller was out {{for four}} in the first innings, not {{offering}} a shot to an inswinger. In the second innings, Miller's first ball was a hat-trick ball from English captain Norman Yardley; he survived a loud leg before wicket appeal and then hit a six into the <b>grandstand,</b> {{on his way to}} 74. Australia declared at 7/460, 595runs ahead. Miller took three catches as Australia won by 409runs.|$|E
5|$|Burston was {{involved}} in thoroughbred racing both as a punter and as a racehorse owner. He served as Chairman of the Moonee Valley Racing Club from 1952 {{until his death in}} 1960. Burston made the W S Cox Plate the richest weight for age race in Australia, and he oversaw the construction of the Burston <b>Grandstand,</b> which was named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Rosenborg had {{qualified}} for the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League, UEFA had for security reasons introduced restrictions which reduced Lerkendal's capacity to 12,200 spectators. In addition, a total ban on standing places would be introduced from 1997. In 1995, a debate arose between Rosenborg and Trondheim Municipality regarding {{the construction of a}} new <b>grandstand,</b> to be located on the north side of the stadium. Rosenborg's Nils Skutle stated that if it was not built ahead of the 1997–98 season, Rosenborg would only be allowed to sell 2,800 tickets to their home Champions League matches, and that they instead would be forced to play their games at Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo. The new <b>grandstand</b> cost 32 million, and opened in 1996 season. The upgrades also included a new floodlight and public announcement system.|$|E
50|$|In a {{separate}} project, the stadium's east <b>grandstands,</b> while not razed, were renovated {{to move the}} stadium's in-game operations into the press box. In addition, space under the <b>grandstands</b> was renovated for the university's track and field program.|$|R
50|$|Another {{factor in}} {{removing}} the hairpin {{is the fact}} that the turn is only visible from the garages or the bleachers behind the esses. This is due to <b>grandstands</b> built along the front straight that serve also as the drag strip's <b>grandstands.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had just}} rounded the last pylon when it pitched upward {{and then went}} inverted. While inverted the plane rocked its wings and suddenly pitched downward towards the ground and <b>grandstands,</b> crashing into the box seating area {{in front of the}} <b>grandstands.</b>|$|R
5|$|Helen Frances Rollason, MBE (née Grindley: 11 March 1956 – 9 August 1999) was a British sports {{journalist}} and television presenter, who in 1990 {{became the first}} female presenter of the BBC's sports programme <b>Grandstand.</b> She was also a regular presenter of Sport on Friday, and of the children's programme Newsround during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 the Oval {{was bombed}} in the Belfast blitz, {{destroying}} both grandstands and leaving a crater in the pitch. As a result, {{the ground was}} flooded repeatedly by the Connswater River; the water pumps were insufficient to drain the pitch. Grosvenor Park {{was used as a}} temporary home for Glentoran, until August 1949. In 1953 the main <b>grandstand</b> was built.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, a {{permanent}} brick stand was built and {{became known as}} the Bluemantle Stand after the Bluemantle Cricket Club members who helped to build it. The Bluemantle Stand was built {{on the site of the}} original pavilion. Every Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council erects a temporary <b>grandstand</b> at the Nevill Ground.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City {{returned}} to the First Division for the 1966–67 season, and Young remained a key player. Before Manchester City's game against Leeds United, Leeds manager Don Revie, known for his meticulous scouting of opposition teams, identified Young as a particular threat in a <b>Grandstand</b> interview. Operating mainly on the wing, Young scored less frequently {{than in the previous}} season, with 7 goals in 45 appearances.|$|E
