500|$|The opening track, [...] "Afraid" [...] (featuring rapper Attitude), is a {{description}} of Furtado's fear of what people think of her, and she has said the chorus reminds her of [...] "walking down the hall in high school ... because you live from the outside in.

On meeting {{the head of}} the label, Ivo Watts-Russell, Santiago remarked: [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> is that you make me famous in the Philippines because all the chicks are really pretty". Watts-Russell later said [...] "that's probably all I ever heard Joey really say," [...] and by that time, Santiago's quietness had been noted by those close to the band. The Pixies' first release, Come On Pilgrim, featured his trademark angular lead guitar on tracks such as [...] "The Holiday Song" [...] and [...] "Vamos".|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} the father of an infant son, Yorke adopted a {{strategy}} of [...] "distilling" [...] the political themes into [...] "childlike simplicity". He took phrases from fairy tales and folklore, such as the tale of Chicken Little, and children's literature and television he shared with his son, including the 1970s TV series Bagpuss, whose creator Oliver Postgate is thanked in the liner notes. Parenthood made Yorke concerned {{about the condition of}} the world and how it could affect future generations.

500|$|Handlen {{thought that}} Michael sounded [...] "reasonable", and Sepinwall said [...] "Awake... {{a good job}} of making the guest {{characters}} involved in 's cases interesting enough that <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> what happens in each investigation." [...] He thought that until this episode the writers had been wise on guest stars and on not focusing on them too much; he also wrote that actors Lawrence and Valderrama did not seem to match each other. Handlen was rather impressed with the storylines of the [...] "red reality" [...] and gave the episode a [...] "B+", writing that [...] "Jake reminded [...] of Al Pacino's aging [...] in Donnie Brasco." [...] Sepinwall liked Jake's actor, Lawrence, praising his appearance on the Awake episode.|$|E

Gillian Anderson was {{very pleased with the}} scene. She later noted that [...] "I happened to be in good shape at the time and was just raring {{to get in there and}} be taking those half-naked nurses out with some karate chops." [...] David Duchovny was not as exuberant; when showed the script and directed to [...] "be impressed with [...] karate skills", he responded that [...] "But I have no arms. I've lost my arms. Why would <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> Scully's karate?" [...] Dean Haglund later called the sequence [...] "one of the great fight scenes, ever".|$|E

West said, [...] "Bruno Mars won all the motherfucking awards and shit". He continued, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> is if you’re {{an artist and}} you work hard as fuck and the streets say that you deserve that shit. Then can’t no motherfucking networks try to gas everybody up so they can sell some product with the prettiest motherfucker out". Nevertheless, on February 26, 2015, he publicly apologized to Bruno Mars on Twitter while asking him to sing a hook on a song that he co-produced. West asked Tyler, the Creator to direct the music video. Mars confirmed that West called him and apologized.|$|E
500|$|Along with Pierce Brosnan, Cindy Crawford, Jane Seymour, Dick Van Dyke, Téa Leoni, and Daryl Hannah, Berry {{successfully}} {{fought in}} 2006 against the Cabrillo Port Liquefied Natural Gas facility that was proposed {{off the coast}} of Malibu. Berry said, [...] "I care about the air we breathe, <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the marine life and the ecosystem of the ocean." [...] In May 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the facility. Hasty Pudding Theatricals gave her its 2006 Woman of The Year award. Berry took part in a nearly 2,000-house cell-phone bank campaign for Barack Obama in February 2008.

500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is set in common time and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. While it is played in the key of C major and has backing piano and guitar sounds, [...] "Alfie" [...] also uses a sample from Sandie Shaw's 1967 Eurovision Song Contest winning song [...] "Puppet on a String". In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he thought that I was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> him, and I {{want him to do}} something with his life. I suppose his paranoia — induced by smoking so much weed — made him think, [...] "Why are you trying to be mean?" ...|$|E

500|$|By December 2011, Romney assumed an {{even more}} {{prominent}} role in the campaign, {{as she tried to}} offer a more rounded and compelling portrait of her husband while he fell behind Newt Gingrich for a stretch in polls. [...] Her emphasis on their 42years of marriage and his steadfastness following the onset of her disease offered an implicit but clear contrast with Gingrich's own personal history. [...] She had long been known within the family as the [...] "Mitt-stabilizer", due to the calming effect she had on her husband, and continued to perform that role during the up-and-down campaign. [...] In particular, she began appearing with him more often during February 2012 as he dueled with Rick Santorum during the Republican presidential primaries. [...] Regarding the couple's net worth, she alluded to her health problems and said, [...] "Look, I don't even consider myself wealthy, which is an interesting thing, it can be here today and gone tomorrow. And how I measure riches is by the friends I have and the loved ones that I have and the people that <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film two stars {{out of four}} and asked about the title character, [...] "Why should <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> this guy? He feels no pain and nothing can kill him, so {{therefore}} he's essentially a story device for action sequences." [...] James Berardinelli gave Wolverine {{two and a half}} stars out of four, calling the action scenes competently executed but not memorable, and considering that when dealing with Wolverine's past [...] "there's little creativity evident in the way those blanks are filled in", and that the revelations made Wolverine [...] "less compelling". Comparatively, Bill Gibron of AMC's Filmcritic.com website gave the film a positive [...] "4.0 out of 5 stars," [...] saying that although Hugh Jackman is [...] "capable of carrying even the most mediocre effort, he singlehandedly makes X-Men Origins: Wolverine an excellent start to the summer 2009 season." [...] He predicted [...] "there will be purists who balk at how Hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate the mythology;" [...] and further said that [...] "any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for can't really seal the full entertainment deal." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of Revolution Muslim's statement, Seattle {{cartoonist}} Molly Norris suggested that many people draw and publish pictures of Muhammad on May 20, 2010, which she dubbed the [...] "first annual Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". However, very few cartoonists actually joined her in criticizing Islam or depicting the prophet Muhammed; instead, much like Maher and Stewart, they merely praised her for her efforts and condemned the idea of censorship. Norris herself went into hiding, shortly thereafter, {{on the advice of}} the FBI. Animated comedy series Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane voiced this ambivalence {{on the part of the}} creative community, saying [...] "No one is a bigger critic of organized religion than I am", but nevertheless added, [...] "It's tricky. You pick your battles. You have to judge how real the threat is against how funny the joke is. How much do <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the joke?" [...] And The Simpsons also addressed the apparent hypocrisy of those who claimed to stand with South Park in a chalkboard gag during the opening sequence of the April 25, 2010 episode [...] "The Squirt and the Whale", with Bart Simpson writing [...] "South Park—We'd Stand Beside You If We Weren't So Scared".|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] {{was directed by}} Colin Tilley and Brown, and was filmed in August 2012.

On September 11, 2012 Brown released a similar image, tweeting, [...] "'Don't Judge Me' video coming soon!". The video premiered on Vimeo on September 27, 2012. It begins with Brown walking through the desert, while intercut scenes of himself sitting in front of a couch (with his girlfriend, played by Runa Lucienne, sleeping behind him) are shown. As the chorus begins for the first time, Brown is seen catching a ride from an army truck. He eventually arrives at an army base to prepare for a [...] "suicide mission", which involves him riding a spacecraft into outer space to save the world from an alien ship invading Earth. A news reporter at the base (Brown's girlfriend) runs to him with the question, [...] "People are saying this is a suicide mission, why are you doing this?" [...] Brown replies, [...] "I'm doing a service for my country and my planet. If that means saving the people I love and <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>about,</b> then that's what I'll do." [...] As the spacecraft takes off, tears run down Brown's face before the spacecraft crashes into the alien ship, killing him. Brown and his girlfriend are then shown, hugging on the couch.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the final}} game of the 2005 season, Kansas State offered to name the stadium Bill Snyder Stadium in honor of {{retiring}} head coach Bill Snyder. In 17 years, Snyder had turned the Wildcats, once the definition of college football futility, into a frequent championship contender in the Big 12 Conference. When he was asked about renaming the stadium, Snyder told school officials, [...] "If {{you are going to do}} it, name it after the people that <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the most."
