25|$|Whilst {{the use of}} {{thiabendazole}} has waned, newer generation benzimidazole compounds such as albendazole and <b>fenbendazole</b> are to {{this day}} used widely in people and domestic animals.|$|E
2500|$|Drugs used in {{treatment}} of A. caninum infections of dogs include: dichlorvos, <b>fenbendazole,</b> flubendazole, mebendazole, nitroscanate, piperazine, pyrantel, milbemycin, moxidectin, diethylcarbamazine, oxibendazole, [...] and ivermectin.|$|E
2500|$|Acute {{diarrhea}} can {{be caused}} by cyathostomes or [...] "small Strongylus type" [...] worms that are encysted as larvae in the bowel wall, particularly if large numbers emerge simultaneously. The disease most frequently occurs in winter time. Pathological changes of the bowel reveal a typical [...] "pepper and salt" [...] color of the large intestines. Animals suffering from cyathostominosis usually have a poor deworming history. There is now a lot of resistance to <b>fenbendazole</b> in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|Drug {{resistance}} {{is a growing}} concern for many horse owners. Resistance has been noted with ivermectin to ascarids, and with <b>fenbendazole,</b> oxibendazole, and pyrantel to small strongyles. [...] Development of new drugs takes many years, leading to the concern that worms could out-evolve the drugs currently available to treat them. As a result, most veterinarians now recommend deworming for small strongyles based on fecal egg counts to minimize the development of resistant parasite populations. Fecal egg count reduction tests can also be performed to identify which dewormers are effective on a particular farm.|$|E
2500|$|A clean {{environment}} minimises {{the risk of}} A. caninum infection; this can include regularly washed concrete or gravel in kennels instead of soil. [...] Bitches are typically checked prior to using them for breeding purposes for nematodes such as A. caninum and birth and suckling can be restricted to sanitised areas to {{lower the risk of}} health complications to the pups. [...] When infection of a pregnant bitch is known or suspected <b>fenbendazole</b> or ivermectin can be administered to the bitch to help avoid transmission to the pups.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{horse is}} heavily infested with parasites, dewormers {{must be given}} carefully. Small strongyles can form cysts {{embedded}} in the intestinal epithelium. A decrease in the active population of worms, {{as in the case}} of deworming, can cause larvae to emerge from the cysts (larval cyathostomiasis). [...] Additionally, foals with a large load of ivermectin-susceptible ascarids in the small intestine may experience intestinal blockage or rupture after deworming. [...] Thus, in heavily-infested animals, a veterinarian may recommend worming with a mild class of drugs, such as <b>fenbendazole</b> or a low-dose daily wormer. for the first month or so, followed by periodic purge wormer treatments.|$|E
2500|$|Metronidazole [...] {{is widely}} used to treat infections of Giardia in dogs, cats, and other {{companion}} animals, although it does not reliably clear infection with this organism and is being supplanted by <b>fenbendazole</b> for this purpose in dogs and cats. It is also used {{for the management of}} chronic inflammatory bowel disease in cats and dogs. Another common usage is the treatment of systemic and/or gastrointestinal clostridial infections in horses. Metronidazole is used in the aquarium hobby to treat ornamental fish and as a broad-spectrum treatment for bacterial and protozoan infections in reptiles and amphibians. In general, the veterinary community may use metronidazole for any potentially susceptible anaerobic infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration suggests it only be used when necessary because it {{has been shown to be}} carcinogenic in mice and rats, as well as the microbes for which it is prescribed, and resistance can develop.|$|E
50|$|There {{are so far}} no true {{vaccines}} against Capillaria worms. This parasite {{is readily}} treated with proprietary medicines such as <b>fenbendazole</b> and ivermectin. <b>Fenbendazole</b> is given at 25 mg/kg every 12h for 10 days.|$|E
50|$|It gets metabolized in {{the liver}} to oxfendazole, which is {{anthelmintic}} too; oxfendazole partially gets reduced back to <b>fenbendazole</b> {{in the liver}} and rumen. Also, <b>fenbendazole</b> itself is an active metabolite of another anthelmintic drug, febantel.|$|E

5000|$|Oxfendazole {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} benzimidazole anthelmintic. Its main use is for protecting livestock against roundworm, strongyles and pinworms. [...] Oxfendazole is the sulfoxide metabolite of <b>fenbendazole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Infections of Alaria spp can be {{diagnosed}} through fecal examination or thoracic radiographs of dogs and cats. There are no forms of diagnosing in humans yet. This infection {{can be treated}} with paraziquantel. It's been noted that another possible treatment is with <b>Fenbendazole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some vets now {{recommend}} treating rabbits {{against the}} Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a parasitic, microscopic fungus. Some {{studies have indicated}} that in the UK over 50% of rabbits may be infected with E. cuniculi. The usual drugs for treatment and prevention of this infection are the benzimidazole anthelmintics, particularly <b>fenbendazole,</b> also used as a deworming agent in other species of animal, and shown to be effective in treating this condition in rabbits. In the UK, it is sold over-the-counter in oral paste form as a nine-day treatment for rabbits under the brand name Panacur Rabbit. <b>Fenbendazole</b> is particularly recommended for rabbits kept in colonies and before mixing new rabbits with each other. E. cuniculi is the primary cause of [...] "wry neck".|$|E
50|$|Infestation {{is easily}} {{diagnosed}} {{by the presence}} of C. aerophila eggs in the nasal or tracheal lavage, or the feces of infested animals. Standard anthelmintics, such as ivermectin or <b>fenbendazole,</b> are recommended for treatment of dogs. Humans infested with C. aerophila have been successfully treated with albendazole and mebendazole.|$|E
5000|$|Diagnosis {{is through}} finding the fluke eggs microscopically in a stool sample. A needle {{aspiration}} biopsy of an enlarged lymph node will reveal rickettsial organisms within macrophages in many cases. [...] The rickettsial infection can be successfully treated with tetracycline, and the fluke infection {{can be treated}} with <b>fenbendazole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Infection is {{directly}} diagnosed by identifying proglottids in the faeces, or adult worms in the intestine upon autopsy. Broad-spectrum anthelmintics such as albendazole, <b>fenbendazole,</b> praziquantel, oxfendazole and niclosamide are all effective against the different species. The most effective control measure is {{disruption of the}} habitat of intermediate hosts near poultry farms.|$|E
50|$|Praziquantel (5 mg/kg body weight) and {{epsiprantel}} {{have both}} {{been shown to be}} efficacious in the treatment of taeniataeniaeformis in cats. Similarly, febantel and <b>fenbendazole</b> are approved for the treatment of this parasite in most of the world. Mebendazole and nitroscanate are also products that have efficacy against taeniataeniaeformis in cats.|$|E
50|$|Most benzimidazoles are effective. Mebendazole, {{triclabendazole}} and <b>fenbendazole</b> {{are commonly}} used. Ivermectin and pyrantel pamoate are also effective. The combination of ivermectin 6 Î¼g/kg and pyrantel pamoate at 5.0 mg/kg is 100% efficacious against adult worms in dogs. Human infection {{in case of}} cutaneous larva migrans is treated with oral thiabendazole at 500 mg in 4 daily dose.|$|E
5000|$|There are no {{clinical}} symptoms {{associated with}} whipworm infections in felines. Diagnosis of cats with these infections is usually through fecal flotation [...] To treat them, veterinarians recommend feeding the cats 50 mg/kg of <b>fenbendazole</b> {{once a day}} for three days. Although they are very infectious between cats, there are no recorded cases of T. serrata infecting humans.|$|E
50|$|Broad {{spectrum}} anthelmintics {{are also}} effective against adult worms and larvae. There are several benzimidazoles {{were successful in}} clearing infection, including albendazole, febantel, <b>fenbendazole,</b> oxfendazole. Moreover, levamisole and several macrocyclic lactones (e.g. abamectin, doramectin, eprinomectin, ivermectin, moxidectin) are reported to be effective. After multiple rounds of exposure adult ruminants can overcome the adverse effects of the parasite however still it act as reservoir for new infection.|$|E
50|$|Both {{oxfendazole}} and <b>fenbendazole</b> are efficacious against gastrointestinal lungworms and roundworms of livestock, adults, and L4-larvae of {{the significant}} species for example, of the genera Bunostomum, Haemonchus, Ostertagia, Oesophagostomum, Nematodirus, Teladorsagia, Cooperia, Trichostrongylus, Dictyocaulus, Trichuris, etc., including against arrested larvae {{of some of the}} species. They are even highly efficient against majority of the livestock tapeworms. This drug works effectively against the main parasitic roundworms and tapeworms of dogs and cats.|$|E
50|$|Infection is {{diagnosed}} by identifying proglottids in the faeces, or adult worms in the intestine upon autopsy. <b>Fenbendazole</b> is 100.0% efficacious when administered {{in the diet}} at 240 ppm (50.9 mg/kg BW) for 6 days in naturally infected broilers; but less effective at lower doses, without affecting the appetite nor it induced any adverse effects on weight gain. Albendazole is a better drug of choice in terms of efficacy and sideeffects.|$|E
50|$|If the {{infection}} is already present then {{use one of}} these drugs: Epsiprantel, Praziquantel, Mebendazole, Niclosamide, Bunamindine hydrochloride or <b>Fenbendazole.</b> This will kill the adult stage but not the cyst or egg stage, so several treatments may be needed. Daily doses of Praziquantel for about one to two weeks' time will be effective against larval cysticercosis in rabbits. One dose of Niclosamide or Praziquantel can be very effective in dogs.|$|E
50|$|The {{level of}} control with three {{treatments}} of cambendazole on days 3-4, 6-7, and 16-17 post-infection was 94.9% in chickens and 99.1% in turkeys. Levamisole (Ergamisol), fed {{at a level of}} 0.04% for 2 days or 2 g/gal drinking water for 1 day each month, has proven effective in game birds. <b>Fenbendazole</b> (Panacur) at 20 mg/kg for 3-4 days is also effective. Ivermectin injections may be effective in treating resistant strains.|$|E
5000|$|Acute {{diarrhea}} can {{be caused}} by cyathostomes or [...] "small Strongylus type" [...] worms that are encysted as larvae in the bowel wall, particularly if large numbers emerge simultaneously. The disease most frequently occurs in winter time. Pathological changes of the bowel reveal a typical [...] "pepper and salt" [...] color of the large intestines. Animals suffering from cyathostominosis usually have a poor deworming history. There is now a lot of resistance to <b>fenbendazole</b> in the UK.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fenbendazole</b> (Hoechst {{brand names}} Panacur and Safe-Guard, Intervet Panacur and Panacur Rabbit) {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} benzimidazole anthelmintic used against gastrointestinal parasites including: giardia, roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, the Taenia genus of tapeworms (but not effective against Dipylidium caninum, a common dog tapeworm), pinworms, aelurostrongylus, paragonimiasis, strongyles and strongyloides and can be administered to sheep, cattle, horses, fish, dogs, cats, rabbits and seals. Drug interactions may occur if salicylanilides like dibromsalan and niclosamide are co-administered. Abortions in cattle and death in sheep have been reported.|$|E
50|$|As paratenic hosts, {{a number}} of vertebrates, {{including}} humans, and some invertebrates can become infected. Humans are infected, like other paratenic hosts, by ingestion of embryonated T. canis eggs. The disease (called Toxocariasis) caused by migrating T. canis larvae (toxocariasis) results in two syndromes: visceralis larva migrans and ocularis larva migrans.Owing to transmission of the infection from the mother to her puppies, preventive anthelmintic treatment of newborn puppies is strongly recommended. Several antihelmintic drugs are effective against adult worms, for example pyrantel, <b>fenbendazole,</b> selamectin.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{recommended}} to de-worm all puppies and kittens at 6 weeks and repeat treatment 2-4 {{weeks after the}} first treatment. T. leonina roundworm infections are treated with the same medication protocol as the T. canis or T. cati roundworm infections (see Toxocariasis). Therefore, when eggs are seen on a fecal flotation exam, or fecal swab, {{it is not necessary}} to determine which species is present. Roundworm infections are treated with medication, called [...] "de-wormers", and includes such drugs as <b>fenbendazole,</b> pyrantel, milbemycin oxime, and piperazine.|$|E
