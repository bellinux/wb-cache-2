5|$|Among the {{earliest}} evidence of chariot use are the burials of horse and chariot remains by the Andronovo (Sintashta-Petrovka) culture in modern Russia and Kazakhstan, dated to approximately 2000 BC. The oldest documentary {{evidence of what}} was probably chariot warfare in the Ancient Near East is the Old Hittite Anitta text, of the 18th century BC, which mentioned 40 teams of horses at the siege of Salatiwara. The Hittites became well known throughout the ancient world for their prowess with the chariot. Widespread use of the chariot in warfare across most of Eurasia coincides approximately {{with the development of}} the composite bow, known from c.1600 BC. Further improvements in wheels and axles, as well as innovations in weaponry, soon resulted in chariots being <b>driven</b> <b>in</b> battle by Bronze Age societies from China to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, <b>driven</b> <b>in</b> part by a strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns {{about the ability of}} inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E

5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, <b>driven</b> <b>in</b> the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E
40|$|Context: Authorizing {{powered two-wheeler}} drivers to <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> lanes {{reserved}} to buses {{is a measure}} that is sometimes mentioned to improve mobility conditions for these users. But what effect would this measure have on {{the safety of the}}se users and on the safety of the other users with whom they share the traffic space? Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} contribute elements to help answer this question. More precisely, the objective is to estimate the risk of having an accident per kilometer driven by powered two-wheeler drivers who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> bus lanes and to compare this risk with that of powered two-wheeler drivers who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> general traffic lanes. Method: Using the bodily injury accidents recorded by the police over two years on thirteen roads in the city of Marseille and a campaign of periodical observations of powered two-wheeler traffic, we estimated the risk per kilometer driven by powered two-wheeler drivers who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> bus lanes and compared it with that of drivers who do not <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> them. Results: The results show that the risk for powered two-wheeler drivers who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> bus lanes of being involved in a bodily injury accident is significantly higher than the risk run by drivers who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> general traffic lanes. For the thirteen roads studied, it is on average 3, 25 times higher (95 % CI: 2, 03; 5, 21). Conclusion: In the current situation, powered two-wheeler drivers who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> bus lanes are less safe than those who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> general traffic lanes. The analysis of police reports suggests that part of this increased risk comes from collisions between automobile drivers turning right and powered two-wheelers driving in the bus lane who continue straight ahead...|$|R

Thousands of people gathered to witness the plane's departure. Just before she boarded the VC-25A Presidential Aircraft, Nancy Reagan waved to the crowd with her military escort at her side.

5|$|Technology {{and science}} in England {{advanced}} considerably during the Middle Ages, <b>driven</b> <b>in</b> {{part by the}} Greek and Islamic thinking that reached England from the 12th century onwards. Many advances were made in scientific ideas, including the introduction of Arabic numerals and a sequence of improvements in the units used for measuring time. Clocks were first built in England in the late 13th century, and the first mechanical clocks were certainly being installed in cathedrals and abbeys by the 1320s. Astrology, magic and palm reading were also considered important forms of knowledge in medieval England, although some doubted their reliability.|$|E

Dissatisfaction with Romney's administration and the weak condition of the Republican state party were among several factors contributing to Democrat Deval Patrick's 20-point win over Republican Kerry Healey, Romney's lieutenant governor, in the 2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial election.|$|E

These operations had two aims– to gain territory and discourage the Ottoman Eighth Army from transferring troops into the Judean Hills to reinforce the Seventh Army. After successful actions by the New Zealand Mounted Brigade, two infantry battalions of the 54th (East Anglian) Division held these two bridgeheads on the northern bank until they were attacked by overwhelming forces on 25 November.
