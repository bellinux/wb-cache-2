40|$|We <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> the {{classical}} {{failure of the}} fuse system, the dielectric breakdown and the quantum breakdown in the Anderson insulators. We <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> how the extreme value statistics and the resulting Gumbel distribution arises in breakdown and failure processes, especially when the disorder concentration is low. At high concentration of disorder near the percolation threshold, we <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> how the cross-over might take place from extreme value to percolation statistics. We <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> the system size dependence that arises at {{the distribution of the}} failure current at low disordered regime. Finally, the extension of Zener breakdown phenomenon for band insulators to the disordered-induced Anderson insulators <b>has</b> been <b>discussed.</b> Comment: An updated version will be published in "Quantum & Semiclassical Percolation & Breakdown in Disordered Solids".
