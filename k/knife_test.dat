40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{compare the}} {{responsiveness}} of the condition-specific Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis (OA) index (WOMAC) and the generic Short Form- 36 (SF- 36) {{in patients with}} OA of the legs undergoing a comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation intervention.  METHODS—A prospective follow up study of consecutively referred inpatients of a rehabilitation clinic was made. The patients included fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for knee or hip OA and underwent both passive and, particularly, active physical therapy {{for three to four}} weeks. Responsiveness assessment was performed using the standardised response mean (SRM), effect size, and Guyatt's responsiveness statistic between admission and discharge (end of rehabilitation) and then again between admission and three months later. For pain and function the SRMs were stratified by sex and OA joint. Effects were tested by the t test and SRMs of different scales were compared by the jack <b>knife</b> <b>test.</b>  RESULTS—At the three month follow up, complete data were obtained for 223  patients. In general, the three responsiveness statistics showed a similar order of responsiveness. For both instruments, the pain scales were more responsive than the function scales. The responsiveness of the pain scale of both instruments was comparable (SRM= 0. 723 for WOMAC and SRM= 0. 528 for SF- 36 at the end of rehabilitation; SRM= 0. 377 for WOMAC and SRM= 0. 468 for SF- 36 at the three month follow up). In the measurement of function, the WOMAC was significantly more responsive than the SF- 36 (SRMs, end of rehabilitation: 0. 628  v 0. 249; three month follow up: 0. 235  v − 0. 001). Responsiveness tended to be higher in women and in knee OA than in men and hip OA.  CONCLUSIONS—Both instruments, the WOMAC and the SF- 36, capture improvement in pain in patients undergoing comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation intervention. Functional improvement can be detected better by the WOMAC than by the SF- 36. All the other scales of both instruments were more weakly responsive. ...|$|E
40|$|Titanium and its alloys {{are widely}} {{employed}} in many industrial fields, {{due to their}} high specific strength and good corrosion resistance. On the other hand, these materials show relatively low shear strength and high coefficient of friction. As matter of fact, the poor wear resistance of these materials is still a limit to a wider use. However, these disadvantages mainly concern on bulk materials and can be avoided by using intermetallic coatings. Thin hard coatings have good wear resistance only when they have both good cohesion and adhesion. In this study, the effect of substrate temperature of titanium aluminium nitride (TiAlN) coating on the titanium alloy substrate using PVD method was evaluated. The TiAlN coating was deposited on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrate by DC magnetron sputtering process at various temperature. The reactive sputter gas {{with a mixture of}} Ar (99. 999 %) and N 2 (99. 999 %) with flow rate of 20 sccm and 10 sccm respectively was used. The substrate temperature was set at 200 °C, 240 °C and 300 °C, and the bias was kept at - 60 V for all the coatings. Structural characterization of the coating was done using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD measurements showed the presence of Ti 2 AlN and also, the results show that its intensity was decreased with substrate temperature, however there was no changes in crystalline structure was occurred. The substrate temperature during the growth, change in crystalline structure will not occur. The surface roughness of the coating was determined using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). From three-dimensional AFM analysis it was indicated that the surface roughness will decrease as the substrate temperature increases. And also, Cross-sectional FESEM indicated the presence of dense columnar structure. The mechanical properties of the coating layers (cohesion and adhesion) were deduce by both Rockwell-c adhesion test and <b>knife</b> <b>test.</b> These two tests indicated that by increasing substrate temperature, the adhesion and cohesion were also increased...|$|E

However, the fabric is expensive, difficult to manufacture because of its tight weave construction, and has limited protection against ballistic threats. In an effort to produce materials that are less bulky, more flexible, and resistant to puncture, thermoplastic-Kevlar (TP-Kevlar) composites have been examined. Kevlar fabric was impregnated with thermoplastic film using a hot press to produce the composites. Static and dynamic puncture resistant properties of the TP-Kevlar composites were investigated using a National Institute of Justice (NIJ Standard 0115. 00) Stab Tower. The TP-films {{used in this study}} were polyethylene, Surlyn, and co extruded-Surlyn, which is a co extrusion of Surlyn and polyethylene. Response of the polyethylene (PE) -Kevlar composites, Surlyn-Kevlar composites, and co extruded (COEX) -Kevlar composites to spike and knife threats under static and dynamic conditions were compared with that of neat Kevlar. The infusion of thermoplastic films into the Kevlar fabric was shown to dramatically increase puncture resistance during quasi-static and dynamic testing with spikes. The TP-film type also made a difference when examining the resistance on a comparative basis of the TP-Kevlar targets.

The standard practice for protecting metallic substrates in atmospheric environments is {{the application of}} an applied coating system. The most common topcoats used in coating systems are polyurethanes that contain isocyanates. Isocyanates are classified as potential human carcinogens and are known to cause cancer in animals. The primary objective of this effort was to demonstrate and validate alternatives to aliphatic isocyanate polyurethanes resulting {{in one or more}} isocyanate-free coatings qualified for use at AFSPC and NASA installations participating in this project. This joint Test Report (JTR) documents the results of the laboratory and field testing as well as any test modifications made during the execution of the testing. The technical stakeholders agreed upon test procedure modifications documented in this document. This JTR is made available as a reference for future pollution prevention endeavors by other NASA centers, the Department of Defense and commercial users to minimize duplication of effort. All coating system candidates were tested using approved NASA and AFSPC standard coating systems as experimental controls. This study looked at eight alternative coating systems and two control coating systems and was divided into Phase I Screening Tests, Phase II Tests, and Field Testing. The Phase I Screening Tests were preliminary tests performed on all the selected candidate coating systems. Candidate coating systems that did not meet the acceptance criteria of the screening tests were eliminated from further testing. Phase I Screening Tests included: Ease of Application, Surface Appearance, Dry-To-Touch (Sanding), Accelerated Storage Stability, Pot Life (Viscosity), Cure Time (Solvent Rubs), Cleanability, <b>Knife</b> <b>Test,</b> Tensile (pull-off) Adhesion, and X-Cut Adhesion by Wet Tape After a review of the Phase I test results, four of the alternative coating systems showed substandard performance in relation to the Control Systems and were eliminated from the Phase II testing. Due to the interest of stakeholders and time constraints, however, all eight alternatives were subjected to the following Phase II tests, along with field testing at Stennis Space Center (SSC), Mississippi: Hypergol Compatibility, Liquid Oxygen Compatibility, 18 -Month Marine Exposure (Gloss Retention, Color Retention, Blistering, Visual Corrosion, Creepage from Scribe, Heat Adhesion), and Field Exposure (6 - and 12 -month Evaluation for Coating Condition, Color Retention, Gloss Retention). The remaining four alternative coating systems determined to be the best viable alternatives were carried on to Phase II testing that included: Removability, Repairability, Abrasion Resistance, Gravelometer, Fungus Resistance, Accelerated Weathering, Mandrel Bend Flexibility, and Cyclic Corrosion Resistance. Of the systems that continued to Phase II, three (3) alternative coating systems meet the performance requirements as identified by stakeholders. Two (2) other systems, that were not included in Phase II testing, performed well enough on the 18 -Month Marine Exposure, the primary requirement for NASA technical standard NASA-STD- 5008, Protective Coating of Carbon Steel, Stainless Steel, and Aluminum on Launch Structures, Facilities, and Ground Support Equipment, that they were also considered to be successful candidates. In total, five (5) alternative coating systems were approved for inclusion in the NASA-STD- 5008 Qualified Products List (QPL).

40|$|At {{the request}} of Ankarsrum Assistant AB {{the main purpose of}} this thesis was to find another {{material}} to replace Polycarbonate in their blender jug. The other purpose was to examine which length that is the most desirable on the blender knives, to prevent the overload protection to be activated, when the knife is working with tough dough. Presented in this project are two scientific issues. The first one is: Which material is most suited to replace Polycarbonate in the blender jug of Ankarsrum Assistent. The second issue is: If the blender knifes are shortened will the duration increase, before the overload protection activates. To learn about blenders and what they can and can’t do, an area analysis was conducted. The analyses described what consumers usually used the blender for and why they break. The area analysis was used for making specifications and later on for setting up material and <b>knife</b> <b>tests.</b> In {{the same time as the}} area analysis was conducted a list of plastic materials was set up. The plastic list also included some glass materials because there is lots of a glass material in kitchen applications. Based on the specifications and the plastic list, five different materials were selected to be tested. These materials were tested in the areas of temperature and UV resistance, chemical resistance and scratch and shock resistance. The blender <b>knives</b> where <b>tested</b> in three different lengths, the original knife of 43 mm, the middle length of 40 mm and the shortest length of 37 mm. The two new smaller knives where made by the test department at Ankarsrum. These <b>knives</b> where <b>tested</b> in the areas of durability, efficiency and strength.

There are many variables to a knife and there are beliefs about what makes for a better knife. There are two common multipurpose knives used for slicing vegetables, the chef knife and the santoku knife. The aim of the first portion of the study was to investigate if there is a difference in cutting between a chef knife and a santoku knife, a ceramic knife and a stainless steel knife, and a sharp and dull knife in terms of muscle activation, body part discomfort, time, and slice performance. In order to test these variables, four different knives were used. 50 participants sliced two pounds of vegetables with two knives each, each on a different day. The results show that for the consumer, the type of knife, material, and level of sharpness do not affect the user 2 ̆ 7 s muscle activation, discomfort, time, or slice performance. In the second portion of the study the Pinch Cinch grip was designed to be placed on the knife to create an affordance for users to hold the knife in a pinch grip. This grip aligns the wrist and forearm and decreases fatigue and increases stability and control while cutting. The designed grip, the Pinch Cinch, is to be used as a training mechanism for the consumer to easily adjust to using the pinch grip.
