50|$|Frost heaving {{requires}} a frost-susceptible soil, a continual {{supply of water}} below (a water table) and freezing temperatures, penetrating into the soil. Frost-susceptible soils are those with pore sizes between particles and particle surface area that promote capillary flow. Silty and loamy soil types, which contain fine particles, are examples of frost-susceptible soils. Many agencies classify materials as being frost susceptible if 10 percent or more constituent particles pass through a 0.075 mm (No. 200) sieve or 3 percent or more pass through a 0.02 mm (No. 635) sieve. Chamberlain reported other, more direct methods for measuring <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility.</b> Based on such research, standard tests exist to determine the relative frost and thaw weakening susceptibility of soils used in pavement systems by comparing the heave rate and thawed bearing ratio with values in an established classification system for soils where frost-susceptibility is uncertain.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} ensure the bearing {{capacity}} and durability of road pavement in cold climate areas, it is necessary use materials which are resistant to harmful frost impact, known as frost-heaving. Frost heave cause adverse volume changes, the upwards swelling of the pavement after freezing and deterioration of the bearing capacity of the structure after thawing. In winter, road carriageway temperatures may reach tmin = - 30 ̊C under Polish conditions, which results in the freezing of the structural pavement and subgrade layers. Due to frost penetration into the pavement and the subgrade, heaves may form in soils and in structural layers (unbound mixtures), and during the thaw period {{a high level of}} moisture is maintained in the frozen layers, and therefore the structure has a low bearing capacity. The aim of this research was to evaluate <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of aggregates mixtures based on content of fine-grain fractions and plasticity index IP. Potential <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of road materials and soils is determined by laboratory testing. <b>Frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> is connected directly with the content and quality of fines, which is why the basic test is that material grading. The criterion based on fines content is the most frequently used indicator in determining <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> for soils. The article shows whether the limit values adopted for this criterion are also applicable to aggregates. The results of frost-heaving properties are presented of 14 typical natural aggregate road mixtures, continuously graded 0 / 31. 5 mm. <b>Frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> was determined based on laboratory testing of the following features: content of fine-grain fractions, smaller than 0. 002 mm, 0. 02 mm, 0. 075 mm, 0. 125 mm, plasticity index IP and the value of the actual frost-heave of a compacted aggregate mixture frozen in a cylinder.

Because there is limited research about frost heave and thaw weakening of pavement foundation geomaterials, this research focused on the frost heave and thaw weakening performance of geomaterials stabilized with various combinations of fly ash, cement, fibers, and fibers with cement. The first objective {{of this research was}} to conduct laboratory tests according to ASTM D 5918 to compare the effects of these stabilizers on <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility.</b> The second objective of this research was to further associate laboratory results with in situ freeze-thaw performance of pavements with similar stabilized foundation geomaterials. For sandy lean clay, fly ash decreased <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility,</b> and 15 % fly ash performed better than 5 %, 10 %, and 20 % fly ash. Cement decreased the <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> to very low to negligible levels for both sandy lean clay and silty sand with gravel. For silty sand with gravel, fibers alone did not significantly affect <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility,</b> but fibers with cement performed better than the other stabilizers. Findings related to variations in compaction delay, cure time, setting time for chemical stabilizers, and cost are also reported. In situ stiffness testing conducted during frozen and after thaw conditions indicated that frozen pavements were stiffer than after thaw pavements. The trends in seasonal variation in stiffness were similar for pavement systems with all kinds of stabilization. Layers stabilized with cement and cement with fibers had the lowest stiffness changes after freeze-thaw cycles. These findings correlate with laboratory test results.

40|$|Frost {{can affect}} the {{productivity}} and distribution of plants, as it can cause plant cell rupture and xylem cavitation, which may limit the water transport, growth, and survival of plants. Climate change {{is expected to increase}} the effect of frost on plants, making them more susceptible to frost events. Therefore it is necessary to determine the <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of species, which may be done using a plant functional trait approach. Plant functional traits are any attribute of a plant which can influence its establishment, survival and fitness. Frost tolerant species are expected to possess traits that reflect a conservative life history strategy aimed at stress tolerance, such as small and thick leaves, low specific leaf area, high leaf dry matter content, high leaf vein density and vein length per unit area, and high wood density. We sampled twenty-three plant species in Australia and twenty-five plant species in New Zealand, and compared their functional traits to existing species-specific <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> datasets. The traits most likely to influence <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> appear to be leaf size traits, leaf venation traits, and wood density, which is most likely due to the important effects these traits have on plant hydraulics, which is known to be significantly impacted by frost. Higher leaf vein density and vein length per unit area provide greater leaf hydraulics and better water use efficiency, which helps plants survive the water stress conditions that can be caused by frost. Higher wood density is related to having narrow xylem vessels, which are more resistant to freeze-thaw induced xylem cavitation and embolism, compared to wider xylem vessels. This study has provided globally-new information about which plant functional traits may be associated with <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> in plant species, and demonstrates {{for the first time the}} promise of leaf venation traits as a means of predicting and understanding response of plants to frost...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} ensure the bearing {{capacity}} and durability of road pavements in cold climate areas, {{it is necessary to}} use materials which are resistant to harmful frost impact, known as frost heaving. Frost heave cause adverse volume changes, the upwards swelling of a pavement after freezing and deterioration of the bearing capacity of the structure after thawing. In winter, road carriageway temperatures may reach tmin = − 30 ˚C under Polish conditions, which results in the freezing of the structural pavement and subgrade layers. Due to frost penetration into the pavement and the subgrade, heaves may form in soils and unbound pavement structural layers. Road bases made of unbound mixtures of continuously graded aggregates may be frost susceptible. Potential <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of road materials and soils is determined by laboratory testing. <b>Frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> is connected directly with the content and quality of fine particles in an aggregates. Frost heave can be predicted on the basis of different properties of soils or aggregates. The article presents the results of laboratory tests of 14 typical natural aggregate road mixtures, continuously graded 0 / 31. 5 mm and practically applied to road base courses. <b>Frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of the aggregates was determined during laboratory testing of the following properties: content of fine-grain fractions < 0. 002 mm, < 0. 02 mm, < 0. 075 mm, plastic limit, liquid limit and sand equivalent.

Correlations between fine-grain fractions, plastic limit, liquid limit, plasticity index, sand equivalent and frost have of the aggregates were analysed. The tests showed no correlations between plastic limit or plasticity index and frost have of the aggregates. Differences were also noted in criteria applied for predict <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of aggregates based on fines content.

40|$|AbstractThis paper first {{presents}} a simple frost heave model. Frost heave {{is assumed to}} be caused by the formation of ice lenses in a freezing soil. The formation of ice lenses is governed by the Clapeyron equation of thermodynamics and relies on the existence of a frozen fringe between the frozen and unfrozen zones. Both unfrozen water and ice co-exist in pores of the frozen fringe. The suction at the water–ice interface is the driving force for the water flow that feeds the growth of the ice lens. The initiation of a new ice lens is governed by a simple effective stress concept. The frost heave model contains only a few soil parameters and can be used to compute frost heave and frost penetration in stratified soil profiles. The second part of the paper illustrates the application of the frost heave model in assessing the <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of different soils. It is shown that the <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of a soil must be assessed together with environmental conditions such as overburden pressure, temperature gradient, cooling rate and the depth of groundwater table. A soil that is only mildly susceptible to frost according to classification can still generate a significant amount of heave or heaving pressure under favourable environmental conditions...|$|E

40|$|Although Britain is {{relatively}} rich in natural aggregate reserves, planning approvals {{to develop new}} quarries are running at about half the rate of aggregate extraction. The use of secondary materials, such as recycled aggregate, might not create a major course of aggregate but if secondary material were used in less demanding situations, the quantity of natural aggregate required by the construction industry would be reduced. This dissertation reports mainly on laboratory tests conducted on crushed concrete and demolition debris to examine the potential use of these materials in new construction. Standard aggregate tests were conducted on the materials to check their compliance with the Specification for Highway Works (1986), particularly for use as aggregate in road sub-base layers. A more detailed examination of the aggregates was conducted with regard to CBR, shear strength and <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> where the influences of moisture content, density and particle packing on these properties were investigated. One {{part of the study}} involved examining the use of recycled aggregate as the coarse aggregate fraction in new concrete. An analysis of the shear strength data was conducted using the dilatancy index defined by Bolton (1986). From the <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> results, it was concluded that further work would be required in this area to determine the main factors which influence the frost heave of recycled aggregates. The recycled aggregate concrete compared well with the natural aggregate concrete and appeared to be of superior quality than that produced in other research. During the study, it became evident that the recycled aggregates could perform as well as limestone in most cases and therefore could be considered for many potential uses.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Nottingham University. In this thesis work to improve the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) frost heave test is described along with a new indirect method of predicting the <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of granular material. To determine the optimum TRRL test conditions temperatures in the Nottingham University cold room and prototype Self Refrigerated Unit (SRU) were automatically monitored. In a typical trial several thousand temperatures were recorded. These were reduced to just three independent parameters, each of which quantified a particular feature of the temperature regime. Temperature fluctuations in the water bath of the prototype SRU were excessive and so an improved Mk 3 unit was developed. Road sub-base aggregates covering {{a wide variety of}} geological types and grading were tested. These had the same heave after 250 hours freezing in the Mk 3 SRU and the cold room, at least within the working range. Rigorous statistical analyses revealed that <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> could be judged with equal precision after only 96 hours freezing. The variability of heave was the same in both units. This variability was attributed to intrinsic differences between nominally similar specimens. It is intended that a 96 hour Mk 3 SRU, frost heave test will be specified in a new British Standard. The indirect method is based on the suction/moisture content characteristics of granular soils. These were determined using the osmotic suction technique although the specimen preparation procedure had to be improved to accommodate the hard, coarse aggregates. For all the materials tested, the volumetric moisture content at suction of pF 2. 5 (ϴ 2. 5) was strongly correlated with heave in the TRRL test. Calculations revealed that, for the TRRL test conditions, pF 2. 5 is a suction which must occur in the zone between the terminal ice lens and the limit of ice penetration. It is thought that ϴ 2. 5 reflects the overall permeability of this frozen fringe...|$|E

40|$|On sub-Antarctic Marion Island {{cushions}} of {{the dominant}} vascular plant species, Azorella selago, interact with the geomorphology of fellfield landscapes by affecting sediment distribution and ultimately terrace formation. Here, to understand the consequences of Azorella cushions for substrate movement and sorting, we quantified {{the size and shape}} of Azorella cushions and the grain size distribution of sediment surrounding these cushions, using a combination of image analysis approaches. Results show that as cushions become larger, they tend to become more elongated and grow more perpendicular to the slope. Mean and variance of grain size were greater upslope of Azorella cushions, while the number of particles was higher downslope of cushions, although these differences were not significant at all sites studied. Differences between upslope and downslope particle sizes were, however, not related to cushion elongation or growth angle as had been expected. The observed sediment partitioning is likely caused by a combination of frost-related sediment transport and Azorella cushions acting as sediment obstructions. Understanding these interactions between Azorella cushions and the landscape is especially important in the light of recent warming and drying on the island, as particle size affects soil properties such as water-holding capacity and <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility...</b>|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 Lime {{treatment}} of soil is {{the practice of}} introducing lime to soil to improve subgrade conditions or to improve a soil's properties to meet construction aggregate qualifications. Lime treated soils commonly exhibit improvements in moisture-density, strength, and thaw performance. Although lime treatment has been practiced in many regions of the United States and Canada for several decades, it is not practiced in Alaska.

Field work in Mosfellsheiði provided height, length, and width data of more than 120 frost hummocks which were analyzed and compared to frost hummocks in Keprník and Tabulové skály location in the Hrubý Jeseník Mts. Soil samples from frost hummocks were taken to determine <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of soils. Based on ground temperature measurements at depth of 15 and 30 cm in the frost hummocks in Iceland and the Hrubý Jeseník Mts., freeze-thaw cycles were investigated. The results show that frost hummocks in the Hrubý Jeseník Mts. are larger but less domed-shaped than those in Mosfellsheiði. Further, soils in frost hummocks are frost susceptible. The highest numbers of freeze-thaw cycles were identified in Iceland. It was also found out that freeze-thaw processes occurred in the frost hummocks in Tabulové skály but in Keprník location were very few freeze-thaw cycles observed.

Data were collected in a previously established experimental field after temperatures fell to 1. 3 °C on 20 June 1992, and to 0. 3 °c on 21 June 1992. The degree of frost damage to prairie plants was recorded using a scale of frost damage based on visual criteria, and possible causes of variation in <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> were examined. The degree of frost damage was independent of plant type (grass or forb), life cycle (annual, perennial, or biennial), successional status (early or late), and species origin (native or introduced). No significant correlations were noted between plant height and mean frost damage but there was a significant negative correlation between plant height and maximum frost damage. In addition, there were no significant correlations between frost damage and mean plant biomass allocated to leaves, stems, and roots, mean biomass allocations aboveground and below-ground, and total biomass. However, plants that allocated a greater proportion of biomass to leaves were more severely damaged than plants which allocated less biomass to leaves. The ratio of leaves to total biomass appears to be critical in relation to frosting events because leaves have a high surface area to volume ratio, which allows more surface area to be exposed to cold air masses, thus increasing the freezing rate...|$|E

Because chalk is extremely frost susceptible it is usual to provide a cover over the chalk of granular soil and road construction of thickness at least 450 mm. The object of this research was to attempt to find an economical method of treating the chalk so that it would be resistant to frost heave and would have a compressive strength at seven days of 3. 45 MN/m 2. Emphasis was placed on the use of sodium silicate to achieve these ends. The investigation was undertaken in three parts. In the "preliminary investigation" sodium silicate was used as a main additive and a number of fluid and powder setting agents were used as secondary additives. Various combinations of different types of sodium silicate and setting agents were investigated for seven day crushing strength. A number of suitable combinations were found. In the "main investigation" ordinary portland cement was used as a main additive and sodium silicate as a secondary additive. Optimum percentages of additives were determined together with optimum moisture, content. The variation in crushing strength with dry density and time was also investigated.

These INA populations ranged from less than 10 to over 106 CFU/g (fresh weight) of blossoms and, in Hood River Valley orchards, generally comprised over 10 % of the total bacterial population. Populations of INA bacteria fluctuated during the year with highest levels developing on buds and flowers during the cool, wet spring, followed by a drop in populations during the warmer, drier, summer months and finally a gradual increase in the autumn. The INA bacteria persisted on dormant buds from which they again colonized young developing vegetative tissues. All INA bacteria were identified as Pseudomonas syringae. The frequency of ice nucleation at − 5 °C for these strains ranged from nearly every cell being INA to less than 1 in 107 cells. The median frequency of ice nucleation at − 5 °C was 104 cells per ice nucleus. The INA P. syringae strains from individual orchards were diverse with respect to bacteriocin typing and in ice nucleation frequency. The consistent absence of detectable INA bacteria or presence of low populations in most of the orchards surveyed during periods when critical temperatures (i. e., − 2 to − 5 °C) were common indicated a limited role for INA bacteria in <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of most Pacific Northwest orchards...|$|E
40|$|In {{areas of}} {{seasonal}} frost, <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> composed by frost heaving {{during the winter}} and thaw softening during the spring {{is one of the}} most dangerous phenomenon for transportation, road and railway infrastructure. Therefore, the need for frost protection layer becomes imperative. The purpose of frost protection layer is to prevent frost from penetrating down through the pavement and into the sub-soils. Frost susceptible soils under the road can be cause damages on the roads or other structures due to frost heave or reduced capacity characteristics thaw period. "Frost heave" is the term given to the upwards displacement of the ground surface caused by the formation of ice within soils or aggregates (Rempel et al., 2004). Nowadays in Scandinavia the most common material used in frost protection layer in the pavement structure of roads and in the ballast of the railway tracks are coarse-grain crushed rocks aggregates. Based on the capillary rise, the mechanics of frost heave phenomenon is based on the interaction between aggregates and water, as suggested by Konrad and Lemieux in 2005 that said that the fraction of material below the 0. 063 mm sieve for coarse-grained soils must be controlled so as to reduce the sensitivity to frost heave. The study conducted in this thesis project is divided in two parts: - the analysis of the coarse grained aggregates used in frost protection layer in Norway; - the analysis of the frost heave phenomenon in the laboratory under known boundary conditions, through the use of the most widely used method, the frost heave test, in” closed system” (without access of water). ...|$|E
40|$|Knowing the {{attributes}} of the most suitable species to overcome the obstacles in different environmental conditions is an important tool for ecological restoration. To evaluate the comparative performance of native Cerrado species being cultivated at an arboretum (Assis State Forest, Assis, SP, Brazil), we categorized 106 species by the following attributes: average annual increment in height and crown diameter, survival rates, frequency of herbivory, <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> and seed dispersal syndrome. The score of each attribute may vary from 1 to 3, {{and the value of}} a species for restoration was generated from the sum of the scores for the different attributes converted to the scale of 0 to 100. Analyzing the species altogether, survival was 70 %, the average annual increment was 30 cm in height and 21 cm in crown diameter. Only 8 % of the species showed high susceptibility to frost and 17 % high frequency of herbivory. Eighteen species had scores above 80, being the first Annona crassiflora, Cecropia pachystachya, Enterolobium gummiferum, Plathymenia reticulata e Protium heptaphyllum. In this group are the species that gather the highest number of favorable attributes for the restoration of Cerrado vegetation. We generated two separate lists of ten species of higher value, one for the cerrado sensu stricto and the other for cerradao the forest type of cerrado vegetation. We believe that using these species accelerates the recovery of vegetation structure and thus provide the restoration of ecological processes of ecosystems undergoing restoration. At the end of the list are species of low scores, which, if used, can lead to higher costs or delay in the recovery of structure and ecological processes of the ecosystem being restored...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{freeze-thaw}} cycles in cold {{regions are}} a key factor leading to pavement damage. The duration and penetration depth of freeze-thaw cycles in the foundation layers can significantly influence the pavement performance. Frost heaves and loss of support conditions are two direct results due to pavement freezing and thawing. Current research has brought great interests in this topic, which may benefit pavement design, construction, and maintenance. Sufficient freezing depth, continuous water supply, and frost susceptible geomaterials are the three factors required resulting in pavement freeze-thaw related damage. When these factors are satisfied, stiffness and support conditions can be significantly affected due to the phase change of moisture within pavement structures. In various current pavement design guides, seasonal variation in foundation layers is taken into consideration by empirically adjusting the foundation layer moduli values. As various QC/QA testing methods is used in practice, different mechanistic properties can be derived. Even though only a few particular parameters are considered in current pavement design guides, empirical correlations were reported for transferring different properties. Values of these measurable properties change seasonally, which may differ from the values of design parameters after correlations. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate if the seasonal mechanistic property values meet the design values and if the empirical correlations match to the in situ measurements. This study focused on investigating the frost actions of pavement foundations that may affect pavement designs, such as frost penetration depths, number of freeze-thaw cycles, moisture conditions, and geomaterial <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility.</b> QC/QA tests were conducted to assess the influences and performance on reconstructed and rehabilitated pavement foundation stiffness and support conditions. Seasonal strength/stiffness results of pavement foundation layers were evaluated in comparison with design values in terms of empirical correlations...|$|E
40|$|In {{regions of}} {{temperate}} climate the destructive influence of frost action such as frost heave {{in winter and}} thaw weakening in spring are the main contributors to severe deterioration of the pavement structure. A number of studies on construction aggregates and field observations of road failures, especially caused by seasonal fluctuations of temperature, have revealed a negative influence of unbound mica-rich rock aggregates on the service life of road construction. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} behaviour of mica-rich aggregates under the temperate climate conditions. The study focuses on measurements of volume change (frost heave), capillarity rise and interaction between water and mica-rich aggregates. The materials studied in this research are commercially available unbound road construction aggregates with varying free mica grains, and originating from different regions of Sweden. The mineral composition of the samples has been determined by polarizing microscopy using a point-count method. In Paper I, the materials were exposed to freeze-thaw cycling in order to register the volume change (in terms of frost heave). The results show that mica-rich base-course aggregates have a large potential to produce frost heave. The results from the test for determining capillary rise (Paper II) indicate a direct correlation between mica content of the aggregates and capillary rise values confirming the capability of mica-rich unbound aggregates to transport and absorb higher amounts of water. The interaction of mica-rich aggregates with water in terms fraction sizes and free mica content was studied in Paper III, measuring water storage capacity and specific water saturation values. The results reveal a strong positive correlation between mica content, grain size, water sorption and water storage capacity of the aggregates. The overall results of this research bring the mineralogy of the fines into focus when evaluating <b>frost</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of unbound aggregates and can be considered when estimating threshold values of free mica grains in crushed road materials.
