40|$|The rubber {{pressing}} process is {{applied for the}} rapid production of thermoplastic composite products. However, rubber pressed products show geometrical distortions, such as warpage, due to processinduced residual stresses. An experimental study is performed to measure the curvature after rubber pressing of initially <b>flat</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> glass/poly(phenylenesulphide) composite panels. A material model is proposed that incorporates the solidification of the composite in order to predict the residual stresses and the warpage due to inhomogeneous cooling. The model is employed in finite element simulations of the rubber {{pressing process}}. The simulations are compared to the experimentally obtained curvatures. It shows that unbalanced cooling has a minor effect on the warpage in this case. It is demonstrated that transverse shear loading of the composite during consolidation, for example by a non-flat rubber tool, results in warpage-inducing residual stresses...|$|E
40|$|Draping of {{woven fabrics}} and {{garments}} interacting with rigid objects or human bodies {{is a large}} displacement/rotation contact problem of anisotropic materials. The objective {{of this paper is}} to extend a geometrically nonlinear finite-volume method recently developed by the authors to predict contact drape deformations of woven fabrics. In this finite volume method, an initially <b>flat</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> sheet is first divided into a number of structured finite volumes (or control volumes) using mesh lines along the warp and weft directions. The out-of-plane bending and in-plane membrane strain energies of the fabric sheet are then found by summing up the contributions from all control volumes. The equilibrium equations of the fabric sheet are derived employing the principle of stationary total potential energy and solved using the full Newton-Raphson method with line searches. In this paper, a simple and easily achievable algorithm for detecting and treating fabric contact with a rigid object is proposed and shown to be effective and efficient. Numerical simulation of two square fabric sheets draped over a round rod is first considered. The coordinates of a characteristic point of the first fabric sheet after drape deformation predicted using the present method are compared with available experimental results, showing a close match between the two approaches. Numerical results of square fabric sheets draped over a sphere and skirts attached to and draped over a synthetic body form are next presented. The predicted drape shapes are realistic.

40|$|Efficient {{numerical}} {{methods for}} simulating cloth deformations {{have been identified}} as the key to the development of successful Computer-Aided Design systems for clothing products. This paper presents the formulation of a new finite-volume method for the simulation of complex deformations of initially <b>flat</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> sheets under self-weight or externally applied loading. The fabric sheet is assumed to undergo very large displacements and rotations but small strains during the process of deformation. The fabric material is assumed to be linear elastic and orthotropic. The fabric sheet is discretized into many small structured patches called finite volumes (or control volumes), each containing one grid node and several face nodes. The bending and membrane deformations of a typical volume can be defined using the global co-ordinates of its grid node and surrounding face nodes. The equilibrium equations governing the complex deformations are derived employing the principle of stationary total potential energy. These equations are solved using a single-step full Newton-Raphson method which is found to be capable of predicting the final deformed shape, the only result of interest in a fabric drape analysis. To speed up convergence, the line search technique is adopted with good effect. This single-step approach is more efficient than the step-by-step incremental approach employed in conventional non-linear finite element analysis of load-bearing structures. A number of example simulations of fabric drape/buckling deformations are included in the paper, which demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the proposed method.

This lecture will focuss on three periods in time: the beginning, the middle {{and the end of the}} 20 th century, three different kind of makers: a large manufacturer, a small studio and an independent textile designer, three methods: machine <b>woven</b> jacquard interior <b>fabrics,</b> simple handwoven household textiles and exclusive samples handwoven on a 24 shafts computerised loom, and three types of markets: the export market, the local Belgian market and both. Most of the weaving mills active in Belgium today, were founded in the 19 th century or in the beginning of the 20 th century.

I. Vats Orange 1, Yellow 2 and Red 1 have been certified, whereas Vat Blue 6 is a marginal candidate. Vat Blue 1 has been demonstrated {{to be a viable}} colorant for dyeing of PP fiber as a single colorant. Molecular dynamics simulation and solubility parameter (SP) approaches have been utilized to screen the potential vat dye candidates for generic PP coloration. Experimental K/S results have exhibited good correlation with the predicted mixing energy of acid leuco vat dyes-PP fiber and the calculated dyes' SP's. The low SP/mixing energy acid leuco vat dyes (e. g., C. I. Vat Red 1) have shown better color-yield/fastness properties than the high SP/mixing energy vat dyes (e. g., C. I. Vat Brown 1), exhibiting that increasing difference of SP between the vat dye and the PP fiber, coupled with a higher mixing energy of dye-PP blend, resulted in decreased interactions between the two. For example, C. I. Vat Brown 1 with its high SP and calculated mixing energy with PP gave least color yield than the certified vat dyes, all with lower SP's and mixing energies. Cross-section micrographs of the dyed fibers revealed the absence of "ring-dyeing". Experimentally determined kinetic parameters such as affinity of dyeing and heat of dyeing quantified the presence of interaction between acid leuco vat dyes and PP fiber. Tensile test and X-ray crystallinity results have confirmed that dyeing process did not alter the tensile strength and modulus of the dyed PP textiles significantly. PP Fabrics dyed with simulated continuous dyeing processes (pad-steam and pad-dry heat) demonstrated good color yields and levelness with adequate fastness to crocking, washing and dry cleaning. Ph.

The enhancement of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> in HAH sandwich panel further strengthens the sandwich panel especially in ballistic tests. Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> showed extensive pull out (rupture of yarns) when less than 6 layers of fabric impacted by ballistic projectile at a velocity of 293 m/s. Sandwich panel consisting of 6 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> incorporated with aluminium honeycomb showed no pull out when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 312. 5 m/s.

Therefore, it is crucial to have ballistic projectile entrapped within the Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> layers before prioritising the arrangement of sandwich panel...|$|R
