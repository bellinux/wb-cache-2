50|$|Tiffin {{retired to}} stud where she {{produced}} a filly foal sired by Blandford on 17 February 1931. A {{few days after}} giving birth, Tiffin became seriously ill and {{was found to be}} suffering from peritonitis and a perforated bowel. She died on 7 March at the Stetchworth stud in Newmarket. Her daughter, named Merenda, was raised by a <b>foster</b> <b>mare</b> and went on to win three races including the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot in 1933. Merenda was the direct female ancestor of many winners, most notably the Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Smile.|$|E
5000|$|Jack Spigot (4 May 1818 [...] - June 1843) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse {{that won}} the 1821 St. Leger Stakes and was a sire in the early 19th century. His {{paternity}} is attributed to either Ardrossan or Marmion. His mother was a blind mare with a difficult temperament, whose unpredictable behavior necessitated that he be raised by a <b>foster</b> <b>mare.</b> He was named after one of his owner's tenant farmers, Jack Faucet. He won four of his six career starts before being retired from racing in early 1823. He is {{not considered to be}} a good sire. Jack Spigot died in June 1843 and was buried at Bolton Hall.|$|E
5000|$|Simmer (1894), brown colt by St. Simon. Dutch Oven died {{shortly after}} Simmer's birth {{and he was}} raised by a <b>foster</b> <b>mare.</b> Simmer was unraced due to a leg injury as a yearling. Derided as a horse that could [...] "neither gallop, trot nor walk", he was {{exported}} to Australia in 1898 to the Tocal Stud {{for use as a}} breeding stallion. He was sold at the dispersal of the stud in 1901 to George Kiss for Â£1200. He died in May 1909 at the Hobartville stud in New South Wales. Simmer sired the AJC St. Leger winner Dividend, and he appears in the pedigrees of Australian steeplechase horses, such as Hercules and Kincumber.|$|E
5000|$|Red Evie is a bay mare with {{no white}} {{markings}} bred by Dermot Cantillon & Forenaghts at Tinnakill House in County Laois, Ireland. She was sired by Intikhab, a miler {{best known for}} his wide-margin victories in the Diomed Stakes and Queen Anne Stakes in as a four-year-old in 1998. His other offspring have included the outstanding middle-distance filly Snow Fairy. Red Evie's dam Malafemmena showed some ability as a racehorse, winning the Listed Premio Vittorio Crespi in Italy as a two-year-old in 1994. She was a granddaughter of Pavlova a half-sister to the Ascot Gold Cup winner Random Shot. Malafemmena died foaling Red Evie and the filly was raised by a <b>foster</b> <b>mare.</b> Remembering Red Evie's early days Dermot Cantillon described her as [...] "a lovely foal, but independent. Impossible to catch in the field".|$|E
5000|$|Jack Spigot's dam had a fractious {{temperament}} {{and had been}} blind and barren for four years before Jack Spigot's birth. Her first foal died {{at a young age}} in 1814 and she was owned by H. Peirse until she was sold to Powlett for a small sum. While owned by Peirse, the mare had killed other horses by kicking, notably Reveller's dam Rosette in 1816. She kicked about so much in the foaling paddock after Jack Spigot's birth that in order to prevent the death of her second foal, he had to be raised by a surrogate. A dapple grey <b>foster</b> <b>mare</b> similar in colouring to his own dam was procured from one of Powlett's tenants, Jack Faucet, to raise the foal. The sister to Bourbon mare also produced the grey colt Isaac in 1831 (sired by Figaro), who was considered to be the [...] "best Cup horse of his day", running in flat and steeplechase races until he was 15 years old winning 53 races out of 172 starts.|$|E
