5|$|Although heavy {{industry}} died {{out in the}} area during the <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Giffnock has continued to grow as a dormitory town, supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents in the <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century to 16,178 in 2001. Expansion continues due to several new housing developments; however, much {{of the land is}} now urbanised or designated parkland, leaving little room for further expansion.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century notable {{photographic}} work in Scotland included that {{of visiting}} artists, such as Alvin Langdon Coburn (1882–1966), whose produced illustrations {{for the work}} of Robert Louis Stevenson and Paul Strand (1890–1976), as well as atmospheric depictions of Hebridean landscapes. There was also the record of the Gorbals in Glasgow made by Bert Hardy (1913–95), Joseph MacKenzie (b. 1929) and Oscar Marzaroli (1933–88), but, having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high in the <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century.|$|E

50|$|The 18 {{counties}} {{are shown in}} most maps of Tasmania {{in the mid to}} late nineteenth and <b>earlier</b> <b>twentieth</b> century.

The counties in the east and centre were proclaimed by 1850, while the western counties of Wellington, Russel, Montague, Lincoln, Franklin, Montgomery and Arthur were proclaimed during the 1850s.|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to such structurally pure models, {{the power of}} computation has opened possibilities for at once muddying and synthesizing geometry, structure and material performance. Where the <b>earlier</b> <b>twentieth</b> century experiments employed {{a more or less}} uniform tectonic based on symmetrical structural diagrams, contemporary analysis and design techniques can efficiently adapt a material system to address variable, localized, and non-symmetrical loading conditions. This has resulted in projects characterized by non-optimized structural forms that register the impacts of geometry on material behavior with a deviated tectonic system...|$|R
50|$|Una {{was noted}} for taking in lodgers and renting out rooms; {{after her death}} in 1924, Erlendur kept up the tradition. She and her son were very {{interested}} in the arts and culture, and Unuhús was known as a central point in Icelandic cultural life in the <b>earlier</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, associated with free-thinkers, radicals, and communists. Young poets and artists {{as well as a number}} of others stayed there, including Stefán frá Hvítadal, Steinn Steinarr, Halldór Laxness, Þórbergur Þórðarson, Louisa Matthíasdóttir and Nína Tryggvadóttir.|$|R

50|$|With the {{building}} of a bridge over Lækinn, the stream running from Tjörnin along what is now Lækjargata, in 1828, Bankarstræti, along with the contiguous Austurstræti and Laugavegur, became {{some of the most important}} streets in Reykjavík. The street saw Reykjavík's first street light, an oil-lamp beside Lækjartorg. Since the <b>earlier</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, the street has been one-way. Since 2012, Bankastræti, along with Laugarvegur and Skólavörðustígur, has been pedestrianised during the summer as part of the 'sumar götur eru sumargötur' ('some streets are summerstreets') scheme.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} {{a comparative}} study of two large UK clothing plants in the 1990 s with <b>earlier</b> <b>twentieth</b> century studies of clothing workshops undertaken in the late 1950 s by Cunnison and Lupton, and in the late 1970 s by Edwards and Scullion. Traditionally the clothing industry is identified {{with a history of}} low wages and poor conditions of employment. Though increasingly subject to global market pressures, research findings from this study illuminate workplaces in the 1990 s with much in common with the aforementioned historical studies, offering working conditions that leave the clothing worker isolated, individualised and struggling to survive...|$|R
5|$|Lions {{were kept}} in cramped and squalid {{conditions}} at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages {{was built in the}} 1870s. Further changes took place in the <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, in the <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park.|$|E

50|$|Scalloptown Park {{has been}} {{completed}} {{at the southern end}} of Greenwich Cove, built atop the old town landfill. However, it is not part of historical Scalloptown, which was another name for the waterfront in earlier times.

In contrast to the other villages in East Greenwich, Scalloptown consisted primarily of poor whites and African Americans. The true Scalloptown goes from the town dock down past the clubs to Fin's Marina.|$|R
50|$|Typical of most {{painters}} and decorators {{of the nineteenth}} and <b>earlier</b> <b>twentieth</b> centuries, Exton and Gough and their employees provided {{a wide range of}} services for the householder or business person building or improving their premises.

Exton and Gough also provided paint supplies for tradesmen and were agents for embossed metal ceilings and importers of art glass and wallpapers of the latest European design. During the 1880s Exton and Gough expanded their business to incorporate a department for the manufacture of stained glass, the only of its kind in Queensland.|$|R
