A layer-by-layer (LbL) fabrication procedure is detailed for the manufacture of free-standing thin films defined by interdigitated phase homogeneity and high strength.

An {{original design}} taking advantage on both mechanical and bulk piezoresistive properties of silicon is presented and enables to easily fabricate a very small, large range, high sensitivity with high integration potential sensor. The sensor is made of two silicon strain gages for which widespread and known microfabrication processes are used. The strain gages present a <b>high</b> <b>gage</b> factor which allow a good sensitivity of this force sensor. The dimensions of this sensor are 700 mm in length, 100 mm in width and 12 mm in thickness.

The design, microfabrication process, and performances of the fabricated piezoresistive force sensor are innovative thanks to its resolution of 100 nN and its measurement range of 2 mN.

40|$|Invasive bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) {{and silver}} carp (H. molitrix), hereafter, bigheaded carp, pose {{a major threat}} to the Great Lakes {{ecosystem}} as they advance toward Lake Michigan via the Illinois River. However, a series of navigation dams may deter their upstream movement. Starved Rock Lock and Dam (SRLD) is the most downstream gated dam on the Illinois River, therefore presenting the first navigation challenge for upstream migrating bigheaded carp. Before 2015, five acoustic receivers near SRLD detected successful upstream passage of only two of 900 tagged bigheaded carp. I further investigated the permeability of SRLD to bigheaded carp migration as a function of temperature, gage height, and dam operation. In 2015, I added 12 receivers around SRLD and acoustically tagged an additional 118 bigheaded carp downstream of SRLD. I also investigated the timing of bigheaded carp arriving downstream of SRLD using a generalized linear model. The explanatory variables influencing bigheaded carp arrival were average water temperature, average tailwater elevation, and the change in average water temperature. During 2015 - 2016, acoustic receivers recorded a total of 11 upstream passage events through SRLD, with nine through the dam gates, one through the lock chamber, and one undetermined. Passage through the dam gates occurred most frequently at high water levels when the dam gates were completely out of the water. The probability of upstream migrating bigheaded carp approaching SRLD was positively correlated with rising temperature and <b>high</b> <b>gage.</b> No upstream migrants approached SRLD between mid-September and late March. Overall, dam gates were more susceptible to upstream passage than the lock chamber, and environmental factors accurately predicted the arrival of bigheaded carp at SRLD. Modifying gate use during times of bigheaded carp arrival will likely prevent upstream passage through SRLD and other lock and dam structures...|$|E

Carbon nanofiber (CNFCC) and fiber (CFCC) cement composites were used as sensors on a 4 m long RC beam. Different casting conditions (in situ or attached), service location (under tension or compression) and electrical contacts (embedded or superficial) were compared. Both CNFCC and CFCC were suitable as strain sensors in reversible (elastic) sensing condition testing. CNFCC showed <b>higher</b> sensitivities (<b>gage</b> factor up to 191. 8), while CFCC only reached gage factors values of 178. 9 (tension) or 49. 5 (compression). Furthermore, damage-sensing tests were run, increasing the applied load progressively up to the RC beam failure. In these conditions, CNFCC sensors were also strain sensitive, but no damage sensing mechanism was detected for the strain levels achieved during the tests.
