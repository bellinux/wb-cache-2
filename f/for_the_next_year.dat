5|$|Hubbard's health {{deteriorated}} significantly {{during this}} period. A chain-smoker, he also suffered from bursitis and excessive weight, {{and had a}} prominent growth on his forehead. He suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1973 and {{had a heart attack}} in 1975 that required him to take anticoagulant drugs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> In September 1978, Hubbard had a pulmonary embolism, falling into a coma, but recovered.|$|E

Ima was devastated; to quell her grief, her brother William took her to New York City. During her stay she immersed herself in concerts and museums.|$|E

5|$|Although {{this was}} a good start, Hastings was not a {{particularly}} well-known barrister, and cases were few and far between. To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil, and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil paid him. To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine was the basis of his appeals to the public <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> and a half.|$|E

5|$|At the Battle of Lewes in 1264, {{the rebellious}} barons, led by Simon de Montfort, had {{defeated}} the royal army and taken King Henry III captive. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> {{the reins of}} government were in Montfort's hands, but his support soon began to crumble. On 4 August 1265, Montfort faced an army led by Prince Edward (later King Edward I) and the powerful Earl of Gloucester, who had recently defected to the royalist side, at the Battle of Evesham. The battle resulted in a complete royal victory; Montfort was killed, and King Henry III was restored to full power.|$|E
5|$|Converted into {{an escort}} {{destroyer}} {{midway through the}} war, Forester was assigned to escort convoys to Russia <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> {{and a half and}} then in the North Atlantic until mid-1944. The ship helped to sink another German submarine before she was transferred to the English Channel to protect convoys during the Normandy landings. Forester assisted in sinking a German submarine before returning to the North Atlantic for a few months. The ship was under repair {{for the first half of}} 1945 and was then reduced to reserve in November before being scrapped in early 1946.|$|E

The ship also participated in the landings on Leyte and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. During this time, Pennsylvania {{was present at the}} last battle ever between battleships, the Battle of Surigao Strait. The ship did not fire any salvos because the Japanese vessels were turned away or sunk at long range, beyond Pennsylvanias outdated fire control but within range of other, radar-directed battleships.|$|E

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> the RPF waged {{a classic}} {{hit-and-run}} style guerrilla war, capturing some border areas but not making significant {{gains in the}} war against the Rwandan army. Following the June 1992 formation of a multi-party coalition government in Kigali, Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with the Rwandan government in Arusha, Tanzania. In early 1993 groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large-scale violence against the Tutsi. Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across the north of the country.|$|E

The band then sent out a one track demo cd of Bullets, earning them the interest of several British labels, with thirty A reps coming to see them play at Birmingham. In October 2004, the group signed to Newcastle based indie label Kitchenware Records. Upon signing to the record label they changed their band name to Editors.|$|E
5|$|HMS Hunter was a H-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed on both sides by Britain and France, until she struck a mine in May 1937. She was under repair <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> and a half, after which she rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet. During {{the first few months}} of World War II, Hunter searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean until she was transferred back to Britain in February 1940. Returning to action in the Norwegian Campaign, she was sunk by German destroyers during the First Battle of Narvik in April 1940.|$|E

After Ariel was released in mid-2007, Thorn continued to wrestle on ECW, but was sent to OVW in late 2007, after undergoing an image change. He wrestled in both OVW and WWE's other developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling, until January 2009, when {{he was released from}} his contract. He then returned to {{the independent}} circuit, and also wrestled in Europe as Seven Thorn.|$|E

The division launched a reconnaissance in force on the Voëvre Plain, but before it could begin a full assault, the Allies signed an Armistice ending hostilities. After 33 days on the front lines, the 7th Division suffered 1,988 casualties. It was awarded one campaign streamer for Lorraine. The brigade performed occupation duties <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> as it began preparations to return to the continental United States.|$|E
