The Alpha {{is the basis for}} the five-seat Prius v launched in North America in October 2011 with a nickel-metal hydride battery pack similar to the 2010 model year Prius, and with two rows of seats to accommodate five passengers. The European and Japanese versions are offered with a lithium-ion battery, with three rows of seats with accommodations for seven passengers. However, the seven passenger seating on the Prius v is not available on North American Prius v models. The European version, named Prius+ (plus), began deliveries in June 2012. Global sales totaled 671,200 units [...] Japan is the leading market with 446,400 units sold, followed by North America with 173,100 units, [...] and Europe with 43,800, all through January 2017.|$|E

Using numerical simulation, a lightweight method {{is designed to}} reduce E-REV body and key parts weight based on rear-end collision failure analysis. To calculate and optimize the performance of vehicle safety, the simulation model of E-REV rear-end collision safety is built by using finite element analysis. <b>Drive</b> <b>battery</b> pack lightweight design method is analyzed and the bending mode and torsional mode of E-REV before and after lightweight are compared to evaluate E-REV rear-end collision safety performance.

30|$|The {{proposed}} modeling framework allows to smoothly integrate and compose different {{building blocks}} {{representative of a}} cascade of devices. Indeed, in some applications, the energy flow provided by a given harvester needs to be properly shaped for compatibility with the load to be powered. For example, voltage limiters or output stage regulators (DC-DC converters) {{could be used to}} couple a photovoltaic scavenger to an embedded device equipped with integrated circuits requiring to be powered with stable voltage [28]. Another example could be represented by chips used to <b>drive</b> <b>battery</b> recharging according to optimized policies [36]. The composition of the I-V curves of each single block into a suitable I-V characteristic representative of the whole cascade allows us to emulate modular scavenging systems, providing a twofold benefit: on the one side we extend the emulation process to a wider spectrum of possible power source behaviors, on the other side we decouple and isolate the contribution of each single block (e.g. the photovoltaic cell and the recharge chip are separately characterized and composed) thus enabling to perform significant fine-grain emulations.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the work of}} NREL's Energy Storage group for FY 2011. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) supports energy storage R&D under the Vehicle Technologies Program at the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). The DOE Energy Storage program's charter is to develop battery technologies that will enable large market penetration of electric drive vehicles. These vehicles could {{have a significant impact}} on the nation's goal of reducing dependence on imported oil and gaseous pollutant emissions. DOE has established several program activities to address and overcome the barriers limiting the penetration of electric <b>drive</b> <b>battery</b> technologies: cost, performance, safety, and life. These programs are: (1) Advanced Battery Development [through the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) ]; (2) Testing, Design and Analysis (TDA); (3) Applied Battery Research (ABR); and (4) Focused Fundamental Research, or Batteries for Advanced Transportation Technologies (BATT). In FY 11, DOE funded NREL to make technical contributions to all of these R&D activities. This report summarizes NREL's R&D projects in FY 11 in support of the USABC, TDA, ABR, and BATT program elements. In addition, we continued the enhancement of NREL's battery testing facilities funded through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) of 2009. The FY 11 projects under NREL's Energy Storage R&D program are briefly described below. Each of these is discussed in depth in the main sections of this report...|$|E

Once the battery runs out, surgery {{is needed to}} replace the unit. Longer battery life correlates to fewer surgeries needed to replace batteries. One option {{that could be used}} to recharge implant batteries without surgery or wires is being used in powered toothbrushes. These devices make use of inductive coupling to recharge batteries. Another strategy is to convert electromagnetic energy into electrical energy, as in radio-frequency identification tags.|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} {{fuel consumption}} reduction strengths of multiple passenger car powertrains are investigated. These include [A] conventional compression ignition (CI) direct injection (DI) turbocharged (TC) diesel (D) [CI-DI-TC-D]; [B] Atkinson cycle charge sustaining (CS) "split-hybrid" electric vehicles (HEV) fueled by gasoline/petrol (G) [HEVG]; plug-in (P) hybrid gasoline/petrol [PHEVG) ]; and indirect fuel injected (IDI) spark-ignited (SI) internal combustion engines (ICE) fueled by gasoline/petrol [SI-IDI-NA-G]. When we use simulation {{to evaluate the}} behavior of PHEVG powertrains, the size is a four-to-five passenger car platform that would be regarded as "compact" in the U. S. and standard in Europe. A careful distinction between probable driving patterns for PHEVGs when in charge-depletion (CD) mode vs. charge sustaining (CS) operation is made. Effects of variation {{in the amount of}} kWh storage and the CD strategy, between PHEVs with varying km of electric-equivalent range are also investigated. The effect of electric <b>drive</b> (<b>battery</b> and motor) power (kW) on ability of a vehicle to operate all-electrically, relative to its ability to reduce oil use, is examined. Four degrees of hybridization are briefly examined, including stop-start (SS), integrated starter-generator (ISG), mild parallel (MP), and full parallel (FP). Each of the parallel PHEVs examined is an FP. Powertrain model simulations and limited dynamometer test results for such PHEVGs are compared to the other vehicle types for certification and "on-road" driving cycles from Europe and the U. S. It is illustrated that the conventional wisdom that HEVG has significant superiority over CG primarily in urban stop and go driving should not automatically be extended to PHEVGs. The driving cycle information is related to systematically varying consumer patterns of dwelling choice and vehicle use in cities, suburbs, and rural areas, as well as across nations. Effects of fuel taxation choices by nation - for gasoline, diesel and electric fuel - are investigated. The effects that residential location and type, driving cycle, and fuel cost have on the relative marketability of the studied powertrains, when initially entering the market, are summarized. The sequence of events leading to early emergence of original equipment automaker production and marketing of PHEVGs is discussed...|$|E
