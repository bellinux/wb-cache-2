Hans asks Ole to become the manager of Enekaer and see if it can be saved.|$|E
500|$|Portland was {{the lead}} ship of the third class of [...] "treaty cruisers" [...] to be {{constructed}} by the United States Navy following the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, following the two vessels of the [...] ordered in 1926 and the six vessels of the [...] ordered in 1927. Ordered for the U.S. Navy in Fiscal Year 1930. Portland was originally designated as a light cruiser, because of <b>her</b> <b>thin</b> armor, and given the hull classification symbol CL-33. She was reclassified a heavy cruiser, because of her 8-inch guns, with the symbol CA-33 on 1 July 1931, {{in accordance with the}} London Naval Treaty.|$|E

500|$|Königsberg {{was hit by}} {{at least}} five [...] bombs, which caused serious damage to the ship. One {{penetrated}} <b>her</b> <b>thin</b> deck armor, went through the ship, and exploded in the water, causing significant structural damage. Another hit destroyed the auxiliary boiler room. Two more bombs exploded in the water next to the ship; the concussion from the blasts tore large holes in the hull. She took on a heavy list almost immediately, and the captain ordered the crew to abandon the ship. It took slightly less than three hours {{from the start of}} the attack for the ship to completely capsize and sink, which gave the crew enough time to evacuate many of the dead and wounded. They also had time to remove a significant amount of ammunition and equipment from the stricken cruiser. Only eighteen men were killed in the attack. The wreck was raised on 17 July 1942, and slowly broken up for scrap thereafter. By 1943, the wreck had been completely dismantled in situ.|$|E
500|$|Lütjens then ordered Prinz Eugen to drop behind Bismarck, so {{she could}} {{continue}} to monitor the location of Norfolk and Suffolk, which were still some [...] to the east. At 06:00, Hood was completing her second turn to port when Bismarcks fifth salvo hit. Two of the shells landed short, striking the water close to the ship, {{but at least one}} of the 38cm armour-piercing shells struck Hood and penetrated <b>her</b> <b>thin</b> upper belt armor. The shell reached Hoods rear ammunition magazine and detonated [...] of cordite propellant. The massive explosion broke the back of the ship between the main mast and the rear funnel; the forward section continued to move forward briefly before the in-rushing water caused the bow to rise into the air at a steep angle. The stern similarly rose upward as water rushed into the ripped-open compartments. After only eight minutes of firing, Hood had disappeared, taking all but three of her crew of 1,419 men with her.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} use of Auto-Tune in Spears' voice. Ewing said that Blackout serves as a {{reminder}} of how instantly recognizable Spears' vocals are, saying that [...] "treated or untreated: <b>her</b> <b>thin</b> Southern huskiness is one of the defining sounds of 00s pop." [...] He noted that the album [...] "is a masterclass in autotune and vocal treatment as a studio instrument, disrupting and jamming the songs as much as it helps them." [...] While reviewing Spears' demo of [...] "Telephone", Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone compared it to [...] "Piece of Me", [...] "proving yet again how much impact Britney has had on the sonics of current pop. People love to make fun of Britney, and why not, but if 'Telephone' proves anything, it's that Blackout may be the most influential pop album of the past five years." [...] In June 2012, [...] "Blackout" [...] was added to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's musical library and archive.|$|E

500|$|As Glitter was an {{unsuccessful}} mixture of covers and dance music, Charmbracelet incorporated slower, contemporary melodies. In {{his review of}} the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine criticized the album's content, describing Carey's voice as [...] "in tatters". He wrote, [...] "Whenever she sings, there's a raspy whistle behind <b>her</b> <b>thin</b> voice and she strains to make notes throughout the record. She cannot coo or softly croon, nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs. Her voice is damaged, and there's not a moment where it sounds strong or inviting." [...] Though fueled by strong media attention regarding Carey's return to music, {{as well as her}} new deal with Island Records, the album failed to deliver the type of success she had been accustomed to throughout the 1990s, and only managed sales of five million copies globally. After the album's release, and its succeeding tour, Carey began conceptualizing and working on a new project, eventually titled The Emancipation of Mimi, her tenth studio effort. By November2004, Carey had already recorded several songs for the album.|$|E
500|$|Later reviews {{continue}} {{to find the}} album favorable. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine expressed that the misconception that Control is Jackson's debut album only confirmed the [...] "quintessential statement on personal and artistic self-actualization" [...] that it set out to accomplish. Henderson claimed critics who judged Jackson harshly for <b>her</b> <b>thin</b> voice [...] "somehow missed the explosive 'gimme a beat' vocal pyrotechnics she unleashes all over [...] "Nasty"... Or that they completely dismissed how perfect her tremulous hesitance fits into the abstinence anthem [...] "Let's Wait Awhile." [...] However, Henderson also commented that the [...] "Jam-Lewis formula wasn't completely infallible" [...] as [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] and [...] "Funny How Time Flies (When You're Having Fun)", {{were two of the}} album's least impressive misfires. While William Ruhlmann of Allmusic commented Jackson [...] "came across as an aggressive, independent woman", he asserts the album's true value is the production talents of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. [...] The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album four stars out of five.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Charmbracelet was {{released}} to nearly negative critical reception. Aggregator website Metacritic, which averages professional reviews into a numerical score, gave Charmbracelet {{a score of}} 43/100, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic rated the album two out of five stars, and criticized its production and the condition of Carey's voice. He wrote, [...] "Whenever she sings, there's a raspy whistle behind <b>her</b> <b>thin</b> voice and she strains to make notes throughout the record...Her voice is damaged, and there's not a moment where it sounds strong or inviting." [...] Tom Sinclair of [...] Entertainment Weekly said she was [...] "in fine voice". He wrote that [...] "Through the Rain" [...] sinks in its own sodden sentimentality, as do by-the-numbers efforts like 'Yours' and 'I Only Wanted'", and added that [...] "Clown' is a moody number graced with mournful acoustic guitar and a gorgeously nuanced vocal, while 'Sunflowers for Alfred Roy' is a short, sweet song sung to a lovely piano accompaniment". He finished by saying that [...] "too much of Charmbracelet is mired in middle-of-the-road muck." ...|$|E
500|$|Auf der Maur was {{generally}} well received by music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 19 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine awarded the album {{three out of}} five stars, noting that the album had [...] "a certain nostalgic appeal" [...] and [...] "it's a little slicker and more polished" [...] than her previous work but added that the album's themes were [...] "little embarrassing and juvenile." [...] Alternative Press awarded the album {{four out of five}} stars, adding that [...] "the disc's bread and butter is Auf Der Maur's smoking riffs." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said that [...] "though Auf Der Maur is never objectionably bad, there's nothing the least bit distinctive about it" [...] and called it [...] "Billy Corgan-inspired, arena-scale, guitar-driven introspective musery" [...] in his three out of ten review. In his review for the BBC, Matt Wicks described the album as [...] "excellent" [...] and [...] "like the Pumpkins in their prime" [...] and compared Auf der Maur to other female contemporaries such as Shirley Manson and PJ Harvey. Blender gave a majorly positive review, awarding the album three out of five stars, but criticized Auf der Maur's vocals, stating: [...] "buffeted by big guitars, <b>her</b> <b>thin,</b> untrained voice occasionally sounds listless." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vertinskaya's 1961 debut was {{successful}} with both cinema fans and critics, {{some of the}} latter hailing the fifteen-year-old a future star of the Soviet cinema. [...] "No other Soviet actress could have played Assol.

The young girl's slight clumsiness looked natural on screen, while her strengths – 'gracefulness', 'youthful charms' and an 'aura of other-worldliness' – went undisputed, according to critic L.Nekhoroshev. [...] "It {{was as if a}} young flower blossomed before our eyes in the Soviet cinema," [...] critic Andrei Plakhov recalled years later.
