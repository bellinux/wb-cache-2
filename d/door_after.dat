25|$|Bank vaults {{are built}} as custom orders. The vault {{is usually the}} first aspect of a new bank {{building}} to be designed and built. The manufacturing process begins with {{the design of the}} vault, {{and the rest of the}} bank is built around it. The vault manufacturer consults with the customer to determine factors such as the total vault size, desired shape, and location of the <b>door.</b> <b>After</b> the customer signs off on the design, the manufacturer configures the equipment to make the vault panels and door. The customer usually orders the vault to be delivered and installed. That is, the vault manufacturer not only makes the vault parts, but brings the parts to the construction site and puts them together.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for her, black-haired Lavigne and {{her friends}} happen to be present at the venue as well. As soon as she {{and her friends}} see them, black-haired Lavigne hits her {{in the head with a}} golf ball, {{resulting}} in the red-haired girl splashing down into the water. Her boyfriend tries to grab her hand but misses, to black-haired Lavigne's amusement. Finally, the man, who eventually develops feelings for black-haired Lavigne, is seen waiting for her. As she comes toward him, they soon hold hands together, but red-haired girl sees this and attempts to seize black-haired Lavigne. But black-haired Lavigne and the man manage to dodge her, and in her attempt to win back her boyfriend, she tumbles all the way down and lands in a portable toilet ahead, where she gives a look of desperation towards the camera, showing she has failed to do so, and signalling that black-haired Lavigne has finally won the man's affections. Blonde Lavigne then takes her new boyfriend into a bathroom stall and slightly opens the <b>door</b> <b>after</b> a moment and pumps her arm in victory.|$|E
25|$|On November 12, 1853, President Antonio López de Santa Anna {{announced}} a competition {{to write a}} national anthem for Mexico. The competition offered a prize for the best poetic composition representing patriotic ideals. Francisco González Bocanegra, a talented poet, {{was not interested in}} participating in the competition. He argued that writing love poems involved very different skills from the ones required to write a national anthem. His fiancée, Guadalupe González del Pino (or Pili), had undaunted faith in her fiancé's poetic skills and was displeased with his constant refusal to participate in spite of her constant prodding and requests from their friends. Under false pretenses, she lured him to a secluded bedroom in her parents' house, locked him into the room, and refused to let him out until he produced an entry for the competition. Inside the room in which he was temporarily imprisoned were pictures depicting various events in Mexican history which helped to inspire his work. After four hours of fluent (albeit forced) inspiration, Francisco regained his freedom by slipping all ten verses of his creation under the <b>door.</b> <b>After</b> Francisco received approval from his fiancée and her father, he submitted the poem and won the competition by unanimous vote. González was announced the winner in the publication Official Journal of the Federation (DOF) on February 3, 1854.|$|E

25|$|Wynn's {{first major}} casino on the Las Vegas Strip was The Mirage, {{which opened in}} November 1989. It {{was the first time}} Wynn was {{involved}} with the design and construction of a casino, and he financed the $630 million project largely with high-yield bonds issued by Michael Milken. The resort's high cost and emphasis on luxury meant that it was considered high risk at the time, though the project ended up being enormously lucrative. The hotel, with its erupting volcano and South Seas theme, ignited a $12 billion building boom on the Strip. Its construction is also considered noteworthy in that Wynn had set a new standard for Vegas resorts, and when it opened The Mirage was the first casino to use security cameras full-time on all table games. Known for its entertainment, the hotel became the main venue for the Siegfried & Roy show in 1990, and in 1993 the hotel hosted the Cirque du Soleil show Nouvelle Expérience. Afterwards Wynn decided to invite Cirque to create Mystère for the soon-to-be-built Treasure Island resort next <b>door.</b> <b>After</b> Mirage, Wynn's next project Treasure Island Hotel and Casino opened in the Mirage's old parking lot in 1993, and overall cost $450 million. Intended to be family-friendly, pools in front of the casino enacted the Battle of Buccaneer Bay with two full-sized pirate ships, while the inside featured romantic tropical theming. The establishment was the home of the first permanent Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas, and the show went on to be voted nine times as the best production show in the city by the Las Vegas Review Journal reader's poll.|$|E
25|$|A feature {{not found}} in {{previous}} Souls games are Chalice Dungeons. Chalice Dungeons are randomly generated dungeons that vary in depth and difficulty, and can be reformed by performing a ritual with a Chalice and other certain materials in the Hunter's Dream. Chalice Dungeons are optional and provide additional content to the player. Gameplay {{is much the same}} as the main story in that it contains various areas and enemies that the player must overcome to complete the Dungeon. Each Chalice Dungeon contains multiple bosses that the player must defeat to progress through the Dungeon's levels. Special types of lootable chests that are {{not found in}} the main story are hidden throughout the Dungeons, providing the player with the materials to generate more Dungeons. One major difference between the main story and the Chalice Dungeons is the world design. In the main story world of Yharnam, the design is open ended, more spacious, and is a mixture of indoor and outdoor environments. Chalice Dungeons are only indoors, cramped, and contain many traits of a typical dungeon. The branching paths featured in the main story are still present in the Chalice Dungeons. Another important difference are the objectives. In the main story, players journey through many different locations with many different objectives. In the Chalice Dungeons, the player's basic objective is to locate a door, then find the lever to open the door, which is located elsewhere, and then battle the boss behind the <b>door.</b> <b>After</b> the boss is defeated, the player enters the next area, which will be completely different, and completes the same goal. The cycle repeats at least three times before the entire Chalice Dungeon is cleared. Chalice Dungeons, like the main story, can be played alone or cooperatively with other players.|$|E

500|$|It {{begins with}} Jackson in {{what seems to}} be a hotel, singing about his girlfriend. He is distressed because he found a silver card in with the name [...] "Alex" [...] on it. To him, it implies that [...] "Alex" [...] is another man who his girlfriend is with; thus, she is {{cheating}} on Jackson. However, as the story in the video unfolds, this is not true, because the girl takes on different identities (I.e. Eve, Diana, etc.) for her job as a high class call girl. [...] "Alex" [...] (which is also a girl's name), just happens to be one of them. The video alternates scenes from where Jackson is singing about his pain, to where the girl is being changed into her different identities and taking care of her jobs (mostly meeting with other men and even some women and sleeping with them). Towards the end of the video, Jackson has packed up his bags to leave town, because of his distress. A helicopter comes to pick him up from his house. The girl comes to Jackson's house and she asks his assistant (who knows the situation and aided Jackson in his departure) to let her in. It is likely she quit the job for him and wants to stay. The assistant shakes his head, implying that he left. When she asks why, he drops a flutter of silver nameplates (including the one that said [...] "Alex") from a slot in the <b>door.</b> <b>After</b> that scene, Jackson is seen sleeping and smoke floats out the side of the screen. Having lost her love and without any alternative, the girl turns to her callgirl existence again. Her employer slaps her in the face and she is then seen being prepared for a new identity.|$|E
500|$|The Altar and the Door {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews upon its release. Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave it four-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, saying it has a [...] "slightly greater dose of rock" [...] and [...] "Casting Crowns gave fans {{no reason to be}} disappointed on Alter [...] ". Deborah Evans-Price of CCM Magazine gave it four out of five stars, commenting that [...] "With this new set, [...] Hall and his companions again deliver songs that are musically engaging and lyrically insightful... Few acts more eloquently capture the complexities of being a Christian in today’s tumultuous world, but these fine folks continue to help light the path for the rest of us". Jennifer E. Jones of cbnmusic.com gave it four out of five spins, opining that [...] "There’s a reason why Casting Crowns {{is one of the best}} Christian bands out today, and that reason is evident when you listen to The Altar and The <b>Door.</b> <b>After</b> three albums, lead singer/songwriter Mark Hall still knows how to speak for those who cannot... The Altar and The Door leaves plenty of room for the sinners and the saints to come closer to Jesus". Mark Lawrence of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares, saying [...] "Traditionally album number three is a defining point in a band's legacy: some bands self implode and produce an album high on production sheen but low on song quality... other bands though go on to produce their masterpiece... The Altar and the Door leans closer to the masterpiece than the flop but leaves you with a sense that they have even greater things to come... The Altar And The Door' is clearly a Casting Crowns album in sound, content and style but this is far from being a negative thing and will appeal to both existing fans as well as draw in new ones". Brian Mansfield gave it two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that [...] " [...] concern themselves with the space between the title’s two fixtures– that is, between intention and action, between doing good and getting in the way, or, as one song puts it, between “the God we want and the God who is.” That’s a space worth exploring, and the band’s motives may be the best, but their anthems are as predictable as a televangelist’s tears: start soft, build big, then cue the strings".|$|E
