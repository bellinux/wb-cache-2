As such, the airline could {{from then on}} restructure itself into shareholding enterprises, independently arrange external financing and establish subsidiaries to complement its core enterprise. During the airline's early years, the carrier was the dominant domestic carrier. Together with the two major airlines of China– Air China and China Eastern– the airline handled half of passenger traffic carried by all Chinese carriers. Owing to Air China's status as the country's flag carrier, the airline is entitled to extensive international service rights, with China Eastern and China Southern's international networks confined to mainly East Asia and within Asia, respectively. Like other Chinese carriers, China Southern was subjected to CAAC's exclusive right to grant operating rights for every prospective route {{as well as to}} <b>regulate</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>prices.</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{increases}} in international {{oil prices have}} resulted in substantialfuel subsidies in many developing and emerging market economies. After {{a long period of}} stability over the last two decades, international oil prices increased substantially from 2002. Prices increased from around US$ 25 per barrel in January 2003 to over US$ 65 per barrel by August 2005, an increase of about 260 percent. Rising fuel subsidies reflect the fact that many countries <b>regulate</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>prices</b> and, especially in the face of sharp price increases, do not pass on higher world prices to domestic consumers. 1 These subsidies have adverse consequences both for government finances and the efficient use of energy. Large subsidies redirect public expenditures away from other valuable social expenditures or contribute to unsustainable budget deficits. Low energy prices fail to provide the appropriate incentive to households to be more efficient in their use of energy, which would help to mitigate the adverse effect of higher inter-national prices on households and the economy. In fact, given the relatively low price elasticity of energy demand and the negative consumption exter-nalities associated with its use, taxing energy consumption is generall...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} a two-period {{model of}} an investment decision in a network industry characterized by demand uncertainty, economies of scale and sunk costs. In the absence of regulation we identify the market conditions under which a monopolist decides to invest early {{as well as the}} underlying overall welfare output. In a regulated environment, we consider a monopolist who faces no downstream (final good) competition but is subject to retail price regulation. We identify the welfare-maximizing <b>regulated</b> <b>prices</b> when the unregulated market outcome is set as the benchmark. We show that if the regulator can commit to ex post regulation – that is, <b>regulated</b> <b>prices</b> that are contingent to future demand realization – then <b>regulated</b> <b>prices</b> that allow the firm to recover its total costs of production are welfare-maximizing. Thus, under ex post price regulation {{there is no need to}} compensate the regulated firm for the option to delay that it foregoes when investing today. We argue, however, that regulators cannot make this type of commitment and, therefore, price regulation is often ex ante – that is, <b>regulated</b> <b>prices</b> are not contingent to future demand. We show that the optimal ex ante regulation, and the extent to which <b>regulated</b> <b>prices</b> need to incorporate an option to delay, depend on the nature of demand uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the option of}} a <b>regulated</b> linear input <b>price</b> affects vertical contracting, where a monopolistic upstream supplier sequentially offers supply contracts to two symmetric downstream firms. We find that equilibrium contracts vary with production cost and <b>regulated</b> <b>price</b> level: If the <b>regulated</b> <b>price</b> is not too high, the option allows for price discrimination, but prevents foreclosure in the intermediary market. Indeed, if both cost and optional price are rather low, non-discriminatory input prices below cost may arise. Optional input prices are socially more desirable than a flat ban on price discrimination, as consumers benefit from more intense downstream competition. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} a regulated firm's {{choice of}} technology. It presents {{a model in}} which regulatory opportunism induces the firm to adopt a technology that gives rise to cost functions with higher variable costs and lower fixed costs than is socially optimal. This distortion arises because the <b>regulated</b> <b>price</b> is positively correlated with marginal costs. Consequently, a technology with low marginal costs implies a low <b>regulated</b> <b>price</b> and hence is unattractive to the firm. Debt financing is shown to alleviate this distortion because it induces regulators to increase the <b>regulated</b> <b>price</b> to prevent he firm from financial distress, thereby reducing {{the cost to the}} firm of adopting technologies with low marginal costs. When regulators restrict the firm's ability to issue debt, the firm may have an incentive to goldplate (i. e. waste resources). This incentive disappears when the firm can use its most preferred mode of financing...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} market is characterised by market {{power on the}} supply side, mainly due to the patent system, and price-inelastic demand because of substantial third-party payments and asymmetric information. As a consequence, most countries <b>regulate</b> <b>prices</b> of prescription drugs. When <b>regulating</b> <b>prices,</b> one has to trade-off low prices of the existing drugs against the incentive {{for research and development}} of new drugs. Price regulation of prescription drugs implies that the price-cost margins of distributors and pharmacies also will be regulated. This raises a concern for consumer access to pharmaceuticals as well as the quality of pharmacy services. In <b>regulating</b> <b>prices</b> of prescription drugs a health authority has to balance many concerns. This report discusses principles of price regulation of pharmaceuticals and regulation of price-cost margins of pharmacies.

This paper sheds light on how these two factors - the <b>regulated</b> <b>pricing</b> system and the loe rate of separation - contribute to hospital inefficiency. It further argues for a capitaion on government <b>regulated</b> reimbursement <b>prices</b> for prescription drugs in order to increase hospital production efficiency. The empirical results of this study not only show that the <b>regulated</b> <b>pricing</b> causes the baised allocation of resources,which contributes to inefficiency,and that the number {{of prescription}}s exceeding the optimal level,which results in the inefficiency of hospital production output,but also shows that overprecribing drugs increases the existing inefficiencles in hospitals. Simple price reduction {{of prescription drugs}} has little impact on discouraging physicians from over prescribing drugs due to the existing negative elasticity between treatment days and drug prices as well as between the relationship of units of service and drug <b>prices.</b> Futhermore,the <b>regulated</b> <b>pricing</b> system also contributes to inefficient human resource allocation in hospitals,pariculary pharmacist over employment,which in tum contributes to lower efficiency in general hospitals. As a means of comparative study,this paper highlights and evaluates the effectiveness of the capitation scheme in curbing medical expenditures with respect to prescription drug usage. This comparison shows that hospotals,which choose the capitation method,are less likely to emphasize pharmacists,physicians,and prescribing drugs,but are more likely to emphasize having more registered nurses,than hospitals with the cost-based fee-for-service scheme.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} a three-period {{model of}} an investment decision in a network industry characterized by demand uncertainty, economies of scale and sunk costs. In the absence of regulation we identify the market conditions under which a monopolist decides to invest early {{as well as the}} underlying overall welfare output. In a regulated environment, we first consider a monopolist facing no downstream competition but subject to a price cap on the downstream retail (final good) market. We identify the welfare-maximising <b>regulated</b> <b>prices</b> using the unregulated market output as a benchmark. In particular, we show that the optimal regulation depends on market conditions (that is, the nature of demand) and there are three possible outcomes: (i) price regulation does not improve welfare; (ii) <b>regulated</b> <b>prices</b> include an option to delay value and provide a positive payoff to the firm; and (iii) <b>regulated</b> <b>prices</b> yield a zero payoff to the firm. Second, we consider a vertically integrated network provider that is required to provide access to downstream competitors. We show that when the regulator has only one instrument, namely the access price, an option-to-delay pricing rule generates (weakly) higher welfare than the Efficient Component Pricing Rule (ECPR), except under very specific conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Several {{electricity}} companies, including Enemalta, face a <b>regulated</b> maximum consumer <b>price</b> on {{the electric}} units they produce and supply on the market. This <b>regulated</b> consumer <b>price</b> {{gives rise to}} financial losses for the electricity company because it causes a divergence between the unit cost and the consumer price of each unit of electricity demanded and supplied. Unexpected changes in temperature increase the demand for electricity at the <b>regulated</b> <b>price</b> and cause even larger financial losses for the electricity company. Similarly, unexpected increases in fuel oil costs increase the production cost per electric unit and also widen the financial losses for the electricity company. The long history in Malta of political regulation and social intervention in the electric-ity market, {{make it very difficult}} to transform the <b>regulated</b> consumer <b>price</b> into a market clearing equilibrium one. This paper argues that the only option for the electricity company is to use derivatives to insure away the financial losses brought about by unexpected temperature and fuel oil shocks...|$|R
