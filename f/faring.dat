5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Piłsudski became {{a leader of}} the Polish Socialist Party. Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won by force of arms, he created the Polish Legions. In 1914 he anticipated the outbreak of a European war, the Russian Empire's defeat by the Central Powers, and the Central Powers' defeat by the western powers. When World War I broke out, he and his Legions fought under Austrian army control against Russia. In 1917, with Russia <b>faring</b> badly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers and was arrested by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|In 1981 the Queen's Park Oval hosted England and saw West Indian {{victory by}} an innings, {{followed}} by a draw against India in 1982. The first One-Day International at the ground took place between India and the West Indies in March 1983, with the hosts taking a comfortable victory. Australia, New Zealand and England all visited the ground for Test and ODI games during 1985 and 1986, <b>faring</b> poorly. The decade ended with tours by Pakistan and India, mixed with matches from the now entitled Red Stripe Cup, the new name for the West Indian domestic first-class competition.|$|E
5|$|Letcher {{enrolled}} in Joshua Fry's private academy near Danville, Kentucky, <b>faring</b> better under Fry's instruction {{than he had}} in the common schools, and gained a sound education. Following his instruction at Fry's academy, he returned to his father's brickyard, where tradition holds that he helped build the state's first governor's mansion alongside future governor Thomas Metcalfe. He then read law in the office of Humphrey Marshall, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Lancaster, Kentucky. He briefly served as a judge advocate in Colonel John Allen's volunteer militia during the War of 1812.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fares</b> are rounded to {{the nearest}} $0.05 for single-ride <b>fares</b> and day passes and $1.00 for monthly passes, after <b>fare</b> {{multiples}} are applied.

50|$|The <b>fare</b> of MTR {{between any}} two {{particular}} stations is not calculated using a particular formula, {{and must be}} {{looked up from the}} <b>fare</b> table. <b>Fares</b> for the Airport Express Line are significantly higher. Services to checkpoint termini are also more expensive than ordinary <b>fares.</b> Adult <b>fares</b> range from HK$3.6 to $52.6 (US$0.46-6.74). Concessionary <b>fares</b> are usually half the adult <b>fare,</b> and range from HK$1.50 to $27.00. Student <b>fares</b> are the same as child and elderly <b>fare</b> on the urban lines, but are the same as the Adult <b>fares</b> for journeys to or from checkpoint termini, and range from HK$1.50 to $51.00.

5|$|Populations of Bengal and Sunda {{slow lorises}} are not <b>faring</b> well in zoos. Of the 29captive {{specimens}} in North American zoos in 2008, several are hybrids that cannot breed, while most are past their reproductive years. The last captive birth for these species in North America was in 2001 in San Diego. Pygmy slow lorises are doing better in North American zoos; {{from the late}} 1980s (when they were imported) to 2008, the population grew to 74 animals, with most of them born at the San Diego Zoo.|$|E
5|$|The Wrington Vale line {{closed in}} 1931, with traffic having dropped to only two trains per day with no Sunday service. In 1938 coal traffic {{to the gas}} works ended, though there was some through coal traffic along the Clevedon branch. The Cheddar line was not <b>faring</b> well either: the number of tickets sold along the line had {{decreased}} dramatically since the early 1900s, although {{there was still a}} significant flow of strawberries, milk and cheese to London. The railways were nationalised in 1948, with the GWR becoming the Western Region of British Railways, but this did not halt the decline. The line was closed to passengers in 1963, with the only traffic to serve a private siding near Cheddar, but this too closed in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Populations of slow loris species, {{such as the}} Bengal and Sunda slow loris, are not <b>faring</b> well in zoos. In 2011, the International Species Information System (ISIS) {{had only}} 11 and 53specimens (respectively) on file from {{reporting}} zoos worldwide. In North American zoos, for instance, several of the 29captive specimens in 2008 were hybrids that could not breed while most were past their reproductive years, and the last captive birth was in 2001 at the San Diego Zoo. Only three Javan slow lorises were kept in zoos in 2011 according to ISIS. Pygmy slow lorises are doing better, with 100specimens reported from zoos worldwide in 2011.

5|$|Their {{partnership}} {{continued with}} 2014's Bayonetta 2, which sparked controversy {{for being a}} Wii U exclusive when its predecessor is a multi-platform title. According to executive producer Atsushi Inaba, the company worked with Sega to create the game's sequel. It was later cancelled {{in the middle of}} the game's development until Nintendo offered to work with the company to revive it and fund the project. Sega only served as the game's advisor. Inaba added that Nintendo did not actively interfere with the game's development, and compared its role to that of an observer. Kamiya, who originally did not expect a sequel to the game, served as the game's supervisor. Replacing Kamiya as the game's director is Yusuke Hashimoto. Hashimoto focused on refining the original's combat, and extending the game's replay value. Bayonetta 2 received critical acclaim on its launch, with several gaming publications awarding the game a perfect score. Though Nintendo did not comment on the game's sales, the title sold only 38,828 copies in Japan in its first week of release, <b>faring</b> much worse than the original. It became the seventh best-selling retail game in the UK in its first week of release, but sales declined significantly in the second week.|$|E
5|$|This {{impacted}} amphibians {{in particular}} {{in a number of}} ways. The enormous drop in sealevel due to greater quantities of the world's water being locked into glaciers profoundly affected the distribution and size of the semiaquatic ecosystems which amphibians favored, and the significant cooling of the climate further narrowed the amount of new territory favorable to amphibians. Given that among the hallmarks of amphibians are an obligatory return to a body of water to lay eggs, a delicate skin prone to desiccation (thereby often requiring the amphibian to be relatively close to water throughout its life), and a reputation of being a bellwether species for disrupted ecosystems due to the resulting low resilience to ecological change, amphibians were particularly devastated, with the Labyrinthodonts among the groups <b>faring</b> worst. In contrast, reptiles - whose amniotic eggs have a membrane that enables gas exchange out of water, and which thereby can be laid on land - were better adapted to the new conditions. Reptiles invaded new niches at a faster rate and began diversifying their diets, becoming herbivorous and carnivorous, rather than feeding exclusively on insects and fish. Meanwhile, the severely impacted amphibians simply could not out-compete reptiles in mastering the new ecological niches, and so were obligated to pass the tetrapod evolutionary torch to the increasingly successful and swiftly radiating reptiles.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} of SDI {{was that it}} would not be effective against non-space <b>faring</b> weapons, namely cruise missiles, bombers, short-range ballistic missile submarines and non-conventional delivery methods. However, it was never intended to act as a defense against non-space <b>faring</b> weapons.|$|E

5000|$|Potential for {{a higher}} <b>fare</b> charge if a user forgets to touch off: the final cost of a trip, after which the user has not touched off (deliberately or accidentally), may be higher than the best <b>fare.</b> For {{regional}} town buses the default <b>fare</b> may {{be as much as}} a two-zone <b>fare.</b> The default <b>fare</b> for Melbourne Metropolitan Train trips is a '2 Hour Zone 1+2' <b>fare,</b> unless touching on a tram which results in a '2 Hour Zone 1' <b>fare.</b>|$|R
