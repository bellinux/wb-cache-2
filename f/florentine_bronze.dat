2500|$|In fact he {{had never}} {{abandoned}} it. The 1959 oil Francisco Carretero and A. López García Talking, like many portraits and townscapes of this period, is devoid of surrealistic devices. So are Autumn (1961) and The Sea (196170). Some of his relief sculptures conjure fantastic episodes, such as The Apparition (1963), in which a child hovers mid-air against a wall, gliding toward an open door. There are many affinities with the Tuscan Renaissance in his work in three dimensions. The ethereal Head of Carmencita (196568), for example, might at first glance be taken for a quattrocento <b>Florentine</b> <b>bronze</b> by Desiderio da Settignano.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Florentine</b> <b>bronze</b> is {{a modern}} term for an alloy usually formed as a mixture of {{aluminium}} or tin (<10%) and copper (>90%). Currently no chemical formula for <b>Florentine</b> <b>bronze</b> has been made as it is an alloy which is not standardised (in proportions) worldwide. [...] "Florentine bronze" [...] bears {{no relation to the}} 16th century bronze reductions of full-scale sculptures that were made in Florence after models by Giambologna and other Mannerist sculptors, to satisfy a collectors' market.|$|E

The obverse centre medallion bears the relief image of the French Republic {{in the form of}} the bust of a young woman wearing a Phrygian cap surrounded by the circular relief inscription RÉPUBLIQUE FRANCAISE (FRENCH REPUBLIC). Not knowing how long the war would last, the reverse centre medallion bears the dates 1914-1915, 1914-1916, 1914-1917 and finally 1914-1918.|$|E

50|$|The {{portrait}} {{art of the}} Renaissance {{is represented}} by medals, miniatures, paintings and full plastic sculptures. Many items come from the art chamber of the Wittelsbach family. From the possession of the Wittelsbach the Bavarian National Museum also presents unique Baroque objects from all areas of craft and artistic production, such as stentatious furniture, jewelery, weapons, musical instruments, watches, glasses, miniatures, ivories and bronzes. Of importance are especially <b>Florentine</b> <b>bronzes</b> {{from the collection of}} the Medici and pastel paintings from Venice includings works of Rosalba Carriera. The Bavarian National Museum has the most important collection of the Bavarian Rococo sculpture. A rich collection of architectural models and designs for frescoes and altarpieces documents the new buildings and conversions of churches in the competition of the various monasteries and convents. A unique court ensembles are the silverware of the Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim and the service and figurative centrepieces of Nymphenburg and Meissen porcelain manufacturers.

5000|$|During {{this period}} Antonio López shows an {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} representation of objects, independent of their contained narrative load. Magic Realism continued to inform his work through the mid-1960s, but gradually, as he said, [...] "the physical world gained more prestige in my eyes."In fact he had never abandoned it. The 1959 oil Francisco Carretero and A. López García Talking, like many portraits and townscapes of this period, is devoid of surrealistic devices. So are Autumn (1961) and The Sea (1961 - 70). Some of his relief sculptures conjure fantastic episodes, such as The Apparition (1963), in which a child hovers mid-air against a wall, gliding toward an open door. There are many affinities with the Tuscan Renaissance in his work in three dimensions. The ethereal Head of Carmencita (1965 - 68), for example, might at first glance be taken for a quattrocento <b>Florentine</b> <b>bronze</b> by Desiderio da Settignano. García's painting also reverberates with {{the art of the}} past. The Grapevine (1960) evokes Tiepolo's sunlight, The Quince Tree (1962) Chardin's dusky murk, and other paintings echo Old Masters from Dürer to Degas.|$|E
50|$|The Obelisks of the Corsa dei Cocchi, or Aguglie di Piazza Santa Maria Novella are two 16th-century, four-sided, marble obelisk monuments {{located in}} the Piazza of Santa Maria Novella, Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy.The obelisks {{replaced}} two pyramidal wooden structures used to mark {{the margins of the}} track used in a festival race, Palio dei Cocchi, held the day before the day of San Giovanni. The present obelisks were designed in 1570 by Bartolomeo Ammannati, {{with the help of the}} stonemasons Raffaello and Giovanni Maria Carli. The idea for the four turtles, upon which the marble obelisks perch, has more recently been attributed to Giambologna or his pupil, Pietro Tacca. The obelisks were transported from the quarries to Florence in 1572. They were finally erected in 1608 to celebrate the marriage of the Grand Duke Cosimo II to Maria Maddalena of Austria. In the early 1790s, the obelisk underwent refurbishment, adding the <b>bronze</b> <b>Florentine</b> Fleur-de-lis or lily symbol, the giglio, on the top and adding the polished breccia marble plaques to the base. The current plates are made of red Levanto marble.|$|R
