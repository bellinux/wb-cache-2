The faint {{outline of}} the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and, in emigration, from Brooklyn to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|As Brezhnev {{replaced}} Khrushchev {{as the new}} General Secretary of the Communist Party, he held ultimate {{political authority}} {{as the leader of}} the Soviet Union. However, he shared collective leadership with Nikolai Podgorny (the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and nominal head of state) and Alexsei Kosygin, the Premier. Brezhnev soon would maximize his grip on power and would be the dominating authority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> leadership.|$|E
5|$|Manuel was {{prevented}} from following up his early successes in the east, for events {{to the west}} meant that his presence was urgently required in the Balkans. In 1147 he granted a passage through his dominions to two armies of the Second Crusade under Conrad III of Germany and Louis VII of France. At this time, there were still members of the Byzantine court who remembered {{the passage of the}} First Crusade, a defining event <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> memory of the age that had fascinated Manuel's aunt, Anna Komnene.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{rebellion}} did not itself achieve lasting success, {{it is commonly}} cited as a watershed moment in Nyasaland history. The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> national consciousness, has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.|$|E
5|$|For {{the events}} {{surrounding}} 572, the most exhaustive source available is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, {{a history of the}} Lombard nation up to 744. The book was finished {{in the last two decades}} of the 8th century, after the Lombard Kingdom had been conquered by the Franks in 774. Because of the apparent presence in the work of many fragments preserved from Lombard oral tradition, Paul's work has been often interpreted as a tribute to a vanishing culture. Among these otherwise lost traditions stands the tale of Alboin's death. According to Herwig Wolfram, what Paul deals with is an example of how nationally vital events were personalized to make them easier to preserve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> memory. Even later than the Historia Langobardorum, but possibly using earlier lost sources, are the last two primary sources to speak about Helmichis: the anonymous Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani and the Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis written by Andreas Agnellus. The first is a brief Christianizing version of the Origo that was made in the first decade of the 9th century from a Carolingian point of view. The second was written in the 830s by a priest from Ravenna and is a history of the bishops who held the see of Ravenna through the ages. Agnellus' passage on Alboin and Rosamund is mostly derived from Paul and little else.|$|E
25|$|Although Srivijaya left few archaeological {{remains and}} was almost {{forgotten}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> {{memory of the}} Malay people, the rediscovery of this ancient maritime empire by Cœdès in the 1920s raised {{the notion that it}} was possible for a widespread political entity to have thrived in Southeast Asia in the past.|$|E
50|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>Collective's</b> early plays were {{developed}} out of loose improvisations {{based on the}} members' life experiences, including the early play Bellywoman Bangarang, about pregnancy. However, as <b>the</b> <b>Collective</b> developed, they began incorporating more outside sources, including archival material and interviews with women who had experienced the situations being dramatized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plays. However, improvisation remains an important element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Collective's</b> production process, allowing an organic and democratic development of material.|$|R

25|$|Some early {{evidence}} suggests that comprehensive campaigns build strong unions. Weakened employers are unable to counter newly built unions, providing union leaders and members with a much less steep learning curve. Some scholars also find that union members involved in comprehensive campaigns are more active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining process and in the life {{and culture of the}} new union.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of burials in the Mehrgarh site.

25|$|No one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> was {{experienced}} with explosives. Terry Robbins and Cathy Wilkerson lacked knowledge {{even in the}} basics of electricity. Members worked up a simple circuit without safety features, consisting of a battery, a fuse, a clock, and wires connecting these elements. They inserted dynamite into a one-foot length of water pipe packed with nails. Precisely what went wrong remains uncertain, but the resulting series of blasts in the sub-basement of the townhouse killed those near the bomb and caused {{the collapse of the}} townhouse.|$|E

25|$|On 25 June 2015, {{following}} the Supreme Court's ruling striking down district same-sex marriage bans, the Civil Registry of Guerrero {{announced that they}} had planned a collective same-sex marriage ceremony for 10 July 2015 and indicated that {{there would have to}} be a change to the law to allow gender-neutral marriage, passed through the state Legislature before the official commencement.

25|$|However, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, {{operator}} of the Metrodome, won an injunction requiring the Twins to play there in 2002.

By that time, the Expos had become the Washington Nationals and the Twins had made sufficient progress towards the eventual building of a new baseball-specific stadium that contraction was no longer on the agenda.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of revolutionism {{went beyond the}} recognition of the reforms made during Atatürk's lifetime. Atatürk's revolutions in the social and political life are accepted as irreversible. Atatürk never entertained the possibility of a pause or transition phase {{during the course of the}} progressive unfolding or implementation of the revolution. The current understanding of this concept can be described that active modification. Turkey and its society, taking over institutions from Western Europe, must add Turkish traits and patterns to them and adapt them to the Turkish culture, according to Kemalism. The making of the Turkish traits and patterns of these reforms takes generations of cultural and social experience (which results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> memory of the Turkish nation).|$|E

25|$|The Navy Cross is {{presented}} to Harry Brinkley Bass, Lieutenant (j.g.), U.S. Navy, for extraordinary heroism and conspicuous devotion to duty as pilot of a dive bomber in action against Japanese forces in the Coral Sea on May 7, 1942. In the face of heavy anti-aircraft fire and fierce fighter opposition, he dived his plane at an enemy Japanese aircraft carrier and released his bomb with calm and accuracy. By grim determination and expert appraisal of his objective, he contributed materially to the high percentage of hits inflicted by his particular squadron and assisted in ultimate destruction of the enemy carrier. His individual action was an important factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> success of those United States Naval forces which engaged in the enemy in the Battle of the Coral Sea.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ouster}} of Ranković in 1966, the agenda of pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia, {{especially}} from Slovenia and Croatia, succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a Muslim Yugoslav nationality. As {{a result of these}} reforms, there was a massive overhaul of Kosovo's nomenklatura and police, that shifted from being Serb-dominated to ethnic Albanian-dominated through firing Serbs in large scale. Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the University of Pristina as an Albanian language institution. These changes created widespread fear among Serbs that they were being made second-class citizens in Yugoslavia. By the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia, Kosovo was granted major autonomy, allowing it to have its own administration, assembly, and judiciary; as well as having a membership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> presidency and the Yugoslav parliament, in which it held veto power.|$|E
