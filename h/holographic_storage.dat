Next, we consider holographic materials characteristics for digital data storage, followed by a discussion on photorefractive media, fixing techniques, and noise in photovoltaic and other media with a local response. Subsequently, we discuss photopolymer materials, fol-lowed by a discussion on system tradeoffs and a section on signal processing and en/decoding techniques, succeeded by a discussion on electronic implementations for control, signal encoding, and re-covery. We proceed further by presenting significant demonstrations of digital holographic systems.
