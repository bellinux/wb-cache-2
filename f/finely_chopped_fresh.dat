One egg and 100–150mL of yogurt are {{combined}} in a deep cup and mixed until smooth. This gets stirred slowly into the soup after the pot is removed from heat to prevent curdling. <b>Finely</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>chopped</b> parsley is often added before serving.|$|R

To spice up the taste, depending on one's preference, a mixture of soy sauce, kalamansi juice and crushed fresh red chili peppers can be added to the dish as a condiment. The same soy sauce mixture can also be used as a dipping sauce for the meatballs, Other lomi patrons request a small amount of <b>finely</b> <b>chopped</b> <b>fresh</b> red onions to be eaten with the dish for extra pungency.|$|E
50|$|A popular seafood {{speciality}} is the 'poisson complet' or {{the whole}} fish. The entire fish, excluding internal organs, is prepared and fire-grilled, {{but it can}} also be fried, grilled or sautéed. It is accompanied with potato chips and either mild or spicy tastira. The peppers are grilled with a little tomato, a lot of onion and a little garlic, all of which is finely chopped and served with an egg poached or sunny side up. <b>Finely</b> <b>chopped</b> <b>fresh</b> parsley is sprinkled on top; a drizzle of lemon juice and a pinch of sea salt complete the recipe.|$|E

5000|$|Julia Child also echoes Escoffier: [...] "A {{mixture of}} fresh parsley, chives, tarragon, and chervil is called fines herbes," [...] while Alan Davidson, author of The Oxford Companion to Food, {{identifies}} <b>chopped</b> <b>fresh</b> parsley as the minimalist {{basis of the}} fines herbes mix, {{with the addition of}} [...] "any (or all) of: chervil, tarragon, chives," [...] noting that the number of different herbs to be used is far from fixed. Food scientist Harold McGee's definition, on the other hand, limits the number of fines herbes to tarragon, chervil, chive, and omits parsley altogether. McGee also recommends that the herbs be <b>finely</b> <b>chopped</b> using a sharp knife rather than a food processor, [...] "since food processors slice into herbs and introduce a lot of air and therefore aroma-altering oxygen." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ros omelette, {{also known}} as ras omelette, is a snack and street food in Goan cuisine. Ros means [...] "gravy" [...] in Konkani. It is a spicy gravy of either chicken or chickpeas, which is often similar to xacuti which is {{commonly}} seen in the Goan Catholic style of cooking. If {{it is not a}} xacuti then it is probably a spicy gravy consisting of onions, curry leaves, black mustard seeds, scraped coconut and spices mostly prepared by Goan Hindus. Ingredients such as mushrooms or cauliflower are also commonly used. The omelette contains eggs, herbs, finely chopped green chili peppers, onions (or shallots), <b>finely</b> <b>chopped</b> <b>fresh</b> green coriander and salt, with many variations. The ros is cooked separately. The hot ros is poured over the freshly fried omelette and served with Goan bread.|$|E
50|$|Once the eel {{has been}} gutted and {{its head and}} skin removed, two inch long {{cuttings}} are simmered {{with a mix of}} <b>finely</b> <b>chopped</b> <b>fresh</b> herbs. These may typically be a selection of sage, ginger mint, oregano, sorrel, lemon balm (citronella), chervil, thyme, citrus thyme, savory, parsley, stinging nettle, spearmint, burnet, watercress, dragon's-wort, chives, and basil. Finely chopped shallot, cornflour, a little butter and salt are added. The stew is done as soon as the white flesh could easily be separated from the bone but still stays on when stirred gently; the amount of starch should allow the sauce on a plate after a minute to be a thickly flowing liquid. According to personal preference, a brighter green colour can be achieved by including spinach, though other aficionados reject this. Variations with beer or wine, lemon juice, egg yolk, or even with chicken broth do occur.|$|E
30|$|Measurements of {{chlorophyll}} a fluorescence {{were made}} on fully expanded youngest leaves of three different plants in each plot after 14 [*]days of submergence only during the year 2010. The measurement of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence was carried out using a Plant Efficiency Analyzer, Handy PEA (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, UK) and data were recorded from 10 [*]μs up to 1 [*]s with a data acquisition of every 10 [*]μs for the first 300 [*]μs, then every 100 [*]μs up to 3 [*]ms and later every 1 [*]ms. The signal resolution was 12 bits (0 – 4000). For each cultivar, the Chl a fluorescence transients of 9 individual leaves were measured. Leaves were maintained in darkness for 30 [*]min before taking the data on Chl fluorescence. The maximal intensity of the light source, providing an irradiance saturating pulse of 3000 [*]μmol (photons) / m 2 / s) was used. From the fast O-J-I-P transients, several bio-energetic parameters were derived according to the equations of the JIP-test using the program BIOLYSER (R.M. Rodriguez, Bioenergetic Laboratory, University of Geneva). Different chlorophyll fluorescence parameters like minimal fluorescence (Fo), maximal fluorescence (Fm), variable fluorescence (Fv[*]=[*]Fm - Fo), maximal quantum yield of PS II (PSII) photochemistry (Fv/Fm), electron transport per unit cross area of leaves (ETo/CS) and overall performance index (PI) of PSII were calculated using the software. After measuring the Chl fluorescence characteristics, the same leaves {{were used for the}} measurement of chlorophyll content, which comprised both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. One hundred milligrams of <b>finely</b> <b>chopped</b> <b>fresh</b> leaves were placed in a capped measuring tube containing 25 [*]mL of 80 % acetone, and placed inside a refrigerator (4 °C) for 48 [*]h. The chlorophyll was measured spectrophotometrically (UV–VIS spectrophotometer, model SL 164, Elico India Ltd., Hyderabad) following Porra ([2002]). Normalized data (values at 14 [*]days of submergence/values of corresponding control plants) on chlorophyll and different chlorophyll fluorescence parameters are presented.|$|E
