40|$|The {{available}} {{empirical evidence}} on the wage <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> jobs through informal contacts is mixed. This paper provides a simple theory where, depending on the efficiency of formal search methods, the use of personal contacts can lead either to a wage premium or to a wage penalty. New empirical evidence shows that, in fact, across {{the countries of the}} European Union, premiums and penalties to finding jobs through personal contacts are equally frequent and of about the same size. Furthermore, much of this cross-country vari- ation appears to be correlated with measures of the efficiency of formal search channels. In particular, the wage <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> jobs through personal contacts is higher in countries with more labor market intermediaries. Differences-in-differences estimates based on the Italian liberalization of the labor recruitment industry confirm this result...|$|R

Therefore, we limited the analyses to those observations for whom we did not observe an announcement before (Appendix A 5). The results are qualitatively robust with <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> similar sizes. Not surprisingly, the job search effects for the sample without previous announcement are slightly larger than for the sample which includes individuals that have received an announcement before. The positive effect on the likelihood of receiving welfare benefits become significant for the total sample, for West Germans and for people who have not been employed for 4  years or more or have never been employed.

40|$|Most {{commonly}} used inductive rule learning algorithms employ a hill-climbing search, whereas local pattern discovery algorithms employ exhaustive search. In this paper, we evaluate {{the spectrum of}} different search strategies to see whether separate-and-conquer rule learning algorithms are able to gain performance in terms of predictive accuracy or theory size by using more powerful search strategies like beam search or exhaustive search. Unlike previous results that demonstrated that rule learning algorithms suffer from over-searching, our work pays {{particular attention to the}} interaction between the search heuristic and the search strategy. Our results show that exhaustive search has primarily the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> longer, but nevertheless more general rules than hill-climbing search. Thus, in cases where hillclimbing finds too specific rules, exhaustive search may help, while in others it may lead to over-generalization. ...|$|R

We focus on how individual labour market changes and marriage formation influence their decision to leave. Our model allows for correlated unobserved heterogeneity across the migration, the labour market and the marriage formation processes. The large size of the data permits us to stratify the analysis by five groups based on the country of birth. The empirical analyses reveal that when students become unemployed they leave faster. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a job on return is more ambiguous. For students from developed (including EU) countries it hardly affects their return, while students from less developed countries and Antilles/Surinam {{are more prone to}} leave after finding a job.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> work {{by one of}} the {{household}} members on the probability of escaping from poverty in the Netherlands. For households with non-active heads, finding work by the head of the household is the most important (investigated) event connected with exiting poverty, nearly a third of all poverty endings. However, finding a job by the head of the household does not guarantee one leaving poverty. In practice, the success rate yields 25 percent. A multivariate analysis shows that finding a job by the head of the household increases the chance of leaving poverty with 22 percent points. So, some exits from poverty are a result of other factors or are due to selectivity of the job-finders. This difference is much larger when partners or (adult) children find jobs.

40|$|The {{connection}} between work environment and organizational commitment (OC) is investigated and compared across six western countries, {{using data from}} the 1997 International Social Survey Program (ISSP). Differences in work environment are examined on two levels: (1) with reference to theoretical literature and empirical findings in comparative research and (2) with reference to how individuals perceive their workplace situation in relation to their personal evaluations of different workplace features (person–environment fit). Although no {{connection between}} work environment and OC is found when countries are compared on the basis of literature on the differences in the organization of production, the connection proves to be salient with respect to individual and group levels. The result suggests that the most important factor for OC in all countries is a job that the individual finds interesting. A control for job satisfaction makes it clear that the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> the work interesting is independent of satisfaction with work. Other similarities and differences between the countries are also identified and discussed. New avenues for further comparative research are suggested...|$|R

The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> synchronous colorectal liver metastases on the performance of the surgeon whilst operating on primary colorectal cancer. Methods: patients with completed colorectal cancer data who underwent liver resection for colorectal metastases between 1993 and 2001 were included. Two hundred seventy patients were categorised according to the site of the primary tumour (colon or rectum) and knowledge of the presence of liver metastases by the colorectal surgeon (SA = surgeon aware, n = 112, SNA = surgeon not aware, n = 158). The number of retrieved lymph nodes and colorectal resection margin involvement were used as surgical performance indicators. Survival and local recurrence rate were monitored. Results: the SA group had a higher rate of colorectal circumferential resection margin involvement, the local and intra-abdominal recurrence rate was also significantly higher in this group (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: awareness of the presence of liver metastases by the operating surgeon is an independent predictor of intra abdominal extra hepatic recurrence of colorectal cancer following potentially curative hepatic resection. This is related to an increased rate of primary colorectal resection margin involvemen...|$|R
