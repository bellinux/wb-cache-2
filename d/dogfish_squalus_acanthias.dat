5|$|The {{black dogfish}} forms shoals or schools {{that tend to}} be larger during the winter and spring.

The lipid-filled liver comprises about one-fifth of its total weight and functions in maintaining neutral buoyancy. Potential predators of the black dogfish are larger sharks and bony fishes. It {{is one of several}} deep-sea sharks parasitized by the barnacle Anelasma squalicola, which attaches in front of the second dorsal fin and impairs the reproductive development of its host.

5|$|From birth, leopard sharks form large schools {{generally}} segregated {{by age and}} sex, {{which may}} intermingle with grey or brown smoothhounds (Mustelus californicus and M. henlei) or spiny <b>dogfish</b> (<b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias).</b> These schools are apparently nomadic, often appearing suddenly in an area {{for a few hours}} and then vanishing just as quickly. In captivity, larger sharks have been observed establishing their dominance over smaller individuals via light nips to the pectoral fins. During summer days, large aggregations of mature females assemble in shallow bays and estuaries, dispersing at night. As these females follow the warmest patches of water, allowing them to raise their internal body temperatures by up to 3°C (5.4°F), they are speculated to be taking advantage of the heat to speed their growth and that of their gestating young. The membership of these aggregations is inconstant, with individual females periodically switching between different sites scattered over several kilometers.|$|E

40|$|In marine elasmobranch fishes, renal tubular urea {{reabsorption}} is, in part, {{responsible for}} the maintenance of a high plasma urea concentration. Furthermore, the regulation of tubular urea reabsorption is important in the renal response of euryhaline elasmobranchs to changes in environmental salinity. The mechanisms by which tubular urea reabsorption is regulated in the elasmobranch kidney have yet to be elucidated, but both passive and active mechanisms have been proposed.

Reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification using specific primers in two teleost fish, winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), reveals a similar pattern of CaR tissue expression. Exposure of the lumen of winter flounder urinary bladder to the CaR agonists, Gd 3 + and neomycin, reversibly inhibit volume transport, which is important for euryhaline teleost survival in seawater. Within 24 - 72 hr after transfer of freshwater-adapted Atlantic salmon to seawater, there are increases in their plasma Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Na+ that likely serve as a signal for internal CaRs, i. e., brain, to sense alterations in salinity in the surrounding water.
