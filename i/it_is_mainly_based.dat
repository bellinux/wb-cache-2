5|$|Laurence died on 2February 619, and {{was buried}} in the abbey of St Peter and Paul in Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's; his relics, or remains, were moved, or translated, to the new church of St Augustine's in 1091. His shrine was in the axial chapel of the abbey church, {{flanking}} the shrine of Augustine, his predecessor. Laurence came to be regarded as a saint, and was given the feast day of 3February. The ninth century Stowe Missal commemorates his feast day, along with Mellitus and Justus. A Vita (or Life) was written about the time of his translation, by Goscelin, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>based</b> on information in Bede. His tomb was opened in 1915. Besides his feast day, the date of his translation, 13September, was also celebrated after his death. Laurence's tenure as archbishop is mainly remembered for his failure to secure a settlement with the Celtic church, and for his reconversion of Eadbald following Æthelbert's death. He was succeeded as archbishop by Mellitus, the Bishop of London.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{doctoral}} thesis Über eine Klasse von Matrizen, die sich einer gegebenen Matrix zuordnen lassen Issai Schur determined the polynomial {{representations of the}} general linear group [...] on the field [...] of complex numbers. The results and methods of this work are still relevant today. In his book, J.A. Green determined the polynomial representations of [...] over infinite fields [...] with arbitrary characteristic. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>based</b> on Schur's dissertation. Green writes, [...] "This remarkable work (of Schur) contained many very original ideas, developed with superb algebraic skill. Schur showed that these (polynomial) representations are completely reducible, that each one is [...] "homogeneous" [...] of some degree , and that es equivalence types of irreducible polynomial representations of , of fixed homogeneous degree , are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions [...] of [...] into not more than [...] parts. Moreover, Schur showed that the character of an irreducible representation of type [...] is given by a certain symmetric function [...] in [...] variables, since described as a Schur function. According to Green, the methods of Schur's dissertation today are important for the theory of algebraic groups.|$|E
