50|$|From the 16th century, the {{incumbency}} of prelates of this see was, as a rule, {{of short}} duration, {{because most of}} the cardinal-bishops preferred the See of Ostia and Velletri, which they <b>exchanged</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own as soon as possible.|$|R

Citizens fled the town, while the Uskoci retreated {{to the city of}} Senj, where they continued fighting the Ottoman army. Klis became an administrative centre or sanjak (Kilis Sancağı) of the Bosnia Eyalet, and would remain so for a century.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{thought the}} land grants given to {{expanding}} railroads was an unjust practice. He also opposed some monopolistic practices by corporations, {{as well as}} the power sought by workers' unions. Garfield supported the proposed establishment of the United States civil service as a means of ridding officials of the annoyance of aggressive office seekers. He especially wished to eliminate the common practice whereby government workers, in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> positions, were forced to kick back a percentage of their wages as political contributions.|$|E

5|$|Labor {{was always}} in short supply. The most common {{solution}} was indentured servitude of young whites. These were teenagers in Britain or Germany whose parents arranged for them to work for families in the colonies until age 21, in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> ocean passage. The great majority became farmers or farm wives. By the mid-eighteenth century, African American slaves comprised 12% {{of the population of}} New York. Most were house servants in Manhattan, or farmworkers on Dutch estates.|$|E

5|$|The {{independent}} Democratic Republic of Georgia was {{invaded by}} the Red Army in 1921 and a Soviet government was installed. The government of Soviet Georgia created an autonomous administrative unit for Transcaucasian Ossetians in April 1922, called the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast. Historians such as Stephen F. Jones, Emil Souleimanov and Arsène Saparov {{believe that the}} Bolsheviks granted this autonomy to the Ossetians in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> help in fighting the Democratic Republic of Georgia, since this area {{had never been a}} separate entity prior to the Russian invasion.|$|E

5|$|This period saw a {{political}} alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures {{stemming from the}} 1973 oil crisis, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and {{a sharp decline in}} living standards, and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> bailout of the nation's broken economy.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} La Familia Michoacana, Moreno González {{was in charge}} of forging alliances with other cartels. Reportedly, Moreno González met with several other {{high-ranking}} drug lords, including Fernando Sánchez Arellano of the Tijuana Cartel; Juan José Esparragoza Moreno of the Sinaloa Cartel; and Ezequiel Cárdenas Guillén of the Gulf Cartel. In these agreements, the cartels allowed La Familia Michoacana to move drugs freely in their territories in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> support in fighting off rival gangs like Los Zetas. In 2008, Moreno González agreed to send armed men to help Joaquín Guzmán Loera and Ismael Zambada García fight off rival cartels, a favor which granted him access to the drug corridors in Sinaloa and Sonora. In addition, his friendship with the Gulf Cartel leader Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez allowed him access to the northeastern state of Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Philip {{engaged in a}} flurry of {{diplomatic}} activity. He bribed Berisades, son of the Thracian king Cotys, to withdraw Thracian support for Pausanias, and thereby prevented the Thracian invasion. Similarly, he bought off the Paionians with gifts in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> withdrawal from Macedon. Philip may also have concluded a treaty with the victorious Dardanian king Bardylis, possibly surrendering large parts of Macedon in exchange for peace. Although no evidence remains of such a treaty, the fact that Illyrians did not follow up their victory despite Macedon's weakness is suggestive that some agreement was reached. Philip also married Bardylis's daughter (or niece), which may have formed part of the treaty. At any rate, Philip's diplomacy gave Macedon some breathing space and time for recovery.|$|E

5000|$|Marx critiqued Smith and Ricardo for {{not realizing}} that their {{economic}} concepts reflected specifically capitalist institutions, not innate natural properties of human society, {{and could not be}} applied unchanged to all societies. He proposed a systematic correlation between labour-values and money prices. He claimed that the source of profits under capitalism is value added by workers not paid out in wages. This mechanism operated through the distinction between [...] "labour power", which workers freely <b>exchanged</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> wages, and [...] "labour", over which asset-holding capitalists thereby gained control.|$|R

5|$|Brulé was {{selected}} first {{overall in the}} 2002 WHL Bantam Draft by the Vancouver Giants. The selection was originally possessed by the Prince Albert Raiders, but was dealt to the Giants in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> third overall and third round selections. He debuted in one game with the Giants during the subsequent WHL season, while playing Junior A in the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL) with the Quesnel Millionaires. Recording 57points (32goals and 25assists) over 48games in his lone BCHL season, he was named the Interior Conference's recipient of the Bruce Allison Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year.|$|E
5|$|Béla, who {{had been}} Andrew's heir before Solomon's coronation, left for Poland in 1059; his sons {{accompanied}} him. They returned with Polish reinforcements and began a rebellion against Andrew. After defeating Andrew, Béla was crowned king on 6 December 1060. Solomon left the country, taking refuge in the Holy Roman Empire. Béla I died on 11 September 1063, some time before German troops entered Hungary in order to restore Solomon. Ladislaus and his brothers, Géza and Lampert, went back to Poland, and Solomon was once again crowned king in Székesfehérvár. The three brothers returned when the Germans left Hungary. To avoid another civil war, the brothers signed a treaty with Solomon on 20 January 1064, acknowledging Solomon's reign in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> father's duchy.|$|E
5|$|Following the Plitvice Lakes {{incident}} of 1 April 1991, SAO Krajina forces captured three Croatian policemen from nearby Drniš, {{with the intention}} of exchanging them for Croatian Serb troops taken prisoner by the Croatian forces at the Plitvice Lakes. In turn, the militia established by the residents of Kijevo captured several Serb civilians and demanded that the captured policemen be released in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> prisoners. On 2 April, JNA intelligence officers reported on this, and warned how local militias in Kijevo and Civljane, otherwise separated by barricades, were engaged in armed skirmishes that threatened to escalate. Kijevo became strategically significant because its location hindered SAO Krajina road communications.|$|E

After initially objecting, Mulder agrees to let Skinner turn the tape over. Skinner heads to see Melissa in the hospital and is told by Albert of the mysterious blue-suited man outside. Skinner chases the man to a stairwell where he is attacked by Alex Krycek and Luis Cardinal, who beat him unconscious and steal the tape.|$|E
5|$|In 1274 Pope Gregory X convened the Second Council of Lyon. Abaqa sent a {{delegation}} of 13 to 16 Mongols to the Council, which created a great stir, particularly when three of their members underwent a public baptism. Abaqa's Latin secretary Rychaldus delivered {{a report to the}} Council which outlined previous European-Ilkhanid relations under Abaqa's father, Hulagu, affirming that after Hulagu had welcomed Christian ambassadors to his court, he had agreed to exempt Latin Christians from taxes and charges, in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> prayers for the Khan. According to Rychaldus, Hulagu had also prohibited the molestation of Frank establishments, and had committed to return Jerusalem to the Franks. Rychaldus assured the assembly that even after Hulagu's death, his son Abaqa was still determined to drive the Mamluks from Syria.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 16th century, {{during the reign}} of Stefan Batory (1576–1586), a peasant-based levy formation, piechota wybranicka (lit. drafted or {{selected}} infantry, also known as piechota łanowa, lit. acreage infantry) was formed. It was based on peasants from the royal estates only, who received a unit of land (łan) in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> service. The formation numbered about 2,300 and after early disappointments was never seen as of much military value. It supplemented the few small units of haiduk infantry, which saw service in Poland primarily around late 16th and 17th centuries. In 1655 a new infantry unit was created, the żołnierz dymowy (or żołnierz łanowy– lit. chimney or łan soldier, named again after the type of tax applied). It required all lands, no matter whether owned by king, nobles or the Church, to provide peasant recruits, and applied a similar requirement to towns.|$|E

This speech act occurs in various language transactions in Japanese, in both formal and informal contexts, and this paper attempts to analyse and comment on some authentic <b>exchanges</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> semantic and pragmatic implications, with follow-up comments on implications for teachers and learners of the Japanese language...|$|R
