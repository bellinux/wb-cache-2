40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of fabric {{manipulation}} on performance of unidirectional non-crimp fiber reinforced polymer composites. Conventionally hand layup process is being followed in wind turbine manufacturing industries which is a time consuming process. To overcome the long man labor, automatic layup method {{could be used to}} make the process faster. Before implementing the automatic layup process in industries, it is essential to study how in-plane wave caused by shifting is going to affect the properties of the fabric and thus predict the life of the <b>fabric.</b> <b>Fatigue</b> and compressive tests were conducted on the fabric to study the behavior of the fabric in actual wind turbine manufacturing applications. Samples were made by stacking four layers of fabric one over each other with a definite shift angles and then followed by resin infusion and then cut the coupons for testing. Stacking of in-plane wave samples over each other resulted in formation of out of plane waviness. Eight coupons per shift angles of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 degree were cut out for tests. Compression loading and compression fatigue testing was performed on the samples to characterize the properties. The maximum strength level concentration acted on the point of grip on the fabric sample. The result from the experimental tests support and help explain the impact of shifting on the unidirectional fiber reinforced polymer composites and used to establish the manufacturing defects in the unidirectional fabric from shifting process...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} damage {{development}} of a glass/epoxy non-crimp 3 D orthogonal woven <b>fabric</b> composite during <b>fatigue</b> life has been examined. Results of preliminary quasi-static tensile tests performed in both principal in-plane directions are presented. Fatigue behavior of the material has been then investigated, measuring stiffness reduction and energy dissipation, and correlating the trends of these to the different damage mechanisms individuated with microscopy, X-ray micro-CT and thermography...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue {{propagation}} of a through-the-thickness crack in thin woven glass laminates {{is difficult to}} model when using homogeneous material assumption. Crack growth depends on both the fatigue behaviour of the fibres and of the matrix, these two phenomena occurring at different time and space scales. The developed finite element model {{is based on the}} architecture of the fabric and on the fatigue behaviours of the matrix and the fibre, even if the pure resin and fibre behaviours are not used. That thus limits the physical meaning of this model. Basically, the objective of this simulation is to illustrate and to confirm proposed crack growth mechanism. The fatigue damage matrix is introduced with user spring elements that link the two fibre directions of the <b>fabric.</b> Fibre <b>fatigue</b> behaviour is based on the S-N curves. Numerical results are compared to experimental crack growth rates and observed damage in the crack tip. Relatively good agreement between predictions and experiments was found...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to test a new method known as {{shearing}} for the layup of Non-Crimp Fabric (NCF) plies for 2 -dimensional and 3 -dimensional composite components. This research includes {{the development of a}} machine capable of imparting shear on NCF plies. Results are presented with an equation for calculating machine settings for a given contour. The machine is found to be capable of imparting a shear on the fabric, and the shear is found to have a significant positive impact on the quality of these samples during <b>fabric</b> layup. <b>Fatigue</b> tensile testing was conducted to understand the effect of the shearing method on the properties of composite components, and the samples produced by the machine display a fatigue life greater than samples produced by other methods. This research makes the automation of composite layup possible, which could replace high labor costs in industries such as wind turbine blade manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|National audienceThe {{objective}} of this work was to analyse the fatigue behaviour and the damage development in unidirectional and angle-ply 2 / 2 twill weave T 800 carbon/epoxy woven <b>fabric</b> composite laminates. <b>Fatigue</b> tensile-tensile tests were performed and internal damage has been observed by using camera and optical microscope during testing. The experimental {{results show that the}} damage evolution can be characterized by two or three stages according to the 0 ° ply and angle-ply laminates respectively. An original fatigue criterion for onset delamination during fatigue loading of angle-ply laminates has been proposed. Validation of fatigue model was made with tensile fatigue tests performed on angle-ply textile laminates with drilled circular hole. Further numerical predictions are in good agreement with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesIn situ {{fenestration}} of {{endovascular stent}} grafts {{is a technique}} that is becoming more common, as it has the advantages of decreased cost, increased availability, and more anatomic configuration than other methods of branch revascularization. However, a significant concern is the short- and long-term durability of the stent graft fabric during and after fenestration. MethodsThis study utilizes the textiles analysis techniques of macro- and microscopic imaging, tear strength testing, burst strength testing, and accelerated cyclic fatigue testing on the fabrics of the Cook Zenith, Medtronic Talent, and Medtronic Endurant stent grafts (three polyester grafts), {{as well as two}} different expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membranes. Specimens were punctured using radiofrequency, and serially dilated with angioplasty balloons (3, 5, and 7  mm). For each type of fabric, three groups were analyzed: control, radiofrequency (RF) puncture only, and balloon dilated. ResultsA total of 110 specimens were analyzed, with 80 of them having been fenestrated. The Zenith fabric had the greatest strength after fenestration, but was limited by the inability to fully dilate the fenestration with the conventional balloons, which only achieved 26 – 29 % of their nominal balloon diameter. While the Talent and Endurant grafts could be dilated with balloons, the orifices were markedly elliptical not circular. After accelerated fatigue testing, there was an increase in the size of fenestrations of the Talent fabric. There was no increase in fenestration size for the Endurant fabric, Zenith fabric, or the ePTFE <b>fabrics,</b> after <b>fatigue</b> testing. ConclusionsWhile the Zenith fabric was the strongest both before and after fenestration, it requires further study with cutting balloons to achieve full-sized fenestrations. All fenestrations remained stable during fatigue testing except for the Talent fabric. This study serves as the baseline for future studies that will include stent grafts, branch stents, and cutting balloons...|$|R
