500|$|Pavement had {{attained}} {{a degree of}} success within the underground music scene with its 1989 debut EP Slay Tracks (1933-1969). While Malkmus was traveling to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, Kannberg managed Slay Tracks release on the band's self-owned label, Treble Kicker. Slay Tracks {{caught the attention of}} Dan Koretzky, an avid record collector working at Reckless Records in Chicago. Koretzky ordered 200 copies of the EP for the record store, and asked Kannberg to sign to his newly started independent label, Drag City. At the time the members of Pavement anticipated no further releases beyond Slay Tracks, and Kannberg initially expressed reluctance to sign to any label. Kannberg later said [...] "I started talking to [...] and in our conversations he said 'I'm starting this label. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something for us?' I said, 'Well I don't know if we're even a band. Steve is off in Europe.' He said, [...] "Well if you want to I'm up for it.'" ...|$|E

[...] often said following adult humor, Wakko's [...] "Faboo!" [...] and Dot's frequent assertions of her cuteness. The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all the Warners was [...] "Hello-o-o, nurse!" [...] Tom Ruegger said that the [...] "Hello-o-o, Nurse!" [...] line {{was intended to be}} a catchphrase much like Bugs Bunny's line, [...] "What's up, doc?" [...] Before the theme song for each [...] "Pinky and the Brain" [...] segment, Pinky asks, [...] "Gee, Brain, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> tonight?" [...] Brain replies, [...] "The same thing we do every night, Pinky: try to take over the world!" [...] During these episodes, Brain often asks Pinky, [...] "Are you pondering what I'm pondering?" [...] and Pinky replies with a silly non sequitur. Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode [...] "Win Big," [...] and then Producer Sherri Stoner used them and had them put into later episodes.|$|E
