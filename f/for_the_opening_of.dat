The station opened on 27 September 1998, but the commuter train service along the line did not start until 1999, when the Romerike Tunnel opened. In 2008, the parking lot was expanded with an additional 36 parking spaces.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Commodore Matthew Perry led the Perry Expedition, a {{squadron}} of four ships which sailed to Japan to establish normal relations with Japan. Perry's two technologically advanced steam-powered ships and calm, firm diplomacy convinced Japan to end three centuries of isolation and sign Treaty of Kanagawa with the U.S. in 1854. Nominally a treaty of friendship, the agreement soon paved the way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> Japan and normal trade relations with the United States and Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{the first}} M-108 {{designation}} was commissioned along a rare three-legged route connecting the State Highway Ferry Docks with the Fort Michilimackinac State Historic Park and US 31. At one point while traveling westbound on M-108, motorists could turn right onto northbound M-108 or left onto southbound M-108. In preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the Mackinac Bridge, the Michigan State Highway Department transferred all of M-108 to local control in late 1957, decommissioning the designation {{at the same}} time. In 1960, the current M-108 was commissioned along the final routing.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II in September1939 temporarily halted McQuesten's ambitions, as funding was quickly {{shifted to the}} war effort. As a result, construction on the new superhighway was put on hold south of Niagara Falls. McQuesten officially opened the QEW on August23, 1940; the pavement ended south of Lundy's Lane. Despite the war, work began on {{a link between the}} highway and the Rainbow Bridge through the centre of Niagara Falls. This link would not be completed in time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the new bridge.|$|E
5|$|As the new emperor, Macrinus had to {{deal with}} the major threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome were {{currently}} at war. An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited as a reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> peace negotiations. Negotiations may have been favourable for both sides; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians were far from home and low on supplies. The settlement, however, was viewed by many people as being unfavourable to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of this high figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the prevailing opinion accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|During 2005, the British Museum {{presented}} Egypt with a full-sized {{replica of}} the stele. This was initially displayed in the renovated Rashid National Museum, close to {{the site where the}} stone was found. In November 2005, Hawass suggested a three-month loan of the Rosetta Stone, while reiterating the eventual goal of a permanent return. In December 2009, he proposed to drop his claim for the permanent return of the Rosetta Stone if the British Museum lent the stone to Egypt for three months <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza in 2013. These requests were refused.|$|E

5|$|In 1878, Argentina made {{inquiries}} in Britain {{to buy a}} new, ocean-going capital {{ship for}} its navy, which to that point, had consisted of only coastal and riverine forces, centered on the two small s. Almirante Brown, the first large ironclad of the Argentine Navy, was ordered from the Samuda Brothers shipyard of London. She was launched on 6 October 1880, and cost the Argentine government £270,000. On 14 June 1881, she conducted speed trials on the Maplin Mile, and achieved her designed speed of 14knots at full power. Upon her delivery to Argentina, she was the largest vessel in the Argentine fleet, and remained so until the four Garibaldi-class armored cruisers were acquired in the late 1890s. Almirante Brown was present during the ceremonies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the south basin in the harbor of Buenos Aires on 28 January 1889.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} {{decided that the}} Bergen Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with {{standard}} gauge. So the newly laid line from Bergen to Voss had to be converted in time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on the line, with 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed {{and in the morning}} the trains could operate on standard gauge to Voss.|$|E
5|$|Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia {{was laid}} down on 1 June 1891, {{launched}} on 29 April 1893, and commissioned into the fleet in November 1894. In 1895, Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria took {{a squadron of}} warships, including Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia, to Germany {{to participate in the}} celebrations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the Kiel Canal. The squadron called on the port of Brest, France on the way, and stopped in Portsmouth on the return voyage. In early 1897, the ship joined the massive international fleet that demonstrated off Crete to protest the Greek annexation of the island from the Ottoman Empire. The Austro-Hungarian fleet was the third largest contingent, after the Italians and British. The Austro-Hungarians and Germans were dissatisfied with the compromise worked out, and so withdrew their contingents early, in March 1898.|$|E

5|$|Other {{people who}} have lived in Deptford, range from the First Governor of the Honourable East India Company, and Ambassador {{to the court of}} Russia, Thomas Smythe, whose {{magnificent}} house was destroyed by fire in 1618; to early members of the Chartist movement, John Gast and George Julian Harney; and the Cleveleys, John Cleveley the Elder and his sons John and Robert, a family of marine artists who also worked as tradesmen in the Dockyard. Other artists born in Deptford are Henry Courtney Selous, who is known <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Opening</b> <b>of</b> The Great Exhibition, painted in 1851; James Duffield Harding, landscape painter, lithographer and author of drawing manuals; the watercolourist Mariquita Jenny Moberly. Joseph Drew, newspaper editor, steamboat proprietor, art collector, writer and lecturer, was born in Deptford in 1814.|$|E
5|$|Serial {{production}} {{started in}} 1964, with the bodies built at Strømmens Værksted, the motors built by NEBB and the electrical equipment by AEG. By 1978, 162 cars had been delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, named T1 through T4, with varying specifications. T1 was manufactured in 90 units from 1964 to 1966 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the Grorud Line and {{the conversion of}} the Lambertseter Line. The first 30 have driver's cabs in both directions (designated T1-2), while the latter 60 have it in only one end (designated T1-1). In 1967, 15 T2s were built for {{the conversion of the}} Østensjø Line. Although given a new designation, they are in all ways identical to the T1-1s. From 1969 to 1972, 30 T3s were built for the Furuset Line. Further expansions of the lines resulted in 37 T4s being built from 1976 to 1978. The T1000s are numbered 1001–1162.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{terminal}} docks {{were constructed}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the canal. Four small docks were {{located on the}} south side of the canal near Cornbrook, within the Borough of Stretford: Pomona Docks No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4. The three main docks, built primarily for large ocean-going vessels, were in Salford, to the west of Trafford Road on the north bank of the canal, docks No. 6, No. 7, and No. 8. In 1905, No. 9 Dock was completed on the same site. Dock No. 5, known as Ordsall Dock, was part of Pomona Docks, but was dug on the Salford side of the river; it was never completed and was filled in around 1905.|$|E
