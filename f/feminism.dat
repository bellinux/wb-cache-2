5|$|Numerous feminist {{movements}} and ideologies have {{developed over the}} years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Some forms of <b>feminism</b> have been criticized for taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives. This criticism {{led to the creation of}} ethnically specific or multicultural forms of <b>feminism,</b> including black <b>feminism</b> and intersectional <b>feminism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Radical <b>feminism</b> {{considers}} the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression {{and the total}} uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary. Conservative <b>feminism</b> is conservative relative to the society in which it resides. Libertarian <b>feminism</b> conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference. Separatist <b>feminism</b> does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian <b>feminism</b> is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist <b>feminism</b> as sexist. Ecofeminists see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment; ecofeminism {{has been criticized for}} focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.|$|E
5|$|French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir {{provided}} a Marxist solution and an existentialist view {{on many of}} the questions of <b>feminism</b> with the publication of Le Deuxième Sexe (The Second Sex) in 1949. The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice. Second-wave <b>feminism</b> is a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave <b>feminism.</b> Second-wave <b>feminism</b> is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending gender discrimination.|$|E
5000|$|Marie-Claire Belleau {{argues for}} [...] "strategic intersectionality" [...] {{in order to}} foster {{cooperation}} between <b>feminisms</b> of different ethnicities. She refers to different nat-cult (national-cultural) groups that produce unique types of <b>feminisms.</b> Using Québécois nat-cult as an example, Belleau acknowledges that many nat-cult groups contain infinite sub-identities within themselves. Due to this infinity, she argues that there are endless ways in which different <b>feminisms</b> can cooperate by using strategic intersectionality, and these partnerships can help bridge gaps between [...] "dominant and marginal" [...] groups. Belleau argues that, through strategic intersectionality, differences between nat-cult <b>feminisms</b> are neither essentialist nor universal, but {{that they should be}} understood as results of socio-cultural contexts. Furthermore, the performances of these nat-cult <b>feminisms</b> are also not essentialist. Instead, they are strategies.|$|R

5|$|Some {{branches}} of <b>feminism</b> closely track the political leanings {{of the larger}} society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. Liberal <b>feminism</b> seeks individualistic equality {{of men and women}} through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal <b>feminism</b> has led to that form of <b>feminism</b> being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality. Due to this she argues that Liberal <b>Feminism</b> cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.|$|E
5|$|The media {{tended to}} {{overlook}} the meaning behind Pussy Riot's feminism; the cultural context of it is vastly {{different from that of}} Western <b>feminism.</b> According to Elianna Kan in the American Reader, Pussy Riot's <b>feminism</b> focused on the repression of authoritarian regimes that created idealised ideas of sexism, sex and family life. Pussy Riot strove {{to make it clear that}} <b>feminism</b> in Russia was still an issue and that post-feminism had not been achieved.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} will {{make use of}} the {{parallax}} method in its attempt to analyze and verify the relationship between postmodernism – representation – <b>feminisms,</b> reinterpreting concepts such as subject-object, ideology, dedoxification, with an interest in the relationship between postmodernisms – <b>feminisms.</b> In this sense, the article will resort to two forms/formulas accompanying its theoretical basis – clona societas (Orphan Black) and the post-Oedipal model (Those Who Kill), varieties which, although asymmetrical, can visually reconsider the biopolitical statute of <b>feminisms,</b> either by the option of self-multiplication, or through its constant actualization...|$|R
5000|$|Amanda Swarr and Richa Nagar, {{in their}} book Critical Transnational Feminist Praxis, give {{a list of the}} now {{outdated}} terms that describe transnational feminist practices. They emphasize that, like these [...] "rejects", the term [...] "transnational" [...] <b>feminisms</b> is merely a product of its time in the U.S. and Canadian academic institutions. Before, the terms were [...] " [...] "women of color" [...] <b>feminisms</b> (Combahee River Collective 1982), [...] "third world" [...] <b>feminisms</b> (Mohanty et al. 1991), [...] "Mutli-cultural <b>feminisms</b> (e.g. Shohat 1998)", [...] "international (Enloe 1990)" [...] and [...] "global" [...] <b>feminisms</b> (e.g., Morgan 1984)." [...] Currently, [...] "transnational feminism" [...] is the term that feminists like Chandra Mohanty and Jacqui Alexander, Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan claim has political power and can discard essentialist binaries like First World/Third World, or heteronormative gender constructs. These feminist theorists believed that [...] "international" [...] put more emphasis on nation-states as distinct entities, and that [...] "global" [...] speaks to liberal feminist theories, like Robin Morgan’s concept of [...] "global sisterhood", without taking into consideration race, class, culture, or colonialist and imperialist histories.|$|R

5|$|<b>Feminism</b> in Russia {{originated}} in the 18thcentury, influenced by the Western European Enlightenment and mostly confined to the aristocracy. Throughout the 19thcentury, the idea of <b>feminism</b> remained closely tied to revolutionary politics and to social reform. In the 20thcentury Russian feminists, inspired by socialist doctrine, shifted their focus from philanthropic works to organizing among peasants and factory workers. After the February Revolution of 1917, feminist lobbying gained suffrage and nominal equality for women in education and the workplace; however, in the 1960s and 1970s, women continued to experience discrimination in certain career-paths (including politics) as well as income inequality and a greater burden of household work. In spite of this, the concern with <b>feminism</b> waned during this period.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography <b>feminism</b> against sex-positive <b>feminism,</b> and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of <b>feminism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Male {{participation}} in <b>feminism</b> is encouraged by feminists and {{is seen as}} an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with <b>feminism</b> is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that both genders can and should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of <b>feminism.</b> It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.|$|E

5|$|Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham {{say that}} materialist forms of <b>feminism</b> {{grew out of}} Western Marxist thought and have {{inspired}} {{a number of different}} (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women. Marxist <b>feminism</b> argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Socialist <b>feminism</b> distinguishes itself from Marxist <b>feminism</b> by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression. Anarcha-feminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil rights}} {{movement}} has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights {{and the rights of}} non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and {{civil rights movement}}s, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that <b>feminism</b> was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism, and new feminisms, such as black <b>feminism</b> and Chicana <b>feminism.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of <b>feminism</b> and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about <b>feminism.</b> “Lemonade” is about black <b>feminism.</b> The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Feminism</b> was {{challenged}} by various minority groups for not entirely addressing {{the needs of}} minority populations. It was suggested that 'mainstream' <b>feminism</b> was upper caste and Hindu in its orientation and did not address the concerns of minority women. This {{led to the formation of}} the Awaaz-e-Niswaan (The Voice of Women) in 1987 in Mumbai in largely Muslim part of the city. The Muslim community has personal laws that often were considered harmful to the rights of Muslim women. The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not Polyandry.|$|E
