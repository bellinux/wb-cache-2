Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and <b>I</b> <b>drive</b> my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E
500|$|American Life is {{suffused with}} Ahmadzaï's {{characteristic}} production techniques, like stuttering instruments and vocals, oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s Sonar pulses, morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments {{that make the}} music freeze in between rhythms. The producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in the future world of recording. He believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But he used it {{to create a new}} groove. With the help of Pro Tools, he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks. Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously, about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing. They had an instrumental breakdown in [...] "American Life", where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life. [...] "Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and <b>I</b> <b>drive</b> my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like'. So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it.

2500|$|On June 30, 1998, the group's second German single, [...] "Tearin' Up My Heart", was {{released}} in both the U.K. and the U.S., once again achieving success on both charts. Further edits were made for the British version of the album, including remixes of [...] "Thinking of You (<b>I</b> <b>Drive</b> Myself Crazy)", [...] "(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You" [...] and [...] "For the Girl Who Has Everything", plus an all-new track, [...] "U Drive Me Crazy", written exclusively for the British market. This version of the album {{was released}} in the UK on July 5, 1998. At first, sales of the album were mediocre in both British and American territories, until the band's worldwide broadcast Disney Summer Concert in 1998. After the concert was aired, sales of the album began to skyrocket. It reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and shipped over 10 million copies in the United States alone, making it certified 10× Platinum and earning the group a RIAA diamond award. On February 9, 1999, a third single from the {{new version of the}} album, [...] "(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You", was released exclusively in the United States, peaking at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100.

2500|$|Following {{their success}} of their début album in several European territories, the band {{captured}} the attention of Vincent DeGiorgio, an A rep for RCA Records. After watching the group perform a rendition of their single [...] "Together Again" [...] in Budapest in November 1997, he offered them a record deal with RCA, which the group immediately agreed to. In January 1998, their first German single, [...] "I Want You Back", was released in both the United Kingdom and the United States, becoming their first single in both territories, achieving success on both the UK Singles Chart and the Billboard Hot 100. Around this time, RCA Records announced that they wished to release the group's debut album, which was previously only released in Germany, in both the U.K. and the U.S., however, wanted to make adjustments to suit both markets. This resulted in the tracks [...] "Riddle", [...] "Best of My Life", [...] "More Than a Feeling", [...] "Together Again" [...] and [...] "Forever Young" [...] being cut altogether, and new mixes of [...] "I Want You Back", [...] "Tearin' Up My Heart" [...] and [...] "For the Girl Who Has Everything" [...] being recorded. The new version of the album also included four new tracks: [...] "I Just Wanna Be with You", [...] "(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You", [...] "Everything I Own", [...] "Thinking of You (<b>I</b> <b>Drive</b> Myself Crazy)". This version of the album was subsequently released in the United States on March 24, 1998.|$|E
