At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees {{to advocate for}} political awareness, saying, [...] "To anyone who says that church {{is no place to}} talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better– no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues– they are moral issues, they're issues {{that have to do with}} human dignity and human potential, and the future we want <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>kids</b> and our grandkids." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{have felt that}} the [...] "Mature" [...] rating is too broad; video game {{journalist}} Ben Kuchera noted that Halo 3—a sci-fi first-person shooter whose level of violence was, in his opinion, comparable to a Star Wars film, had received an M rating for [...] "Blood and Gore," [...] "Mild Language" [...] and [...] "Violence". He argued that [...] "having a game like Halo 3 share the same rating as Saints Row IV, which carries the 'Blood,' Intense Violence,' 'Partial Nudity,' 'Sexual Content,' 'Strong Language' and 'Use of Drugs' descriptors was always silly, and it weakened {{the thrust of the}} ratings system." [...] Likewise, he felt that the tone and content of the PG-13 rated film The Dark Knight was relatively harsher to children than that of the Saints Row series due to the latter's light-hearted tone, but still noted that [...] "as parents we know what's right and what isn't <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>kids,</b> and being aware of the content they consume is a large part of our job as parents." [...] , the most recent installment in the franchise, received a [...] "Teen" [...] rating instead of [...] "Mature". Microsoft Xbox division executive Aaron Greenberg argued that consumers had been [...] "surprised" [...] by the M rating on previous installments [...] "given the style of the game and the lack of real graphic violence and things like that", but that the [...] "Teen" [...] rating would theoretically enable the game to reach a broader audience of younger players.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, {{when asked what}} the federal government’s role should be in {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every time you have an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in." [...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>kids.</b> It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Later in December, {{there was}} {{controversy}} regarding Obama's admissions {{of drug use}} as a teen. Obama first publicly acknowledged the issue in his 1995 book, Dreams from My Father. In the book, Obama said [...] "Pot had helped, and booze. Maybe a little blow when you could afford it." [...] The issue was revived {{on the campaign trail}} after a November 2007 speech at a New Hampshire high school. Obama told the students, [...] "I've made some bad decisions that I've actually written about," [...] noting that his [...] "drinking and experimenting with drugs" [...] accounted for a lot of [...] "wasted time" [...] in high school. Some, including Republican candidate Mitt Romney, criticized Obama for discussing these examples with students. Romney said that [...] "in order to leave the best possible example <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>kids,</b> we're probably wisest not to talk about our own indiscretions in great detail." [...] However, fellow GOP candidate Rudy Giuliani and Partnership for a Drug-Free America president Stephen J. Pasierb praised Obama's candor. [...] "I respect his honesty," [...] Giuliani said. Pasierb told CNN that [...] "really the truth works best" [...] when discussing drug use with kids. Bill Shaheen, the co-chairman of Clinton's campaign in New Hampshire, mentioned the drug use in a December 12 conference call with reporters. Shaheen said that if Obama were to win the nomination, Republicans would use Obama's admissions against him in a general election. He suggested that in such a scenario, Republicans would ask, [...] "'When was the last time? Did you ever give drugs to anyone? Did you sell them to anyone?'" [...] He added that such [...] "Republican dirty tricks" [...] would be difficult to overcome. The comments immediately caused controversy, and Shaheen resigned the next day. Clinton denounced the comments and personally apologized to Obama. Her spokesman said that she [...] "made it clear that this kind of negative personal statement has no part in this campaign." [...] Appearing on Hardball with Chris Matthews, Axelrod accused the Clinton campaign of giving a [...] "wink and a nod" [...] to negative tactics. He criticized Clinton's December 3 statement in which she signaled a more aggressive approach and called it the [...] "fun part" [...] of the campaign. Axelrod said that the signal should come [...] "from the top" [...] that the campaigns will not be waged [...] "in the gutter." ...|$|E
