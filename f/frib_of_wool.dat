40|$|Abstract. With the {{increase}} in the environmental protection consciousness of people, attention has focused on plasma technology because of its efficiency and environmentally friendliness. In order to improve the dyeing behavior <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics, surface modification <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics was carried out using an atmospheric pressure (argon) low temperature plasma treatment (LTP). Morphology and chemical composition analyses <b>of</b> the treated <b>wool</b> fiber surface were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effect on the surface properties <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics treated for different times was evaluated. The results showed that the coloration <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> fabric is improved with an argon atmospheric pressure low temperature plasma (LTP) treatment but the fabric has a lower color fastness to washing and rubbing. This results from the formation of sulfonic groups and {{the increase}} in nitrogen content attributed to more severe etching and oxidization on the surface <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> fibers...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{heat and}} flame {{resistance}} of the high performance fibers poly-p-phenylenediamine-terephthalamide (PPTA), co-poly (p-phenylene- 3, 4 -oxi-diphenylene-terephthalamide) (TECH) and Poly (p-phenylene- 2, 6 -benzobis-oxazole) (PBO) fibers is studied. It is shown that for an organic polymer PBO has exceptional heat and fire resistance. Blends <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> with high performance fibers is studied in order to investigate possible synergistic effect. Blends <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> with PBO do not enhance the FR performance <b>of</b> <b>wool.</b> Blends <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> with p-aramides (PPTA and TECH) improves the FR performance and the thermal stability of the whole textile.

Chemical change <b>of</b> UV treated <b>wool</b> was classified as surface oxidation of cystine residues and thereby induce the change in dyeing properties <b>of</b> <b>wool.</b> Dyeing tests <b>of</b> UV treated and untreated wool samples were performed at low temperature of 45 oC, 50 oC, 55 oC and 60 oC, and UV treated wool samples showed remarkably higher rate of dye uptake compared with untreated samples.

40|$|Scouring <b>of</b> raw <b>wool</b> is a {{chemical}} treatment that needs a high amount of detergents, alkalis and water. Effluents produced by this treatment are extremely polluted with chemicals and impurities washed {{out from the}} fibers. It {{is well known that}} the ultrasound washing can remove effectively different substances from the textile surfaces even without surfactants due to the cavitations occurring at certain parameters of the ultrasound field. On the other side water treatments <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> combined with mechanical agitation provoked felting which can impair the quality <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> materials. Felting itself depends not only on the parameters of water treatments but also on the structure <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> cuticle. Partial hydrolysis of the cuticle with some proteases can decrease considerably the wool felting. The aim of this work is to study the possibility of applying the ultrasound at the process <b>of</b> raw <b>wool</b> scouring and the influence of proteases on the felting properties <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> at these conditions. It has been found out that ultrasound environment applied does not impair the specific activity of enzyme auxiliaries used and leads to increasing of their effect on the surface <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> fibers. Thus the scouring process studied could be used for developing of a technology producing lower amount and less polluted effluents...|$|R
