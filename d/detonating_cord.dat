5|$|The flame fougasse has {{remained}} in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient {{to the present}} day. Such weapons are improvised from available fuel containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades and are triggered electrically or by lengths of <b>detonating</b> <b>cord.</b> In some designs, <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> is used to rupture the container immediately before triggering the propelling charge. In order to guarantee ignition, the improvised devices frequently feature two explosive charges, one to throw {{and the other to}} ignite the fuel. Weapons of this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars as well as other conflicts.|$|E

50|$|Modern day {{safety fuses}} {{are often used}} in mining and {{military}} operations, to provide a time-delay before ignition, and they {{more often than not}} are used to initiate an explosive detonator, thereby starting an explosive chain reaction to detonate a larger more stable main charge. Safety fuses are typically colored green or black (military) or fluorescent orange (commercial) to distinguish them from <b>detonating</b> <b>cords</b> such as Primacord, which are brightly colored or transparent.|$|R

[...] Citing these policies to establish a contrast with {{the manner in which the}} Romero administration handled the Cerro Maravilla murders and to criticize government downsizing, the EPB also warned that [...] " [...] will be implacable" [...] against anyone that [...] "exploits and betrays" [...] them or that serves as an obstacle to their goals. Later that month, during the commemoration of the Jayuya Uprising, the group published a draft notice where they claimed that it was [...] "not just another political-military organization", but [...] "a military structure being formed" [...] and warned that they intended to act [...] "in military fashion [...] guided by the laws of war". Noting their willingness to take their conflict [...] "to the final consequences, the group emphasized that it was [...] "not playing war". Directly identifying the United States [...] "and its collaborators" [...] as their enemy, the EBP stated that [...] "despite treating the public with the upmost responsibility", their sworn enemy would be subjected to trial and if necessary executed. After further distancing themselves from the modus operandi other revolutionary movement, the organization urged potential draftees to [...] "earn physical conditioning" [...] and opened the door to less militant individuals to take a place within their combat units.|$|E

U.S. leaflet bombs include the PDU-5B dispenser unit, the LBU30 and the older M129E1/E2. The M129 weighs [...] when empty and about [...] loaded. It can contain 60,000 to 80,000 leaflets. At a pre-determined time after release, the two halves of the bomb's outer shell are blown apart by <b>detonating</b> <b>cord,</b> dispersing the leaflet payload. Soviet/Russian leaflet bombs include the AGITAB-250-85 and the AGITAB-500-300 (used during the First Chechen War).|$|E
30|$|The WV ranks {{second in}} the nation for {{explosives}} consumption (Apodaca 2010). Almost 350, 000 tonnes were used in WV surface coal mining in 2009. Considering an average price of blasting agents (bulk emulsions, slurry and ANFO) of $ 1.14 per kg, the surface coal mines in WV spent almost $ 400 million for explosives alone. This does not include additional blasting accessories such as detonators, boosters, <b>detonating</b> <b>cords,</b> lead lines, additional costs for labor, explosives truck-delivery, and shot services. The addition of the drilling, digging and loading costs for the blasted material amounts to a significant overall cost to mine operators.|$|R
40|$|Several heat {{resistant}} secondary explosives {{suitable for use}} in spacecraft hardware were characterized and tested in order to select a prime candidate for further study. The design goal criterion was that no significant degradation of the explosive takes place after exposure to 315 C. The final selection was made from the following candidates: PYX (2, 6 -bis (picrylamino) - 3, 5 -dinitropyridine), ONT (octanitro-m-terphenyl), and TPT (2, 4, 6 tripicryl-s-triazine), following performance tests in <b>detonating</b> <b>cords.</b> TPT was the final selection and was further characterized and evaluated {{in order to obtain}} data for a procurement specification...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A novel {{shock wave}} control system to use {{material}} processing technique is described. The spiral <b>detonating</b> <b>cords</b> {{is used to}} get the broad wide pressure and the impulse control. The impulse was extremely improved by this technique. Moreover {{in order to get}} a higher pressure than its Chapman-Jouguet pressure (C-J pressure), a combined explosives system, consisting of two explosives, was used. When a high explosive with a lower detonation velocity is inserted into the high explosive tube with a higher detonation velocity, the detonation characteristics of the lower velocity explosives is improved by the influence of the higher velocity explosives and a pressure is higher than the C-J pressure was obtained. In addition the aluminum alloy metal processing technique using explosives is also reported...|$|R
5000|$|The {{next step}} in mining {{technology}} was <b>detonating</b> <b>cord.</b> Ensign-Bickford and other companies developed different versions of <b>detonating</b> <b>cord.</b> In 1937, Ensign-Bickford trademarked [...] "Primacord" [...] , which became the functional generic name for <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> in North America. In May 2003, Ensign-Bickford sold the trademarks and processes to Dyno Nobel Inc [...] of Australia (formerly of Norway).|$|E
50|$|Primacord is a {{brand of}} <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> used in blasting. The {{registered}} trademark Primacord was originally owned by the Ensign-Bickford Company; Ensign-Bickford sold the trademark to Dyno Nobel in 2003, who manufacture it in their Graham, Kentucky factory. The name is also used as a genericized trademark for any <b>detonating</b> <b>cord.</b>|$|E
50|$|Low-yield <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> {{can be used}} as a {{precision}} cutting charge to remove cables, pipes, wiring, fiber optics, and other utility bundles by placing one or more complete wraps around the target. Detonation cord is used in commercial boilers to break up clinkers (solidified coal ash slag) adhering to tube structures. Also a vertical centered cord being lowered into the water of a drilled well can remove any clogging that obstructs water flow. Higher-yield <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> can be used to cut down small trees, although the process is very uneconomical compared to using bulk explosive, or even a chainsaw. High-yield <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> placed by divers has been used to remove old dock pilings and other underwater obstructions. Creating a slipknot from <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> yields a field-improvised device that can be quickly employed to cut a locked doorknob off a door. Detonation cord can be taped in several rings to the outline of a military man-sized target and detonated, breaching a man-sized hole into wooden doors or light interior walls. <b>Detonating</b> <b>cord</b> is also employed directly in building demolition where thin concrete slabs need be broken via channels drilled parallel to the surface, an advantage over dynamite since a lower minimum of explosive force may be used and smaller diameter holes are sufficient to contain the explosive. Anything much more substantial than these uses requires the use of additional explosives.|$|E
50|$|On April 21, Nichols {{learned he}} was wanted for questioning, turned himself in, and consented to {{a search of}} his home. The search turned up {{blasting}} caps, <b>detonating</b> <b>cords,</b> ground ammonium nitrate, barrels made of plastic similar to fragments found at the bombing site, 33 firearms, anti-government warfare literature, a receipt for ammonium nitrate fertilizer with McVeigh's fingerprints on it, a telephone credit card that McVeigh had used when he was shopping for bomb making equipment, and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City. Nichols was held as a material witness to the bombing until he was charged on May 10. Nichols's family said {{the federal government was}} framing him and said this was proved by other explosives found inside the building.|$|R
5|$|The script {{called for}} the probe to {{vaporize}} the Earth's oceans, generating heavy cloud cover. While effects cinematographer Don Dow {{wanted to go to}} sea and record plumes of water created by exploding <b>detonating</b> <b>cords</b> in the water, the team decided to create the probe's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced concerns for the welfare of marine life in the area. The team used a combination of baking soda and cloud tank effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank. These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.|$|R
40|$|The method {{comprises}} identifying {{regions of}} component or product with higher content of fibers and/or reinforcements and {{regions of the}} component with a lower content of fibers and/or reinforcements, decomposing the component or product {{in accordance with the}} identified regions to form two fractions of the product or component having high and lower content of fibers and/or reinforcement, and recovering the fibers and/or reinforcements from the fragments having high content of fibers and/or reinforcements by selective removal of the plastic matrix of the fibers and/or reinforcements. The method comprises identifying regions of component or product with a higher content of fibers and/or reinforcements and regions of the component with a lower content of fibers and/or reinforcements, decomposing the component or product in accordance with the identified regions to form two fractions of the product or component having high and lower content of fibers and/or reinforcement, and recovering the fibers and/or reinforcements from the fragments having high content of fibers and/or reinforcements by selective removal of the plastic matrix of the fibers and/or reinforcements. The components and products comprise long and/or continuous filament in the form of fiber bundles and two and/or three-dimensional fibrous structures containing plastic-fiber composite materials. The identification step is performed by acoustic, spectroscopic, thermo graphic or inductive method. The decomposition step is carried out by a water jet cutting process, line shaped explosive charges, and <b>detonating</b> <b>cords,</b> and includes arranging the explosive charges in cavities in the product or component and activating the explosive charges. The lower content of fibers and/or reinforcements are present in an amount of 30 - 60 wt. %. The selective removal of the polymer matrix of the fibers and/or reinforcements is performed by pyrolysis, thermolysis or solvolysis. The fraction having the lower content of fiber and/or reinforcement is used as a filler or reinforcing material. The method further comprises crushing the plastic matrix of the fibers and/or reinforcements to obtain powder or granules. USE: The method is useful for recovering fibers from large-shaped, components or products of plastic composite materials, where the components or products are rotor blades and nacelles for wind turbines, ship hulls and aircraft hulls or tanks (all claimed). ADVANTAGE: The method allows economic and precise recovery of the fibers from the components or products without any health hazards using line shaped explosive charges and <b>detonating</b> <b>cords.</b> Preferred Components: The fibers includes glass fibers, carbon fibers, metal fibers, and/or aramid fibers...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Detonating</b> <b>cord</b> {{is rated}} in {{explosive}} mass per unit length. This {{is expressed in}} grains per foot in the United States, or in grams per metre elsewhere.

40|$|Nickel {{hydrazine}} nitrate is {{an energetic}} coordination compound having explosive properties in between that of primary and secondary. This compound {{was used to}} develop a new type of detonator by replacing the sensitive primary explosive, lead azide in conventional detonators and keeping RDX (cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) as the output secondary explosive. The detonator consists of three regions, viz., initiation, deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT), and output. The initiation and the electrical rating of 1 A/ 1 W no-fire were achieved using a suitable squib. The DDT and the output were taken care of, by pressing requisite quantities of Nickel hydrazine nitrate and RDX, respectively at required densities in a stainless steel stem channel. The detonator assembly involves crimping the squib and the stem channel in a stainless steel housing and applying a suitable resin at the crimped-end for leak tightness. The output was assessed from the dent depth on aluminium plate, volume expansion on lead block, and by achieving veloctiy of detonation of 8200 m/s in mild <b>detonating</b> <b>cords,</b> containing 0. 95 g/m of RDX, which indicates full-order detonation. The detonators were tested at system level and found to perform satisfactorily...|$|R
