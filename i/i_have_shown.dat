500|$|The {{second of}} the two main themes in the music video is of African American history and culture, {{as some of the}} {{vaudeville}} scenes in the short film acknowledge minstrel shows and blackface. Author W. T. Lhamon writes that the video is set in the Californian Depression, and that McCartney and Jackson [...] "convey a compactly corrupt history of blackface" [...] as they con their way to riches with the Mac and Jack show. Lhamon was critical of the pair and of the video because he felt that the African American theme had not been made explicitly known. The author expressed his view that aspects of the short film were historically out-of-synch with interracial relations. He stated, [...] "Nearly everything in the video is backward. Mack's white hand continually helping black Jack on board, for instance, reverses the general process <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> of blacks providing whites with their sustaining gestures." [...] Lhamon added, [...] "In a just world, Jackson should be pulling McCartney onto the wagon, not the other way around." ...|$|E

He stated [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> enough patience. I have been repeatedly guaranteed the compensation due. Twelve months have passed without anything, following a number of promises to pay. I remain willing to fight for anyone interested in giving me his gala tournaments, with no limits or proprietary." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rosecrans was reelected in 1882 {{and became}} the {{chairman}} of the House Military Affairs Committee, a position in which he publicly opposed a bill that would provide a pension to former President Grant and his wife. Unaware of the serious financial condition of Grant's family, Rosecrans objected that some of Grant's official statements [...] "were false, and which he knew to be false at the time he made them, and which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> in my official reports to be false. I cannot say to {{the people of this country}} that a business which has been conducted as to rob poor people of millions, and which, if done on a smaller scale would have sent its managers to prison, shall be considered as important when the principal manager has allowed a great name to be used as the instrument of the robbery." [...] The bill was passed over his objections. When a bill was introduced in 1889 to restore Rosecrans's rank and place him on the retired list, some Representatives objected, based on Rosecrans's actions against Grant in 1885, but the bill was passed.|$|E
