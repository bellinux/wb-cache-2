25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the country's economy was hit hard when real GDP per capita {{declined}} by 5.1% per year between 1989 and 1992 {{partly due to}} the 1990 oil price spike.

In contrast, Robert Booth Fowler, professor emeritus {{of political science at}} the University of Wisconsin, writes that to Connolly [...] "American capitalism and Christianity work together...at all levels of society in ways which violate Connolly's main goals: a dramatically more egalitarian society, an environmentally responsible nation and world, and a deep respect for human diversity".|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility that}} spiral inflation can be realized using the near-conifold flux potentials for the complex structure moduli in type IIB string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold. Using the explicit form of the flux potential for complex structure moduli, we provide analytical and numerical arguments showing that spiral inflation is difficult to support. We also show that for this sector of low energy string theories, a viable <b>spiral</b> <b>inflationary</b> scenario would owe its success to a de Sitter-like vacuum energy, with minimal reliance on the non-gradient flow field trajectories which characterize spiral inflation.

50|$|A precipitous rise in {{the price}} of rice caused extreme {{economic}} hardship, particularly in rural areas where rice was the main staple of life. Farmers, when comparing the low prices they were receiving due to government regulation with the high market prices had tremendous hostility against rice merchants and government officials who had allowed the consumer price to spiral out of control. The rice price increase came at the peak of a post-war (World War I) <b>inflationary</b> <b>spiral</b> that also affected most consumer goods and rents, and thus urban dwellers also had considerable scope for grievances. The Siberian Intervention further inflamed the situation, with the government buying up existing rice stocks to support the troops overseas, which further drove rice prices higher. The government intervention in economic affairs (low, regulated rice price) caused rural protests spread to the towns and cities.|$|E
50|$|The {{years from}} 1951 to 1956 {{were marked by}} much {{economic}} progress, but the reforms of the period were implemented irregularly, and were poorly coordinated. One large obstacle to the reform process was the corrupt, inefficient, and bloated bureaucracy. By the mid-1950s, the <b>inflationary</b> <b>spiral</b> had resumed its upward climb, and foreign currency reserves that had stood at US$58 million in 1958 plummeted to US$6 million by mid-1959. The growing demands of the emerging middle class—and of the ever-greater number of tourists—for the amenities of life, particularly for higher nutritional standards, placed heavy demands on imported food and luxury items. At the same time, exports lagged, largely because of high domestic demand and institutional restraints on foreign trade. The peseta fell to an all-time low on the black market, and Spain's foreign currency obligations grew to almost US$60 million.|$|E

5000|$|According to Professor Keith Shaw an {{important}} early milestone in Friedman's campaign against Keynesianism was the 1956 publication of Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money. [...] In this work Friedman restated the Quantity theory of money, and obtained {{the attention of}} several Keynesian economists partly because he admitted Keynes was right to state that the velocity of circulation {{of money in the}} Equation of exchange can vary, rather than being a constant as assumed by classical economists. However, Friedman's restatement was otherwise closer to the classical view in reducing the scope for beneficial government intervention in the economy. [...] An even more influential work was his 1963 publication of A Monetary History of the United States. Drawing on extensive empirical data, it further strengthened the case for his restated Quantity Theory of Money, arguing that inflation was [...] "always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon", while conceding that it could take one or two years for an increase in the money supply to lead to inflation. This ran counter to the then orthodox Keynesian interpretation that inflation was linked to employment, as modelled by the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between the two variables. Governments at the time would use the Phillips curve as part of their models to calculate the expected cost in terms of inflation for a stimulus designed to restore full employment. In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist, {{and that it would be}} possible to have both inflation and unemployment rise at once. Friedman had also argued that workers' expectations of future high inflation could lead to an <b>inflationary</b> <b>spiral</b> as they would push for increased wages in advance to try to compensate for expected future inflation.|$|E

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{an investigation}} of the effects of past high injation on future performance measures if inflation were to disappear. Computer simulations were used to estimate continuing differences between historical cost and current cost measures and their patterns of convergence over time. Current cost accounting and three combinations of historical cost accounting were applied to an average manufacturer and an average retailer, each company being based on empirical price data and average jinancial char-acteristics for its industry. Results for the period of stable prices show that, even for the average retailer, historical cost rates of return can differ from current-cost returns by material amounts (at least 10 percent higher) for more than a decade.

40|$|Economists' long-standing {{interest}} in {{the degree to which}} exchange rate movements are reflected in prices was rekindled in the 1970 s by a combination of rising inflation and the adoption of more flexible exchange rate regimes in many industrialized countries. Specifically, there were concerns that a large currency depreciation could degenerate into an <b>inflationary</b> <b>spiral.</b> Such fears were curtailed in the 1980 s and early 1990 s as industrialized countries began to reduce and stabilize their inflation rates. The low-inflation period most industrialized countries entered approximately a decade ago coincided with significant exchange rate depreciations that had much smaller effects on consumer prices than expected. This led to a belief that the extent to which exchange rate movements are passed through to consumer prices has declined. In this article, the authors examine why pass-through could be incomplete and review empirical estimates to determine whether pass-through has indeed declined, suggesting possible reasons for this decline and discussing the implications for monetary policy. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} {{on the effects of}} the minimum wage using Brazilian monthly household and firm panel data between 1982 and 2000. By examining the effects on wages, employment and prices together we are able to provide an explanation for the small employment effects prevalent in the literature. Our principal finding is that increasing the minimum wage raises wages and prices with small adverse employment effects. This suggests a general wage-price <b>inflationary</b> <b>spiral,</b> where persistent inflation offsets some of the wage gains. The main policy implication deriving from these results is that the potential of the minimum wage to help the poor is bigger under low inflation. Under high inflation, the resulting wage-price spiral makes the minimum wage increase - as well as its antipoverty policy potential - short lived. In this case, the wage effects are volatile and the permanent scars are lower employment and higher inflation in Brazil. minimum wages; employment; labor costs; cost shock; Brazil...|$|E
