5|$|For XIII-2, Game Informers Joe Juba was <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> Lightning {{had been}} {{transferred}} to a supporting role in favor of Serah and Hope, whom he saw as weaker characters than Lightning. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found that the story suffers without {{the driving force of}} Lightning's single-minded determination. VanOrd was <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> Lightning and Caius Ballad have relatively limited screen-time, since they come off as stronger characters than the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Eko {{received}} many positive responses from critics and fans, who were <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> the character was killed after one season. A toy figure of Mr. Eko {{was included in}} a second series of Lost toy figures distributed by McFarlane Toys.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{was opposed}} {{to the idea of}} a ceasefire, but under {{pressure}} from Machel he agreed to it. Mugabe signed the agreement, although felt cheated, remaining <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> he had never achieved a military victory over the Rhodesian forces.|$|E

5|$|Du Bois was bitterly <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> {{many of his}} colleaguesparticularly the NAACPdid {{not support}} him during his 1951 PIC trial, whereas working class whites and blacks {{supported}} him enthusiastically. After the trial, Du Bois lived in Manhattan, writing and speaking, and continuing to associate primarily with leftist acquaintances. His primary concern was world peace, and he railed against military actions, such as the Korean War, which he viewed as efforts by imperialist whites to maintain colored people in a submissive state.|$|E
5|$|Grant and Hayes {{had both}} {{advocated}} civil service reform, and by 1881, civil service reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation. Garfield sympathized with them, {{believing that the}} spoils system damaged the presidency and distracted from more important concerns. Some reformers were <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> Garfield had advocated limited tenure only to minor office seekers and had given appointments to his old friends, but many remained loyal and supported Garfield.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the community, perpetually {{struggling}} financially, drafted {{an entirely}} new constitution and committed to following more closely the Fourierist model. Not everyone at the community supported the transition, and many left. Many were <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> the new, more structured daily routine de-emphasized the carefree leisure time {{that had been a}} trademark. Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.|$|E

5|$|In Karlsruhe on 3 May 1842, Ernest married 21-year-old Princess Alexandrine of Baden. She was {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden and Princess Sophie of Sweden, {{daughter of the}} deposed King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. Though he gave his consent, his father was <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> his second son did not do more to advance the concerns of Coburg. The marriage did not produce any issue, though Ernest apparently fathered at least three illegitimate children in later years.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's primary {{interest}} lay {{in improving}} the state's mental and penal institutions. These improvements began under Governor Chandler, and while Johnson stated that the mental hospitals and prisons were in their best condition in forty years {{by the end of}} his term, he was <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> he was not able to do more. In light of the financial obligations brought about by World War II, he had to curb state construction.|$|E
5|$|The DS {{version of}} the game, which was {{significantly}} different from the other versions, received praise for its unique gameplay, but criticism for its short length. IGN lauded the DS version's unique gameplay experience and GameSpot proclaimed that it was satisfying from start to finish. GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> the game was extremely brief. 1UP found that even though The Simpsons Game parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used them anyway, making it a pointless endeavor.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What a good fellow you are, Clennam!' exclaimed the other, {{stopping}} {{to look at}} him, as if with irrepressible admiration. 'What a capital fellow! You have never been <b>disappointed.</b> <b>That's</b> easy to see.' ...|$|R

5|$|When Stewie becomes <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> Lois did {{not take}} him on the cruise, he relates {{that he has not}} {{expressed}} it much since he saw The Lake House. Peter and Lois watch the sunset; Lois noting that she feels like Kate Winslet's character in Titanic, but Peter believes that she was portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Leonardo DiCaprio is also referenced in the scene.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{literary}} critics Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian, Hasan's psychological struggles reflect Sigmund Freud's theories on psychoanalysis. Teeuw notes that Hasan {{comes across as}} being <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> his traditional religious upbringing {{is not enough to}} overcome the temptations of the modern world. Poet and critic of Indonesian literature Muhammad Balfas writes that Hasan's conflict arises from being torn intellectually between the teachings of his ultra-religious father and the Marxist Rusli, {{while at the same time}} being emotionally victimised by the ever self-confident Anwar. Balfas notes that three versions of Hasan are made apparent to the reader: Hasan's view of himself, the narrator's view of Hasan, and the narrator's reconstruction of Hasan.|$|E
5|$|Curie's {{quest to}} create a new {{laboratory}} did not end with the University of Paris, however. In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris. The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute. Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>disappointing</b> <b>that</b> the 30th {{amendment}} {{has been}} narrowly defeated but the Constitution {{is something that}} belongs {{to the people and}} we acknowledge and accept the people's democratic decision.

5|$|Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother! (often {{referred}} to simply as Happy Brothers) is an 1887 oil painting by the Serbian artist Uroš Predić. It shows four intoxicated youths walking through their village whilst {{the mother of}} one shouts her disapproval from the distance. The painting {{is said to have been}} inspired by a frequent sight in Predić's home village of Orlovat—that of drunken youths returning from the pub at dawn. Predić painted the composition hoping it would persuade the villagers to change their ways. He was <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> it not only failed to decrease the incidence of drunkenness in Orlovat, but was well received by the villagers themselves, who were happy merely to have been depicted.|$|E
5|$|In the Faris Nyannyan Ending, Okabe {{decides to}} not send the D-Mail {{that results in}} the death of Faris' father to try to stop the loss of the IBN 5100 computer. He instead sends a {{different}} D-Mail in an attempt to convince Faris' father to not part with the IBN computer. Beyond 1% divergence is achieved, but the divergence meter gives a strange output and none of Okabe's friends have any memories of him. In this worldline, Okabe and Faris are a couple and live together, participating in Rainet Access Battlers card game tournaments. Although <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> none of his friends remember him, Okabe is still satisfied {{that he was able to}} prevent Mayuri's death. He decides to build a new life with Faris at his side.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session of the 33rd Congress, Breckinridge acted as {{spokesman}} for Ways and Means Committee bills, including a bill to assume and pay the debts Texas incurred prior to its annexation. Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran and Jesse D. Bright, were two of Texas's major creditors. The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation. Breckinridge was <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> the House defeated a measure to pay the Sioux $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of {{an island in the}} Mississippi River; the debt was never paid. Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce vetoed it.|$|E

5|$|Its {{associated}} thunderstorm {{activity was}} sporadic and relatively disorganized, and the storm weakened to a tropical depression on July16. Claudette briefly re-intensified into {{a tropical storm}} before becoming extratropical later that day. Shortly thereafter, it merged with a cold front, while the remnants were last noted near the Azores on July23. Tropical Storm Claudette had minimal effects on land. Severe rip currents from Claudette in North Carolina caused several rescues and one person was injured, although no fatalities occurred. Some residents of coastal North Carolina were even <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> Claudette was to remain offshore, as the region was suffering from dry conditions.|$|E
5|$|Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon, Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Howard (Simon Helberg) are in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, {{waiting for}} Comic-Con tickets {{to go on}} sale online. After ten minutes of trying, Leonard finally gets in the queue but is 15,211th in line. Tickets run out and the four men are <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> {{they will not be}} able to attend, {{especially}} as they had spent so much time on their costumes, intending to go as different versions of the Hulk as portrayed by Lou Ferrigno, Eric Bana, Edward Norton, and Mark Ruffalo.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{commented that}} the imaginative {{character}} designs and use of advanced graphics technology, such as hardware transform and lighting, and bump mapping, made the graphics of the game unrivaled in its time; ActionTrip was so impressed by the game's visuals that they thought their graphics card was supporting the complex hardware environmental bump mapping it was incapable of. The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won the praises of reviewers. Many critics, however, were <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> the computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full details on the recommended system specifications.|$|E
