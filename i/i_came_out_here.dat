2500|$|Jones' sudden {{switch from}} Ohio State to conference rival Iowa caused Big Ten {{commissioner}} Tug Wilson {{to conduct a}} personal investigation. [...] Iowa was cleared of any wrongdoing. [...] When questioned, Cal Jones reportedly told Wilson, [...] "I'll tell you why <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> [...] They treated me like a white man, and I like it here. [...] I'm going to stay." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{always wanted}} to have fun and was pretty much a comedian when I pitched. I {{did a lot of}} crazy things. [...] One time I went up to bat without a bat ... I {{always wanted to}} have fun playing {{baseball}} [...] that got me into trouble with Mel Ott ... I knew I wasn't going to last long with him. [...] Ott came out to the mound and said [...] "When {{are you going to get}} serious? When I sent you out here I wanted you to work." [...] I told him the only way I would work [...] a rake and a shovel [...] <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to play ... I was in the minor leagues soon after that."

2500|$|On October 30, 2010, WWE held a [...] "Fan Appreciation Day" [...] in Hartford, Connecticut. Vince {{acknowledged}} that the event was held to counter the negative publicity from the Senate race. During the wrestling show, McMahon distanced himself from his wife's political campaign, saying, [...] "Some people may think I was {{going to talk about}} politics today. Nothing {{could be further from the}} truth. I do encourage you to vote this Tuesday, and while you're voting, feel free to wear a WWE T-shirt. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to simply say thank you. That's what this day is all about. It's about fan appreciation. No one appreciates the fans more than World Wrestling Entertainment." [...] The Connecticut Democratic Party filed an FEC complaint against Linda McMahon's campaign in October, claiming the WWE's [...] "Fan Appreciation Day" [...] was an [...] "illegal campaign contribution". The complaint also cited the taping of [...] "Smackdown in Bridgeport Harbor Yard" [...] on Election Day, claiming it intended to suppress voter turnout in a Democratic-leaning community.|$|E

6000|$|When {{they had}} stopped, Milt warned, [...] "There's their machine now. Seems {{to be kind}} of a hotel here. I'm going in and say howdy. Good-by, Pink. Glad to have met you, but I expect you to be gone when <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> again. If you aren't---- Want granite or marble for the headstone? I mean it, now!" ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> and {{the whole}} thing went phut. She wrote to say {{that there had been a}} mistake, and then she married.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> {{to escape}} college--and my father's business." [...] He laughed. [...] "But don't betray me. I'm {{supposed}} to be 'slowly improving.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> two {{or three}} times with Thomas Jones to set my {{squirrel}} trap," [...] said Marco. [...] "There goes Thomas Jones now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I was {{a nigger}} or an Italian <b>I</b> should <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> and sing. <b>I</b> whistle sometimes, but bless you, it's singing I've {{got in my}} mind. Sometimes I think I live for sunsets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are an old friend, Doctor, and {{you will}} {{understand}} my case, and make more allowances for it than most people would. When <b>I</b> first <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> dare say you heard some sort of reports as to why I had left the army and had afterwards entered the Civil Service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How refreshingly {{healthy and}} well you look!" [...] {{a young man}} of some six and twenty years old, named Johnson, said. [...] "I was {{something}} like that, when <b>I</b> first <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> though you'd hardly think it now. Eight years of stewing, in this horrible hole, takes the life and spirits out of anyone.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, father, I {{have not}} heard {{anything}} about it. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> directly I finished my breakfast. How {{are the people who}} were brought up here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] he admitted. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to think. I could not quite {{make up my mind}} what to say to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} a dozen, Francisco. It is owing to you {{we have taken}} these prisoners, and that I have had my first bit of {{excitement}} since <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I know Bertie {{ought to}} be in school," [...] Mrs. Gilman said one day to a {{sympathetic}} guest. [...] "But what can I do? We got to live. <b>I</b> didn't <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> for my health, but goodness knows I never expected to slave away in a hot kitchen in this way. If Mr. Gilman had lived--" ...|$|R
500|$|James Alcock - [...] "Ray and I and {{a magician}} {{by the name}} of Steve Shaw, now known as Banachek did the very first Toolbox in Buffalo... a little while later Ray asked me if <b>I</b> could <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to this group." [...] Ray stated [...] "It took a long while to get Jim <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> but finally we managed it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he said, when {{he heard}} the cause of the uproar; [...] "when <b>I</b> first <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> should have done the same, and should have {{regarded}} the certainty of being knocked on the head as cheerfully as you do. Eight years <b>out</b> <b>here</b> takes the enthusiasm out of a man, and I shall wait quietly to see whether we are to be transferred to Calcutta, or shipped back to England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mine is Morse--Fred Morse. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> with a grub-stake, lost it, and, {{being out}} of a job, fell into rolling the marble for a living. What are you--a miner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps you're right," [...] said Maxton; [...] "I {{confess that}} I have troubled myself {{very little about}} {{religion}} since <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> but my conscience has often reproached me for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! Thou sawest? <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> {{to avoid}} the gaping throng, who don't know what a hunter can do. I have been in worse case in the Tyrol. Snowdrifts are worse footing than stone vine leaves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Waltham, I'll {{be ready}} for you. But {{remember}} what <b>I</b> said. We <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> {{to have a good}} time, and I am not going to allow you to spoil it for Miss Laning or for anybody else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the same}} time, Dias, should {{you know of}} any silver lodes that might turn out well, I would {{certainly}} take some samples, and send two or three mule-loads of the stuff home. They might be of no good for the purpose for which <b>I</b> have <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> but in time I might do something with them; the law here is that anyone who finds a mine can obtain a concession for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see why {{we should}}, Uncle. Of course, we should not go up dressed as we are, but as shikarees, and when we went into a village, should begin by asking whether the people are troubled with any tigers in the neighbourhood. You see, <b>I</b> {{specially}} <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to go into Mysore in disguise, and I should be getting a little practice in this way, besides obtaining news for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should that," [...] Mike said, emphatically. [...] "I was but {{eighteen}} when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> {{to enlist}} in the brigade--that is twelve years ago now, and it is few people {{would be likely to}} know me again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look here, I'm {{not going}} to be ordered about like a dog. You've got no right to talk to me like that. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> of my own free will, and I won't let you treat me like a damned nigger.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course. But I rather enjoy a row now and then. It stirs up one's {{grey matter}} so nicely. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> this {{afternoon}} and thought the whole affair over from beginning to end. And I have determined to say 'no.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Small {{developed}} the persona of Grandpa Elliott, {{an old man}} dressed in blue denim overalls, a bright red shirt, Santa beard, and a floppy hat who played blues harp and sang for the street traffic on his corner at Royal and Toulouse streets in the French Quarter, right where he started out. He often teams with guitarist Michael “Stoney B” Stone and they have become an institution in New Orleans {{for the people who}} stop to listen to them and throw change in their bucket. His act was even written up in The New York Times in 1995. He arrives here most mornings by taxi and spends his days singing his soulful songs and playing his harmonica. It's the place where everybody knows his name."When I feel sick, <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to feel better," [...] he said. [...] "The French Quarter is my medicine." [...] Small said he doesn’t even know what beer tastes like and he’s never touched drugs and the only thing he smokes is the exhaust from the cars that pass Royal and Toulouse.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I don’t {{think you}} will,’ replied Chevenix. ‘When <b>I</b> agreed to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> and do sentry-go, {{it was on}} one condition, Master Ronald: don’t you forget that! Military discipline, my boy! Our beat is this path close about the house. Down, Towzer! good boy, good boy—gently, then!’ he went on, caressing his confounded monster.|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> first <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> from Toronto it {{was much}} the same with me, and there was nobody to teach me. It's {{fortunate}} that men are not very fastidious {{in this part of}} Canada. In any case I had, perhaps, better mention that while I would be glad to pay you at the usual rate and you would be required to help, you would live with us as one of the family. I want a companion. With my husband at work from sunup until dark, it's often lonely here. Besides, the arrangement would give you an opportunity for learning a little and finding out how you like the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Probably because I didn't {{care whether}} I escaped or not," [...] Felix replied, with a short, bitter laugh. [...] "I stood behind some shrubs {{just inside the}} garden, and watched the hunt go by. Then <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> and sat down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Angrily.] You've {{no right}} {{to talk to me}} like that. I'm sick to death of being ordered about. You seem to think I'm a dog. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> of my own free will, and I won't let you treat me as if I were a servant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm not priceless, I'm only real, I'm only human--human and tired. You are so strong, you can't {{know how}} tired. Have you any idea why <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> this summer? It was because I was desperate--because I had almost decided to marry some one else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so, chief," [...] Harry said, {{grasping}} the Indian's hand warmly, [...] "and I was a selfish brute {{not to think}} of it before. There is one thing I will promise you. Every year or so <b>I</b> will <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> and do a couple of months' hunting with you. The journey is long, but it is quickly made now, and I know that after knocking about for twenty years I shall never be content if I don't take a run out on the plains for a bit every summer. I will give you my word, Leaping Horse, that as long as I have health and strength <b>I</b> will <b>come</b> <b>out</b> regularly, and that you shall see your white brother's friendship is as strong as your own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} what, Owen: <b>I</b> did not <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to hear myself abused; and I {{will not stand}} it. According to my idea you had no right {{whatever}} {{to speak to me}} about Lady Clara Desmond. But you are my cousin; and therefore I have borne it. It may be as well that we should both understand that it is once for all. I will not listen to you again on the same subject." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Sam; but then, thank God, I am {{master of}} the liquor, and not the liquor of me. I can take a glass, or perhaps two, without wanting more. Though I have made a fool of myself in many ways since <b>I</b> have <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> no man can say he ever saw me drunk; if liquor were to {{get the better of}} me once, I would swear off {{for the rest of my}} life. Don't you ever take to it, Tom; that is, not to get so as to like to go on {{drinking}} it. In our life we often have to go for months without it, and a man has got to be very careful when he goes down to the settlements, else it would be sure to get over him." ...|$|R
