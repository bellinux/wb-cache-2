5|$|This {{period of}} {{electronic}} music championing culminated in 1971 {{with the publication}} of Kaegi's unique record release, a 7-inch record titled Von Sinuston zur elektronischen Musik ("From Sine Wave to Electronic Music"). In the 12 pages accompanying booklet, Kaegi analyses the basic constituents of electronic music like sine wave, sound synthesis, ring modulation or <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillator,</b> with sound examples provided on the disc as well as excerpts from his most recent works of the time, Kyoto, 1970, Thai Clarinet, 1970, Hydrophonie I, 1969 and Illumination Expo'70 Osaka, 1969. The latter piece was commissioned by the Swiss government to be used as background music for the Swiss pavilion at the World Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan, a project he undertook with composer and contemporary music promoter André Zumbach (born 1931), then head of music at Radio Suisse Romande.|$|E
25|$|The quartz {{clock is}} a clock that keeps time {{by using an}} <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillator</b> {{regulated}} by a quartz crystal. This allows for significantly better accuracy than mechanical clocks. The first quartz clock was built in 1927 by Warren Marrison and J.W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, {{before the}} popularization of {{electronic}} organs and the introductions of combo organs, manufacturers developed and marketed various portable monophonic electronic instruments with small keyboards. These small instruments consisted of an <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillator,</b> vibrato effect, passive filters etc. Most of these (except for Clavivox) {{were designed for}} conventional ensembles, rather than as experimental instruments for electronic music studios—but they contributed {{to the evolution of}} modern synthesizers.|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we present results on {{synchronization}} of diffusively coupled Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillators.</b> These <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillators</b> are analog electrical circuits which integrate the differential equations of the Hindmarsh-Rose model. An experimental setup consisting of four chaotic Hindmarsh-Rose oscillators, {{is used to}} evaluate the existence and stability of partially or fully synchronized states...|$|R

25|$|This {{result is}} valid for {{any type of}} {{harmonic}} oscillator, such as a pendulum, a vibrating molecule or a passive <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillator.</b> Systems of such oscillators arise in many situations; by equipartition, each such oscillator receives an average total energy kBT and hence contributes kB to the system's heat capacity. This {{can be used to}} derive the formula for Johnson–Nyquist noise and the Dulong–Petit law of solid heat capacities. The latter application was particularly significant in the history of equipartition.|$|E
500|$|Younger Than Yesterday is {{the fourth}} album by the American rock band the Byrds and was {{released}} on February 6, 1967 on Columbia Records (see 1967 in music). [...] It saw the band continuing to integrate elements of psychedelic rock into their music, a process they had begun on their previous album, Fifth Dimension. [...] In addition, the album captured the band and record producer Gary Usher experimenting with new musical textures, including brass instruments, reverse tape effects and an <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{labeling}} of the drawbar {{derives from the}} stop system in pipe organs, in which the physical length of the pipe corresponds to the pitch produced. Most Hammonds contain nine drawbars per manual. The drawbar marked [...] "8′" [...] generates the fundamental of the note being played, the drawbar marked [...] "16′" [...] is an octave below, and the drawbars marked [...] "4′", [...] "2′" [...] and [...] "1′" [...] are one, two and three octaves above, respectively. The other drawbars generate various other harmonics and [...] subharmonics of the note. While each individual drawbar generates a relatively pure sound similar to a flute or <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillator,</b> more complex sounds can be created by mixing the drawbars in varying amounts.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} of thermal noise analysis of <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillators</b> is presented. Although nonlinear <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillators</b> {{are one of the}} most essential subcircuits in electronic systems typical design concepts for these oscillators are based on ideas of linear circuits. Because the functionality of oscillators depends on nonlinearities, advanced design methods are developed where nonlinearities are an integral part. Since low voltage oscillator concepts have to be developed in modern IC technologies there is a need to include at least thermal noise aspects into the design flow. For this reason we developed new physical descriptions of thermal noise in <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillators</b> where we use ideas from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics as well as the Langevin approach. We illustrate our concepts by some examples...|$|R

2500|$|Spontaneous {{synchronization}} of weakly coupled pendulum clocks {{was noted}} by the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens as early as 1673. [...] Around {{the turn of the}} 19th century, Lord Rayleigh observed synchronization of weakly coupled organ pipes and tuning forks. [...] In 1919, W. H. Eccles and J. H. Vincent found that two <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillators</b> that had been tuned to oscillate at slightly different frequencies but that were coupled to a resonant circuit would soon oscillate at the same frequency. [...] Automatic synchronization of <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillators</b> was described in 1923 by Edward Victor Appleton.|$|R
500|$|McGuinn and Crosby's songs, written both {{separately}} and together, represented {{an expansion of}} the jazz influences and psychedelia that had been featured heavily on the band's previous album. [...] The song [...] "C.T.A.-102", named after the CTA-102 quasar and written by McGuinn and his science-fiction-minded friend Bob Hippard, was a whimsical, but ultimately serious song that speculated on the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life. [...] McGuinn explained the inspiration for the song in a 1973 interview with ZigZag magazine: [...] "At the time we wrote it I thought {{it might be possible to}} make contact with quasars, but later I found out that they were stars which are imploding at a tremendous velocity. They're condensing and spinning at the same time, and the nucleus is sending out tremendous amounts of radiation, some of which is audible as an electronic impulse on a computerized radio telescope. It comes out in a rhythmic pattern ... and originally, the radio astronomers who received these impulses thought they were from a life-form in space." [...] Although the band's earlier song [...] "Mr. Spaceman" [...] had been thematically similar, [...] "C.T.A.-102" [...] was a slightly more serious attempt at tackling the subject matter, highlighted by the extensive use of studio sound effects, simulated alien voices and the sound of an <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A low-frequency {{oscillator}} (LFO) is an <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillator</b> that generates a frequency below ≈20Hz. [...] This term is typically {{used in the}} field of audio synthesizers, to distinguish it from an audio frequency oscillator.|$|E

50|$|OEO is device {{where the}} phase {{noise of the}} {{oscillator}} does not increase with the frequency that is subject to other implementations by <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillators</b> such as quartz crystal oscillators, dielectric resonators, sapphire resonators or air-dielectric resonators.|$|R
5|$|Although {{they are}} {{sometimes}} included {{in the category of}} electronic organs, the majority of Hammond organs are, strictly speaking, electric or electromechanical rather than electronic organs, because the sound is produced by moving parts rather than <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillators.</b>|$|R
2500|$|An <b>{{electronic}}</b> <b>oscillator</b> is {{an electronic}} circuit {{that produces a}} periodic, oscillating electronic signal, often a sine wave or a square wave. [...] Oscillators convert direct current (DC) from a power supply to an alternating current signal. [...] They are widely used in many electronic devices. [...] Common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by radio and television transmitters, clock signals that regulate computers and quartz clocks, and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and video games.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillator</b> can be {{made from}} a {{klystron}} tube, by providing a feedback path from output to input by connecting the [...] "catcher" [...] and [...] "buncher" [...] cavities with a coaxial cable or waveguide. [...] When the device is turned on, electronic noise in the cavity is amplified by the tube and fed back from the output catcher to the buncher cavity to be amplified again. [...] Because of the high Q of the cavities, the signal quickly becomes a sine wave at the resonant frequency of the cavities.|$|E
2500|$|Beat {{frequency}} oscillator (BFO) - This is an <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillator</b> {{which is only}} found in communications receivers, used in the reception of radiotelegraph (CW) or single-sideband modulation (SSB). [...] It produces a fixed frequency offset from the IF which is mixed with the IF in the demodulator. [...] The IF and BFO frequencies produce a heterodyne (beat) in the audio range which sounds like a musical tone in the speaker. [...] In CW the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of the Morse code are audible as beeps.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the later}} Hammond organ, the Telharmonium used tonewheels to {{generate}} musical sounds as electrical signals by additive synthesis. It {{is considered to}} be the first synthetic instrument due to its ability to generate sounds electromechanically because the sound is produced by moving parts rather than <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillators.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In a klystron, an {{electron}} beam interacts with radio waves {{as it passes}} through resonant cavities, metal boxes {{along the length of}} a tube. [...] The electron beam first passes through a cavity to which the input signal is applied. [...] The energy of the electron beam amplifies the signal, and the amplified signal is taken from a cavity {{at the other end of}} the tube. [...] The output signal can be coupled back into the input cavity to make an <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillator</b> to generate radio waves. [...] The gain of klystrons can be high, 60dB (one million) or more, with output power up to tens of megawatts, but the bandwidth is narrow, usually a few percent although it can be up to 10% in some devices.|$|E
2500|$|In {{inductive}} coupling (electromagnetic induction or inductive power transfer, IPT), power is transferred between coils of wire by a magnetic field. [...] The {{transmitter and receiver}} coils together form a transformer (see diagram). An alternating current (AC) through the transmitter coil (L1) creates an oscillating magnetic field (B) by Ampere's law. [...] The magnetic field [...] passes through the receiving coil (L2), where it induces an alternating EMF (voltage) by Faraday's law of induction, which creates an alternating current in the receiver. [...] The induced alternating current may either drive the load directly, or be rectified to direct current (DC) by a rectifier in the receiver, which drives the load. [...] A few systems, such as electric toothbrush charging stands, work at [...] 50/60Hz so AC mains current is applied directly to the transmitter coil, but in most systems an <b>electronic</b> <b>oscillator</b> generates a higher frequency AC current which drives the coil, because transmission efficiency improves with frequency.|$|E
