40|$|Wild <b>hogs</b> (Sus scrofa) are {{a serious}} threat that impact natural areas, farmland, and even urban landscapes. Previous {{research}} has shown that examining the differences in the gene MC 1 R using molecular methods and the examination of the hair coat of wild <b>hogs</b> has the potential to identify wild <b>hogs</b> and hybrids from domestic species; however, this technique has also not been evaluated in such a manner that would make it useful for conservation officers and prosecutors in a court of law. Therefore, we propose to evaluate both the morphological and genetic methods as a tool for identifying wild <b>hogs</b> using the model of disease testing where the morphological methods are applied by field personnel as a screening test and the genetic methods are used in a confirmatory manner. The objective is to determine the accuracy and precision of each of these methods for identifying wild <b>hogs</b> in the US.
