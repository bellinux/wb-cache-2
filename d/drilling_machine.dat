500|$|Frink often {{tries to}} use his mad and bizarre inventions to aid the town in its crises, but they usually do not work or only make things worse. Most of his inventions never {{function}} properly or are of no real use. He is the inventor of, among other things, a frog exaggerator (which grossly misrepresents the size of amphibians), automatic tapping shoes for tap dancing, the sarcasm detector, hamburger earmuffs, the 8-month-after pill, and a <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> that can cut through anything. Some of Frink's unsuccessful inventions include his small remote-controlled plane that carries babies as passengers (it crashed), and a burglar-proof house that sprouts legs and runs away from potential danger (the legs of which collapsed causing the house to crash {{to the ground and}} catch fire). As a scientist, Frink has discovered and cured [...] "Frink's Disease" [...] and discovered the element [...] "Frinkonium". He has also mastered astrology {{to the point where he}} can use it to accurately predict the future, and has been shown to be capable of time travel.|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} commented on Frink's inventions. Patrick Goss of MSN's Tech & Gadgets wrote that [...] "When {{it comes to}} gizmos, Frink is the king", and listed the Death Ray {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} gadgets featured in The Simpsons. Although he added that it [...] "was not one of [...] most successful," [...] since it never received the funding it needed from Grampa. On the same list, Goss also featured Frink's automatic phone dialer, intra bovine ice-cream maker (an invention that is inserted into a cow and uses the four stomachs to mix the various ingredients), and hamburger earmuffs. In a profile about Frink, the publication UGO Networks wrote: [...] "Where would the town be without your Jerry Lewis/Julius Kelp-inspired voice and antics? A lot safer most likely. Professor John Frink's inventions range from distracting to disruptive. Who can forget his hamburger earmuffs? Or his teleportation device, responsible for switching Bart Simpson's head with that of a housefly?" [...] Howard Waldrop and Lawrence Person of Locus listed the scene in The Simpsons Movie that features Frink's <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> invention as one of the highlights of the film.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, Wade Dean {{formed the}} Glacier Mining Company and filed mining {{claims to the}} sulfur on Adams' [...] summit plateau. Beginning in 1932, the first {{assessment}} work was done. The initial test pits were dug by hand, but this proved to be dangerous work and an alternative was needed to drill through the up to [...] thick ice cap more safely. The answer was a diamond tipped <b>drilling</b> <b>machine,</b> but, being a heavy machine, {{it could not be}} carried up the newly completed horse and mule trail like other supplies. So it winched itself up the mountain using a series of deadman anchors. 168 pack string trips led by John Perry were made {{over the course of the}} mining activities. The crew stayed in the abandoned Forest Service lookout, a tight fit for the usual eight men and their equipment. This problem was alleviated somewhat in the later years of the project when an enclosed [...] lean-to was added to the cabin. Another smaller lean-to was added later. The conditions and weather above [...] could be incredibly variable with the highest temperature of [...] recorded 12 hours before the lowest temperature of [...] This preliminary mining continued for several years until 1937 when the last crew worked from the summit lookout. In the years following, Dean periodically attempted to restart this venture and in 1946, he and Lt. John Hodgkins made several landings by airplane on the summit ice cap. Although sulfur was found, the amount of the ore that was able to be mined in a season was only enough to make up the cost of getting it off the mountain and was not enough to be competitive. Part of this stemmed from Dean’s desire that if operations were expanded, an ore as well as passenger transport system was needed, and his desire that Adams not be significantly scarred by the operation. The project was fully abandoned in 1959. [...] Adams is the only large Cascade volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} aimed at the issue of establishment quality of winter wheat stands by different <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> in conditions of beat production area. For this purpose was made characteristic of chosen <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> aimed on technical parameters and sowing principles. In the experimental part of this thesis was the aim to evaluate quality of winter wheat stands establishment, when different <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> were used, under conditions of different agriculture companies. Under good moisture conditions in time of soil pre-sowing preparation in the autumn 2014 was evaluated better technology with ploughing, mainly from the view of soil loosening, now cloddy soil and very good quality of crop residues incorporation. In spite of this were the results of stand establishment by minimum tillage technologies very comparable with traditional technology. Under conditions of dry maize production area were evaluated yield forming elements and yields of winter wheat stands established by two <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> (Kverneland Accord and Farmet Falcon). In case of both <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> were reached comparable results in number of spikes, TGW and yields...|$|R

2500|$|The 1999 Act's reforms mean {{a number}} of old cases would be decided {{differently}} today. In Beswick v Beswick while the House of Lords held that Mrs Beswick could specifically enforce a promise of her nephew to her deceased husband to pay her £5 weekly in her capacity as administratrix of the will, the 1999 Act would also allow her to claim as a third party. In Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd {{it would have been}} possible for a stevedore firm to claim the benefit of a limitation clause in a contract between a carrier and the owner of a damaged drum of chemicals. Lord Denning dissented, arguing for abolition of the rule, and Lord Reid gave an opinion that if a bill of lading expressly conferred the benefit of a limitation on the stevedores, the stevedores give authority to the carrier to do that, and [...] "difficulties about consideration moving from the stevedore were overcome" [...] then the stevedores could benefit. In The Eurymedon, Lord Reid's inventive solution was applied where some stevedores similarly wanted the benefit of an exclusion clause after dropping a <b>drilling</b> <b>machine,</b> the consideration being found as the stevedores performing their pre-existing contractual duty {{for the benefit of the}} third party (the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> owner). Now none of this considerably technical analysis is required, given that any contract purporting to confer a benefit on a third party may in principle be enforced by the third party.|$|E
60|$|The {{actions of}} a horse when much startled are highly expressive. One day my horse was much frightened at a <b>drilling</b> <b>machine,</b> covered by a tarpaulin, and lying on an open field. He raised his head so high, that his neck became almost perpendicular; and this he did from habit, for the machine lay on a slope below, and {{could not have been}} seen with more {{distinctness}} through the raising of the head; nor if any sound had proceeded from it, could the sound have been more distinctly heard. His eyes and ears were directed intently forwards; and I could feel through the saddle the palpitations of his heart. With red dilated nostrils he snorted violently, and whirling round, would have dashed off at full speed, had I not prevented him. The distension of the nostrils is not for the sake of scenting the source of danger, for when a horse smells carefully at any object and is not alarmed, he does not dilate his nostrils. Owing to the presence of a valve in the throat, a horse when panting does not breathe through his open mouth, but through his nostrils; and these consequently have become endowed with great powers of expansion. This expansion of the nostrils, as well as the snorting, and the palpitations of the heart, are actions which have become firmly associated during a long series of generations with the emotion of terror; for terror has habitually led the horse to the most violent exertion in dashing away at full speed from the cause of danger.|$|E
