5|$|The Right to Freedom {{is covered}} in Articles 19-22, with the view of guaranteeing {{individual}} rights that were considered vital by {{the framers of the}} Constitution, and these Articles also include certain restrictions that may be imposed by the State on individual liberty under specified conditions. Article 19 guarantees six freedoms in the nature of civil rights, which are available only to citizens of India. These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted, and include national security, public order, <b>decency</b> <b>and</b> morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences, and defamation. The State is also empowered, {{in the interests of the}} general public to nationalise any trade, industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens.|$|E

25|$|Locals defended Ison {{not because}} they {{approved}} of murder and not because of an innate, clannish suspiciousness of outsiders, but because they perceived the prying eyes of reporters to be an assault on manners, common <b>decency,</b> <b>and</b> the integrity of their communities.|$|E
25|$|If a {{constitution}} no longer meets {{the exigencies of}} a society's evolving standard of <b>decency,</b> <b>and</b> the people wish to amend or replace the document, there is nothing stopping them from doing so in the manner which was envisioned by the drafters: through the amendment process.

60|$|Then came England {{with its}} luxuries <b>and</b> <b>decencies</b> <b>and</b> comforts, and Georgie Porgie walked in a {{pleasant}} dream upon pavements {{of which he}} had nearly forgotten the ring, wondering why men in their senses ever left Town. He accepted his keen delight in his furlough as the reward of his services. Providence further arranged for him another and greater delight--all the pleasures of a quiet English wooing, quite different from the brazen businesses of the East, when half the community stand back and bet on the result, and the other half wonder what Mrs. So-and- So will say to it.|$|R

It was founded in 1977 by Donald Wildmon as the National Federation for <b>Decency</b> <b>and</b> is headquartered in Tupelo, Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|Judeo-Christian is a {{term that}} groups Judaism and Christianity, either in {{reference}} to Christianity's derivation from Judaism or due to perceived parallels or commonalities shared between those two religions.. The term became prevalent towards {{the middle of the}} 20th century in the United States to link broader principles of Judeo-Christian ethics such as dignity of human life, adherence to the Abrahamic Covenant, common <b>decency,</b> <b>and</b> support of traditional family values.|$|E
25|$|If a {{constitution}} {{is to be}} interpreted {{in light of the}} evolving standards of decency, why, in most democratic countries, should the highest authority of judicial branch (e.g., the Supreme Court in U.S.) be the ones to have the final say over its interpretation? Is not the legislative branch which is elected, thereby more likely {{to be in touch with}} the current standards of <b>decency,</b> <b>and</b> therefore better placed to make such judgments? If originalism is wrong, then Marbury v. Madison—which holding underpins judicial review of constitutionality, that is, the meaning of the constitution—was wrongly decided, and two centuries of jurisprudence relying on it is thereby on shaky ground.|$|E

50|$|Clearcast {{approval}} is applied both to scripts {{and to the}} final commercials. Clearcast has to check that commercials comply with the BCAP code (rules) that applies to television advertising. These include both good taste <b>and</b> <b>decency</b> criteria, <b>and</b> also a variety of technical and even medical constraints (advertisements may not, for example, contain flashing which would set off attacks of photosensitive epilepsy).|$|R
25|$|Nudity, or nakedness, is {{the state}} of wearing no {{clothing}}. The wearing of clothing is a predominantly human characteristic arising from functional needs such as protection from the elements and from cold temperatures, after the loss of body hair, and migration to colder regions. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations, such as a need for warmth, as well as social circumstances. In some situations, a minimum amount of clothing or none at all may be considered socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing may be expected. Social considerations involve cultural issues of modesty, subjective <b>decency</b> <b>and</b> social norms, besides other considerations, and these may depend on the context. There may also be legal considerations.|$|E
25|$|The Brown {{decision}} {{was a powerful}} moral statement clad in a weak constitutional analysis; Warren was never a legal scholar {{on a par with}} Frankfurter or a great advocate of particular doctrines, as was Black. Instead, he believed that in all branches of government common sense, <b>decency,</b> <b>and</b> elemental justice were decisive, not precedent (stare decisis), tradition or the text of the Constitution. He wanted results. He never felt that doctrine alone should be allowed to deprive people of justice. He felt racial segregation was simply wrong, and Brown, whatever its doctrinal defects, remains a landmark decision primarily because of Warren's interpretation of the equal protection clause to mean that children should not be shunted to a separate world reserved for minorities.|$|E
25|$|Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Penn Warren used York as {{the model}} for {{characters}} in two of his novels, both explorations of the burden of fame faced by battlefield heroes in peacetime. In At Heaven's Gate (1943), a Tennessee mountaineer who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in World War I returns from combat, becomes a state legislator, and then a bank president. Others exploit his <b>decency</b> <b>and</b> fame for their own selfish ends as the novel explores the real-life experience of an old-fashioned hero in a cynical world. In The Cave (1959), a similar hero from a comparable background has aged and become an invalid. He struggles to maintain his identity as his real self diverges from the robust legend of his youth.|$|E

50|$|While a {{great deal}} of science fiction {{reflects}} either very optimistic or dystopian visions of the human future, the Revelation Space universe is notable in that human societies have not departed to either positive or negative extremes, but instead {{are similar to those of}} today in terms of moral ambiguity and a mixture of cruelty <b>and</b> <b>decency,</b> corruption <b>and</b> opportunity, despite their technology being dramatically advanced.|$|R

25|$|Arthur Phillip (1738–1814) {{was born}} in London on 11 October 1738 to Jacob and Elizabeth Phillip, a German {{language}} teacher and former wife of a naval captain. He was educated at the Greenwich school for the sons of seaman and completed a two-year apprenticeship in the mercantile service. His naval career began during the Seven Years' War and led to an accomplished career, which included a promotion to lieutenant. After a periodic retirement, Phillip returned to the British navy in 1778. In 1786, he was appointed the first Governor of New South Wales and Admiral of the First Fleet. He was chosen for his organisational, leadership and farming skills. He also displayed altruistic qualities, with plans to treat the Aboriginal people with <b>decency</b> <b>and</b> assist convicts with improving their lives.|$|E
25|$|In Baby Doll (1956), {{he played}} a man {{frustrated}} by a teenaged wife. The film was condemned by the Legion of <b>Decency</b> <b>and</b> did not air long. He starred in dozens of films from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, such as Fear Strikes Out (1957), Pollyanna (1960), Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), Gypsy (1962), How the West Was Won (1962), The Cincinnati Kid (1965), and Patton (1970), playing General Omar Bradley. At the 1971 Academy Awards ceremony, Malden accepted the best actor Oscar on behalf of George C. Scott, who won {{for his role as}} Patton. After Summertime Killer (1972), he appeared in the made-for-television film The Hijacking of the Achille Lauro (1989) (as Leon Klinghoffer). He directed one complete film Time Limit (1957), and when Delmer Daves took ill during the shooting of The Hanging Tree, Malden took over direction of the film for two weeks.|$|E
25|$|A soldier whose {{business}} is murder {{as a fine}} art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday <b>decency</b> <b>and</b> perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not {{come up to the}} standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches. It is bad enough if we {{have to put up with}} these, because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E
