To meet these requirements, pump mechanical behavior versus nozzle loads must be examined in detail. Others have discussed shaft end displacement of centerline mounted pumps under nozzle loads. However, the subject of stresses on the pedestal bolts and casing is a critical area that must also be analyzed. An in-depth study was made on the deformation and stress analysis of centerline mounted <b>end</b> <b>suction</b> pumps, whose stiffness were relatively low and were frequently required to withstand rather high nozzle loads. The nozzle load analysis consisted of deformation and stress measurements, combined with finite element calculation.

Efficiency improvement is viable through geometric modification to improve hydraulic characteristic.

The hydraulic Institute Concepts of low, and very high suction energy, and NPSH margin are explained and related to cavitation noise and suction pressure pulsations. Cavitation is shown to exist above the NPSHR of a centrifugal pump, and {{be related to the}} suction energy level. High suction energy pumps above a certain threshold, with low NPSH margins, can produce severe cavitation noise, especially at reduced flowrates. Test results on an <b>end</b> <b>suction</b> pump also demonstrate the interaction between the air content in the water and cavitation noise within the pump, over varying NPSH margin ratios, flowrate, and speed (energy level). A small amount of air is shown to dramatically reduce the suction pressure pulsation levels.

40|$|Lecturepg. 81 Double row {{angular contact}} ball {{bearings}} are used extensively in ANSI type <b>end</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal pumps and other fluid machinery. The double row {{angular contact ball bearing}} supports combined axial and radial loads, provides high shaft stiffness and limits {{the movement of}} the pump impeller, shaft, and seal. Recent studies, tests, and analysis of double row ball bearings operating in various conditions have both confirmed and contradicted some long held opinions, regarding the application of these bearings in centrifugal pumps. The studies indicate the Conrad type (e. g., without filling slot) double row angular contact ball bearings operate at lower temperatures than the maximum capacity failing slot type double row bearings at 3, 600 rpm rotational speed. These lower operating temperatures result in longer bearing and lubricant life and greater pump reliability. The filling slot of the modern design maximum capacity double row bearing has been redesigned so that it seldom has direct influence n the bearing life and performance when correctly applied in the pump. Double row angular contact ball bearings having moderate to high contact angle and normal axial internal clearance operate at lower temperature and have better internal motion than bearings having lower contact angles and greater clearances in typical pump application conditions. The results and conclusions of the studies made with the double row angular contact ball bearings are discussed.

In this paper, centrifugal pump is analyzed by using a single-stage <b>end</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal pump. Two main components of a centrifugal pump are the impeller and the casing. The impeller is a rotating component and the casing is a stationary component. In centrifugal pump, water enters axially through the impeller eyes and water exits radially. The pump casing is to guide the liquid to the impeller, converts into pressure the high velocity kinetic energy of the flow from the impeller discharge and leads liquid away of the energy having imparted to the liquid comes from the volute casing. A design of centrifugal pump is carried out and analyzed {{to get the best}} performance point. The design and performance analysis of centrifugal pump are chosen because it is the most useful mechanical rotodynamic machine in fluid works which widely used in domestic, irrigation, industry, large plants and river water pumping system. Moreover, centrifugal pumps are produced by manufacturing processes in Myanmar. In this paper, the pump is driven by one horse power electric motor and the design is based on Berman Method. The head and flow rate of this pump are 10 m and 0. 179 m 3 /s and the motor speed is 2900 rpm. The low specific speed is chosen because the value of specific speed is 100. The number of impeller blade is 9 blades. The performance analysis of centrifugal pump is carried out after designing the dimensions of centrifugal pump. So, shock losses, impeller friction losses, volute friction losses, disk friction losses and recirculation losses of centrifugal pump are also considered in performance analysis of centrifugal pump.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} an alternative method {{to describe the}} water retention curve over a range of water contents from saturation to oven dryness. It makes two modifications to the standard Brooks and Corey [1964] (B-C) description, one at each <b>end</b> of the <b>suction</b> range. One expression proposed by Rossi and Nimmo [1994] {{is used in the}} high-suction range to a zero residual water content. (This Rossi-Nimmo modification to the Brooks-Corey model provides a more realistic description of the retention curve at low water contents.) Near zero suction the second modification eliminates the region where there is a change in suction with no change in water content. Tests on seven soil data sets, using three distinct analytical expressions for the high-, medium-, and low-suction ranges, show that the experimental water retention curves are well fitted by this composite procedure. The high-suction range of saturation contributes little to the maximum capillary drive, defined with a good approximation for a soil water and air system as HcM = f • krw dhc, where krw is relative permeability (or conductivity) to water and h c is capillary suction, a positive quantity in unsaturated soils. As a result, the modification suggested to describe the high-suction range does not significantly affect the equivalenc...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the hypothesis that}} fish species with similar ecomorphological patterns, but from different taxonomic groups, would use similar feeding modes. We contrasted the feeding behavior of Micropterusalmoides(Lacépède) (Centrarchidae) and Cichla ocellaris(Block and Schneider) (Cichlidae), both large-mouthed piscivores with a locomotor morphology designed for fast acceleration, with Lep mispp. (Centrarchidae) and Cichlosomaseverum(Heckel) (Cichlidae), both small-mouthed predators on benthic invertebrates with a locomotor morphology designed for maneuverability. Pressure profiles in the buccal and opercular cavities were more similar for species that shared ecomorphological patterns than for species that shared phylogenetic histories. For small-mouthed predators, minimum buccal pressures were significantly greater and occurred earlier than the corresponding opercular pressures. For both large-mouthed predators, minimum buccal and opercular pressures were similar in magnitude and in timing. We developed the ram–suction index (RSI) to identify the relative contributions of ram feeding (i. e. predator movement) and of suction feeding (i. e. prey movement) to shortening the predator–prey distance during the strike.

40|$|Purpose: In this work, {{we present}} the analysis, design and {{optimization}} of one experimental device recently {{developed in the}} UK, called the 'GP' Thrombus Aspiration Device (GPTAD). This device {{has been designed to}} remove blood clots without the need to make contact with the clot itself thereby potentially reducing the risk of problems such as downstream embolisation. Method: To obtain the minimum pressure necessary to extract the clot and to optimize the device, we have simulated the performance of the GPTAD analysing the resistances, compliances and inertances effects. We model a range of diameters for the GPTAD considering different forces of adhesion of the blood clot to the artery wall, and different lengths of blood clot. In each case we determine the optimum pressure required to extract the blood clot from the artery using the GPTAD, which is attached at its proximal <b>end</b> to a <b>suction</b> pump. Result: We then compare the results of our mathematical modelling to measurements made in laboratory using plastic tube models of arteries of comparable diameter. We use abattoir porcine blood clots that are extracted using the GPTAD. The suction pressures required for such clot extraction in the plastic tube models compare favourably with those predicted by the mathematical modelling. Discussion & Conclusion: We conclude therefore that the mathematical modelling is a useful technique in predicting the performance of the GPTAD and may potentially be used in optimising the design of the device...|$|R
40|$|To {{fill the}} gap in the {{literature}} in terms of numerical studies of positive displacement (PD) pumps in a cavitating condition, a comprehensive and transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a PD pump, simulating the cavitation arising during the suction stroke, was created. The ‘full’ cavitation model was utilized to study its capability on PD pump cavitation. A set of three plunger speeds were simulated. Using the highest plunger speed, an assessment was made of the effect of 1. 5, 3, 4. 5 and 15  parts per million (ppm) of air mass fraction on pump performance and cavitation. An experimental test rig, replicating the CFD model, was designed and built in order to validate the numerical model and find its weaknesses. CFD modeled, in a consistent way, the fluid dynamics phenomena related to cavitation (the chamber pressure approaching the vapor pressure, the vaporization/condensation and the pressure spike occurrence at the <b>end</b> of the <b>suction</b> stroke marking the end of cavitation). On the other hand the CFD pressure trends calculated appeared stretched along the time axis with respect to the experimental data, and this highlighted issues in the multiphase and cavitation models: the vaporization/condensation rate calculated by CFD did not follow the real dynamics correctly because the non-condensable gas expansion was overestimated. This was seen when comparing the CFD/experimental results where the simulated pressure drop gradient {{at the beginning of the}} suction stroke and the pressure peaks as the valve closed exhibited a delay in their occurrence. The simulation results were sensitive to the dissolved air mass fraction as the delay depended on the amount of air dissolved in the water. Although the influence of the air mass fraction was considered consistent, the 3  ppm CFD case was the closest to the experimental results, whereas the analyst expected the 15  ppm case to be more accurate...|$|R
