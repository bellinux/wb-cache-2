50|$|MPEC is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> {{with because}} its {{feasible}} region {{is not necessarily}} convex or even connected.|$|R
5000|$|Anger is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with. Feelings of fear, anger, {{and guilt}} are {{expressed}} inappropriately and responses are either very volatile or inert.|$|R

5000|$|Since long runs {{of small}} non-zero digits are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with {{naturally}} (such as 1121 or 1111211), another rule set called Standard Pilish was introduced: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is perilous, and <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with. But it must {{be dealt}} with. The problem is to {{suppress}} Fenianism, and not to strengthen the Protestant confederacy." ...|$|R
30|$|In econometrics, {{measurement}} error {{is a common}} problem and also is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with. Following Brown and Tierney (2009), {{we believe that the}} likelihood of systematic bias is slim.|$|R
50|$|Bell was a fanatical enthusiast for {{his system}} and an {{intolerant}} man. He was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with {{and hard to}} work under. Nevertheless, he always got on well with children.|$|R

30|$|The coupled {{bilinear}} equation (2.6) is more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> {{with than}} a single bilinear equation due to the appearance of two equations. The following proposition {{plays an important role}} in constructing its quasi-periodic wave solutions.|$|R
3000|$|Actions {{of types}} (A) and (B) {{are not very}} hard to {{describe}} (although the latter are more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with than the former). They are given by the following theorems (see [43, 44, 49]): [...]...|$|R
50|$|At Alfa, Legs {{will always}} be temperamental and <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with, but fair. However, as the story runs we learn that Legs has more depth. She quickly becomes Nathan Never's best friend within the agency.|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a large-scale disaster, agents' decisions derive from self-interested (e. g. survival), common-good (e. g. victims' rescue) and teamwork (e. g. fire extinction) motivations. However, current decision-theoretic models are either purely individual or purely collective and find it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with motivational attitudes; on the other hand, mental-state based models find it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with uncertainty. We propose a hybrid, CvI-JI, approach that combines: i) collective 'versus' individual (CvI) decisions, founded on the Markov decision process (MDP) quantitative evaluation of joint-actions, and ii) joint-intentions (JI) formulation of teamwork, founded on the belief-desire-intention (BDI) architecture of general mental-state based reasoning. The CvI-JI evaluation explores the performance's improvemen...|$|R
50|$|However, {{from about}} 1960 Tobias found it {{increasingly}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with {{the discipline of}} the fashion world and his commissions fell off significantly. In 1966 {{he turned back to}} acting and took roles in theatre and film.|$|R
50|$|Extraneous {{solutions}} {{are not too}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with because they just require checking all solutions for validity. However, more insidious are missing solutions, which can occur when performing operations on expressions that are invalid for certain values of those expressions.|$|R
5000|$|She {{painted the}} {{circle around the}} Polish royal court and, in Paris, {{received}} numerous commissions from the local aristocracy, thanks to the reluctant influence of the king's agent, Filippo Mazzei, who felt that she had little talent and was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with.|$|R
50|$|Many homebrew programmers have <b>encountered</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{navigate}} obstacles while {{developing their}} projects {{as a result}} of the DS's relatively weak CPU and little RAM compared to PCs of the time. The introduction of the Nintendo DS Memory Expansion Pak (included with Nintendo DS Browser) and the recent inclusion of extra RAM in some Slot-2 devices (SuperCard SD/CF/Lite, EZ3-in-1), as well as the 1GB of NAND memory in the Acekard RPG, and a GBA slot expansion pack with the M3 Real has allowed programmers to overcome some of these obstacles.|$|R

After his Pittsburgh art exhibit (which Lindsay organized), Lindsay gives in and they have a brief tryst at the gallery.|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{the human}} spirit is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with, and uncomfortably explosive. At least so Richard Rosco found it when, towards {{the close of the}} day on which his enemy chased him into the dismal swamp, he sat down on a gnarled root and began to reflect.|$|R
50|$|Constant {{systematic}} {{errors are}} very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with as their effects are only observable {{if they can}} be removed. Such errors cannot be removed by repeating measurements or averaging large numbers of results. A common method to remove systematic error is through calibration of the measurement instrument.|$|R
40|$|For {{people with}} {{locomotor}} difficulties space can frequently raise insurmountable problems which {{at first sight}} may seem so trivial to able-bodied persons that they become ignored. Space is often <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with, but seldom are {{the views of the}} physically disabled acknowledged in mapping and urban design. ...|$|R
30|$|Here ·_ 2 is {{the usual}} norm in the space L_ 2 (R) and c is a {{suitable}} constant independent of u. However, this property fails when an odd order operator is considered. This fact makes their study more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with than the one delivered to even order operators.|$|R
5000|$|Seven {{years after}} Thompson's foray, only three small European caravans {{including}} his, had entered Nandi but no significant contact had been made.

It is sometimes <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with them. Of course there is no hierarchy amongst the affiliated. No rigid system." ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{is called}} the Wolfe dual problem. This problem may be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with computationally, because the {{objective}} function is not concave in the joint variables [...] Also, the equality constraint [...] is nonlinear in general, so the Wolfe dual problem is typically a nonconvex optimization problem. In any case, weak duality holds.|$|R
40|$|The usual amazement about exclamatives {{is fully}} justified, {{because it is}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with them {{exclusively}} {{from the viewpoint of}} truth-conditional semantics, and, hence, they have been an exotic object of study. Indeed, we do not even have a clear-cut definition of what constitutes an exclamative, so the term refers to a wid...|$|R
50|$|The show is filmed using high-definition cameras mounted {{within and}} outside the car. Llewellyn drives his guest to a {{destination}} of their choosing as they talk informally about various subjects.

5000|$|Because {{touching}} intersection appears rarely and is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with, {{the following}} considerations omit this case. In any case below all necessary differential conditions are presupposed. The determination of intersection points always lead to 1 or 2 non-linear equations {{which can be}} solved by a Newton iteration. A list of the appearing cases follows: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{inherent}} {{problems with}} offshore evacuation in emergencies like fire or sinking, which are problematic for ordinary crew, {{are much more}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with for divers in saturation.The methods of controlling the risks due to these hazards are usually engineering solutions, and are expensive, and often introduce secondary hazards which must also be managed.|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} of how <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the countless existing technical nutrients (synthetic materials) that cannot be recycled or reintroduced to the natural environment is dealt with in C2C design. The materials that can be reused and retain their quality can be used within the technical nutrient cycles while other materials are far more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with, such as plastics in the Pacific Ocean.|$|R
50|$|Due to the Pauli {{exclusion}} principle, electrons can {{be considered}} as non-interacting if their density does not exceed the value 1016~1017 cm−3 or electric field value 103 V/cm. However, significantly above these limits electron-electron scattering starts to dominate. Long range and nonlinearity of the Coulomb potential governing interactions between electrons make these interactions <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with.|$|R
