5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E

Albert died at 10:50p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle, in {{the presence}} of the Queen and five of their nine children. The contemporary diagnosis was typhoid fever, but modern writers have pointed out that Albert was ill for at least two years before his death, which may <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> chronic disease, such as Crohn's disease, renal failure, or abdominal cancer, was the cause of death.|$|E

5|$|Telegraph reports <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} eastern Caribbean Sea on October24. The depression moved northwestward without differentiating in intensity before making landfall near San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic with winds of 35mph (55km/h). It did not weaken while crossing Hispaniola and instead strengthened into a tropical storm shortly after emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the northwestern tip of Haiti. Late on October27, the storm re-curved north-northeastward and pass through the eastern Bahamas. Around that time, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h).|$|E
5|$|Whereas the {{dynamics}} of Jovian magnetosphere mainly depend on internal sources of energy, the solar wind probably has a role as well, particularly {{as a source of}} high-energy protons. The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind-driven magnetosphere, including a significant dawn–dusk asymmetry. In particular, magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector. In addition, the dawn magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas in the dusk magnetosphere, the field lines are closed. All these observations <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the Dungey cycle, may also be taking place in the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Blue Alert warnings, which <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> cyclone {{may affect}} the warning area within 48hours, were issued for Cyclone Rosita on the morning on 19 April. They were {{upgraded}} to a Yellow Alert– an indication that a cyclone appears inevitable to affect the warning area in 12hours– at 1 pm, then to a Red Alert– meaning the cyclone is imminent– at 8 pm. In general, residents were well informed of the warnings through the radio. Residents from the low-lying downtown areas evacuated to homes in more elevated locations. Two of the three available evacuation shelters were opened and co-ordinated by the Department of Family and Children's Services. 280people took shelter in schools, while 78 residents from Bidyadanga were evacuated to Port Hedland or Broome. The people that stayed in the settlement sheltered {{in the church and}} family homes. Staff and guests at the Eco Beach tourist resort received warnings from Rosita early on 19 April and made a timely return to Broome before the cyclone hit.|$|E

5|$|In 1922 the American film Hope, {{directed}} by Legaren à Hiller and starring Mary Astor and Ralph Faulkner, {{was based on}} the imagined origins of the painting. In it Joan, a fisherman's wife, is treated poorly by the rest of her village in her husband's absence, and has only the hope of his return to cling to. His ship returns but bursts into flames, before he is washed up safe and well on shore. The story is interspersed with scenes of Watts explaining the story to a model, and with stills of the painting. By the time the film was released, the fad for prints of Hope was long over, to the extent that references to it had become verbal shorthand for authors and artists wanting to <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> scene was set in the 1900s–1910s. Watts's reputation continued to fade as artistic tastes changed, and in 1938 the Tate Gallery removed their collection of Watts's works from permanent display.|$|E
5|$|S. angustirostris {{was one of}} {{the largest}} herbivores of the Nemegt Formation, which lacked large horned dinosaurs, but had sauropods and a more diverse {{theropod}} fauna. It coexisted with the rare hadrosaurid Barsboldia, flat-headed pachycephalosaurian Homalocephale and domed Prenocephale, the large ankylosaurid Saichania, rare saltasaurid sauropods Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia, the alvarezsaurid Mononykus, three types of troodontids including Zanabazar, several oviraptorosaurians including Rinchenia and Nomingia, the ostrich-mimics Gallimimus and Deinocheirus, therizinosaurid Therizinosaurus, tyrannosaurid relative Bagaraatan, and the tyrannosaurid Tarbosaurus. Unlike other Mongolian formations like the well-known Djadochta Formation that includes Velociraptor and Protoceratops, the Nemegt is interpreted as being well-watered, like the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. When examined, the rock facies of the Nemegt formation suggest the presence of stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Sediments also <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> rich habitat existed, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain Cretaceous dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Structure C8 is a {{residential}} compound that was accessed from the alley {{running to the}} East Plaza from behind Pyramid C1. The entrance opened onto the alley from a patio situated in the southern portion of the compound. This patio was surrounded on the east, west and north sides by rooms, with the alley to the south. It was floored with stucco and Structure C8 was the only stuccoed residential building {{in the whole of}} the city. The north range of rooms backed directly onto the ravine immediately to the north of Group C; the lower portion of the walls of the west room and of half of the north room still stand. The west room was square while the north room was narrow and probably extended the entire width of the patio. Wear marks in the stucco floor <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> door once accessed the north room from the west. The workmanship of Structure C8 was of very high quality and indicates that it was the residence of a member of the city's elite. Its proximity to the large pyramid-temple C1 has led archaeologist Henri Lehmann to speculate that it was once the house of the high priest.|$|E

5|$|The West Cornwall Covered Bridge (an earlier {{incarnation}} {{was known}} as the Hart Bridge) is a wooden covered lattice truss bridge carrying the Sharon-Goshen Turnpike over the Housatonic River in the town of Cornwall, Connecticut. Records <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> bridge may have been in place in this location as early as 1762. A previous bridge was destroyed in the flood of 1837 and a new bridge was constructed in 1841. This bridge would also be destroyed and the current bridge would be completed circa 1864. Utilizing the central pier from the previous incarnation, despite the Town lattice being able to withstand the weight and single span, the bridge has two spans. The later addition of queen trusses and supports gives the bridge an unusual appearance. Modernization of the bridge in 1968 and 1973 has continued to let the bridge handle traffic. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The marble was quarried from Mt. Pentelikon {{and transported}} 19km to the acropolis of Athens. A {{persistent}} {{question has been}} whether it was carved in situ. Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds {{it is easier to}} move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a crowbar to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges. No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style, however, Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given. It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion. Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as Poseidon’s trident and the laurel in Apollo’s hand. The many drill holes found in Hera’s and Apollo's heads <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.|$|E
5|$|Within the Australian {{region in}} the Southern Hemisphere between 90°E– 160°E, a {{tropical}} cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to continue. The Indonesian Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika names systems that develop between the Equator and 10°S and 90°E and 141°E, while Papua New Guinea's National Weather Service names systems that develop between the Equator and 10°S and 141°E and 160°E. Outside of these areas, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology names systems that develop into tropical cyclones. If a name is assigned to a tropical cyclone that causes loss of life or significant damage and disruption to {{the way of life}} of a community, then the name assigned to that storm is retired from the list of names for the region. A replacement name is then submitted to the next World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting.|$|E
