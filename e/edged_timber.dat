40|$|Communication first opresented at the IV France-Russia Conference New Achievements in Materials and Environmental Sciences, NAMES' 10, 26 - 29 October 2010, Nancy, FranceInternational audienceThis {{presentation}} {{is the first}} phase of a more complete study about the interest of the use of an X-ray scanner {{in the context of a}} planing mill. This scanner, placed upstream to edging phases of concerned wood products (unedged timber, square <b>edged</b> <b>timber),</b> allows to make visible not perceptible defect of the material by the human operator eye. These new knowledge in correlation with rough materials has to allow an improvement of the valuation of the end products, but also has to indicate the improvement tracks of the production installation. Our first tries aim at validating this hypothesis...|$|E
50|$|On the {{northern}} {{side of the}} building is the cantilevered steel framed platform awning with bull-nose front <b>edge.</b> Two <b>timber</b> sash windows are located along {{the northern}} {{side of the building}}.|$|R
50|$|The shelter shed has a {{rectangular}} hipped roof, clad in corrugated iron {{and supported by}} square posts. Decorative arches span between the posts and a solid balustrade runs along {{the north and south}} <b>edges</b> with <b>timber</b> bench seating along the inner face.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true. But yesterday, when I rode {{up to the}} <b>edge</b> of this <b>timber,</b> I {{caught sight}} of {{something}} that looked {{very much like the}} white mustang." ...|$|R
50|$|A bitumened road <b>edged</b> with <b>timber</b> posts {{supporting}} timber cross boards forms a U-shape track {{through the}} park. Grassed areas to centre and verges of internal road accommodate timber picnic tables and seats - one set sheltered by a gabled roof. There is a discreet camping {{area to the}} northwest and a carparking area off the internal road to the west.|$|R
60|$|Dick was willing, and, as a consequence, by {{the time}} the <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber</b> was reached, the sun was sinking over the hills in the West, and it was growing dark.|$|R
60|$|There was a rattle and a rush, and a five-plough cultivator, blades in {{air like}} so many teeth, trundled itself at us round the <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber,</b> fuming and {{sparking}} furiously.|$|R
50|$|The public bar area, now {{one large}} {{room on the}} {{principal}} corner of the building, features a timber bar in the corner opposite the entrance. The walls are lined with timber panelling to two metres, braced and <b>edged</b> with <b>timber</b> mouldings. High quality timber joinery surrounds the windows and doors in the bar. The remaining ground floor areas are substantially altered from original form.|$|R
5000|$|In 1902 three men, Ted Baker, Jim McMillan and [...] "Wattie" [...] Joiner {{built the}} wooden {{stairway}} that zigzagged {{its way from}} the top of the gorge to the water's <b>edge.</b> All <b>timber</b> used in this dangerous and mammoth task was hand dressed with an axe and adze by this trio. The original stairway was used until 1932, when it was declared unsafe and partly demolished.|$|R
50|$|For the wharves, a {{reinforced}} concrete base was {{laid on the}} rock at the river's <b>edge,</b> with <b>timber</b> piles rammed into the riverbed. Large hardwood timbers {{were used for the}} walings and decking, which extended about 24 feet (8 metres) out over the river. Hundreds of thousands of feet of timber (mostly hardwoods such as ironbark, blue gum, yellow stringybark, spotted gum and messmate) were required to build the berths.|$|R
60|$|He {{was just}} {{dragging}} {{the last of}} the wood up to the fire when a sudden yelping broke upon his ears. Looking up, he saw a lone wolf standing at the <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber,</b> gazing fixedly at him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yep. Bill Weeks rode down. He said a {{bunch of}} I.W.W.'s were campin' above Blue Spring. Thet means they've moved {{on down to the}} <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber</b> an' oncomfortable near our wheat. Bill says they're killin' our stock fer meat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{in favor}} of heading southwest. It may mean an extra hundred miles, or more, but it would bring us nearer the Stony village, and {{afterward}} the logging camp on the <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber,</b> where we might get supplies." ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "core" [...] of {{the house}} has high timber lined ceilings, and timber lined floors and walls with picture rails throughout. The house {{contains}} fine detailing, including cedar joinery, etched and coloured glass windows, timber ceiling roses, mouldings and marble fireplaces with hand-painted tiles. The corridors have fine cedar arches with scalloped <b>edges.</b> The <b>timber</b> sash windows have frosted edging with patterned corners. Several fanlights also have coloured glass. Timber French doors open onto the verandahs.|$|R
5000|$|... {{a wooden}} [...] "screen" [...] made of fencing {{material}} with all vertical <b>timbers</b> <b>edge</b> to edge. This was placed between the single track running {{line and the}} military station. Its purpose {{was said to be}} to prevent horses being frightened by the sight of passing locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|Commins Coch Halt {{railway station}} was a station in Commins Coch, Powys, Wales. The station opened on 19 October 1931 and closed on 14 June 1965. The halt was located between the railway and the A470 road and {{consisted}} of a short <b>timber</b> <b>edged</b> platform and a waiting shelter.|$|R
60|$|Dan nodded, {{and both}} drew {{closer to the}} barrier with their guns. But before they could level their firearms, there came {{a report from the}} <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber</b> next to the burn, and one of the Indians was heard to yell in mortal agony and fall on the doorstep.|$|R
60|$|On {{two sides}} of him were forest lands, on the third a slope of rocks and on the fourth a stretch of dwarf grass. The trail, if such it could be called, ran along the <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber.</b> Should he follow this? He moved along slowly, {{wondering}} whether he was right or wrong.|$|R
60|$|Darkness was {{settling}} {{down over the}} <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber</b> belt that cuts off the prairie from the desolate barrens. In the fading light the straggling wood wore a dreary, forbidding look. The spruces were gnarled and twisted by the wind, {{a number of them}} were dead, and many leaned unsymmetrically athwart each other.|$|R
50|$|A {{jack plane}} is the {{general-purpose}} bench plane, used for general smoothing of the <b>edges,</b> sizing of <b>timber</b> but only making it smaller to correct size - wood edge jointing. Jack planes are about 12-15 inches long, and the blade can have either a slightly curved edge for smoothing stock, or {{a straight edge}} for jointing stock.|$|R
50|$|In architecture, an arris is {{the sharp}} edge {{formed by the}} {{intersection}} of two surfaces, such as {{the corner of a}} masonry unit; the <b>edge</b> of a <b>timber</b> in timber framing; the junction between two planes of plaster or any intersection of divergent architectural details. Also the raised edges which separate the flutings in a Doric column.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{permanent}} white settler in Newton Township was a Joseph Austin, {{who built}} a cabin [...] "by a spring at the <b>edge</b> of some <b>timber</b> in the township" [...] sometime before or during 1847. The first election {{was held in}} the southern part of the township in August 1854. Many early settlers of the area were from Ireland.|$|R
6000|$|As we {{took their}} {{trail in the}} cool of the next morning, we found the horses had taken the back trail till they reached an open hillside, and had climbed to the very <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber.</b> There they were all in a bunch, with the {{exception}} of [...] "Major Grunt," [...] of whom we had no trace.|$|R
50|$|Situated {{some two}} miles from Dunsford village, the halt {{consisted}} of a single <b>timber</b> <b>edged</b> platform {{on the south side}} of the line 100ft in length and a typical basic flat roofed corrugated Great Western Railway iron shelter. It was replaced by a concrete platform after WW2. Dunsford was built some years after the stations on the line in attempt to compete against the new bus services.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{determination}} of conversion factors of stacked timber which originates from Norway spruce. Different assortments were produced and processed by the "Petra s. r. o. " joint-stock company. Determined factors are compared to the one which are used in contracts of "LČR s. p. " ("The forests of the Czech Republic, JSC"). The determination of the coefficients was done using digital photographs of individual timber stocks {{with the help of the}} "picture analysis method" in the Adobe Photoshop CS 5 Extended computer program. The results of this thesis are as follows: determination of the reason for various conversion factors used with various selections, the influence of the <b>edge</b> of <b>timber</b> stock and proposal for changes in storing and measuring of stacked timber...|$|R
50|$|The {{detached}} {{kitchen is}} situated approximately 10 metres to the north-west of the house, connected {{to it by}} a concrete path. It is a timber-framed building elevated on low timber stumps and has a hipped roof, the ridgeline of which runs almost perpendicular {{to that of the}} main house. The roof is clad in corrugated iron sheeting. An approximately 1.5 metre wide verandah encircles the building on three sides. The main roof covers these areas and is supported at each <b>edge</b> by <b>timber</b> posts. On the northern elevation the plane of the roof does not extend over the end wall, which is of brick with two separate chimneys and a stove alcove, which has a skillion roof clad in corrugated iron sheeting.|$|R
40|$|Australians {{are some}} of the highest water {{consumers}} per capita in the world. Australia’s natural water resources are continuing to dry out and exceed sustainable extraction limits. As the population of Western Australia continues to grow so too does the pressure on current water resources and water demand. Seeking alternate water sources as a solution for fit-for-purpose end uses will help to reduce WA’s reliance on mains water, reduce discharge of wastewater into sewers and obtain sustainability in the water industry. This project focuses on the pre-commissioning stages for the <b>Timbers</b> <b>Edge</b> Greywater Treatment System which was built in 2004, but never commissioned due to bankruptcy of the land developer. The system treats and recycles the residential greywater to irrigate the 1. 8 ha of public open spaces at <b>Timbers</b> <b>Edge</b> via subsurface dripline irrigation. The treatment system has the design capacity to treat 48 kL/day of greywater (excluding kitchen) from all residential homes in the <b>Timbers</b> <b>Edge</b> Residential Village. There are currently around 210 homes built, with a maximum of 260 lots. The collected water passes through a lint filter, four constructed wetlands (totalling a treatment area of 1, 105 m 2), two 10 kL Envirophos tanks (which acts to absorb excess phosphorous), and a chlorine dosing system before being used for irrigation at a design application rate of 17 ML per annum. Ground-truthing was completed to verify the design documentation with the in-situ installation and a number of needed repairs and rectifications were identified. Subsequently, all repair and maintenance issues concerning the <b>Timbers</b> <b>Edge</b> Greywater Treatment System have been rectified and resolved in line with the WA Department of Health and AS 1547 requirements. A chlorine dosing system has been installed to the irrigation tank’s pump. The constructed wetlands will require planting of native species in autumn of 2017 to give the seedlings the best chance of survival after rehoming. The species selected to be replanted are Schoenoplectus validus and Baumea articulata. In order for this system to pass its commissioning stage, a Recycled Water Quality Management Plan is required to be submitted to and approved by the Department of Health and the preliminary documentation has been drafted. There is still more research required into the field of greywater treatment through constructed wetlands and also the treatment role which native plants provide; future research recommendations are listed in this paper...|$|R
60|$|The {{light was}} fading {{down in the}} deep rift when, winding round a spur through a tangle of {{clinging}} underbrush, they saw the timber thin off ahead. In a few minutes Vane stopped with an exclamation, and Carroll, overtaking him, loosened his pack. They stood upon the <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber,</b> but {{in front of them}} a mass of soil and stones ran up almost vertically to a great outcrop of rock high above.|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} {{timber frame}} joinery, mortises and tenons were typically two {{inches wide and}} two inches from the <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber</b> when working with softwoods, giving rise to {{the width of the}} blade. Likewise, mortises and tenons were traditionally one and a half inches wide when working in hardwoods, explaining the width of the tongue. This allowed for quick layouts of mortise and tenon joints when working both hard and softwoods.|$|R
3000|$|The {{heartwood}} area percentage (HWP) on the transverse {{face of the}} boxed-heart square timber {{was calculated}} from the heartwood radius and timber dimensions. When the heartwood portion corresponded to the maximum inscribed circle, the HWP was 78.5  %. The moisture content of the heartwood (MCHW) and the basic density (BD) were measured using small blocks cut at 20  mm intervals from the pith to the <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber</b> and then averaged. The longitudinal shrinkage (α [...]...|$|R
3000|$|R) {{from the}} green to {{oven-dry}} condition were measured at 30 – 40  mm (i) and 60 – 70  mm (ii) from the pith (suffix i and ii indicate the distances from the pith) using small clear samples. The radial positions i and ii corresponded to the <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber</b> of dimensions 80 and 140 / 120  mm. The dimensions of the small clear samples were 5 (T) ×  20 – 30 (R) ×  50 – 60 (L) mm for α [...]...|$|R
50|$|Captain Stewart, {{in command}} of a {{squadron}} of Union cavalry left Norfolk, Missouri in the morning, consisting of a small detachment of his own company, Captain Langen's company, and Captain Pfaff's company. They engaged the cavalry of the Missouri State Guard at the Hunter farm, near the <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber,</b> surrounded and captured a portion of them. Captain Stewart returned at 5 o'clock p.m. with 4 prisoners, 4 horses and reported some 10 or 12 killed, several wounded; 1 horse lost.|$|R
50|$|Alexander and James Brownlie came to {{the area}} in August 1838, having {{followed}} the Mississippi River {{to the mouth of}} the Wapsipinicon River, then west along its banks. The two purchased a nearby timber ridge from a man named coats, settling the claim for $160 plus timberland and all the prairie they wished to own. The first log cabin was built shortly thereafter, in a cluster of trees at the east <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber,</b> just south of the original townsite.|$|R
40|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{effective}} nature protection within many forested areas is not to touch the forests at all; {{but in most cases}} this is not an option, as humans want to put forests to a variety of uses. Thus in multi-purpose forests the target is to utilize forest resources in ways that are compatible with nature conservation. Good management planning can ensure that this is achieved as far as possible. Well-managed forest <b>edges</b> benefit both <b>timber</b> production, forest health and resilience, game, and biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} study for {{implementation of a}} novel truss node is presented. For this purpose, the load-slip behaviour of double-shear loaded single large dowel joints was investigated. Out {{of a total of}} 26 laboratory shear tests, 5 were performed on non-reinforced specimens. The remaining 21 tests were performed on specimens reinforced by means of self-tapping screws. All laboratory tests were conducted under monotonic quasi-static loading. The distance between the dowel and the loaded <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber</b> element was considerably smaller than the minimum distance suggested by building codes. The influence of both i) the placement and ii) the diameter of the reinforcing screws on the load-slip behaviour of the joint was studied. The study shows that the scatter in test results is considerably reduced when reinforcing screws are used. The study also shows that the reinforcing screws prevent the joint to fail due to premature splitting. Thus, due to the presence of the reinforcing screws, no reduction of load-carrying capacity of the dowel caused by the short distance between dowel and loaded <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber</b> element needs to be applied. Further, the reinforced specimens exhibited a very ductile load-slip behaviour and - after the first drop in the load-slip curve occurred - the joints still showed a significant reserve of load-carrying capacity...|$|R
60|$|One morning, the Swift One {{not having}} {{put in an}} appearance, Lop-Ear and I were down {{at the mouth of}} the slough playing on the logs. We had {{scarcely}} got out on the water, when we were startled by a roar of rage. It was Red-Eye. He was crouching on the <b>edge</b> of the <b>timber</b> jam and glowering his hatred at us. We were badly frightened, for here was no narrow-mouthed cave for refuge. But the twenty feet of water that intervened gave us temporary safety, and we plucked up courage.|$|R
