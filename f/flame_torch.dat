Will appears {{in the nick of}} time and uses a <b>flame</b> <b>torch</b> to cause a distraction, which allows the Doctor, Hampden, Woolsey and Tegan to escape and get back to the TARDIS. The Doctor locks the signal conversion unit on the frequency of the psychic energy feeding the Malus, hoping to be able to direct it.

The Doctor succeeds in blocking the energy, and the projection of the Malus in the TARDIS dies. The real Malus, in an act of desperation, attempts to drain as much psychic energy from the villagers as possible. He creates a corporeal projection of three roundheads who try to kill the Doctor, Woolsey, Tegan, Turlough, Hampden, Verney and Will. However, the dazed and confused trooper stumbles from the TARDIS and into the main church area, becomes surrounded by the roundheads, and they decapitate him then vanish.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} part of the {{experimental}} investigation on the feasibility of inverse diffusion flame (IDF) for impingement heating. This part is aimed to identify the favorable IDF structure for impingement heating. Seven IDF structures have been observed altogether. Among them the favorable flame structure for impingement heating is identified to comprise a short base diffusion flame and a long premixed <b>flame</b> <b>torch,</b> separated by a contracted flame neck, which acts as a mixing zone for air and fuel and stabilizes the premixed <b>flame</b> <b>torch.</b> This unique flame structure allows the IDF to possess the advantages of both premixed and diffusion flames, with no flashback, high flame temperature and less or no soot emission.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the layer by layer (LbL) {{technique}} has been adopted {{for the construction of}} hybrid organic-inorganic nanoarchitectures capable of adapting to extreme heat or flame exposure and chemically evolving into thermally-stable carbon based structures. More specifically, the LbL has been applied to an open cell poly(urethane) (PU) foam in order to increase its thermal and flame stability. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the LbL assembly covered each surface of the PU complex three-dimensional structure without altering its open cell morphology. When exposed to a direct flame, the treated PU foam was capable of stopping combustion within few seconds after ignition, unlike the untreated foam that burned completely. Under different irradiative heat fluxes (from 35 up to 75 kW/m 2), the coating demonstrated exceptional performances by reducing the rate of heat release up to 60 % with respect to the untreated counterpart. Finally, when subjected to a <b>flame</b> <b>torch</b> penetration (Tflame‚âà 1300 ¬∞C), the LbL-coated PU foam was capable of maintaining its three-dimensional structure, thus successfully insulating the unexposed side (T below 100 ¬∞C after two <b>flame</b> <b>torch</b> applications) with temperature drops of 800 ¬∞C achieved with a specimen thickness of only 10 m...|$|E
