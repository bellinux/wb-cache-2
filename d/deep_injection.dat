Lymphoscintigraphy identifies up to one-third of breast cancer patients with extra-axillary drainage, which is mainly located in the IM chain. Our aim in this meta-analysis is to identify the lymphoscintigraphy technique variables that effect IM node identification. M ethods: An internet database was utilized to review articles concerning sentinel nodes and breast cancer from 1993 {{through the end of}} 2011; 74 articles met our inclusion criteria. The total number of patients included was 22959. We grouped the citations by injection location and injection material. We then analyzed the rate of identification of IM nodes according to these groupings and their subsets. Results: The overall IM identification rate using the random effect model was 9 %. The injection location had the most significant impact on IM identification rate; the <b>deeper</b> <b>injections</b> were associated with the highest rate of identification. Variation in IM identification was associated with the particle size of injection material; the smaller particle size group had a higher rate of identification. Increased dose of the tracer was also associated with increased identification rate. Conclusions: The use of smaller particle size tracers and a <b>deeper</b> <b>injection</b> location achieve the highest IM identification rate. The dose of the tracer also increased the identification rate. These observations can help in the selection of patients for IM sentinel node biopsy, which can affect their prognosis and treatment management. </p...|$|R

The well was cased and sealed to a depth of 11,975 feet (3650 m), with the remaining 70 feet (21 m) left as an open hole for the injection of Basin F liquids. For testing purposes, the well was injected with approximately 568,000 US gallons (2150 m³) of city water prior to injecting any waste. The injected fluids had very little potential for reaching the surface or usable groundwater supply since the injection point had 11,900 feet (3630 m) of rock above it and was sealed at the opening. The Army discontinued use of the well in February 1966 because the fluid injection triggered a series of earthquakes in the area.

50|$|A July 2013 {{study by}} US Geological Survey {{scientist}} William Ellsworth links earthquakes to wastewater injection sites. In {{the four years}} from 2010-2013 the number of earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater in the central and eastern United States increased dramatically. After decades of a steady earthquake rate (average of 21 events/year), activity increased starting in 2001 and peaked at 188 earthquakes in 2011, including a record-breaking 5.7-magnitude earthquake near Prague, Oklahoma which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in Oklahoma. USGS scientists have found that at some locations the increase in seismicity coincides with the injection of wastewater in deep disposal wells. Injection-induced earthquakes {{are thought to be}} caused by pressure changes due to excess fluid injected deep below the surface and are being dubbed “man-made” earthquakes. On September 3, 2016, a 5.8-magnitude earthquake occurred near Pawnee, Oklahoma, followed by nine aftershocks between magnitudes 2.6 and 3.6 within three and one-half hours.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine if}} tin could be removed from liquid steel by a combination of <b>deep</b> <b>injection</b> of calcium and a reducing top-slag practice. The work was carried out in three stages: injection of Ca wire into 35 Kg heats in an induction furnace under laboratory condition; a fundamental study of the solubility of Sn in the slag as a function of oxygen potential, temperature and slag composition; and, two full-scale plant trials. During the first stage, it was found that 7 to 50 % of the Sn was removed from initial Sn contents of 0. 1 %, using 8 to 16 Kg of calcium per tonne of steel. The Sn solubility study suggested that low oxygen potential, high basicity of the slag and lower temperature would aid Sn removal by <b>deep</b> <b>injection</b> of Ca in the bath. However, two full-scale trials at the LMF station in Dofasco's plant showed virtually no Sn removal, mainly because of very low Ca consumption rates used (0. 5 to 1. 1 Kg/tonne vs. 8 to 16 Kg/tonne used during the induction furnace study in the laboratory). Based on the current price of Ca, addition of 8 to 16 Kg/tonne of steel to remove Sn is too cost prohibitive, and therefore, it is not worthwhile to pursue this process further, even though it may be technically feasible...|$|E

However, in oocytes permeabilized to Ca 2 + by the ionophore A 23187 in a Ca 2 +-free solution, the potentiation completely disappears after 30 min. It is proposed that the injected Ca 2 + is largely taken up by the stores, whereas following the second injection, a higher proportion of Ca 2 + reaches the membrane, since the stores are already loaded. In ionophore-treated oocytes, the stores lose the accumulated Ca 2 + over several minutes and are then ready to take up Ca 2 + again, hindering its arrival at the membrane...|$|R
