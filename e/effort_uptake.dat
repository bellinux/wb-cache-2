40|$|BackgroundFollow-up of HIV-exposed {{children}} for the delivery of prevention of mother-to-child transmission services and for early {{diagnosis and treatment of}} HIV infection is critical to their survival. Despite <b>efforts,</b> <b>uptake</b> of postnatal care for these children remains low in many sub-Saharan African countries. MethodsA qualitative study was conducted in three provinces in Mozambique to identify motivators and barriers to improve uptake of and retention in HIV prevention, care and treatment services for HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children. Participant recommendations were also gathered. Individual interviews (n 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 = 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 03079) and focus group discussions (n 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 = 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 03032) were conducted with parents/caregivers, grandmothers, community leaders and health care workers. Using a socioecological framework, the main themes identified were organized into multiple spheres of influence, specifically at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, community and policy levels. ResultsStudy participants reported factors such as seeking care outside of the conventional health system and disbelief in test results as barriers to use of HIV services. Other key barriers included fear of disclosure at the interpersonal level and poor patient flow and long waiting time at the institutional level. Key facilitators for accessing care included having hope for children 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s future, symptomatic illness in children, and the belief that health facilities were the appropriate places to get care. ConclusionsThe results suggest that individual-level factors are critical drivers that influence the health-seeking behavior of caregivers of HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children in Mozambique. Noted strategies are to provide more information and awareness on the benefits of early pediatric testing and treatment with positive messages that incorporate success stories, to reach more pregnant women and mother-child pairs postpartum, and to provide counseling during tracing visits. Increasing uptake and retention may be achieved by improving patient flow at the institutional level at health facilities, by addressing concerns with family decision makers, and by working with community leaders to support the uptake of services for HIV-exposed {{children for}} essential preventive care. 462 /CCU 1234541 - 04 /PHS HHS/United StatesPEPFAR/United States 2014 - 12 - 03 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 25467030 PMC 426543...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDespite {{research}} <b>efforts,</b> cell <b>uptake</b> processes determining siRNA silencing efficiency remain unclear. Here, {{we examine}} the relationship between in vitro cell culture models, cellular trafficking and siRNA silencing efficiency to provide a mechanistic insight on siRNA delivery system design. Model siRNA-polyplexes, based on chitosan as a ‘classical’ condensing agent, were applied to a panel of lung epithelial cell lines, H 1299, A 549 and Calu- 3 and cell internalization levels, trafficking pathways and gene silencing assessed on exposure to pharmacological inhibitors. The data reveal striking differences in the internalization behaviour and gene silencing efficiency in the tested cell lines, despite their common lung epithelial origins. The model system’s silencing was lower where clathrin internalization pathway predominated in Calu- 3, relative to silencing in H 1299  cells where a non-clathrin internalization appears dominant. Increased silencing on endosomal disruption was apparent in Calu- 3  cells, but absent when cellular internalization was not predominantly clathrin-mediated in A 549  cells. This highlights that identifying cell trafficking pathways before incorporation of functional components to siRNA delivery systems (e. g. endosomolytic compounds) is crucial. The study hence stresses the importance of selection of appropriate cell culture model, relevant to in vivo target, to assess the gene silencing efficiency and decide which functionalities the ‘stratified siRNA silencing vector’ requires...|$|R

Methods: Twelve cyclists performed a maximal ramp test followed by three TTE and three TT efforts interspersed by a 60 -min recovery between <b>efforts.</b> Oxygen <b>uptake</b> was measured during all trials. The mean response time (MRT) was calculated as {{a description of}} the overall V ̇O 2 kinetic response from the onset to 2 min of exercise. Results: TTE determined CP was 279 ± 52 W and TT determined CP was 276 ± 50 W (P = 0. 237). Values of W were 14. 3 ± 3. 4 kJ (TTE W') and 16. 5 ± 4. 2 kJ (TT W') (P = 0. 028). Whilst a high level of agreement (- 12 to 17 W) and a low prediction error of 2. 7 % was established for CP, for W limits of agreements were markedly lower (- 8 to 3. 7 kJ) with a prediction error of 18. 8 %. The mean standard error for TTE CP values was significantly higher than that for TT CP values (2. 4 ± 1. 9 % vs. 1. 2 ± 0. 7 % W).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The UK is {{embarking on}} a {{national}} cardiovascular risk assessment programme called NHS Health Checks; {{in order to be}} effective, high and equitable uptake is paramount. METHODS: A cross-sectional study, using data extracted from electronic medical records of persons aged 35 - 74 years estimated to be at a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, to examine the uptake of the Health Checks using logistic regression and statin prescribing. RESULTS: A total of 44. 8 % of high risk patients invited for a Health Check attended. Uptake was lower among younger men but higher among patients from south Asian (AOR = 1. 71 [1. 29 - 2. 27] compared with white) or mixed ethnic backgrounds (AOR = 2. 42 [1. 50 - 3. 89]), and patients registered with smaller practices (AOR = 2. 53 [1. 09 - 5. 84] < 3000 patients compared with 3000 - 5999). The percentage of patients confirmed to be at high risk of CVD prescribed a statin increased from 24. 7 to 44. 8 %.

Targeting <b>efforts</b> to increase <b>uptake</b> and adherence to interventions in high risk populations and reinvesting resources into population wide strategies to reduce obesity, smoking and salt intake may prove more cost-effective in reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease in the UK...|$|R
40|$|Aims Evidence {{supporting}} yearly {{influenza vaccination}} {{in patients with}} chronic heart failure (HF) is limited, consequently leading to inconsistent guideline recommendations. We aimed to investigate the impact of influenza vaccination on the risk of hospitalisation in HF patients. Methods and results We used linked primary and secondary health records in England between 1990 and 2013. Using a self-controlled case series design with conditional Poisson regression, we estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR, 95 % CI) {{of the number of}} hospitalisations in a year following vaccination with an adjacent vaccination-free year in the same individuals. We found the uptake of vaccination to be varied and generaly low (49 % in 2013). Among 59, 202 HF patients, influenza vaccination was associated with a lower risk of hospitalisation due to cardiovascular disease (0. 73 [0. 71, 0. 76]), with more modest effects for hospitalisation due to respiratory infections (0. 83 [0. 77, 0. 90]), and all-cause hospitalisations (0. 96 [0. 95, 0. 98]). The relative effects were somewhat greater in younger patients but with no material difference between men and women. In validation analyses, effects were not significant for consecutive years without vaccination (0. 96 [0. 92, 1. 00]) or hospitalisation due to cancer (1. 02 [0. 84, 1. 22]).

These novel guidelines for children and youth aged 5 - 17 years respect the natural and intuitive integration of movement behaviours across the whole day (24 -h period). The development process was guided by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument and systematic reviews of evidence informing the guidelines were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Four systematic reviews (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, integrated behaviours) examining the relationships between and among movement behaviours and several health indicators were completed and interpreted by expert consensus. Complementary compositional analyses were performed using Canadian Health Measures Survey data to examine the relationships between movement behaviours and health indicators. A stakeholder survey was employed (n = 590) and 28 focus groups/stakeholder interviews (n = 104) were completed to gather feedback on draft guidelines.

40|$|BACKGROUND: HIV {{pre-exposure}} prophylaxis (PrEP) is a prescription antiretroviral medication that an HIV-negative {{person who is}} {{at high risk for}} HIV infection takes once per day to prevent infection. The most recent National HIV/AIDS Strategy identifies increasing PrEP uptake among {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) as a pillar of ending the AIDS epidemic. Extant literature suggests that barriers to PrEP uptake among MSM are related to access, stigma, and knowledge/attitudes. METHODS: From February-March 2016, semi-structured interviews were conducted with researchers and practitioners in the HIV prevention field who work with MSM in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (n= 11). An interview guide was used that asked about PrEP barriers and ways to mitigate these barriers. Interview recordings were transcribed and analyzed for key themes using ATLAS. ti software. RESULTS: The original list of 39 codes was condensed into five key themes. The five key themes are that PrEP is empowering; PrEP barriers are multidimensional and overlapping; episodic PrEP is viewed favorably; PrEP needs, access, and perceptions differ by race and age; and risk compensation is real, but it should not be used to prohibit PrEP uptake. A list of all PrEP barriers identified in the interviews is presented. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE: For public health practice, participants in these interviews identified stigma as more significant of a barrier to PrEP uptake for MSM than its discussion in the existing literature would suggest. PrEP enhancement efforts should simultaneously target multiple barriers across constructs for maximum effectiveness, avoid shaming overtones, and be inclusive of black MSM. A table is presented that may serve as a map to intervention design. Research is needed to test the association of PrEP use and STI incidence in US-based samples, to fine-tune local PrEP <b>uptake</b> <b>efforts</b> in other regions, and to monitor unintended consequences of PrEP uptake in the near or distant future...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} evaluate, in adults, the {{efficacy}} of the Oxygen Uptake Efficiency Slope (OUES), an index of cardiopulmonary functional reserve that can be based upon a submaximal exercise <b>effort.</b> BACKGROUNDMaximal oxygen <b>uptake</b> (O 2 max), the most reliable measure of exercise capacity, is seldom attained in standard exercise testing. The OUES, which relates oxygen uptake to total ventilation during exercise, was proposed by Baba and coworkers (7) in a study of pediatric cardiac patients. They felt this submaximal index of cardiopulmonary reserve might be more practical than O 2 max and more appropriate than the commonly used peak oxygen consumption (O 2 peak). METHODSTreadmill exercise tests with simultaneous respiratory gas measurement were performed in 998 older subjects free of clinically recognized cardiovascular disease and 12 male patients with congestive heart failure. During incremental exercise, oxygen uptake was plotted against the logarithm of total ventilation, and the OUES was determined. RESULTSThe OUES, when calculated only from the first 75 % of the exercise test, differed by 1. 9 % from the OUES calculated from 100 % of exercise time in subjects with a peak respiratory exchange rate ≥ 1. 10. On serial tests the OUES was less variable than exercise duration or O 2 peak. It correlated strongly with O 2 max, with forced expiratory volume in 1 s and negatively with a history of current smoking. The OUES declined linearly with age in both women and men. A small sample of patients with congestive heart failure had OUES values much lower than those of older subjects without cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONSThe OUES is an objective, reproducible measure of cardiopulmonary reserve that does not require a maximal exercise effort. It integrates cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and respiratory function into a single index that is largely influenced by pulmonary dead space ventilation and exercise-induced lactic acidosis...|$|R

Left ventricular wall on SPECT was divided into 9 segments. BMIPP and Tl uptake were scored into four scale (0 =normal, 1 =reduced, 2 =severely reduced, 3 =absent). Discordance was defined when segments with reduced BMIPP uptake had better resting Tl uptake. Left ventricular wall motion was assessed into normokinesis, hypokinesis, akinesis or dyskinesis on left ventriculogram. All patients with effort angina had reduced BMIPP uptake and normal Tl uptake before PTCA. BMIPP uptake scores markedly improved after PTCA (6. 3 ± 1. 7 to 0. 9 ± 1. 2). Discordance scores were similar to BMIPP uptake scores. All patients with old myocardial infarction had reduced BMIPP uptake and Tl uptake in infarcted regions. Discordance was observed in all infarcted regions. Not only hypokinetic segments but akinetic or dyskinetic segments frequently had discordant uptake. BMIPP uptake scores improved after PTCA (10. 1 ± 2. 6 to 6. 9 ± 2. 0). Discordance scores also improved after PTCA (6. 0 ± 3. 2 to 3. 4 ± 2. 3), but discordance was observed in all infarcted regions even after PTCA.

We aim to identify system-level barriers to uptake HIV test and maternal prophylaxis during pregnancy in the existing national program in Côte d’Ivoire. Method Data of 46 sites during November 2011 to October 2015 were analyzed. Multiple Poisson regression models were used to 1) investigate systems-level factors associated with HIV testing and the delivery of maternal ARVs under Option B (Nov. 2012 - Oct. 2015); 2) and highlight the differences in these associations between the Option A (Nov. 2011 -Oct. 2012) and the Option B (Nov. 2012 - Oct. 2015) periods. A significance level of 0. 05 {{was used to determine}} factors associated with each outcome. Result In those 46 sites, 39 (85 %) sites are public and 7 (15 %) sites are privately-operated. During the Option B period, after adjusting for confounders, regional hospitals had higher rates of HIV testing compared to other health facilities (RR: 1. 24; p= 0. 001) and lower rates of maternal ARV delivery (RR: 0. 73; p= 0. 02). Conversely, privately-operated health facilities reported lower rates of HIV testing than public facilities (RR: 0. 92; p 200 first antenatal care per month) were associated with higher delivery ratio of appropriate maternal prophylaxis (RR: 1. 39, p= 0. 01) as were available charts (RR: 1. 04, p= 0. 01) during the Option A period, but those associations were not significant during Option B period. Discussion HIV testing rates were higher in public health facilities and health facilities with a laboratory, while the privately-operated health facilities performed better in the delivery of appropriate maternal prophylaxis. Thus, when access to HIV tests is improving in low prevalence areas, especially in public facilities, specific attention should be paid to risks of loss to follow up from HIV testing to delivery of ARVs. Regional hospitals which served the largest population size had higher HIV testing rate but lower prophylaxis ratio. This implies bigger challenges to follow up pregnant women after HIV tests in facilities which serves a large population. Stock-outs of HIV test kits, general supply of ARVs limited the performance of HIV tests and maternal prophylaxis delivery. And supply of ARVs became more challenging when Option B guidelines were applied, which is likely to be an increasingly important issue as Option B+ guidelines are implemented. This study also highlights the need for further research regarding the association between system-level factors and adherence to ARVs, which might be {{one of the biggest challenges}} to improve PMTCT in Côte d’Ivoire under Option B+...|$|R

However, increasing access to and uptake of VCT, especially among groups {{at high risk for}} HIV infection, has remained a major challenge in Africa. Purpose: The study was undertaken to determine the uptake of VCT (measured by whether study participants had ever received an HIV test) and the factors influencing this practice among military and civilian residents of a military cantonment in Abakaliki, southeastern Nigeria. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive survey of all cantonment residents aged between 20 and 64 years was conducted. A multistage sampling technique was used to establish the sample size; data were collected from 350 military and civilian cantonment residents using a pretested questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (v 16. 0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) and the significance of any association was tested at P &lt; 0. 05 using the chi-square statistic. Results: One hundred and forty-five (41. 4 %) respondents reported having ever been tested for HIV; however, only 44 (12. 6 %) respondents had received the test between 4 and 12 months prior to the survey period. Some of the significant factors that positively influenced uptake of VCT were awareness of VCT (P &lt; 0. 001), education level (P &lt; 0. 006), and knowledge of antiretroviral therapy benefits (P &lt; 0. 01).

EVIDENCE REVIEWWe searched PubMed and previous review articles to identify original research articles describing barriers to HPV vaccine initiation and completion among US adolescents. Only articles reporting data collected in 2009 or later were included. Findings from 55 relevant articles were summarized by target populations: health care professionals, parents, underserved and disadvantaged populations, and males. FINDINGSHealth care professionals cited financial concerns and parental attitudes and concerns as barriers to providing the HPV vaccine to patients. Parents often reported needing more information before vaccinating their children. Concerns about the vaccine 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s effect on sexual behavior, low perceived risk of HPV infection, social influences, irregular preventive care, and vaccine cost were also identified as potential barriers among parents. Some parents of sons reported not vaccinating their sons because of the perceived lack of direct benefit.

40|$|Abstract Background Canada has {{observed}} significant decreases in incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in recent decades, {{and this has}} been attributed to appropriate screening (i. e., the Pap test). However, certain subgroups including Muslim immigrants show higher rates of cervical cancer mortality despite their lower incidence. Low levels of screening have been attributed to such barriers as lack of a family physician, inconvenient clinic hours, having a male physician, and cultural barriers (e. g., modesty, language). HPV self –sampling helps to alleviate many of these barriers. However, {{little is known about the}} acceptability of this evidence-based strategy among Muslim women. This study explored Muslim immigrant women’s views on cervical cancer screening and the acceptability of HPV self-sampling. Methods An exploratory community-based mixed methods design was used. A convenience sample of 30 women was recruited over a 3 -month period (June–August 2015) in the Greater Toronto Area. All were between 21 and 69 years old, foreign-born, self-identified as Muslim, and had good knowledge of English. Data were collected through focus groups. Results This study provides critical insights about the importance of religious and cultural beliefs in shaping the daily and health care experiences of Muslim women and their cancer screening decisions. Our study showed the deterring impact of beliefs and health practices in home countries on Muslim immigrant women’s utilization of screening services. Limited knowledge about cervical cancer and screening guidelines and need for provision of culturally appropriate sexual health information were emphasized. The results revealed that HPV self-sampling provides a favorable alternative model of care to the traditional provider-administered Pap testing for this population. Conclusion To enhance Muslim immigrant women screening <b>uptake,</b> <b>efforts</b> should made to increase 1) their knowledge of the Canadian health care system and preventive services at the time of entry to Canada, and 2) access to culturally sensitive education programs, female health professionals, and alternative modes of screening like HPV self-sampling.

40|$|Introduction: HIV {{treatment}} to reduce downstream HIV incidence and to decrease disease mortality and morbidity at a population level both require that hidden, out-of-care {{people living with}} HIV (PLH) in the community be reached and engaged to enter care. This research evaluated the feasibility of reaching out-of-care or non-adherent PLH through members of their social networks in St Petersburg, Russia. Materials and Methods: To recruit a social network sample of HIV-positive injection drug users, 16 HIV+ seeds were enrolled into the study through PLH-oriented websites and online forums using recruitment ads or approached in needle exchange sites. Interested persons called the study phone number and completed a brief eligibility interview. Seed inclusion criteria were HIV+ status, being 18 years or older, having ever injected drugs, and having not visited an HIV doctor in the past 6 months. Seeds provided blood specimens tested for HIV to confirm their self-reported status. Eligible seeds were enrolled, completed brief network elicitation interview, {{and were asked to}} invite their own HIV+ friends into the study. Incentives were provided as compensation for participants’ time and additional smaller incentives were provided for inviting each HIV+ network member to also participate. The seed's PLH friends established the first ring of participants who, in turn were asked to invite their own PLH friends (second ring). All study participants completed assessment of psychosocial wellbeing and sexual and injection-related HIV risk behaviour. Blood samples were collected from all participants to confirm their HIV+ status. Results: Through this chain referral process, the initial 16 seeds led to the enrolment of a total of 66 PLH from the community (mean= 4 per initial seed), most of whom – like the seed – were not presently in HIV care or were ART non-adherent. Conclusions: Implementation of treatment cascade goals requires complementing conventional paths of identifying PLH with feasible and effective community-based approaches such as described in this study. This research establishes that PLH are connected in their day-to-day social networks with other HIV+ persons and shows that social network methods can be employed to reach infected persons through their connections with other PLH. This method has the potential to expand the reach of medical care <b>efforts</b> and ART <b>uptake...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objectives To {{describe}} the prospects, achievements, {{challenges and opportunities}} for implementing intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) in Tanzania in light of national antenatal care (ANC) guidelines and ability of service providers to comply with them. Methods In-depth interviews were made with national level malaria control officers in 2006 and 2007. Data was analysed manually using a qualitative content analysis approach. Results IPTp has been under implementation countrywide since 2001 and the 2005 evaluation report showed increased coverage of women taking two doses of IPTp from 29 % to 65 % between 2001 and 2007. This achievement was acknowledged, however, several challenges were noted including (i) the national antenatal care (ANC) guidelines emphasizing two IPTp doses during a woman's pregnancy, while other agencies operating at district level were recommending three doses, this confuses frontline health workers (HWs); (ii) focused ANC guidelines have been revised, but printing and distribution to districts has often been delayed; (iii) reports from district management teams demonstrate constraints related to women's late booking, understaffing, inadequate skills of most HWs and their poor motivation. Other problems were unreliable supply of free SP at private clinics, clean and safe water shortage at many government ANC clinics limiting direct observation treatment and occasionally pregnant women asked to pay for ANC services. Finally, supervision of peripheral health facilities has been inadequate and national guidelines on district budgeting for health services have been inflexible. IPTp coverage is generally low partly because IPTp is not systematically enforced like programmes on immunization, tuberculosis, leprosy and other infectious diseases. Necessary concerted <b>efforts</b> towards fostering <b>uptake</b> and coverage of two IPTp doses were emphasized by the national level officers, who called for further action including operational health systems research to understand challenges and suggest ways forward for effective implementation and high coverage of IPTp. Conclusion The benefit of IPTp is appreciated by national level officers who are encouraged by trends in the coverage of IPTp doses. However, their appeal for concerted efforts towards IPTp scaling-up through rectifying the systemic constraints and operational research is important and supported by suggestions by other authors. </p...|$|R

40|$|Zambia has {{for many}} years {{experienced}} a generalised HIV epidemic. Large-scale antiretroviral programmes have been successfully introduced (Egger et al. 2005; Stringer et al. 2006). Despite progress in controlling both new infections and access to treatment, the scale and impact of the epidemic remain major concerns. Persistent social inequalities and discrimination continues to create significant barriers to access HIV/AIDS services. It {{has been argued that}} social cohesion, understood as collective networks of solidarity and trust in a society, could reduce susceptibility and vulnerability to HIV (Meyer-Weitz, 2005; Loewenson, 2007) and generate social action (Kawachi et al., 1997). This thesis aimed to investigate the influence of social cohesion along the continuum of HIV care in Zambia (uptake of testing; uptake of ART; adherence to ART and retention in care). To do so, a community-based cross-sectional survey methodology was implemented in four sites in the Southern and Central provinces of Zambia: two rural (Namwala and Monze district), one commercial centre (Mazabuka) and one urban area (Lusaka). The study population consisted of adults, women and men, over the age of 18, who were residents of one of the four sites. The main conclusions of this thesis are {{based on the results of}} four studies conducted to explore the effect of social cohesion along the HIV care continuum. The results are presented in four scientific papers that have been included as chapters in this thesis (Chapter 6 to Chapter 9) The box below presents an overview of what this thesis adds to the existing evidence. What is already known? Social cohesion plays a positive role in both reducing susceptibility to HIV and dealing with vulnerability to AIDS. Gender-based violence and gender inequalities increase vulnerability to HIV infection and deter uptake of HIV testing in women. HIV/AIDS-related stigma is a major barrier to HIV prevention <b>efforts</b> hampering <b>uptake</b> of HIV testing, adherence to ART and delaying general health seeking among people with HIV. The existing quantitative studies on the link between poverty and HIV/AIDS present conflicting evidence. What does this thesis add? In Zambia, social cohesion - measured by networks of action, trust and reciprocity either at the level of the couple, the family and the community - plays a significant role in access to HIV/AIDS services even when factors such as stigma, socio-economic status, gender and other individual factors are taken into account. Not all levels of social cohesion (couple, family and community) exert their effect in the same way along the continuum of HIV care. Not only enacted violence but tolerance to gender-based violence within households hampers the uptake of HIV testing. This is often a reflection of prevailing social norms with respect to gender and power relations in a community. High levels of tolerance to gender-based violence are more common in discohesive environments. HIV/AIDS-related stigma strongly hinders uptake of testing and retention in care. High levels of stigma are more common in discohesive environments. Livelihoods insecurity deters uptake of treatment and adherence especially in women. However, increasing social ties can help balance this negative effect. Promoting social cohesion among men, especially through increasing men’s participation in community activities, could have harmful effects unless underlying gender norms of masculinity are mainstreamed in the design of the intervention. What do these findings lead to? Social discohesion and disempowering conditions (discriminatory gender norms, high levels of stigma and livelihoods insecurity) are the recurrent obstacles of access along the HIV continuum of care in Zambia. The strategy to scale up access to HIV/AIDS services in Zambia needs to prioritize interventions aimed at promoting social cohesion and reducing disempowering conditions which are especially present in discohesive environments. Social cohesion primarily deals with creating environments that enable couples, families and/or communities to overcome (inevitable) social tensions and conflicts. These enabling environments can be achieved through facility-, community- and policy/institutional- level interventions promoting non-violence and gender-equitable norms as well as mobilizing communities to enforce laws preventing discrimination based on gender and/or HIV status. In conclusion, promoting greater social cohesion in local communities in Zambia has the potential to reduce social inequalities that deters access to HIV/AIDS services. It may also facilitate collective action, for reducing tolerance to violence, reducing stigma and discrimination and compensating economic burden. However, the mobilisation of social cohesion in local communities requires an awareness of the risk of rising inequality, especially for men unless “masculine” gender norms are changed. ...|$|R
