5|$|PHP has {{received}} criticism due to lacking native Unicode support {{at the core}} language level, instead only supporting byte strings. In 2005, a project headed by Andrei Zmievski was initiated to bring native Unicode support throughout PHP, by embedding the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library, and representing text strings as UTF-16 internally. Since this would cause major changes both to the <b>internals</b> of the language and to user code, it was planned to release this as version 6.0 of the language, along with other major features then in development.|$|E
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The <b>internals</b> of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Business Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} <b>internal</b> marketing at selected insurance enterprises. This study examines an approach to <b>internal</b> marketing. In the introduction, relevant concepts are explained and background information regarding marketing, the marketing concept, the marketing environment and relationship marketing is discussed. In addition, an overview of the systems approach, the <b>internal</b> marketing synthesis and the <b>internal</b> marketing purpose is given, the advantages of <b>internal</b> marketing are shown, and <b>internal</b> market research, <b>internal</b> market segmentation and <b>internal</b> target market choice are discussed. After the summary of the <b>internal</b> marketing mix, the <b>internal</b> product elements are discussed. These elements include management tools, such as the vision, mission, goals and strategy of an enterprise. The <b>internal</b> environment, which consists of the enterprise's values, principles and <b>internal</b> culture, also forms part of the <b>internal</b> product. The management's leadership style, training and development, employee support services and staff compensation are explored as part of the <b>internal</b> product. Bearing the <b>internal</b> product in mind, the <b>internal</b> price is studied. This part of the <b>internal</b> marketing mix is discussed in terms of staff sacrifices and contributions weighing up staff sacrifices against staff rewards. Other <b>internal</b> price elements, such as staff commitment, risk, stress and work pressure, are analysed in addition to time and family sacrifices and staff responsibility. After comparing the <b>internal</b> product and the <b>internal</b> price, the <b>internal</b> distribution elements are analysed as components of the <b>internal</b> marketing mix. These include the type of <b>internal</b> distribution channel, the choice of distribution channel and the role players during <b>internal</b> distribution. Thereafter, physical distribution is discussed as an <b>internal</b> distribution element. Subsequently, <b>internal</b> marketing communications, the fourth element of the <b>internal</b> marketing mix, is discussed. This part of the study looks at <b>internal</b> advertising, <b>internal</b> personal selling, <b>internal</b> sales promotions and <b>internal</b> publicity. It furthermore evaluates the various requirements for effective <b>internal</b> marketing communication and <b>internal</b> marketing messages. The <b>internal</b> support processes necessary for effective <b>internal</b> marketing such as staff participation, change management, <b>internal</b> conflict management and innovation and creativity processes are identified and discussed. Lastly, this section of the study considers <b>internal</b> customer service as a prerequisite for <b>internal</b> marketing and also analyses aspects of this service such as <b>internal</b> service culture, total quality management and <b>internal</b> relationship management. It also delineates the requirements and principles for <b>internal</b> customer service and the advantages and disadvantages of an <b>internal</b> customer service strategy. The theoretical section of the study is followed by an exposition of the relevant findings of the empirical study. The most salient of these include: All the respondents from selected insurance enterprises found the <b>internal</b> market research, <b>internal</b> market segmentation and <b>internal</b> target market choice to be unsatisfactory; The <b>internal</b> product of the big enterprise (number 6) is more successful than those of the other enterprises; <b>Internal</b> price is not as big a problem for these enterprises as the other elements of <b>internal</b> marketing are; The small enterprises are more successful with <b>internal</b> distribution than the other enterprises are; <b>Internal</b> market communication is a problem for all the selected enterprises, but the respondents from enterprises 1 and 6 are more satisfied with it than the respondents from the other enterprises; The <b>internal</b> processes and <b>internal</b> customer service are more successful at the small enterprises than they are at the big enterprises. In the light of these findings, the study makes a number of appropriate recommendations to improve the <b>internal</b> marketing of the selected insurance enterprises. Doctora...|$|R

5|$|TWR {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the V64V engine from Austin Rover in 1989 and developed a completely new turbocharged engine, codenamed JV6, under the auspices of Allan Scott, with proportions roughly similar to the V64V, and suitable for Sportcar racing. As the V64V was originally naturally aspirated, TWR needed to redesign all parts of the engine to accommodate forced induction. A few of the changes included increasing the displacement to 3.5 litres, strengthening the <b>internals,</b> and adding two Garrett TO3 turbochargers. The JV6 engine would first be used in the JaguarSport XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars; its compact dimensions and low weight made it an ideal candidate for the XJ220. The engine had a 90° bank angle, four valves per cylinder and belt-driven double overhead camshafts. It shares a number of design features with the Cosworth DFV Formula One engine.|$|E
5|$|Titan uses Jaguar's 200 cabinets, {{covering}} 404 square meters (4,352 ft2), with replaced <b>internals</b> and upgraded networking. Reusing Jaguar's {{power and}} cooling systems saved approximately $20 million. Power is provided to each cabinet at three-phase 480 V. This requires thinner cables than the US standard 208 V, saving $1 million in copper. At its peak, Titan draws 8.2 MW, 1.2 MW more than Jaguar, but runs almost {{ten times as}} fast in terms of floating point calculations. In {{the event of a}} power failure, carbon fiber flywheel power storage can keep the networking and storage infrastructure running for up to 16 seconds. After 2 seconds without power, diesel generators fire up, taking approximately 7 seconds to reach full power. They can provide power indefinitely. The generators are designed only to keep the networking and storage components powered so that a reboot is much quicker; the generators are not capable of powering the processing infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the <b>internals</b> with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E

30|$|The <b>internal</b> control {{literature}} explores how {{to construct}} <b>internal</b> control {{systems and the}} effectiveness of <b>internal</b> control in China. <b>Internal</b> control systems are <b>internal</b> monitoring mechanisms and should cover the following aspects: control environment, risk evaluation, control activities, information communication, and <b>internal</b> monitoring which is consistent with COSO. Further, <b>internal</b> audit is an auxiliary mechanism for <b>internal</b> control systems. Li et al. (2003) investigate the information disclosure of <b>internal</b> control in China, in which they show that information disclosure of <b>internal</b> control contains less efficient information and should be enhanced with auditing. For the effect of <b>internal</b> control on innovation, <b>internal</b> control is divided into strategic <b>internal</b> control and financial <b>internal</b> control where they provide evidence that the former is positively related with disruptive innovation and negatively related with gradual innovation while the latter is reversed. As well, though there are audit committees in Chinese listed firms, audit committees are less effective which may result from the establishment of audit committees without endogenous power (Yang and Xu 2004). However, literature provides further evidence that audit committees may impede accounting restatement and fraud.|$|R
5|$|For 1966 the Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit was increased to 3.0 litres from the 1.5 litres {{of the previous}} five seasons. McLaren considered and discounted British Racing Motors (BRM), Maserati, Coventry Climax and Oldsmobile engines before opting for a Ford V8 engine. This engine was originally designed for the Indianapolis 500, the premier single-seater oval track race in the United States, {{and had to be}} reduced in capacity from 4.2 litres to the 3.0 litre limit. This choice was partly motivated by the belief that it might bring financial support from Ford, although this never materialised. Ex BMW and Daimler-Benz engineer Klaus von Rucker was initially appointed to carry out the conversion of the engine in England. However, progress was slow so the project was transferred to Traco Engineering in California, United States, where extensive modifications were made to the <b>internals</b> under the oversight of McLaren's Gary Knutson. In its 4.2 litre form the Ford engine produced 470bhp and McLaren expected the reduced capacity version to produce about 335bhp. In fact, it produced 300bhp in a narrow power band and was further handicapped by its large size and weight; combined with the gearbox it weighed nearly as much as rival team Brabham's entire car. In order to allow time to further develop the Ford, McLaren also used a Serenissima M166 3.0 litre V8 engine for some of the races. This engine produced about 260bhp and required modifications to be made to the monocoque but was at least relatively light and compact. Four- and five-speed ZF transaxle gearboxes and a Borg & Beck clutch were employed.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} two aspects of <b>internal</b> audit quality, namely <b>internal</b> audit {{competency}} and <b>internal</b> audit contribution to financial statement audits. Consistent with the substitution view, this study predicts a negative relationship between the competency aspects of <b>internal</b> audit (the tenure {{of the existence of}} <b>internal</b> audit in the organization, <b>internal</b> audit staff expertise in IT and computer skills, training hours, <b>internal</b> audit staff professional certifications in accounting and auditing, and <b>internal</b> audit staff experience in auditing) and audit fees. Second, this study tests whether the contribution of <b>internal</b> auditors to financial statement audit reduces audit fees. The data analysis is based on a cross-sectional regression model with observations of 73 public-listed firms in Malaysia, which include publicly available data matched with survey responses from their <b>internal</b> and external auditors. The results of the study suggest that the competency of <b>internal</b> audit, namely the tenure of the existence of <b>internal</b> audit in the organization, training, <b>internal</b> audit staff prior experience in auditing and accounting, and certifications are associated with lower audit fees.
