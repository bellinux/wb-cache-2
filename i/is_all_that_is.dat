5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that {{the court did not}} address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{then goes}} through a third reading. At this stage, only {{amendments}} not of a material character may {{be made to the}} bill. The minister moving the third reading may also make a speech outlining the changes made to the bill. The bill is then put to the vote. In most cases, a simple majority of Parliament <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> needed for the bill to be approved. However, bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a special majority: not less than two-thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings.|$|E

25|$|Descriptive verbs are {{a special}} class {{that can be}} used as either verbs or adjectives.

25|$|Class II Hemorrhage {{involves}} 15-30% {{of total}} blood volume. A patient is often tachycardic (rapid heart beat) with a narrowing {{of the difference}} between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The body attempts to compensate with peripheral vasoconstriction. Skin may start to look pale and be cool to the touch. The patient may exhibit slight changes in behavior. Volume resuscitation with crystalloids (Saline solution or Lactated Ringer's solution) <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> typically required. Blood transfusion is not typically required.|$|E
25|$|Downtown is home {{to three}} {{performing}} arts venues and a movie theatre, the most for any central business district in the Inland Empire.

Dining <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> needed to make this into a reality, as Regal Stadium 14 opened in the spring of 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{workpieces}} {{are brought}} {{together and the}} user marks the location for the biscuits. Precise measurement is not required, as the biscuits are hidden when the pieces are assembled, so a quick pencil stroke that marks both pieces where they align <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> required. The parts are separated and the machine is used to cut the slots in each piece. The machine has reference marks on the center line of the blade for easy alignment to the marks on the materials being joined.|$|E

25|$|A common {{application}} of a trie is storing a predictive text or autocomplete dictionary, such as found on a mobile telephone. Such applications {{take advantage of a}} trie's ability to quickly search for, insert, and delete entries; however, if storing dictionary words <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> required (i.e., storage of information auxiliary to each word is not required), a minimal deterministic acyclic finite state automaton (DAFSA) would use less space than a trie. This is because a DAFSA can compress identical branches from the trie which correspond to the same suffixes (or parts) of different words being stored.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, the Vikings locate {{what they}} believe to be the final Dark Temple. They destroy it, but the {{remnants}} of the Dark Tribe survive, and rally for a final battle. Secure in the knowledge that one more victory <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> required, the Mayans launch an attack. They prove victorious, and with all of the Dark Tribe's temples and farms eradicated, and no way of breeding new troops, Morbus retreats to his lair. Begging HE for mercy, Morbus is horrified to see vines infesting the building, quickly wrapping themselves around him, and turning him to stone.|$|E

25|$|The Devi Mahatmya text is a devotional text, and its aim, states Thomas Coburn, is not {{to analyze}} divine forms or {{abstract}} ideas, but to praise. This it accomplishes with a philosophical foundation, wherein the female is the primordial creator; she is also the Tridevi as the secondary creator, the sustainer, and destroyer. She is presented, through a language of praise, {{as the one who}} dwells in all creatures, as the soul, as the power to know, the power to will and the power to act. She is consciousness of all living beings, she is intelligence, she is matter, and she <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> form or emotion.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} {{clinical use}} of fusidic acid is its activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Although many strains of MRSA remain sensitive to fusidic acid, {{there is a}} low genetic barrier to drug resistance (a single point mutation <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> required), fusidic acid should never be used on its own to treat serious MRSA infection and should be combined with another antimicrobial such as rifampicin when administering oral or topical dosing regimens approved in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere. However, resistance selection is low when pathogens are challenged at high drug exposure. An orally-administered mono-therapy with a high loading dose is under development in the United States.|$|E
25|$|A retinal burn {{resulting}} in permanent damage from scarring is also {{caused by the}} concentration of direct thermal energy on the retina by the lens. It will occur only when the fireball is actually in the individual's field of vision and would be a relatively uncommon injury. Retinal burns may be sustained at considerable distances from the explosion. The height of burst, and apparent size of the fireball, a function of yield and range will determine the degree and extent of retinal scarring. A scar in the central visual field would be more debilitating. Generally, a limited visual field defect, which will be barely noticeable, <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> likely to occur.|$|E
