25|$|Many of {{the most}} {{important}} rights were codified in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in 2000. While the UK has opted out of direct application of the Charter, this has little practical relevance since the Charter merely reflected pre-existing principles and the Court of Justice uses the Charter to interpret all EU law. For example, in Test-Achats ASBL v Conseil des ministres, the Court of Justice held that Equal Treatment in Goods and Services Directive 2004 article 5(2), which purported to allow a derogation from equal treatment, so men and women could be charged different car insurance rates, was unlawful. It contravened the principle of equality in CFREU 2000 articles 21 and 23, and had to be regarded as ineffective after a transition period. By contrast, in Deutsches Weintor eG v Land Rheinland-Pfalz wine producers claimed that a direction to stop marketing their brands as 'easily digestible' (bekömmlich) by the state food regulator (acting under EU law) contravened their right to occupational and business freedom under CFREU 2000 articles 15 and 16. The Court of Justice held that in fact, the right to health for consumers in article 35 has also to be taken into account, and was to be given greater weight, particularly given the health effects of alcohol. Some rights in the Charter, however, are not expressed with sufficient clarity to be regarded as directly binding. In AMS v Union locale des syndicats CGT a French trade union claimed that the French Labour Code should not exclude casual workers from counting toward the right to set up a work council that an employing entity must inform and consult. They said this contravened the <b>Information</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consultation</b> of Employees Directive and also CFREU article 27. The Court of Justice agreed that the French Labour Code was incompatible with the Directive, but held that article 27 was expressed too generally to create direct rights. On this view, legislation was necessary to make abstract human rights principles concrete, and legally enforceable.|$|E

2500|$|Second, the Transnational <b>Information</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consultation</b> of Employees Regulations 1999 enable unified work councils in {{multinational}} enterprises, {{operating in}} the EU. This is most likely for US multinational enterprises. In [...] "community scale undertakings" [...] or corporate [...] "groups" [...] with over 1000 employees, and 150 employees in two or more member states, employees {{have a right to}} a transnational work council to consult on any [...] "probable trend of employment, investments, and substantial changes... introduction of new working methods or production processes... and collective redundancies." [...] A [...] "group" [...] of undertakings exists when one undertaking has a [...] "dominant influence" [...] over another, for instance through company share ownership or rights to appoint or remove directors. Other features of transnational work councils are similar to the <b>Information</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consultation</b> of Employees Regulations 2004. Management can initiate a work council, or 100 employees in at least two undertakings and member states can make a request. Then, a [...] "special negotiating body" [...] (elected worker representative and management) will try to seek an agreement on the terms. If agreement cannot be reached, a template set of [...] "subsidiary requirements" [...] will form the work council's constitution. The rules have been criticised for not going further, or being integrated with other consultation laws, although every member state in the EU is able to go beyond the minimum standards laid down.|$|E
2500|$|First, the <b>Information</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consultation</b> of Employees Regulations 2004, require {{undertakings}} with 50 or {{more employees}} to inform and consult on probable {{developments in the}} enterprise, changes to job structures, and contract changes - especially redundancies. Employees must voluntarily initiate an [...] "information and consultation procedure". If they do, but employers cannot find a negotiated agreement, a [...] "standard procedure" [...] model requires between 2 and 25 elected employee representatives having {{the right to be}} consulted on an ongoing basis: that is, an elected work council. A negotiated agreement can cover more issues than the model (for instance, to integrate health and safety issues in one council) if the parties choose. Crucially, consultation is not merely an exercise in management telling staff about their decisions, but requires meaningful dialogue [...] "with a view to reaching an agreement". This is [...] "an obligation to negotiate", similar to a duty to bargain in good faith. To start a procedure, at least 15 employees or 10 per cent of staff (whichever is higher) can request it. Occasionally, there could be a [...] "pre-existing" [...] council, or procedure in writing, covering all employees. If so, if it is not as good as the new method requested, and if the employer wants to keep it that way, a ballot must be held where over 50 per cent of staff favour a new procedure. For example, in Stewart v Moray Council, after 500 teachers requested a new procedure (over 10 per cent of staff, but under 40 per cent), the employer argued that a ballot had to be held, because the existing collective agreement with the union had a protocol on <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>consultation.</b> The Employment Appeal Tribunal, rejecting the employer's claim, held the pre-existing procedure was not good enough to force a ballot, because it did not explain how the views of staff would be sought. Employer currently face penalties up to £75,000 for failure to comply with the rules, though it is far from clear this is sufficient to ensure an [...] "effective remedy" [...] under EU law.|$|E

2500|$|While {{rights to}} take {{collective}} action, including strikes, are fundamental to democratic and civilised society, the UK {{has introduced a}} growing menu of collective rights to have a [...] "voice at work" [...] without a need for protest. [...] "Information and consultation" [...] are usually seen as precursors to actual participation rights, through binding votes at work. The economic benefit is that directors or decision-makers who inform and consult staff on important workplace changes (e.g. redundancies) think harder, and see alternatives with fewer costs for the enterprise, taxpayers, and staff. <b>Information</b> <b>and</b> <b>consultation</b> rights have historically derived from collective bargaining models. The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 sections 181-182 require employers on a union's written request to disclose information, without which collective bargaining could be materially impeded, according to [...] "good industrial relations practice". The Companies Act 2006 section 417-419 also requires disclosure of information in a director's report each financial year on how companies [...] "have regard" [...] to [...] "the interests of the company’s employees" [...] and [...] "business relationships with suppliers" [...] down the supply chain. General consultation rights existed in the UK with collective bargaining since the Whitley Councils from 1918. A general consultation right is now codified in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, article 27. The Court of Justice held this was not directly binding, but specific rules apply in four main contexts: in general work councils, transnational work councils, for collective redundancies, transfers of undertakings, and health and safety.|$|E
2500|$|Third, the EU is {{formally}} {{not enabled}} to legislate on collective bargaining, although the EU, with all member states, is {{bound by the}} jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on freedom of association. In Wilson and Palmer v United Kingdom the Court held that any detriment for membership of a trade union was incompatible with article 11, and in Demir and Baykara v Turkey the Court held [...] "the right to bargain collectively with the employer has, in principle, {{become one of the}} essential elements" [...] of article 11. This approach, which includes affirmation of the fundamental right to strike in all democratic member states, has been seen as lying in tension with some of the Court of Justice's previous case law, notably ITWF v Viking Line ABP and Laval Un Partneri Ltd v Svenska Byggnadsarbetareforbundet. These controversial decisions, quickly disapproved by legislative measures, suggested the fundamental right of workers to take collective action was subordinate to business freedom to establish and provide services. More positively, the <b>Information</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consultation</b> Directive 2002 requires that workplaces with over 20 or 50 staff have the right to set up elected work councils with a range of binding rights, the European Works Council Directive 2009 enables work councils transnationally, and the Employee Involvement Directive 2001 requires representation of workers on company boards in some European Companies. If a company transforms from a member state corporation to incorporate under the European Company Regulation 2001, employees are entitled to no less favourable representation than under the member state's existing board participation laws. This is practically important as a majority of EU member states require employee representation on company boards. Fourth, minimum job security rights are provided by three Directives. The Collective Redundancies Directive 1998 specifies that minimum periods of notice and consultation occur if more than a set number of jobs in a workplace are at risk. The Transfers of Undertakings Directive 2001 require that staff retain all contractual rights, unless there is an independent economic, technical or organisational reason, if their workplace is sold from one company to another. Last, the Insolvency Protection Directive 2008 requires that employees' wage claims are protected in the event that their employer falls insolvent. This last Directive gave rise to Francovich v Italy, where the Court of Justice affirmed that member states which fail to implement the minimum standards in EU Directives are liable to pay compensation to employees who should have rights under them.|$|E

40|$|Background 2 ̆ 6 Purpose: Research on {{emergency}} department {{length of stay}} (EDLOS) suggests that increased LOS may result in worse patient outcomes and increased overall LOS. Additional research suggests that increased age may not only result in lower intensity of care for some patients but might also increase EDLOS. For geriatric trauma patients, intensity of care and EDLOS may be different from non-geriatric patients. Given the nature of geriatric traumatic injury, {{it is important to}} understand if improvements can be made in geriatric trauma services. Study/Project Design: A retrospective descriptive study utilizing the hospital’s trauma registry data was completed, including patient demographics, injury information, EDLOS, post ED destination <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> <b>consultations</b> during ED stay. Patient aged 65 and older were compared to patients less than 65 years of age. Setting: This study was conducted at a large urban hospital with a level I trauma center.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to use multicriteria analysis to analyze and model the main criteria that influence the optimal design of a network to monitor groundwater levels. The multicriteria analysis was performed using a GIS (IDRISI Selva). The Toluca Valley aquifer (Mexico) was chosen as the case study. The definition and importance of the criteria (factors and constraints) that influence the design of the monitoring network were based on available <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>consultations</b> with experts in the topic. The factors considered were: rate of decline in groundwater levels, decline in groundwater levels, rise in groundwater levels, cracks, vertical hydraulic gradient, and density of wells. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to weight the factors, resulting in a consistency ratio of 0. 08. The weighted linear combination (WLC) method was then applied which resulted in a map identifying the locations of the priority areas to be monitored. The results show that 1. 0 % of the study region corresponds to very high priority monitoring areas, 1. 8 % to high priority areas, another 1. 8 % to medium priority, 4. 4 % to low priority and 91 % to very low priority monitoring areas.
