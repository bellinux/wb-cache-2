500|$|While {{looking for}} a new vocalist, Maia met Mulan Kwok, a {{performer}} at Barbados Cafe in Bilangan Kemang, Jakarta, in December 2004. Of this meeting, Maia later recalled [...] "When I met Mulan it was like meeting a new lover. I saw her and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her.</b> Just fell in love." [...] Mulan was a café singer from Bandung who sang with Dimensi Band. She was asked to audition for the role and ultimately selected; her appointment was announced at a press conference on 7 April 2005. With Mulan, the group's concept, originally [...] "elegant", became [...] "coquettish and sexy". The group's musical style also changed; while originally R with light piano, it was changed to a rock sound with dominant guitars.|$|E
2500|$|Welch {{did with}} Fox her first {{starring}} vehicle, the British Modesty Blaise-style spy movie Fathom (1967), filmed in Spain. Second unit director Peter Medak said Welch [...] "was {{at that time}} quite inexperienced, exactly {{like one of those}} American drum majorettes. But she tried very hard and went to see the rushes each day, gradually improving. 'Who's this dumb broad?' people used to say. But I said: 'You wait. I'll bet she makes it.' <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> very much because she was such a genuine person. And she had a beautiful body which always helps." [...] Welch said her role was [...] "a blown up Barbie doll." [...] Reviewing her performance, the Los Angeles Times film critic said that [...] "each new Raquel Welch picture brings further proof that when Maria Montez died they didn't break the mold. Like Maria, Raquel can't act from here to there, but both ladies seem to have been born to be photographed... this sappiest of spy pictures." ...|$|E
6000|$|Our {{host and}} hostess had {{by this time}} {{returned}} from church, and Mrs. Hall came frankly and heartily {{to the door to}} greet us, scolding us (kindly) for having got wet. [...] . <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> simple, easy, gentle, quiet manners, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> husband too.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't know why. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> so much. And I {{felt sure}} she would fit the place. She {{looks a little like}} a Gainsborough portrait, doesn't she? And <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to see <b>her</b> in this Georgian house.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--not {{particularly}} pretty. But <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> body. And <b>I</b> <b>like</b> {{the fresh}} air. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the fresh air, the summer sea-air all through it--through her as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] Newman {{answered}} presently, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> {{because she}} has lived near you so long. Since your birth, she told me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> today. A {{little or}} much? Don't know. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> {{and it seems}} a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, all the rest, all that I thought I thought and all that I felt I felt, all the rest before now, in fact... O, give it up, old chap! Sleep it off! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> {{better when}} she was spiteful than {{when she was}} smooth. I didn't feel so scared of her then.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> {{from the}} moment I saw her, and set myself to {{interest}} and please her as well as I knew how.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stuff, Sue!" [...] said Sam; [...] "it's {{not being}} cross. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> {{for having a}} spirit; but one can't be finikin and mealy-mouthed to suit <b>her</b> London manners. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eustacia {{has told}} me. He did pay {{her a little}} {{attention}} a year ago; but there's no harm in that. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> all the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh I’m {{willing to}} stand by that.” And he had another try, {{which would have been}} {{transparent}} to a compatriot. “I guess <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> type.” ...|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} this question, which was oddly abrupt, I said <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> very much and thought she was more {{agreeable}} than she used to be.|$|E
6000|$|... "No such thing. Let me tell you, Colonel, {{my heart}} {{has been in}} it ever since I felt the relief of meeting real truth and unselfishness! <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> that first evening, when she was manfully chasing us off for {{frivolous}} danglers round her cousin! <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> for having no conventionalities, fast or slow, and especially for hating heroes! And when my sister had helped to let her get into this intolerable web, how could I look on without feeling the nobleness that has never shifted blame from herself, but bowed, owned all, suffered--suffered--oh, how grievously!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I quarrelled {{with her}} less, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> less,' {{answered}} Berenger--who, since {{the act of}} separation, {{had not been so}} guarded in his demeanour, and began to give way to his natural frankness.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so, Bathurst. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> so {{much that}} I should be very sorry to see her throw herself away upon some empty headed fool. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> greatly, and <b>I</b> was {{convinced}} that you were just the man to make her happy, and as I knew that you had good prospects in England, I {{thought it would be}} a capital match for her, although you are but a young civilian; and I own that of late I have thought things were going on very well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, and {{she always}} sticks pins and daggers into her head, to {{increase}} that effect. I must say <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> husband better: he is so clever.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Susy {{looks as}} gay as a feather-duster. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her.</b> She never snubs a fellow," [...] said Joe, much {{impressed}} with the splendor of the court ladies.|$|R
6000|$|Marian was {{thoughtful}} all day; and at last, when {{sitting alone}} with Mrs. Wortley and Agnes, exclaimed, [...] "Poor Miss Morley! I really am {{very sorry for}} her; I did not know <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> so well." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{chatted with}} Nan Brown, and studied her. She was a pretty, laughing, coquettish little minx and quite {{baseball}} mad. I had met many girl fans, but none so enthusiastic as Nan. But she was wholesome and sincere, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are much}} indebted to him, and to her," [...] said Lord Rotherwood courteously. [...] "She {{looked as if}} she hated it all in the first scene, though she warmed up afterwards. I must say <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> the better for her shyness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why--yes, indeed. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her.</b> But <b>I</b> did {{not think}} of her in {{relation}} to you--that way. I am greatly surprised. Alfred, is she well born? What connections?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> singing best. <b>I</b> {{am sorry}} she can't sing this evening, {{as it is}} always such a treat to me to listen to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think so?" [...] he answered. [...] "Well, so does my wife. I don't know as <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> style exactly," [...] he said, {{with a kind}} of latent grudge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{ought to}} have given Agatha a plainer hint; but, except for school managers, we're not very {{conventional}} people in this country. Then <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> pluck. It's weak {{to give way to}} the prejudices of censorious folks. Besides, in a sense, she really wasn't rash." ...|$|E
6000|$|Libby {{looked as}} if this were rather a new and droll idea. But he seemed not to object to her {{tutoring}} him. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "as far as Mrs. Maynard was concerned, I don't know that <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> any more than I respected her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{suppose she}} was {{expected}} to have any friends. I can't say <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her.</b> But I don't think I disliked her {{so much as the}} author does. She's pretty hard on her good-looking"--he was going to say girls, but as if that might have been rather personal, he said--"people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better for you. I'll leave her to you, for I shall be shut up. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> being placed under my 'care'!" [...] my friend cried.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I've not had time. I've {{seen the}} girl but this once," [...] said the Countess, [...] "and the {{conviction}} has suddenly come to me. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> very much." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Congdon smiled. [...] "I'm {{dying to}} talk with her. She's {{far and away the}} most {{interesting}} of our newly rich, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> face. Frank has called, you know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must confess}} that <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> better {{when she first}} came to Canada. She hadn't begun to remodel {{arrangements}} at her husband's homestead then. Hunter, I understand, came into some money shortly before he married her, and--" [...] he paused with a little laugh--"most {{of my friends are}} poor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wouldn't {{miss him}} for the world," [...] said McTurk. [...] "A lot of chaps thought that Romeo-Romeo woman was a bore. I didn't. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her!</b> 'Member {{when she began to}} hiccough in the middle of it? P'raps he'll hiccough. Whoever gets into the Gym first, bags seats for the other two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, but <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> {{very well}} then. And Ravenswood's dirty usage of me--shutting {{me out of}} doors to dine with the lackeys, because he had the Lord Keeper, forsooth, and his daughter, to be guests in his beggarly castle of starvation,--d--n me, Craigengelt, if I ever forgive him till I play him as good a trick!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is {{her aunt}} in Bryanston Square,' said Clara. 'Or {{if she would}} only live with us! You see I am growing wise, as you call it: <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> now.' ...|$|R
60|$|Fred. Not deplorable neither, but {{a little}} altered: If I could be in love, as I am sure I cannot, it should be with <b>her,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> {{conversation}} strangely.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O Bob, you are mistaken!' {{said the}} trumpet-major, {{who was not}} deceived. 'When I first saw her I admired her, and I admire <b>her</b> now, and <b>like</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> so well that I shall be {{glad to see you}} marry her.' ...|$|R
