Displaying similar, if not superior, powers to the latter, Kessler comes close to killing him, only to be foiled by Zeke. Mortally wounded by a massive energy discharge, Kessler uses his last bit of strength to transmit a message into Cole's brain. In a <b>final</b> <b>twist,</b> Kessler {{turns out to be}} Cole himself from an alternate timeline. While raising a family with Trish, Kessler failed to prevent the Beast, a malevolent entity, from conquering humanity. With his reign secure, the Beast then tracked down and killed Trish and her children. Sending himself back in time, Kessler seized control of the First Sons, using their resources to prepare his past self for the future to come. Cole denounces Kessler's memory, but recognizes that his actions have given his life a new purpose.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} planned to withdraw these final two locomotives on 31 December 2004. However, all {{did not go}} to plan, as the replacement Class 90 locomotives did not prove to be as reliable as hoped. Therefore, two locomotives were reprieved until at least March 2005. A <b>final</b> <b>twist</b> saw no. 86232 repaired, replacing no. 86246, which had again suffered from a serious failure. A third locomotive, no. 86234, was also repaired and briefly returned to traffic in April 2005, but was later stored again after failing. The last two locomotives (nos. 86232/235) saw occasional use, when not enough Class 90 locomotives were available. By mid-2005, no. 86232 was out of use and no. 86235 was operational but not used. The final use of the class came on 17 September 2005, when no. 86235 was used on several Norwich-London return trips to mark its retirement from service. This has brought an end to 40 years of Class 86-hauled passenger trains.|$|E
25|$|The Top 3, Sophie, Bill and Fenton {{had just}} two final {{challenges}} to complete. The {{first was the}} last chance {{to work on their}} presenting skills with Mark and Julia. Mark held a Cue card which they were required to read while looking down the camera and deliver it with as much personality as possible. Mark was looking for someone with the ability to engage the audience. Bill and Sophie struggled with their delivery while big Fenton nailed it in one take, getting a round of applause from both judges. Then it was off to one of Sydney's best fine dining experiences, Mint bar and dining. Once there they had one last attempt to impress 5 VIP's with a signature dish under the keen eye of Ben O'Donoghue. This showed another side of Ben that the contestants had yet to see, a no nonsense head chef barking orders at them in the kitchen and putting the pressure on to get the meals out as efficiently as possible. Sophie served up a very fresh and light Mexican chicken with a tasty salad including heart of palm and pistachio. The food critiques were very impressed. Next up Bill aimed to impress with his dish, crayfish cooked in herb butter and served with a salad. The reaction was the same all round from the judges, not good. The presentation was lacking and the salad didn't suit the dish. Owner of Mint remarked 'It's like two different dishes on one plate.' Finally Fenton from Queensland served up an eye fillet with hollandaise and potato rösti (a favourite at his restaurant.) While one judge thought the beef was the best stating 'he (Fenton) put his whole life on the BBQ and served it up for us.' it was Sophie's chicken that got the majority of the VIP judges vote and won her ticket through to the grand finale. That left Fenton and Bill. Ben then announced that Bill would be going home and Fenton was going through. But then in a <b>final</b> <b>twist,</b> Chef Ben O'Donoghue decided to bring Bill back because he felt that he had let him down with his direction in the kitchen. So the Top 2 was again the Top 3 with all contestants going into the final with the winner announced on Australia Day.|$|E

40|$|High-energy photons {{and other}} {{particles}} carrying non-zero {{orbital angular momentum}} (OAM) emerge as a new tool in high-energy physics. Recently, it was suggested to generate high-energy photons with non-zero OAM (twisted photons) by the Compton backscattering of laser twisted photons on relativistic electron beams. Twisted electrons in the intermediate energy range have also been demostrated experimentally; twisted protons and other particles can in principle be created in a similar way. Collisions of energetic twisted states can offer {{a new look at}} particle properties and interactions. A theoretical description of twisted particle scattering developed previously treated them as pure Bessel states and ran into difficulty when describing the OAM of the <b>final</b> <b>twisted</b> particle at non-zero scattering angles. Here we develop further this formalism by incorporating two additional important features. First, we treat the initial OAM state as a wave packet of a finite transverse size rather than a pure Bessel state. This realistic assumption allows us to resolve the existing controversy between two theoretical analyses for non-forward scattering. Second, we describe the <b>final</b> <b>twisted</b> particle in terms of the orbital helicity [...] - the OAM projection on its average direction of propagation rather than on the fixed reaction axis. Using this formalism, we determine to what extent the twisted state is transferred from the initial to final OAM particle in a generic scattering kinematics. As a particular application, we prove that in the Compton backscattering the orbital helicity of the final photon stays close to the OAM projection of the initial photon.

It shortly becomes apparent, however, that viewers are watching a film, and a director (voiced by Derek Jacobi) provides commentary on the events.

For many critics, the <b>final</b> <b>twist</b> was praiseworthy; it was characterised variously as the episode's [...] "secret weapon", [...] "very fitting", [...] "suitably macabre", and [...] "fantastically nasty". For Hughes, it [...] "was a lovely sting in the tale, and one of which Dahl would almost certainly have approved". Two reviews in The Times, however—one unsigned, and one by Matt Rudd—were more critical.

The New York Times also found it [...] "dry and overdetermined," [...] and Time Out complained that it [...] "never supplies the frissons expected of a ghost story or the emotional draw of a good love story." [...] Film 4 compared it to The Sixth Sense and The Others, but said that [...] "its glacially slow pace will frustrate {{all but the most}} patient". (Rivette said when promoting the film that [...] "I like The Sixth Sense because the <b>final</b> <b>twist</b> doesn't challenge everything that went before it.

[...] "An intellectual exercise in metaphysical romance - Ghost for art-house audiences" [...] was Empire wry take. The Digital Fix argued that Rivette's direction resulted in a product that [...] "if never exactly dull and certainly the work of a master, is ultimately an empty film that has nothing to offer but its own cleverness".

40|$|In many ways, Orestes {{appears to}} be the “most Euripidean of all of Euripides’ dramas”. Its stylistic and {{thematic}} complexities admit a number of interpretations.

It follows that the <b>final</b> plot <b>twist</b> and Apollo’s appearance, which lends meaning to the past and to human sufferings, uniting the feuding parties and commanding them to honour peace, should be understood as the real, politically motivated message of this drama...|$|R

He is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants [...] including murder." [...] The murder attempt was stopped by Ian, and after discovering the truth from Pat, Ian chased Steven to London's St. Pancras Station (where he was intending to put Lucy on the Eurostar to Paris) and convinced Lucy to return home. Sidwell commented, [...] "Steven is such a good manipulator he thinks Lucy will side with him. He’s shocked when she doesn’t and when she agrees to go home with Ian." [...] In Steven's final scenes, Ian rejects Steven as his son once again, telling him [...] "I never give up on my family. But you're not my family, are you? You're your mother's son and you're Simon's son, and that really used to hurt. Now I thank God I never produced anything as sick and twisted as you."

It is explained that the tiger's disappearance was due to the bounty system, in which the government paid everyone who killed a Tasmanian tiger 1 pound. When it was realized that the animal was becoming extinct, there was a rush to catch every last one and put them in zoos. Most zoo specimens died by the 1930s.
