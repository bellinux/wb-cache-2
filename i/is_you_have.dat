500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of the episode enjoyed the [...] "amusement park" [...] feel of the story. Gillian Anderson later noted, [...] "Because of all the magic, I was {{constantly}} being entertained. The difficulty with something like this <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> tendency to forget that people are still having bad things happen to them." [...] Anderson later stated that, {{because many of the}} lines were written in a tongue-in-cheek style, she and David Duchovny said them in a humorous style; the two had to keep reminding themselves that the story revolved around a murder.|$|E
500|$|The American public, {{the church}} {{organizations}} that have been helping—Protestants, Catholics and Jews will know {{you for what you}} are—an evil beast. So will others who have backed you. You are done. King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it <b>is.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> just 34 days in which to do (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significant [...] ). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, {{longtime}} Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich {{said of the}} song: [...] "We {{tried to}} record it countless times, but it never worked. The irony <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> that shitty live version [...] To Thom's credit, he needs to feel a song has validation, {{that it has a}} reason to exist as a recording. We could do 'True Love Waits' and make it sound like John Mayer. Nobody wants to do that." [...] In 2016, more than 21 years after its debut, [...] "True Love Waits" [...] was finally released as the last track on Radiohead's ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, rearranged as a minimal piano ballad.|$|E

It may <b>be</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> {{and it may}} <b>be</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not, sir; <b>you</b> see I <b>have</b> no mind {{to satisfy}} you, sir: What a devil! a man cannot talk a little to his own flesh and blood, but <b>you</b> must <b>be</b> interposing, with a murrain to you.|$|R

500|$|As {{characters}} {{from the previous}} chapters of the game gather around to congratulate him, Conker realizes {{that he should have}} brought Berri back to life when he was negotiating with programmers. He calls them out to bring her back to life, only to realize that they have left already. Conker then gives a closing monologue, in which he discusses appreciating what one already has instead of always wanting more, stating that [...] "the grass is always greener, and you don't really know what it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> until it's gone." [...] The credits roll, and afterwards Conker is seen back at the same pub he was seen in {{at the start of the}} game, drowning his sorrows in Scotch whisky. He drunkenly exits the bar as it begins to storm outside, and leaves in the direction opposite the one he took previously.|$|E
500|$|David Julyan {{composed}} the film's synthesized score. Julyan acknowledges several synthesized soundtracks that inspired him, such as Vangelis's Blade Runner and Hans Zimmer's The Thin Red Line. While composing the score, Julyan created different, distinct sounds {{to differentiate between}} the color and black-and-white scenes: [...] "brooding and classical" [...] themes in the former, and [...] "oppressive and rumbly noise" [...] in the latter. Since he describes the entire score as [...] "Leonard's theme", Julyan says, [...] "The emotion I was aiming at with my music was yearning and loss. But {{a sense of loss}} you feel {{but at the same time}} you don't know what it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> lost, a sense of being adrift." [...] Initially, Nolan wanted to use Radiohead's [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] during the end credits, but he was unable to secure the rights. Instead, David Bowie's [...] "Something in the Air" [...] is used, although another of Radiohead's songs, an extended version of [...] "Treefingers", is included on the film's soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to put yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E

2500|$|Deceiving youths into donning {{handcuffs}} became Gacy's typical {{modus operandi}} in subduing his victims. After plying a youth with drink, drugs or generally gaining his trust, Gacy {{would produce a}} pair of handcuffs (occasionally {{as part of a}} clowning routine) which he would persuade his intended victim into donning. With his victim manacled and unable to free himself, Gacy would then make a statement to the effect of: [...] "The trick <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to have the key", before proceeding to rape and torture his captive. He would finish with [...] "the rope trick", placing a rope over his victim's neck and tying a makeshift tourniquet until the victim was strangled to death.|$|E
2500|$|King {{appeared}} on MSNBC's [...] "The Cycle" [...] on May 9, 2014. He {{was asked by}} co-host Touré if he believed that Democratic Party has done {{enough to get the}} overwhelming support from African-Americans it receives. King's answer is said to have shocked the host. “The party does not do enough,” he said. “It's our responsibility to hold the party accountable. And I'm not sure we do that. I think {{we have to find a}} way to hold the parties accountable. He went on to say that he believed there should be communication between African-Americans and the Tea Party Movement, saying [...] "the only way you change <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be at least communicating".|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect there's a {{very simple}} explanation," [...] Jake replied. [...] "The truth <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a rather {{senseless}} suspicion of Kenwardine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The first <b>was</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{come down}} from London by the {{newspaper}} train this morning, and the second <b>was</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> received your injuries in a hansom cab accident." ...|$|R

"Ah," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "how can I {{tell what}} they might <b>have</b> <b>been!</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> striven and striven, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done {{extraordinary}} things, but <b>have</b> they made <b>you</b> any happier? <b>have</b> <b>you</b> got what you want?" ...|$|R
