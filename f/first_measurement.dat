5|$|Measurements for {{the first}} two known {{examples}} are as follows (in each case, the <b>first</b> <b>measurement</b> given is from the holotype, taken in 1904, the second, from the specimen taken in 1966): head and body length 125 and 118mm (4.9 and 4.6in), tail length 115 and 110mm (4.5 and 4.3in), hindfoot length 27 and 28mm (1.1 and 1.1in), ear length 13 and 15mm (0.51 and 0.59in), skull length 29.8 and 29.0mm (1.17 and 1.14in). The 1966 specimen weighed 46.0g (1.62oz) and had testes 11mm (0.43in) long; these measurements were not recorded in the 1904 specimen. Reid, who mentioned the third specimen, reported a maximum head and body length of 128mm (5.0in), tail length of 150mm (5.9in), hindfoot length of 31mm (1.2in), and ear length of 19mm (0.75in).|$|E
5|$|Io {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the development of astronomy in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was discovered in January 1610 by Galileo Galilei, along with the other Galilean satellites. This discovery furthered the adoption of the Copernican model of the Solar System, the development of Kepler's laws of motion, and the <b>first</b> <b>measurement</b> of the speed of light. From Earth, Io remained just a point of light until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it became possible to resolve its large-scale surface features, such as the dark red polar and bright equatorial regions. In 1979, the two Voyager spacecraft revealed Io to be a geologically active world, with numerous volcanic features, large mountains, and a young surface with no obvious impact craters. The Galileo spacecraft performed several close flybys in the 1990s and early 2000s, obtaining data about Io's interior structure and surface composition. These spacecraft also revealed the relationship between Io and Jupiter's magnetosphere and the existence of a belt of high-energy radiation centered on Io's orbit. Io receives about 3,600 rem (36 Sv) of ionizing radiation per day.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 2000, {{with the}} {{discovery}} of at least three bodies (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) all comparable to Pluto in terms of size and orbit, it became clear that either they all had to be called planets or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers also knew that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly. They were also concerned about the classification of planets in other planetary systems. In 2006, the matter came to a head with the <b>first</b> <b>measurement</b> of the size of Eris. That measurement had showed Eris (as it was mistakenly believed to be until the New Horizons mission to Pluto) to appear to be slightly larger than Pluto, and so was thought to be equally deserving of the status of 'planet' at the time.|$|E

25|$|Greek {{geometrical}} astronomy developed {{away from}} the model of concentric spheres to employ more complex models in which an eccentric circle would carry around a smaller circle, called an epicycle which in turn carried around a planet.

25|$|One of {{the oldest}} methods used by astronomers to {{calculate}} the distance to a star is to record the difference in angle between two measurements {{of the position of}} the star in the sky. The <b>first</b> <b>measurement</b> is taken from the Earth {{on one side of the}} Sun, and the second is taken approximately half a year later, when the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun. The distance between the two positions of the Earth when the two measurements were taken is twice the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The difference in angle between the two measurements is twice the parallax angle, which is formed by lines from the Sun and Earth to the star at the distant vertex. Then the distance to the star could be calculated using trigonometry. The first successful published direct measurements of an object at interstellar distances were undertaken by German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel in 1838, who used this approach to calculate the 3.5-parsec distance of 61 Cygni.|$|E

500|$|Newtonian gravity {{predicts that}} the orbit which a single planet traces around a {{perfectly}} spherical star should be an ellipse.

In the diagram on the right, the ellipse predicted by Newtonian gravity is shown in red, and part of the orbit predicted by Einstein in blue.
