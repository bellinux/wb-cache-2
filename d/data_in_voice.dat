40|$|The {{present study}} {{aims to examine}} the {{possible}} acoustical differences between languages (English and Mandarin) and ethnicities (Chinese and American). Sixteen Chinese (8 males and 8 females) and fourteen American bilingual adults were recruited (8 males and 6 females) and instructed to read one Mandarin and one English passage. Fundamental frequency (F 0), jitter, shimmer, and parameters extracted from long-term average spectral analysis, including first spectral peak (FSP), mean spectral energy (MSE), and spectral tilt (ST) were measured from the speech samples using Praat. Results indicated acoustical differences between English and Mandarin, and between Chinese and American speakers. However, the language effect and race effect on voice quality interacted with each other.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the pharyngoesophageal segment in laryngectomees who rated themselves as functional tracheoesophageal speakers. Methods: Voice perceptual assessment, high-resolution videomanometry of swallowing and phonation, and high-speed camera recording during phonation provided information about the anatomy and function of the pharyngoesophageal segment. Results: Fourteen patients were included in the study. The voice assessments presented high intra/inter-listener reliability. We found a significant correlation between roughness and poor voice quality, hyperfunction and poor intelligibility, and poor voice quality, long time since the operation, and old age. High-resolution videomanometry during phonation revealed decreasing mean pressures from the distal esophagus to the pharynx and confirmed low resting pressures at the pharyngoesophageal segment and low esophageal peristaltic contraction pressures after laryngectomy in comparison to normal subjects. The neoglottis shape was mainly circular and presented a strong mucosal wave in most of the patients on the high-speed camera recording. Conclusions: Perceptual voice assessment and high-speed camera recordings provided baseline information about voice characteristics and vibration regularity of the neoglottis. Additionally, the quantitative measures obtained with high-resolution videomanometry may have clinical applicability as reference <b>data</b> <b>in</b> <b>voice</b> rehabilitation after total laryngectomy...|$|E

This investment proposed an approach based on waveform similarity measure using overlap-and-Add algorithm. The waveform similarity overlap-and-add (WSOLA) technique is an effective algorithm to deal with packet loss concealment (PLC).

The evaluations show that the quality of the reconstructed speech signal of the dual-side WSOLA is higher than that of the standard WSOLA and GWSOLA on different packet loss rate and length using the metrics: PESQ and MOS.

30|$|In {{order to}} provide better {{protection}} to digital data content, new steganography techniques have been investigated in recent researcher works. The availability and popularity of digital audio signals have made them an appealing choice to convey secret information. Audio steganography techniques address {{issues related to the}} need to secure and preserve the integrity of <b>data</b> hidden <b>in</b> <b>voice</b> communications <b>in</b> particular. In this work, a comparative study of the current-state-of-the-art literature in digital audio steganography techniques and approaches is presented. In an attempt to reveal their capabilities in ensuring secure communications, we discussed their strengthes and weaknesses. Also, a differentiation between the reviewed techniques based on the intended applications has been highlighted. Thus, while temporal domain techniques, in general, aim to maximize the hiding capacity, transform domain methods exploit the masking properties {{in order to make the}} noise generated by embedded data imperceptible. On the other side, encoded domain methods strive to ensure the integrity of hidden data against challenging environment such as real time applications. To better estimate the robustness of the presented techniques, a classification based on their occurrence <b>in</b> the <b>voice</b> encoder is given. A comparison as well as a performance evaluation (i.e., imperceptibility and steganalysis) for the reviewed techniques have been also presented. This study showed that the frequency domain is preferred over the temporal domain and music signals are better covers for <b>data</b> hiding <b>in</b> terms of capacity, imperceptibility and undetectability. From our point of view, the diversity and large number of existing audio steganography techniques expand application possibilities. The advantage on using one technique over another one depends on the application constraints in use and its requirement for hiding capacity, embedded data security level and encountered attacks resistance.|$|R

The investigation studies the user effects on the antenna performance and how these are incorporated into the MIMO channel and the link characteristics. The antennas and the user are deterministic. These are then integrated into the statistical 3 GPP spatial channel model (SCM) for a typical macrocell propagation environment setting. The channel performance is analyzed based on the average channel capacity, the average power transfer, the correlation, and the cumulative distribution function of the channel capacity as well as the link throughout and the error performance. The mentioned channel and link properties are tied to the MIMO antenna properties that are represented in the mutual coupling between the antennas, the power loss, the total radiated power, the mean effective gain (MEG), as well as the efficiency with emphasis on how the user affects each. It was found that the presence of the user contributed to a loss of up to 50 % in the average channel power transfer. The data position was found to be the lowest in terms of channel capacity performance. The voice position performance showed a large dependence on the user orientation with respect to the line of sight path while the data position showed less dependence on the user's orientation. We also discuss through the examined antenna and channel properties the importance of the channel multipath on the MIMO performance. In some scenarios, it was found that a well-conditioned channel can compensate for losses due to the presence of the user, improving the overall system performance. The presented investigation at the link level also discusses the user effects in different MIMO transmission schemes...|$|R
