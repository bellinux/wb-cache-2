5|$|After {{the first}} month, {{the actual number}} of {{passengers}} was 125,971, compared to the predicted annual total of around 650,000 return journeys, i.e. 1.3m single journeys. By 23 January 2016, 537,327 passengers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> on the line with weekly figures consistently showing over 20,000 journeys made. Figures released on 31 May 2016 showed that 694,373 persons <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> since 6 September 2015, an increase of 22% by reference to the predicted patronage. Tweedbank station saw 183,918 journeys compared to a predicted 18,978, while Galashiels had 104,593 trips against a predicted 20,567. However, Eskbank, Gorebridge and Shawfair recorded less than their predicted usage. In September 2016, it was announced that one million passengers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> on the reopened line.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 1969, {{the three}} astronauts spoke before {{a joint session}} of Congress on Capitol Hill.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the major tests, {{a large number of}} minor trials were also carried out, from June 1955 and extended through to April 1963. Although the major tests <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> out with some publicity, the minor tests were carried out in absolute secrecy. These minor tests left a dangerous legacy of radioactive contamination at Maralinga.|$|E
60|$|Then rose a {{very clever}} guess. They must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> by icebergs, as much silt and stones (we know) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried,</b> and <b>have</b> dropped, like them, to the bottom, when the icebergs melted.|$|R

5|$|Scott {{was given}} {{leave from the}} Navy to write the {{official}} expedition account, The Voyage of the Discovery; this was published in 1905, and sold well. However, Scott's account {{in the book of}} Shackleton's breakdown during the southern journey led to disagreement between the two men, particularly over Scott's version {{of the extent to which}} his companion <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> on the sledge. The implication was that Shackleton's breakdown had caused the relatively unimpressive southern record.|$|E
5|$|The McClelland Royal Commission {{into the}} tests {{delivered}} its report in late 1985, {{and found that}} significant radiation hazards still existed at many of the Maralinga test sites, particularly at Taranaki, where the Vixen B trials into the effects of burning plutonium <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> out. A Technical Assessment Group {{was set up to}} advise on rehabilitation options, and a much more extensive cleanup program was initiated at the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack was}} universally {{condemned}} by Australian servicemen, who commonly {{believed that the}} attack on Centaur <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> out deliberately and in full knowledge of her status. Similar reactions were expressed by other Allied personnel; United States Army Air Forces General George Kenney recalled having to talk a sergeant bombardier out of organising a retaliatory bombing run on a Japanese hospital ship known {{to be in their}} area.|$|E

5|$|The monks of Glastonbury used {{to claim}} that during the sack of Canterbury by the Danes in 1012, Dunstan's body <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> for safety to their abbey. This story was disproved by Archbishop William Warham, who opened the tomb at Canterbury in 1508. They found Dunstan's relics still to be there.

5|$|At one time, {{the church}} on this site {{was used as a}} chapel of ease to Llantrisant church. In the 15th century, St Mary's Church, Rhodogeidio, was built to serve as a chapel of ease for St Ceidio's. In 2006, one author noted that St Ceidio's had not been {{regularly}} used for some years, but restoration work <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> out by local people. St Mary's, which is about 0.75miles (1.25km) to the west, is no longer used for services either, but is in ruins.|$|E

5|$|Before his {{execution}} {{a convicted felon}} was usually detained in custody for three market days, on each {{of which he was}} publicly displayed in the stocks, accompanied by the stolen goods. After the sentence <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> out a county coroner would visit Halifax and convene a jury of 12men, sometimes the same individuals who had found the felon guilty, and ask them to give an account under oath of the circumstances of the conviction and execution, for the official records.|$|E
5|$|Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach {{described}} {{the screen as}} violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall. It stressed that {{the removal of the}} screen was necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a military fortification throughout the 18th century, and in 1728 it was equipped with 11 culverin guns. The following year, however, the captain, naval officer Sir John Norris, redeveloped the castle to improve his personal accommodation. Similar work <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> out at Walmer in 1708 by the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville, and there may have been some competition between the two men. The keep was redesigned with medieval-style battlements, and wood-panelled accommodation at the rear overlooking the sea; the porter's lodge was also updated.|$|E

5|$|Frederick Barbarossa {{departed}} from the Holy Roman Empire in May 1189. The defence of Antioch was a principal aim of his crusade, but he died unexpectedly near Seleucia in Asia Minor (present-day Silifke in Turkey) on 10June 1190. His son, Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia, took over the command of the army, but most crusaders {{decided to return to}} Europe. The remnants of the German crusaders reached Antioch on 21June 1190. Bohemond paid homage to Frederick of Swabia. Barbarossa's body, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> to Antioch, was buried in the cathedral before the duke continued his crusade toward the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 {{the fragile}} {{relations}} between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile finally reached their breaking point when, on April 13, the Germans announced via the Katyn Commission {{the discovery of the}} bodies of 20,000 Polish officers who had been murdered by the Soviets and buried in Katyn Forest, near Smolensk, Russia. Stalin claimed that the atrocity <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> out by the Germans, while Nazi propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels successfully exploited the Katyn massacre to drive a wedge between Poland, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia, did not acknowledge responsibility for this and similar massacres of Polish officers until the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007 someone {{claiming}} to be an al-Qaeda member sent Rambhadracharya a letter telling him and his disciples either to accept Islam or {{to be prepared to}} die.

5|$|The German {{evacuation}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> out in {{an orderly}} fashion. Army Group North's plans had paid off and both the Soviets and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command) was surprised and impressed by {{the speed of the}} evacuation. The 8th Army went on to take the remaining West Estonian islands (Moonsund archipelago) in the Moonsund Landing Operation, an amphibious attack. Overall, the Baltic Offensive resulted in the expulsion of German forces from Estonia, Lithuania and a large part of Latvia.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} the citadel, {{especially}} to its northern and western walls, was only repaired in 1407. In 1414, governor of Damascus Nawruz al-Hafizi, sought refuge in the citadel against the army of Sultan Al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh. The citadel was bombarded by trebuchet and cannon. The siege ended when a treaty of surrender was signed. In 1461, the southwest tower collapsed in a fire when missiles were fired from it to force the rebellious governor of Damascus to leave the city. This tower and four others were rebuilt in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, indicating that the repairs of 1407 <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> out in haste.|$|E
5|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} ionising radiation were not {{known at the}} time of her work, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E
