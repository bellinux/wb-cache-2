40|$|Background/Aims We have {{previously}} isolated a novel lysosomal cysteine protease, cathepsin Y, which produces a kinin-potenciating octapeptide from rat plasma. The present study aimed to elucidate {{the influence of}} protein-restriction on cathepsin Y mRNA expression in tissues of growing rat. Methods Weaning rats were fed either 20 % casein (normal-protein, NP) or 5 % casein (low-protein, LP) diet for 12 weeks, from post-weaning period to maturity. Cathepsin Y mRNA expression in tissues was examined using RT-PCR and {{compared with that of}} cathepsin L, a general marker of muscle atrophy. Results Body, liver and spleen weights and diet intake of LP were significantly lower than those of NP. Cathepsin Y expression in LP was increased in liver (3. 70 fold vs. NP) and spleen (1. 28 fold) at early periods of protein-restriction, whereas that of cathepsin L was increased in liver and pectoral muscle through all <b>intake</b> <b>periods.</b> However, significant differences were detected in neither cathepsin Y expression in pectoral muscle nor cathepsin L expression in spleen throughout <b>intake</b> <b>periods.</b> Conclusions A significant up-regulation of cathepsin Y was observed in spleen and liver, suggesting that it may associate with immunodepression in rats under protein-malnutrition during the early post-weaning period...|$|R

Particularly, it was investigated whether this biomarker allowed to estimate differences in the site of fermentation. Ten volunteers were included in a placebo-controlled crossover study. They consumed in random order 2 x 15 g RS/day for 2 weeks and placebo for 2 weeks separated by 2 weeks wash-out. At baseline, {{on the first day}} of each <b>intake</b> <b>period</b> and after each <b>intake</b> <b>period,</b> they consumed a N- 15 -labelled test meal and collected all urine in different fractions for 48 h. In ten other volunteers, the effect of 2 x 15 g RS/day and of 2 x 15 g RS + 2 x 6 g WB was compared. These volunteers collected urine and feces for 72 h. N- 15 -content of urine and feces was measured using combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. RS exerted a significant decrease in cumulative urinary N- 15 -excretion which was different from placebo. The effect was most pronounced in the 6 - 24 h urine fraction which suggest fermentation in the proximal colon. The effect of RS+WB on cumulative urinary N- 15 -excretion was not significantly different from the effect of RS. A less pronounced decrease in the 6 - 24 h fraction was observed suggesting less fermentation in the proximal colon whereas no indications for more distal fermentation were observed. Since about 80 % of the cumulative urinary N- 15 was recovered within 24 h, it was concluded that the biomarker N- 15 -LU was useful to monitor processes in the proximal colon rather than in the distal colon. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Efficient {{energy storage}} in adipose tissues {{requires}} optimal {{function of the}} insulin-producing β-cell, whereas its dysfunction promotes diabetes. The associated paradox related to β-cell efficiency is that excessive accumulation of fat in adipose tissue predisposes for type 2 diabetes. Insulin exocytosis is regulated by intracellular metabolic signal transduction, with glutamate dehydrogenase playing {{a key role in}} the amplification of the secretory response. Here, we used mice with β-cell-selective glutamate dehydrogenase deletion (βGlud 1 (-/-)), lacking an amplifying pathway of insulin secretion. As opposed to control mice, βGlud 1 (-/-) animals fed a high calorie diet maintained glucose tolerance and did not develop diet-induced obesity. Islets of βGlud 1 (-/-) mice did not increase their secretory response upon high calorie feeding, as did islets of control mice. Inhibited adipose tissue expansion observed in knock-out mice correlated with lower expression of genes responsible for adipogenesis. Rather than being efficiently stored, lipids were consumed at a higher rate in βGlud 1 (-/-) mice compared with controls, in particular during food <b>intake</b> <b>periods.</b> These results show that reduced β-cell function prior to high calorie feeding prevented diet-induced obesity...|$|R

In this study we sought whether the urinary excretion rate of this autacoid is related to salt intake and by the expected changes in arterial pressure in patients with mild essential hypertension. The influence of salt intake on the renal excretion of ADM was investigated in 55 hypertensive patients in a double blind, randomized and crossover study comparing a 2 -week 50 mmol/day salt <b>intake</b> <b>period</b> with a 150 mmol/day salt <b>intake</b> <b>period.</b> Twenty-four-hour ADM and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) excretion rate were measured by radioimmunoassay on preextracted urinary samples (intraassay confidence variable < 8 %). The antibodies used in these assays had minimal ADM-ET- 1 cross-reactivity (< 1 %). Twenty-four-hour microalbuminuria was measured by nephelometry. On univariate analysis changes in urinary ADM were significantly related to those in salt excretion (r = 0. 33, P =. 01) as well as to changes in urinary ET- 1 (r = 0. 56, P =. 0001). Furthermore, changes in urinary albumin excretion were related to those in urinary ET- 1 (r = 0. 26, P =. 05), but were independent of those in urinary ADM (P =. 19). In a multiple regression model including age, sex, body mass index, and changes in systolic pressure, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone and urine volume, salt excretion resulted as the stronger independent predictor of urinary ADM (r = 0. 33, P =. 01). However, changes in urinary salt lost prediction power (P =. 11) for urinary ADM when urinary ET- 1 was introduced into the model. In this model (multiple r = 0. 31) urinary ET- 1 resulted to be the only independent predictor of urinary ADM (beta = 0. 56, P =. 0001). This study is the first to show that the renal excretion of ADM is related to changes in salt intake and that it is tightly linked to that of ET- 1. The data support the notion that these autacoids play a role in the regulation of sodium metabolism in patients with mild hypertension. The intercorrelations between ET- 1, ADM, and microalbuminuria are compatible with the hypothesis that ET- 1 is involved in a salt-induced increase in glomerular pressure and suggest that ADM may act as a counterregulatory factor in this situation...|$|E

All three mechanisms could not have been predicted during the design phase of the study. It is concluded that it is not always feasible to conduct a randomized study in surgery due to unforeseen circumstances.

However, this stimulatory effect on intestinal absorption may depend on experimental conditions such as duration of fermentable fiber intake, mineral diet levels and animals' physiological status, in particular their age. Objectives the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of inulin intake on Ca and Mg absorption in rats at different age stages. Methods eighty male Wistar rats of four different ages (2, 5, 10 and 20 months) were randomized into either a control group or a group receiving 3. 75 % inulin in their diet for 4 days and then 7. 5 % inulin for three weeks. The animals were fed fresh food and water ad libitum for the duration of the experiment. Intestinal absorption of Ca and Mg was determined by fecal monitoring using stable isotopic tracers. Ca and Mg status was also assessed. Results absorption of Ca and Mg was significantly lower in the aged rats (10 and 20 mo) than in the young and adult rat groups. As expected, inulin intake increased Ca and Mg absorption in all four rat groups. However, inulin had a numerically greater effect on Ca absorption in aged rats than in younger rats whereas its effect on Mg absorption remained similar across all four rat age groups. Conclusion the extent of the stimulatory effect of inulin on absorption of Ca may differ according to animal ages.

The main effect of the policy is to increase the scale of the economy. There is a small transient gain in the average income of incumbents. Underlying this average are large distributional effects...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{a growing}} {{healthcare}} challenge in present days. Objective automated methods of food intake monitoring are necessary to face this challenge in future. A method for non-invasive monitoring of human food intake behavior by the evaluation of chewing and swallowing sounds has been developed. A wearable food intake sensor has been created by integrating in-ear microphone and a reference microphone in a hearing aid case. A concept for food intake monitoring requiring low computational cost is presented. After the detection of food <b>intake</b> activity <b>periods,</b> signal recognition algorithms based on Hidden Markov Models distinguish several types of food based on the sound properties of their chewing sounds. Algorithms are developed using manual labeled records of the food intake sounds of 40 participants...|$|R
