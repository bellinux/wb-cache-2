5|$|Yellow tea: This tea is {{processed}} {{in a similar}} manner to <b>green</b> <b>tea,</b> but instead of immediate drying after fixation, it is stacked, covered, and gently heated in a humid environment. This initiates oxidation in the chlorophyll of the leaves through non-enzymatic and non-microbial means, which results in a yellowish or greenish-yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a <b>green</b> <b>tea</b> puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E

5|$|Green tea: This tea has {{undergone}} {{the least amount}} of oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after tea picking, either with steam, the method preferred in Japan, or by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese tea processing. Tea leaves may be left to dry as separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea. This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The tea is processed within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of <b>green</b> <b>tea.</b> <b>Green</b> <b>tea</b> leaves undergo fixation by either roasting (panning) or steaming. Generally, roasted varieties are richer in flavor, while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|E
5|$|Overdrive is the 19th studio album by pop punk trio Shonen Knife. It was {{released}} on April 14, 2014 in Europe, and on April 16, 2014 in Japan. According to band leader Naoko Yamano, because their album Free Time (2010) was heavily influenced by punk rock, and Pop Tune (2012) had explored a more pop-oriented sound, Overdrive was {{a chance for the}} band to explore a more hard rock sound. The album's lyrics cover a wide array of topics, from <b>green</b> <b>tea,</b> fortune cookies, and cats.|$|E
5000|$|The Qingming festival holiday has a {{significance}} in the Chinese tea culture since this specific day divides the fresh <b>green</b> <b>teas</b> by their picking dates. <b>Green</b> <b>teas</b> made from leaves picked before this date are given the prestigious 'pre-qingming' (...) designation which commands a much higher price tag.

5|$|Vanilla tahitensis (Tahitian vanilla), {{which is}} a cross-strain of Vanilla planifola (Mexican vanilla and Bourbon vanilla) and Vanilla odorata (Inflated Vanilla), is {{produced}} in French Polynesia, especially in Tahiti, and also Hawaii. Its pods have fewer seeds than Vanilla planifolia, {{which is not a}} direct competitor. Mexican vanilla is used almost exclusively as the base of vanilla extract, due to higher vanillin levels. Tahitian vanilla is used primarily in perfume because of its coumarin-like scent. Other Tahitian vanilla products include vanilla <b>green</b> <b>tea,</b> vanilla oil, vanilla powder, vanilla rum, and vinegar-based vanilla.|$|E

5|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{consumption}} of hot chocolate can be positive to one's health. A study conducted by Cornell University {{has shown that}} hot chocolate contains more antioxidants than wine and tea, therefore reducing the risk of heart disease. In a single serving of cocoa, the researchers found 611 milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of epicatechin equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine, and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in <b>green</b> <b>tea.</b> Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study, revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the beverage is heated.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were {{to determine the effects of}} the brewing method on the amount of the major catechins, methylxanthines, total polyphenols and antioxidant capacity in <b>green</b> and black <b>teas,</b> and to correlate the chemical composition of tea infusions to their sensorial properties by the combined use of the electronic nose and tongue. For this purpose, tea infusions were prepared from 7 <b>green</b> <b>teas</b> and 6 black teas using different extraction times (3 - 5 and 10 min). The extraction of total polyphenols and catechins was increased by prolonging the infusion time from 3 - 5 to 10 min, while the caffeine amounts did not increase. The antioxidant activity of teas was well correlated with polyphenol content. Electronic tongue and electronic nose were able to discriminate <b>green</b> <b>teas</b> from black teas on the basis of their sensorial properties. Considering the taste, <b>green</b> <b>teas</b> were characterized by astringency and aftertaste-astringency and this sensation was increased by prolonging the infusion time; black teas were perceived as more bitter, sour, salty and the extraction time affected the astringent sensation. The aroma of <b>green</b> and black <b>teas</b> was discriminated by specific sensors and the increase of the extraction time produced more richly flavoured infusions. This work adds information about correlation between sensorial properties, antioxidant capacity and chemical composition of <b>green</b> and black <b>teas...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit {{bodies have}} been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in <b>green</b> <b>tea.</b> Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts {{have been shown}} to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E

5000|$|Baihao Yinzhen ( [...] ; {{pronounced}} [...] ), {{also known}} as White Hair Silver Needle, is a white tea produced in Fujian Province in China. Amongst white teas, {{this is the most}} expensive variety and the most prized, as only top buds (leaf shoots) are used to produce the tea. Genuine Silver Needles are made from cultivars of the Da Bai (Large White) tea tree family. There are other productions that look similar with downy leaf shoots but most are <b>green</b> <b>teas,</b> and as <b>green</b> <b>teas,</b> they taste differently and have a different biochemical potency than the genuine white tea Silver Needle. It is commonly included among China's famous teas.|$|R

5|$|With the {{increase}} of tea's use in Chinese herbology, production methods changed, where the processed <b>green</b> <b>tea</b> leaves were not immediately dried after steaming. Rather the steamed tea leaves were first pulverized into a paste form, with the paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into brick tea, a technique well described by Lu Yu in his work The Classic of Tea. Tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used, as older mature tea leaves were preferred for tea production. Some tea bricks were also produced from mature whole leaves, which typically required {{the use of a}} cooked rice slurry (米湯) to bind the tea brick together. The preference of producing tea in brick form possibly {{stems from the fact that}} it can be more easily transported and stored.|$|E
25|$|Daily {{consumption}} of black tea (but not <b>green</b> <b>tea)</b> {{has been associated}} with a significant reduction in death from all cancers. There is limited evidence to suggest that <b>green</b> <b>tea</b> consumption may be associated with a slightly lower risk of esophageal cancer in the Chinese population, a lower risk of lung cancer in women, and a lower risk of oral cancer in Asian people. A 2015 meta-analysis of nine prospective cohort studies concluded that a high amount of <b>green</b> <b>tea</b> consumption may be associated with a lower risk of liver cancer in Asian women. This association was not seen in Asian men or when one cup of <b>green</b> <b>tea</b> was consumed daily. Similarly, another analysis of observational data conducted in 2012 suggested that <b>green</b> <b>tea</b> consumption may have a favorable effect on lung cancer risk. The observed effect was strongest in those who consumed more than seven cups of <b>green</b> <b>tea</b> daily. A 2011 meta-analysis of epidemiological studies found limited evidence that <b>green</b> <b>tea</b> consumption may be associated with a moderately reduced risk of liver cancer in Chinese and Japanese people. Limited evidence suggests that <b>green</b> <b>tea</b> consumption is not associated with the risk of developing pancreatic cancer or prostate cancer. The link between <b>green</b> <b>tea</b> consumption and stomach cancer risk is unclear due to inconsistent evidence.|$|E
