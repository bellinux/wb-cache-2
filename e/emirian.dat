5000|$|The word Emirati is an English {{derived from}} a {{combination}} of the word emir, which is an Islamic leader, and the English suffix -ate. It gradually came to mean United Arab Emirates. The demonym <b>Emirian</b> has a similar root from except with the suffix -ian being added to emir. Rarer <b>Emirian</b> demonyms and adjectives include Emiri and Emiratian, both of which are unofficial and informal alternates. However, due to strong tribal allegiances, many Emiratis also self-identify by their tribal affiliations, whereby some Emiratis may call themselves a [...] "Bani Yasi", [...] "Suweidi" [...] or an [...] "al-Shamsi", especially if they come from an influential tribe. Historically, Emiratis were called Trucial Coasters or Trucials.|$|E

5000|$|During the {{beginning}} of the 21st Century, especially in areas of urban and suburban population centers, traditional centralized infrastructure {{have not been able to}} supply sufficient quantities of water to keep up with growing demand. Among several options that have been managed are the extensive use of desalination technology, this is especially prevalent in coastal areas and in [...] "dry" [...] countries like Australia. Decentralization of water infrastructure has grown extensively as a viable solution including Rainwater harvesting and Stormwater harvesting where policies are eventually tending towards a more rational use and sourcing of water incorporation concepts such as [...] "Fit for Purpose". <b>Emirians</b> have the highest per capita water consumption rate in the world, at 133 gallons.|$|R
50|$|R. Neuville and Dorothy Garrod {{divided the}} Upper Paleolithic of Lebanon into six stages based on {{stratified}} {{sites in the}} surrounding area. Stage one has <b>Emirian</b> and transitional varieties, stage two was possibly evidenced at Ksar Akil. Stages three and four have been termed Lower and Upper Antelian after the Antelias cave. Stage five is Atlitian, possibly developed from stage four. Stage six is identified as Kebaran, {{of which there are}} many varieties of assemblage based on locality.|$|E
50|$|Emiran culture {{apparently}} {{developed from}} the local Mousterian without rupture, keeping numerous elements of the Levalloise-Mousterian, together with the locally typical Emireh point. The Emireh point is the type tool of stage one of the Upper Paleolithic, first identified in the <b>Emirian</b> or Emireh culture. Numerous stone blade tools were used, including curved knives {{similar to those found}} in the Chatelperronian culture of Western Europe. Like the Chattelperronian, Elmireh is associated with late Neanderthal people rather than with Homo sapiens.|$|E
