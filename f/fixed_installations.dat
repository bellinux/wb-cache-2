5|$|The Army was {{nonetheless}} overruled by Hitler, {{who had a}} long-standing preference for huge, grandiose constructions. He preferred <b>fixed</b> <b>installations</b> {{along the lines of}} the virtually impregnable U-boat pens that had been built to protect Germany's U-boat fleet. In March 1943, he ordered the construction of a massive bunker (now known as the Blockhaus d'Éperlecques) in the Forest of Éperlecques near Watten, north of Saint-Omer. The bunker was soon spotted by Allied reconnaissance, and on 27 August 1943, a raid by 187 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers wrecked the construction site before it could be completed. A surviving portion was reused by the Germans as a LOX production facility.|$|E

25|$|The IAF {{continued}} flying interdiction missions for {{the remainder}} of the war, shooting up ammunition dumps and other <b>fixed</b> <b>installations.</b> Gnats and Sukhoi Su-7s flew many missions in support of army units as they moved swiftly towards Dhaka, delivering ordnance (such as iron bombs) to take out enemy bunkers which occasionally posed an obstacle to the advancing infantry. Canberras repeatedly struck Jessore, forcing the enemy to abandon this strategic city. The IAF was also prepared to hit any Chinese troop incursions into Indian territory in the eastern Himalayas, but as it turned out, the Chinese did not stir.|$|E
25|$|The Breda Ba.88 Lince (Italian: Lynx) was a ground-attack {{aircraft}} {{used by the}} Italian Regia Aeronautica during World War II. Its {{streamlined design}} and retractable undercarriage were advanced for the time, and after its debut in 1937 the aircraft established several world speed records. However, when military equipment was installed on production examples, problems of instability developed and the aeroplane's general performance deteriorated. Eventually its operational career was cut short, and the remaining Ba.88 airframes were used as <b>fixed</b> <b>installations</b> on airfields to mislead enemy reconnaissance. It represented, perhaps, the most remarkable failure of any operational aircraft to see service in World War II.|$|E
25|$|Modern naval warfare makes {{extensive}} use of both passive and active sonar from water-borne vessels, aircraft and <b>fixed</b> <b>installations.</b> Although active sonar was used by surface craft in World War II, submarines avoided the use of active sonar due to the potential for revealing their presence and position to enemy forces. However, the advent of modern signal-processing enabled the use of passive sonar as a primary means for search and detection operations. In 1987 a division of Japanese company Toshiba reportedly sold machinery to the Soviet Union that allowed their submarine propeller blades to be milled so that they became radically quieter, making the newer generation of submarines more difficult to detect.|$|E

25|$|Sticks: Sticks are the {{analogue}} to guns in {{the world}} of Derlavai. A stick emits a beam of energy which leaves behind a sharp scent like that of a nearby lightning strike. A soldier's stick is a large device and is activated when bare flesh such as an uncovered finger is inserted into its 'blazing hole'. The beam from a soldier's stick can burn a hole through a person with little difficulty, although they are largely ineffective against dragons and behemoths, which are not only naturally tough but also armored or painted silver to reflect beams. Smaller sticks are seen owned by civilians for blazing vermin or hunting game, or used by constables. Larger sticks, known as heavy sticks, are carried by behemoths on the battlefield, and can blaze through several men, another behemoth's armor or even take down dragons. Even larger heavy sticks can be used as <b>fixed</b> <b>installations</b> on the ground, used for air and sea defense, and carried on ley-line warships for use against ships, dragons and leviathans. Portable sticks used away from a power point or ley line require periodic recharging, which can be achieved in some unspecified way through the delivery of what is only described as 'charges' in supply wagons, or by the interventions of a mage drawing energy from a power point or sacrifice.|$|E

50|$|In {{civilian}} aviation {{a station}} is usually {{used to carry}} an external engine or a fuel tank.

50|$|The Type 99 Mark 1 {{was adopted}} by the Japanese for both <b>fixed</b> and {{flexible}} <b>installations.</b> The <b>fixed</b> <b>installation</b> was developed first, as a fighter gun fed by a 60 round drum magazine, mounted in the wings of the famous Mitsubishi A6M Zeke or Zero. A flexible version, initially developed for the Mitsubishi G3M bomber, was inverted to put the ammunition drum below the line of sight of the gunner. Smaller drums (45, 30 or 15 rounds) were used on flexible installations where space was limited.|$|R
