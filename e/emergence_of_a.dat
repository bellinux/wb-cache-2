5|$|The Diet was {{initially}} dominated by Polish nobles, but in time, it saw the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strong peasant faction. Another notable {{change over time}} included the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Ruthenian (modern Ukrainian) bloc, changing {{the balance of power}} within the body. Overall, the Diet preserved the Polish parliamentary tradition during a time in which it waned in the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition, and saw the emergence of the major political parties and groupings that were to dominate the political life of the Second Polish Republic after World War I. The leader of the Polish peasant movement in the Second Polish Republic, Wincenty Witos, gained his experience in the Diet, elected {{for the first time in}} 1908. Similarly, the National Democrats, and the Polish socialists, had their political blocs in the diet around that time.|$|E
5|$|The <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman {{writing in}} the press and {{composing}} poetry in this dark era was a significant event.

5|$|The same period, when a {{battered}} Byzantium defended itself against enemies on all fronts, {{also saw the}} <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new, unexpected threat: the Rus' made their first appearance in Byzantine history with a raid against Paphlagonia in the 830s, followed by a major expedition in 860.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new viral or bacterial infection, {{in addition to}} the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa. DPB continued to have a very high mortality rate before generalized antibiotic treatment and oxygen therapy were beginning to be used routinely in the effort to manage symptoms. Around 1985, when long-term treatment with the antibiotic erythromycin became the standard for managing DPB, {{the prognosis}} significantly improved. In 1990, the association of DPB with HLA was initially asserted.|$|E

5|$|Canada's post-war {{economic}} growth, {{combined with}} the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new Canadian identity, marked by {{the adoption of the}} Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969, and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971. Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans, though provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|From this {{changing}} society emerged a common, unifying musical language, {{in particular}} the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school. The development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased with the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bourgeois class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated {{in the second half}} of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria and William Byrd.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} the oppressive regime imposed on them by the French colonials. The end result of this armed reaction is the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brutal regime in which the oppressed become the oppressors. Sadly, {{the leaders of the}} newly produced regime fail to break the mold imposed by the French colonials. The ruling Afro-Caribbeans end up enslaving and oppressing their own kind and the resulting social situation is devoid of any progress. Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in the way that he portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|E

5|$|The late 1930s saw the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{new era of}} {{tolerance}} in the United States. National leaders hailed the Bill of Rights, particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy. The 1939 Supreme Court decision in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause. Even conservative elements, such as the American Bar Association began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long {{considered to be the}} domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the law of the land.|$|E
5|$|The navy base became {{run down}} after the war, {{eventually}} closing in 1957. The {{problem of a}} declining population was significant in the post-war years, though in the last decades of the 20th century there was a recovery and life in Orkney focused on growing prosperity and the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relatively classless society.

5|$|The royal {{court in}} Bergen also started {{importing}} and translating the first true European literature that became {{available to a}} wider Norwegian audience. The literature which was popular then was heroic-romantic literature derived from the French and in turn English courts, notably chansons de geste around Charlemagne (the Matter of France) and tales of King Arthur (the Matter of Britain). The first work that was translated into Old Norse was reportedly the Arthurian romantic story Tristan and Iseult, which was finished in 1226 after orders from the young and newly-wed Haakon. Hákon's programme {{seems to have been}} the spark for the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new Norse genre of chivalric sagas.|$|E

5|$|After Sri Lanka {{achieved}} {{independence in}} 1948, the ACTC decided {{to merge with}} the ruling United National Party (UNP). This move was not supported by half of the ACTC members and resulted in a splitone half of the party decided to merge with the UNP {{and the other half}} decided to leave the party altogether, forming a new Tamil party in 1949, the Federal party. Policies adopted by successive Sinhalese governments, and the 1956 success of the Sinhala Nationalist government under Solomon Bandaranaike, made the Federal Party the main voice of Tamil politics. Increased racial and political tension between the two communities led to the merger of all Tamil political parties into the Tamil United Liberation Front. This was followed by the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> militant, armed form of Tamil nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> powerful student-voting bloc. A large and growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion measures {{on the part of both}} town and gown.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1960s, {{explicit}} sexuality of {{any kind}} was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by {{the civil rights movement}} and the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.|$|E
