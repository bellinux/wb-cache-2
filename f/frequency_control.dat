Single-loop and multi-loop controllers for pulse-width-modulated (PWM) converters are briefly reviewed and the suitability of these methods for variable <b>frequency</b> <b>controlled</b> quasi-resonant converters (QRCs) are investigated.

25|$|They {{have a few}} (widely spaced) {{frequency}} ranges, {{and relatively}} wide-range continuous <b>frequency</b> <b>control</b> within a given range. In use, the sweep frequency is set to slightly lower than some submultiple of the input frequency, to display typically at least two cycles of the input signal (so all details are visible). A very simple control feeds an adjustable amount of the vertical signal (or possibly, a related external signal) to the sweep oscillator. The signal triggers beam blanking and a sweep retrace sooner than it would occur free-running, and the display becomes stable.|$|E
25|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{properties of}} human vocal fold lamina propria {{are essential for}} their vibration, and depend on the composition and structure of their extracellular matrix (ECM). Adult VF have a layered structure {{which is based on}} the layers differential in ECM distribution. Newborns on the other hand, do not have this layered structure. Their VF are uniform, and immature, making their viscoelastic properties most likely unsuitable for phonation. HA plays a very important role in the vocal fold biomechanics. In fact, HA has been described as the ECM molecule that not only contributes to the maintenance of an optimal tissue viscosity that allows phonation, but also of an optimal tissue stiffness that allows <b>frequency</b> <b>control.</b> CD44 is a cell surface receptor for HA. Cells such as fibroblasts are responsible for synthesizing ECM molecules. Cell surface matrix receptors in return, feed back to the cells through cell-matrix interaction, allowing the cell to regulate its metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Some modern amateur {{transceivers}} have embedded {{computers with}} firmware which is executed {{to provide the}} functions and features of the transceiver. This software must be provided by the original manufacturer of the equipment. Another type of software is that required to control a receiver (or transceiver) without a front panel provided. Examples of this are the Kenwood TS-B2000 and the Ten-Tec Pegasus; both transceivers are sold with PC software to provide the human interface for operation. Most transceivers with front control panels (and many receivers popular among shortwave listeners) have a computer interface such as a serial port, USB or Ethernet port. These ports are useful for satellite-tracking <b>frequency</b> <b>control</b> (Doppler tuning), station logging, digital operation, internet and special-needs accessibility. In many cases, the software adds improved or extra functions and features beyond that provided by the original design. For this reason, some operators purchase radio-control software for non-computerized operation even if their radio has a front control panel.|$|E

To fulfill power quality requirements in these weak electric systems, high performance voltage and <b>frequency</b> <b>controls</b> are needed, although the interactions between these controls can lead to stability issues. In particular, frequency and voltage controls’ bandwidth overlapping may produce destabilizing actions.

40|$|There is, however, {{abundant}} inertial {{resources in}} wind plant rotors for both smoothing of output power and for inertia contribution. Where as with added <b>frequency</b> <b>controlling</b> drive, this could facilitate inclusion of wind power in islanding systems, enabling greater system loads and enhancing power system stability. Modeling of power smoothing and <b>frequency</b> <b>controlling</b> wind plants and access different control strategies. {{this indicates that}} the manufacturer maximum blade pitch rate affects the <b>frequency</b> <b>controlling</b> performance this paper suggest that the control architecture in the wind plants be kept as simple as possible, involving only modifications of the algorithms in the speed controller. The results shown in output could be smoothed {{in the short time}} frame. The synthesis of a power control loop to closely follow maximum available wind power is performed based on the design rules. In this context, the voltage sourced converter is operated in current mode control to contribute to fast adjustment of air-gap torque while maintaining currents within limits. The direct and quadrature current references are calculated to attain the desired torque at minimal stator current magnitude and so enhance energy efficiency. The dynamic performance of the design is evidenced by time-domain simulation and stochastic analysis...|$|R
500|$|A binary phase {{accumulator}} {{consists of}} an N-bit binary adder and a register configured as shown in Figure 1. Each clock cycle produces a new N-bit output consisting of the previous output obtained from the register summed with the <b>frequency</b> <b>control</b> word (FCW) which is constant for a given output frequency. The resulting output waveform is a staircase with step size , the integer value of the FCW. In some configurations, the phase output is taken from {{the output of the}} register which introduces a one clock cycle latency but allows the adder to operate at a higher clock rate.|$|E

[...] The best digital PLLs are constructed with emitter-coupled logic (ECL) elements, at the expense of high power consumption. To keep phase noise low in PLL circuits, it is best to avoid saturating logic families such as transistor-transistor logic (TTL) or CMOS.|$|E

2500|$|This work {{eventually}} {{developed a}} method {{that is used to}} this day. The introduction of lasers provided a new solution through a British discovery known as Thomson scattering. Lasers have extremely accurate and stable <b>frequency</b> <b>control,</b> and the light they emit interacts strongly with free electrons. A laser shone into the plasma will be reflected off the electrons, and during this process will be Doppler shifted by the electrons' movement. The speed of the electrons is a function of their temperature, so by comparing the frequency before and after collisions, the temperature of the electrons could be measured with an extremely high degree of accuracy. By [...] "reversing" [...] the system, the temperature of the ions could also be directly measured.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{widespread}} use of synthesizers, in order to pick up stations on different frequencies, radio and television receivers relied on manual tuning of a local oscillator, which used a resonant circuit composed of an inductor and capacitor, or sometimes resonant transmission lines; to determine the frequency. The receiver was adjusted to different frequencies by either a variable capacitor, or a switch which chose the proper tuned circuit for the desired channel, such as with the turret tuner commonly used in television receivers prior to the 1980s. [...] However the resonant frequency of a tuned circuit is not very stable; [...] variations in temperature and aging of components caused frequency drift, causing the receiver to drift off the station frequency. Automatic <b>frequency</b> <b>control</b> (AFC) solves some of the drift problem, but manual retuning was often necessary. Since transmitter frequencies are stabilized, an accurate source of fixed, stable frequencies in the receiver would solve the problem.|$|E
2500|$|In the reflex {{klystron}} the electron beam {{passes through a}} single resonant cavity. The electrons are fired into {{one end of the}} tube by an electron gun. After passing through the resonant cavity they are reflected by a negatively charged reflector electrode for another pass through the cavity, where they are then collected. [...] The electron beam is velocity modulated when it first passes through the cavity. The formation of electron bunches takes place in the drift space between the reflector and the cavity. The voltage on the reflector must be adjusted so that the bunching is at a maximum as the electron beam re-enters the resonant cavity, thus ensuring a maximum of energy is transferred from the electron beam to the RF oscillations in the cavity. The reflector voltage may be varied slightly from the optimum value, which results in some loss of output power, but also in a variation in frequency. This effect is used to good advantage for automatic <b>frequency</b> <b>control</b> in receivers, and in frequency modulation for transmitters. The level of modulation applied for transmission is small enough that the power output essentially remains constant. At regions far from the optimum voltage, no oscillations are obtained at all.|$|E
