40|$|Water well drillers {{are exposed}} {{to high levels of}} noise while working. NIOSH {{researchers}} have found that water well drillers {{are exposed to}} levels above 85 dB (A) while performing certain tasks during a typical drilling job. Noise levels consistently over 85 dB (A) during an 8 -hour work shift are hazardous and can lead to hearing loss in workers. Finding ways to reduce noise exposure is difficult because of many factors. The work environment is constantly changing due to the location of jobs and environmental factors. The types of drill rigs required for drilling are expensive. Equipment can range from new to used (10 to 30 + years old). Drillers and owners can work together to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, and measures can be taken to reduce exposure to hazardous noise. [] Preventing hearing loss occurs through three stages. The first stage is removing noise from the source (i. e., drill rig). Various parts of a drill rig create noise besides the <b>drilling</b> <b>rod.</b> NIOSH researchers have examined noise levels of drill rigs. Some of the loudest parts of the drill rig include the compressor, engine, and cooling fan (Fig. 1). While removing the noise source from a worksite is ideal, the process would be expensive and difficult. [...|$|E

Generation of {{flexural}} waves, which seem to be responsible for most of the noise, is studied in a model with dynamic photoelasticity and in the real <b>drill</b> <b>rod</b> with strain gauge technique. The effect of the holder of the <b>drill</b> <b>rod</b> is investigated, and it is found, that the amplitudes of the flexural waves can be decreased by introducing visco-elastic damping material in the holder.

A new photographic technique is developed to register structures within the spot. Streaks elongated in the streamwise direction are found to penetrate the spot, and it is observed that undulations on the streaks lead to chaotic motion. Comparisons with theory show that the theory accounts fairly well for the spreading angle, whereas the propagation speeds are larger than the observed values.

40|$|Planetary {{drilling}} {{is a vital}} task in {{the challenge}} for space exploration. Drilling and planetary soil/rock sample acquisition provides information about history of past events, minerals and chemical composition of the soil/rock of the planetary body, available resources for future manned missions and the mechanical behavior of the planetary soil/rock. Several types of drilling devices have been proposed for lunar, Mars, and planetary subsurface exploration. However, these devices have limitations (e. g. heavy equipment and need for large axial force) {{that need to be}} addressed in order to be feasible for extraterrestrial bodies’ exploration. A special type of ultrasonic percussive drill have been proposed by Honeybee Spacecraft Mechanisms Corporation and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to address the limitations of current drilling devices. In this study, the mechanical system of the ultrasonic percussive drill and its interaction with the supporting medium is studied. The percussive mechanism consists of an ultrasonic horn, a free mass, and the <b>drill</b> <b>rod.</b> Special attention is given to the impact between the free mass and the <b>drill</b> <b>rod,</b> including the effects of structural damping, the supporting medium of the rod, plastic deformation in the contact area, and repeated impacts of the free mass on the <b>drill</b> <b>rod.</b> A general methodology to analyze the impact of the free mass on the <b>drill</b> <b>rod,</b> analogous to the longitudinal impact of a mass on a rod, is developed. The methodology involves uncoupling the nonlinear problem by determining the response of each body independently under the contact force to find the local indentation, then using Hertz force-indentation relation to find the contact force. This method is applied using mode superposition method and finite element technique for various support conditions of the rod (e. g. rigid, elastic, free, viscoelastic). Additionally, a model to account for <b>drill</b> <b>rod</b> penetration into the supporting medium due to impact of the free mass is also presented. It was found that for an undamped rod, the support condition of the rod does not affect the contact force if the contact ends before the arrival of the reflected wave to the point of contact. It was also observed that the contact force due to impact, for a given support condition, increases with increasing damping of the rod. Moreover, a modified Hertz equation is introduced to include plastic deformation on the rod due to impact of the free mass. The study was performed for identical repetitive impacts and it was found that the largest plastic deformation occurs in the first impact, with additional plastic deformation decreasing with the increasing number of impacts. The dynamic response of the overall percussive drill was investigated with a finite element model, including the interaction of the free mass with the ultrasonic horn and the <b>drill</b> <b>rod.</b> A numerical example indicated that the dynamic response of the ultrasonic drill is directly affected by the supporting medium. It was found that system with fixed support experienced a higher frequency of oscillation of the free mass and higher impact force compared to the system with the elastic support and the model accounting for penetration into the supporting medium...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to follow up {{blasting}} at the development work of drifts by measuring the distance from a fixed point to the faces before and after scaling and then analyzes the data. LKAB Malmberget needs to follow up the blasting to improve and make the development of drifts more effective. The goals of the project have been to investigate if {{the length of the}} <b>drill</b> <b>rods,</b> <b>drilling</b> plan or the placement of faces affects the need for scaling. The work has involved a literature review of tunneling and its processes, a five-week field study at the development of drifts in LKAB Malmberget where the collection of data was done, analysis, comparing and finally documenting in report form. Development {{is the first step in}} the extraction of ore. Development involves the building of new fields and transport routes in the mine where the ore can be mined and transported. There are two types of drifts in the ore bodies, main gallery and cross cut. It is in the cross cuts the large-scale sub-level caving takes place, which LKAB is known for. At the development work, LKAB Malmberget is using the conventional cycle of blasting which includes drilling, charging, blasting, ventilation, excavation, scaling and reinforcement. At the drilling of the drifts there are three drilling rigs with two different lengths of the <b>drill</b> <b>rods,</b> 16 and 18 feet. In the western field, a rig with 18 foot rod is used and the eastern field has two rigs with both 16 and 18 foot. There are also two different types of drilling plans with different numbers of holes. The drilling plan with 76 holes is used on the western field and the drilling plan on the eastern field has fewer holes. The results of the project show that the need for scaling is greatest when using the 18 foot <b>drill</b> <b>rods,</b> which can be caused by abnormalities of the drill holes or a failed blasting where the rock was not thrown out in the drift. Since the drill holes are longer when using 18 foot <b>drill</b> <b>rods</b> there are also possible that air pockets are formed during the charging in the explosives which can result in an uneven and weak detonation. Further the results show that the need of scaling increases when the face is placed in ore which may be caused by the density. The ore has a higher density than waste rock which makes it harder to blast in ore. The difference in distance before and after scaling is more even for faces placed in ore, which may its base in the formation of a slice of ore closest to the face which is released more even then waste rock does under the scaling process. The drilling plan has no significant effect on the needed scaling because there is only a few holes difference in the drilling plans on the eastern and western field which otherwise is equal. If the dimensions of the profile may vary, there can be an effect on the need for scaling. Validerat; 20110928 (anonymous...|$|R
