40|$|This Closure Report {{documents}} the activities undertaken to close Corrective Action Unit 335 : Area 6 Injection Well and <b>Drain</b> <b>Pit,</b> {{according to the}} Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Action Unit 335 was closed {{in accordance with the}} Nevada Division of Environmental Protection-approved Corrective Action Plan for Corrective Action Unit 335...|$|E
40|$|This Corrective Action Investigation Plan {{contains}} the U. S. Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate corrective action alternatives appropriate for the closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 335, Area 6 Injection Well and <b>Drain</b> <b>Pit,</b> under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Action Unit 335 consists of three Corrective Action Sites (CASs). The CAU {{is located in the}} Well 3 Yard in Area 6 at the Nevada Test Site. Historical records indicate that the <b>Drain</b> <b>Pit</b> (CAS 06 - 23 - 03) received effluent from truck-washing; the Drums/Oil Waste/Spill (CAS 06 - 20 - 01) consisted of four 55 -gallon drums containing material removed from the Cased Hole; and the Cased Hole (CAS 06 - 20 - 02) was used for disposal of used motor oil, wastewater, and debris. These drums were transported to the Area 5 Hazardous Waste Accumulation Site in July 1991; therefore, they are no longer on site and further investigation or remediation efforts are not required. Consequently, CAS 06 - 20 - 01 will be closed with no further action and details of this decision will be described in the Closure Report for this CAU. Any spills that may have been associated with this CAS will be investigated and addressed under CAS 06 - 20 - 02. Field investigation efforts will be focused on the two remaining CASs. The scope of the investigation will center around identifying any contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) and, if present, determining the vertical and lateral extent of contamination. The COPCs for the <b>Drain</b> <b>Pit</b> include: total volatile/ semivolatile organic compounds, total petroleum hydrocarbons (gasoline-and diesel-range organics), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, polychlorinated biphenyls, total Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, and radionuclides. The COPCs for the Cased Hole include: total volatile/ semivolatile organic compounds, total petroleum hydrocarbons (diesel-range organics only), and total Resource Conservation an d Recovery Act metals. Both biased surface and subsurface soil sampling will be conducted, augmented by visual inspection, video surveys, and electromagnetic surveys. The results of this field investigation will support a defensible evaluation of corrective action alternatives in the corrective action decision document...|$|E
40|$|This Corrective Action Plan (CAP) {{has been}} {{prepared}} for Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 335, Area 6 Injection Well and <b>Drain</b> <b>Pit,</b> {{in accordance with the}} Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO) (1996). This CAP provides the methodology for implementing the approved corrective action alternative as listed in the Corrective Action Decision Document (CADD). However, there is one modification to the selected alternative. Due to the large area that would require fencing, it is proposed that instead of fencing, an appropriate number of warning signs attached to tee posts be used to delineate the use restriction area. CAU 335 is located in Area 6 of the Nevada Test Site (NTS) which is approximately 105 kilometers (km) (65 miles [mi]) northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. CAU 335 is located in the Area 6 Well 3 Yard approximately 39 km (24 mi) north of Mercury, on the Mercury Highway and several hundred feet (ft) west along Road 6 - 06. CAU 335 consists of the following three Corrective Action Sites (CASs) : CAS 06 - 20 - 01, Drums, Oil Waste, Spill; CAS 06 - 20 - 02, 20 -inch Cased Hole; CAS 06 - 23 - 03, <b>Drain</b> <b>Pit.</b> The site history for CAU 335 is provided in the Corrective Action Investigation Plan (DOE/NV, 2000). Briefly, CAS 06 - 20 - 01, was used for storing material that was pumped out of CAS 06 - 20 - 02 and placed into four 208 -liter (L) (55 -gall [gal]) drums. The drums were taken to the NTS Area 5 Hazardous Waste Accumulation Site in 1991. CAS 06 - 20 - 01 will be closed with no further action required. Any spills associated with CAS 06 - 20 - 01 are addressed and considered part of CAS 06 - 20 - 02. CAS 06 - 20 - 02 was used for disposal of used motor oil, wastewater, and debris for an undetermined amount of time. In 1991, the casing was emptied of its contents, excavated, and backfilled. CAS 06 - 23 - 03 was used as a depository for effluent waste from truck-washing activities from 1960 - 1991...|$|E
40|$|The paper evaluates swine odor {{management}} strategies using the fuzzy {{extension of the}} Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is a multiple criteria decision making approach based on fuzzy scales. The evaluation is conducted using data from our cost effectiveness study of odor {{management strategies}} and our on farm studies relating odor to various management practices. These strategies include manual oil sprinkling, automatic oil sprinkling, wet scrubber, diffusion-coagulation-separation (DCS) deduster, pelleting feed, and <b>draining</b> shallow <b>pit</b> weekly. The criteria employed to evaluate the strategies are odor reduction efficiency, costs, nutrients in manure, and other benefits. Two producer profiles are considered: (a) producers who are pressured to achieve maximum reduction in odor emissions; and (b) producers who are constrained with limited financial resources. Both of these profiles are reflective of current situations for some producers. The results show that, as the scale fuzziness decreases, the preference of the first producer profile over the strategies from high to low is DCS deduster, pelleting feed, automatic oil sprinkling, manual oil sprinkling, <b>draining</b> <b>pit</b> weekly, and wet scrubber while the preference of the second producer profile is <b>draining</b> <b>pit</b> weekly, DCS dedusters, automatic oil sprinkling, wet scrubbers, pelleting feed, and manual oil sprinkling.

40|$|This {{document}} {{constitutes an}} addendum to the June 2003, Closure Report for Corrective Action Unit 335 : Area 6 Injection Well and <b>Drain</b> <b>Pit</b> {{as described in}} the document Recommendations and Justifications for Modifications for Use Restrictions Established under the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (UR Modification document) dated February 2008. The UR Modification document was approved by NDEP on February 26, 2008. The approval of the UR Modification document constituted approval of each of the recommended UR modifications. In conformance with the UR Modification document, this addendum consists of: • This cover page that refers the reader to the UR Modification document for additional information • The cover and signature pages of the UR Modification document • The NDEP approval letter • The corresponding section of the UR Modification document This addendum provides the documentation justifying the cancellation of the URs for: • CAS 06 - 20 - 02, 20 -inch Cased Hole • CAS 06 - 23 - 03, <b>Drain</b> <b>Pit</b> These URs were established as part of Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO) corrective actions and were based on the presence of contaminants at concentrations greater than the action levels established {{at the time of the}} initial investigation (FFACO, 1996; as amended August 2006). Since these URs were established, practices and procedures relating to the implementation of risk-based corrective actions (RBCA) have changed. Therefore, these URs were re-evaluated against the current RBCA criteria as defined in the Industrial Sites Project Establishment of Final Action Levels (NNSA/NSO, 2006 c). This re-evaluation consisted of comparing the original data (used to define the need for the URs) to risk-based final action levels (FALs) developed using the current Industrial Sites RBCA process. The re-evaluation resulted in a recommendation to remove these URs because contamination is not present at these sites above the risk-based FALs. Requirements for inspecting and maintaining these URs will be canceled, and the postings and signage at each site will be removed. Fencing and posting may be present at these sites that are unrelated to the FFACO URs such as for radiological control purposes as required by the NV/YMP Radiological Control Manual (NNSA/NSO, 2004 f). This modification will not affect or modify any non-FFACO requirements for fencing, posting, or monitoring at these sites...|$|E
2500|$|In {{developing}} countries and in low-density rural areas, wastewater is often not collected in centralized sewer systems but rather dealt with by various on-site sanitation systems.

50|$|A well-conceived utility structure, the North Pine Pumping Station is a {{small scale}} {{industrial}} building designed to accommodate the operations for water pumping. Although now computerised (no longer manually operated), the station retains much original plant and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of this building type. In its essential elements, the station follows the standard design principles for pumping stations. It presents from the road as a single storey building with {{the bulk of the}} structure housed below. The intake pumps are located below river level and draw water into the mains for pumping through a series of pipes and valves to the water treatment plant. The basement contains the main plant for the pumping operations including pipes, valves, <b>drains,</b> <b>pits</b> and motors. The control room sits safely above flood level and houses the equipment that operates and monitors the plant. This room is connected to the basement by a chamber.|$|R

5000|$|Cannel {{had been}} dug from bell pits on Bradshaigh's estate since the 14th century where the seam {{was very close}} to the surface near the Old School Cottages. The sough was driven to <b>drain</b> the <b>pits,</b> which {{produced}} both coal and cannel and extended the life of their shallow workings, which were prone to flooding. The sough, a major investment was considered preferable to winding water from the workings by the primitive methods available at the time. Bradshaigh recorded a detailed survey of the construction of the sough and its shafts with instructions for maintenance so that, [...] "the benefit of my 16 years labour, charge and patience (which it pleased God to crown with success for me and my posterity) may not be lost by neglect." ...|$|R
50|$|The Great Haigh Sough, a 1120 yd tunnel to <b>drain</b> shallow coal <b>pits,</b> {{was driven}} under the estate between 1653 and 1670 by Sir Roger Bradshaigh. The estate was cut through by the {{southern}} portion of the Lancaster Canal, {{now part of the}} Leeds and Liverpool Canal, in 1799. The canal is crossed by several bridges within the park. The estate is bounded to the west by the River Douglas and to the east the boundary is New Road.|$|R
50|$|In 1600 the collieries were drifts where coal outcropped {{and shallow}} bell or ladder pits where roof falls were common and poor {{drainage}} led to them being abandoned. As {{a solution to}} water in his coal pits, Roger Bradshaw dug the Great Haigh Sough between 1653 and 1670. It was a 1120 yd long tunnel under his Haigh Hall estate which <b>drained</b> the <b>pits</b> into a nearby stream and was still in use until 1929. Other soughs were dug, including one in 1729 to drain the Worsley mines and another from Standish Colliery to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Crooke. A waterwheel was used from 1720 to lift water from {{the workings of the}} Plumbe Street Mine in Burnley using an endless chain of buckets, and James Brindley installed one at the Wet Earth Colliery in the Irwell Valley.|$|R

He also purchased the El Cobre Copper Mine near Santiago de Cuba, which had been abandoned since 1895. Chanler brought in Cornish miners to <b>drain</b> the flooded <b>pit,</b> however, they neglected to adequately secure the saturated ground and the entire Cobre Mine collapsed taking with it the beautiful church of Nuestra Senora de la Virgen de la Caridad.|$|R
50|$|The Bergrat Müller Pond {{was laid}} out from 1737 to 1738 to supply water for mining, some 30 years after the nearby Erichsburger Teich had been {{constructed}} in 1709. Water was stored in the pond in order to drive water wheels that <b>drained</b> the nearby <b>pit</b> of Prince Charles William and which, between 1708 and 1741, as well as pyrite and fluorite, produced annually 12,000 tonnes of chalcopyrite, from which about 25 t of copper was extracted. Near the pond lies an abandoned, heavily overgrown quarry, in which the Zweiglimmer granite of the Upper Carboniferous of the Ramberg massif may be seen at the surface with its well-developed weathering zones.|$|R
50|$|At {{a rate of}} 500 bombs a {{week they}} were defuzed and {{individually}} coated in a waxy preservative to seal them. Seventy-two irreparable devices were neutralised on-site by being <b>drained</b> into individual <b>pits</b> filled with caustic soda crystals. Despite being given a preservative covering the bombs continued to suffer in the damp Welsh climate and in 1951 twenty-one 'Bellman' hangars were erected on the site to store the bombs. Finally in June 1954 {{it was decided to}} dispose of the entire stock because by then it was recognised that not only did the weapons have no military value but they had actually become a liability, which could only become worse as time passed.|$|R
50|$|The site {{covers the}} two {{adjacent}} karstic basins <b>draining</b> into Brimble <b>Pit</b> and Cross Swallet. These {{are the two}} best defined of the belt of large shallow closed depressions which account for the total topography along {{the southern edge of}} the Mendip Hills. The Brimble Pit depression has a large old lake sediment floor now pitted with sinkholes, while the Cross Swallet Basin feeds to a single active sinkhole around which are well preserved terraces of both rock and sediment. Both depressions have marginal cols feeding to overflow channels now permanently dry. The site also contains important Pleistocene/Quaternary mammal remains withinsediments infilling former caverns exposed on the north east face of Westbury Quarry.|$|R
50|$|Site cleanup {{began with}} the 1983-1985 {{formation}} of the Leviathan Mine Pollution Abatement Project by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (LRWQCB) which was built {{in an effort to}} mitigate acid mine drainage. The State of California acquired Leviathan from Alpine Mining Enterprises in 1984, and the California State Water Resources Control Board gained jurisdiction over the property. The Leviathan Mine Pollution Abatement Project consisted of building <b>drains</b> beneath the <b>pit</b> to capture contaminated water and making evaporation ponds, filling and regrading the pit, and separating uncontaminated surface water from AMD groundwater. Results of the project include the discovery of unknown acidic springs and accidental AMD discharge directly into Leviathan Creek via a drain line.|$|R

5000|$|Blackett {{was also}} {{involved}} in coal and lead mining, having [...] "by the product of his mines and collieries acquired a very great fortune". He invested heavily in the local coalfield, and once spent £20,000 in an unsuccessful attempt to <b>drain</b> a flooded <b>pit.</b> He {{is believed to have}} extended his fortune by buying land in the 1660s and 1670s. He also acted as business adviser to Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle. From 1669 until his death, he was sub-farmer of coal duties. He became Deputy Lieutenant of the county in 1670. In 1672, he was involved in a dispute with the local customs officials as member of the syndicate which leased the coal export duties from Lord Townshend for £3,200 a year. He was J.P. for Northumberland from 1673 until his death.|$|R
50|$|The mining {{jurisdiction}} and the tithes {{that had}} been granted in 1235 to the Brunswick Welfs and enfeoffed in 1296 to the knights of the Gowische were {{taken over by the}} Sechsmannen in 1356 and then from them to the town council. In 1359 the Goslar Mining Law was passed. As a consequence of this development, the council sought in 1360 to resolve the drainage issue in order to reactivate the mine that had now almost come to a standstill. In 1407, 1418 and 1432, the council tried, in association with foreign investors and various master miners, to <b>drain</b> the <b>pits.</b> In the years 1453-1456 Claus von Gotha achieved partial success with the Heinzenkunst a water wheel designed to lift and empty a chain of water buckets. By 1471 mining had recovered {{to such an extent that}} the council introduced new charges for the trades and ended up buying all the shares from the mine's owner. From 1478 the smelting of metals was also facilitated by the new Seigerverfahren dressing process. Attempts by the dukes of Brunswick to redeem the pledge for the Rammelsberg again redeem were prevented by the town in 1477 and 1484. Goslar experienced a major boom from the proceeds of the mine and smelters. By 1511 the council was able to gain sole ownership of all mines at Rammelsberg.|$|R
50|$|The Sacramento River's {{watershed}} is {{the largest}} entirely in California, covering much of {{the northern part of}} the state. The endorheic (closed) Goose Lake drainage basin in southern Oregon, however, has been known to overflow into the Sacramento River system during particularly wet years. The Sacramento River basin generally lies between the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range on the east and the Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains in the west, although the part of the basin <b>drained</b> by the <b>Pit</b> River extends east of the Cascades. The Pit River, has the distinction of being one of three rivers that cut through the main crest of the Cascades; its headwaters rise on the western extreme of the Basin and Range Province, east of major Cascade volcanoes such as Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak. The other two are the Klamath River and Columbia River.|$|R
50|$|In 1701, Georg Christoff von Utterodt, {{who came}} from Ilmenau, took over the post of Chief Mining Officer (Berghauptmann) for Straßberg. He united all the pits into a single company or Großgewerkschaft with 1,024 mining shares (Kuxen). The {{following}} main pits now came under Utterodt's leadership: Segen Gottes, Hilfe Gottes, Gott hilft gewiß, Vertrau auf Gott (later renamed as Grube Glasebach), {{as well as the}} neighbouring lodes and the pits of Hayn and Schwenda. In addition there were man-riding, water wheel and hoisting shafts. In 1703-1704, Utterodt had the Schindelbrüch Ditch laid between the ponds of Gräfingründer Teich and the Fauler Pfützenteich. By 1707, six mining ponds had been added with a total retention capacity of about 380,000 m³, as well as two more mining ditches. The Schindelbrüch Ditch (Schindelbrücher Kunstgraben) was able to supply all the Straßberg ponds with water and is the oldest Kunstgraben in the Lower Harz Pond and Ditch System. In addition he had the Hüttenstollen built, a deep gallery, from the Selke valley, to <b>drain</b> the <b>pit</b> water from the pits of Getreuer Bergmann, Gott hilft gewiß, Glückauf and Zum Schwarzen Hirsch. Under Utterodt's leadership, the Straßberg Field became the most important mining area in the Harz from 1704. The financial difficulties of the company that arose after 1707 were resolved in 1708 on the Straßberger Gewerkentag ("Straßberg Trade Day") under the leadership of Johann Jeremias Gründler (1681-1753) and Dr. Jakob Waitz. Utterodt finished working in Straßberg in 1709.|$|R
5000|$|Since inheriting the baronetcy in 1763 Sir Thomas {{had always}} taken an active {{personal}} interest {{in the management of}} the estate and adopted pioneering techniques in both agriculture and the extractive industries, especially in coal mining. His estate comprised property in many of the townships stretching between Tadcaster and Leeds in the West Riding and included not only extensive farmland, but limestone quarries at Huddlestone and coal mines at Parlington, Garforth, Barnbow, Sturton, and Seacroft. Gascoigne was responsive to new developments in the extractive industries and eager to adopt these new techniques to exploit his mineral assets to the full. As a result he managed to double the vend from his coal mines from some 51,000 tons in 1762 to 115,950 tons in 1810. In late 1790 and again in 1801 Sir Thomas employed the Catholic coal viewer John Curr to advise on his mines. Curr was the colliery steward to Charles Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and was likely to have been recommended to Gascoigne by the Duke. Curr recommended the introduction into the mines of iron tramways underground - some of the earliest introduced in Britain - and the installation of atmospheric steam engines for both <b>draining</b> the <b>pits</b> and winding the coal. The introduction of these measures by Curr, and in particular his iron tramways, significantly extended the working life of each pit and enabled the greater exploitation of coal at the Gascoigne collieries.|$|R
40|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{was undertaken}} by Cotswold Archaeology in January and February 2014. The earliest features identified comprised {{a small group}} of pit-like features containing fragments of pottery, flintwork and charred hazelnut shells. Radiocarbon dates on recovered hazelnut shells show that the features were of Early Neolithic date. It is possible that they related to transient occupation, with some of the larger features representing tree-throws while the smaller examples appear to be postholes. The latter include alignments that suggest the presence of a structure, but there is no overall pattern that can be interpreted as a building. Subsequent occupation towards the centre of the stripped area consisted of Iron Age to early Roman occupation beginning in the later Iron Age (from c. 300 BC), while pottery dating to the 1 st century AD indicates that occupation was continuous until {{around the time of the}} Roman conquest, but perhaps did not outlast the 1 st century. The identified features from these periods comprise, in the main, curving gullies, pits and postholes. In general, postholes lacked distinguishing characteristics such as post-voids and packing, and it was not possible to determine whether the curving gullies were structural or drainage features. Overall, the identified Iron Age/early Roman settlement appears to be of relatively low status and represents a typical small farmstead. Later features included a pattern of post-medieval field boundaries and more recent field <b>drains</b> and <b>pits.</b> This report presents an assessment of the results of the excavation and proposals for summary publication in the county archaeological journal...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{elevation}} models play a {{large role}} in the modeling of hydrological flow processes driven by topology. DEM 2 ̆ 7 s commonly contain spurious sinks that are artifacts of the data rather than true representations of the fluvial terrain. It is sometimes desirable to remove these prior to use in analysis of hydrological flow processes. The most common method of pit removal involves filling the pits to the elevation of the outlet or pour point of the bounded region containing the pit. A new method for pit removal is proposed that poses the solution as the local elevation changes necessary for pit removal that results in a minimum distortion of the original data. This problem is solved through linear programming. The dimensionality of the problem is limited by localizing the problem to the region <b>draining</b> to each <b>pit.</b> In order to ensure a unique local solution a carving solution is used to impose a flow field with a corresponding set of unique constraints for the linear program. The resulting changes to the elevation grid, though not guaranteed to be a global minimum, are smaller than those from traditional filling techniques or carving algorithms alone...|$|R
25|$|Next {{to cross}} are the Doncaster to Gainsborough railway {{line and the}} B1396 road at Auckley Bridge. The Aldam Drain drains Cantley Low Common, and beyond the junction, the river becomes a high level carrier, with {{permanent}} embanking of both banks, and catchwater drains running along the foot of both banks. At Candy Farm there are two pumping stations, the southern one pumping the Black Bank Drain into the river, and the northern one pumping the East Ring <b>Drain.</b> At Tunnel <b>Pits,</b> there are two more pumping stations, and Tunnel Pits Bridge carries the road which follows Vermuyden's North Idle Drain over the channel. Soon, the South Engine Drain is running parallel to the river, as it crosses under Sandtoft Road and the M180 motorway. As it turns to the east again, the Folly Drain also runs parallel, but a little beyond the A161 bridge, the two drains continue to the east, while the river diverts to the north, to run parallel to the North Engine Drain. The Hatfield Waste Drain runs parallel to the North Engine Drain on its south bank, but after the approach on the Torne, there was nowhere for it to go, and so it passes under the North Engine Drain to its north bank through a grade II listed syphon, which was probably built by Samual Foster in 1795 or by Thackray in 1813 {{as part of a}} series of improvements recommended by the engineer John Rennie.|$|R
40|$|Background: Mosquito Larval Source Management (LSM) {{could be}} a {{valuable}} additional tool for integrated malaria vector control especially in areas with focal transmission like the highlands of western Kenya {{if it were not}} for the need to target all potential habitats at frequent intervals. The ability to determine the productivity of malaria vectors from identified habitats might be used to target LSM only at productive ones. Methods: Each aquatic habitat within three highland sites in western Kenya was classified as natural swamp, cultivated swamp, river fringe, puddle, open <b>drain</b> or burrow <b>pit.</b> Three habitats of each type were selected in each site in order to study the weekly productivity of adult malaria vectors from February to May 2009 using a sweep-net and their habitat characteristics recorded. Results: All surveyed habitat types produced adult malaria vectors. Mean adult productivity of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato in puddles (1. 8 /m 2) was 11 – 900 times higher than in the other habitat types. However, puddles were the most unstable habitats having water at 43 % of all sampling occasions and accounted for 5 % of all habitats mapped in the study areas whereas open drains accounted for 72 %. Densities of anopheline late instars larvae significantly increased with the presence of a biofilm but decreased with increasing surface area or when water was flowing.

The initial response was to decontaminate the valve pit between tank W- 12 and the evaporator service tank (W- 22) to determine if personnel could enter the pit to attempt repair of the leaking flange. Preventing the spread of radioactive contamination from the pit to the environment and to other waste systems was of concern during the decontamination. The <b>drain</b> in the <b>pit</b> goes to the process waste system; therefore, if high-level liquid waste were generated during decontamination activities, {{it would have to be}} removed from the pit by means other than the available liquid waste connection. Remote decontamination of W- 12 was conducted using the General Mills manipulator bridge and telescoping trolley and REMOTEC RM- 10 manipulator. The initial objective of repairing the leaking flange was not conducted because of the repair uncertainty and the unknown tank inleakage. Rather, new piping was installed to empty the W- 12 tank that would bypass the valve pit and eliminate the need to repair the flange. The radiological surveys indicated that a substantial decontamination factor was achieved...|$|R

The Aldam Drain drains Cantley Low Common, and beyond the junction, the river becomes a high level carrier, with {{permanent}} embanking of both banks, and catchwater drains running along the foot of both banks. At Candy Farm there are two pumping stations, the southern one pumping the Black Bank Drain into the river, and the northern one pumping the East Ring <b>Drain.</b> At Tunnel <b>Pits,</b> there are two more pumping stations, and Tunnel Pits Bridge carries the road which follows Vermuyden's North Idle Drain over the channel. Soon, the South Engine Drain is running parallel to the river, as it crosses under Sandtoft Road and the M180 motorway. As it turns to the east again, the Folly Drain also runs parallel, but a little beyond the A161 bridge, the two drains continue to the east, while the river diverts to the north, to run parallel to the North Engine Drain. The Hatfield Waste Drain runs parallel to the North Engine Drain on its south bank, but after the approach on the Torne, there was nowhere for it to go, and so it passes under the North Engine Drain to its north bank through a grade II listed syphon, which was probably built by Samual Foster in 1795 or by Thackray in 1813 {{as part of a}} series of improvements recommended by the engineer John Rennie.|$|R
500|$|F-Zero GX is {{a futuristic}} racing game where up to thirty {{competitors}} race on massive circuits inside plasma-powered machines in an intergalactic [...] It is {{the successor to}} F-Zero X and continues the series' difficult, high-speed racing style, retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the Nintendo 64 game. Tracks include enclosed tubes, cylinders, tricky jumps, and rollercoaster-esque paths. Some courses are littered with innate obstacles like dirt patches and mines. A heavy {{emphasis is placed on}} track memorization and reflexes, which aids in completing the game. Each machine handles differently, has its own performance abilities affected by its weight, and a grip, boost, and durability trait graded on an A to E (best to worst) scale. Before a race, the player is able to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed. Every machine has an energy meter, which serves two purposes. First, it is a measurement of the machine's health and is decreased, for example, when the machine hits another racer or the side of the track. Second, the player is usually given the ability to boost after the first lap. Boosting greatly increases the racer's speed for a few seconds, but also <b>drains</b> their energy. <b>Pit</b> areas and dash plates are located at various points around the track for vehicles to drive over. The former replenishes energy, while the latter gives a speed boost without using up any energy. The less time spent in the pit area, the less energy will regenerate. Courses may also have jump plates, which launch vehicles into the air enabling them to cut corners.|$|R
