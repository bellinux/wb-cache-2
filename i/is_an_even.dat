5|$|Analogously, the {{alternating}} {{group is a}} subgroup of index 2 in the symmetric group on n letters. The elements of the {{alternating group}}, called even permutations, are the products of even numbers of transpositions. The identity map, an empty product of no transpositions, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> permutation since zero is even; it is the identity element of the group.|$|E
5|$|More recently, the {{discovery}} of Zhenyuanlong established {{the presence of a}} full feathered coat in relatively large dromaeosaurs. Additionally, the animal displays proportionally large, aerodynamic wing feathers, as well as a tail-spanning fan, both of which are unexpected traits that may offer an understanding of the integument of large dromaeosaurs. Dakotaraptor <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> larger dromaeosaur species with evidence of feathers, albeit indirect in the form of quill knobs.|$|E
5|$|Countless {{results in}} number theory invoke the {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers, so the above choices have far-reaching consequences. For example, {{the fact that}} positive numbers have unique factorizations means that one can determine whether a number has an even or odd number of distinct prime factors. Since 1 is not prime, nor does it have prime factors, it {{is a product of}} 0 distinct primes; since 0 <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number, 1 has an even number of distinct prime factors. This implies that the Möbius function takes the value , which is necessary for it to be a multiplicative function and for the Möbius inversion formula to work.|$|E

5|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system. The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a morphogen, resulting {{in the growth of}} a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be feedback control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create standing wave patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a chemical oscillator.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} fish are {{viviparous}}. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood supply {{with that of the}} embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, splitfins, and lemon shark. Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. Intrauterine cannibalism <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.|$|E

5|$|Zeta Coronae Borealis is {{a double}} star with two blue-white {{components}} 6.3arcseconds apart that can be readily separated at 100xmagnification. The primary is of magnitude5.1 and the secondary is of magnitude6.0. Nu Coronae Borealis is an optical double, whose components are a similar distance from Earth but have different radial velocities, hence {{are assumed to be}} unrelated. The primary, Nu1 Coronae Borealis, is a red giant of spectral type M2III and magnitude 5.2, lying 640±30 light-years distant, and the secondary, Nu2 Coronae Borealis, is an orange-hued giant star of spectral type K5III and magnitude 5.4, estimated to be 590±30light-years away. Sigma Coronae Borealis, on the other hand, is a true multiple star system divisible by small amateur telescopes. It is actually a complex system composed of two stars around as massive as the Sun that orbit each other every 1.14days, orbited by a third Sun-like star every 726years. The fourth and fifth components are a binary red dwarf system that is 14,000AU distant from the other three stars. ADS 9731 <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> rarer multiple system in the constellation, composed of six stars, two of which are spectroscopic binaries.|$|E
