40|$|Superconducting Flux-Flow Oscillators (FFO) {{as local}} {{oscillators}} for radio astronomy are perfectly suited {{to be combined}} with SIS-mixing-devices in standard Nb/A 1 -AlOxfNb technology, having the potential to result in highly sophisticated integrated receivers up to the terahertz region. Oscillator linewidth and-stability are of exceptional importance for radio astronomical applications. A spectroscopic measurement setup for the 350 GHz-band has been built up to investi gate the radiation properties of superconducting oscillators. We report on unique time resolved measurements of Flux-Flow Oscillator radiation characteristics usin g a modified KOSMA Acousto-Optical Spectrometer (AOS). Measurements with an inte gration time of 1 us result in a FFO linewidth of less than 1 MHz at 350 GHz. A simultaneously recorded spectrum analyzer trace with a sweep time of 40 ms shows a FFO-linewidth of more than 20 MHz. It is concluded that the time averaged linewidth of the Flux-Flow Oscillator- {{as can be seen}} on the spectrum analyzer- is due to frequency modulation of the intrinsic FFO-signal by low <b>frequency</b> <b>pickup.</b> A series of time resolved FFO-spectra gives a detailed impression of the evolution of the intrinsic FFO lineshape with time.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to describe the relationship between specific local government solid waste and recycling program attributes and recyclable material recovery. The characteristics of solid waste and recycling programs vary greatly across North Carolina, achieving variable levels of recyclable material recovery rates. Given that solid waste disposal is increasing at a significant rate in North Carolina and approximately 20 years of landfill space remain in the state’s landfills, solid waste directors and recycling coordinators face an enormous amount of pressure to divert as much materials as possible to recycling programs. Through a survey of North Carolina solid waste and recycling program managers, this study collected vital data regarding characteristics of waste and recycling collection programs including <b>pickup</b> <b>frequencies,</b> weekly waste and recycling collection capacities, recycling separation requirements, and other variables presumed to be related to recyclable material recovery rates. Using correlation analyses and significance tests, the study revealed which solid waste and recycling program characteristics are most closely related to recyclable materials recovery. The study showed the three variables most closely related to recyclable materials recovery are recycling <b>pickup</b> <b>frequency,</b> separation methods and provision of recycling equipment. Solid waste and recycling program managers interested in maximizing recyclable material recovery rates should evaluate these three program attributes first to determine if improvements could be made. Recycling <b>pickup</b> <b>frequency</b> should be maximized, separation methods should be minimized and local governments should increase convenience for residents to obtain recycling bins or carts...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} wiring {{places the}} coils in buck parallel. The equal common-mode mains hum interference cancels, while the string variation signal sums. This method {{has a more}} neutral effect on resonant frequency: mutual capacitance is doubled (which if inductance were constant would lower the resonant frequency), and inductance is halved (which would raise the resonant frequency without the capacitance change). The net is no change in resonant <b>frequency.</b> This <b>pickup</b> wiring is rare, as guitarists {{have come to expect}} that humbucking 'has a sound', and is not neutral. On fine jazz guitars, the parallel wiring produces significantly cleaner sound, as the lowered source impedance drives capacitive cable with lower high frequency attenuation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Our past {{studies have}} shown that {{cigarette}} smoke inhibits oviductal functioning in vivo and in vitro. The goals in this study were to identify pyrazine derivatives in cigarette smoke solutions that inhibit ciliary beat <b>frequency,</b> oocyte <b>pickup</b> rate, and infundibular smooth muscle contraction in the hamster oviduct and to determine their lowest observable adverse effect levels (LOAELs) using in vitro bioassays. Methods MS smoke solutions were fractionated using solid phase extraction cartridges and the fractions were both tested on the hamster oviduct in vitro and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify individual pyrazine derivatives. Commercial pyrazine standards were purchased, assayed for purity, and tested in dose-response studies on hamster oviducts. The LOAEL and efficacy were determined for each compound in the in vitro bioassays. Statistical significance was determined using the Student's t-Test where p Results The LOAELs for the most inhibitory pyrazine derivatives in the ciliary beat <b>frequency,</b> oocyte <b>pickup</b> rate, and infundibular smooth muscle contraction assays were as follows: for pyrazine (1 picomolar, 10 picomolar, and 1 nanomolar); for 2 -methylpyrazine (1 picomolar, 10 picomolar, and 10 picomolar); and for 2 -ethylpyrazine (1 picomolar, 10 picomolar, and 1 picomolar). Six of the seven pyrazine derivatives tested (pyrazine, 2 -methylpyrazine, 2 -ethylpyrazine, 2 -methoxy- 3 -methylpyrazine, 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine, and 2, 3, 5 -trimethylpyrazine) were inhibitory in picomolar or nanomolar doses in all three bioassays, while the seventh derivative, 2, 6 -dimethylpyrazine, had LOAELs in the nanomolar to micromolar range. Conclusion This work shows that very low doses of pyrazines significantly inhibit proper oviductal functioning, raising questions regarding the safety of these compounds in cigarettes and other consumer products. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Having both pickups {{cranked up}} at full volume {{produces}} the classic scooped, [...] "growling" [...] sound which many players—such as Marcus Miller and Will Lee—use for slap bass playing. This sound {{is the product}} of certain <b>frequencies</b> from both <b>pickups</b> being out of phase and cancelling each other, leaving a [...] "scoop" [...] on the midrange.

50|$|The {{turns of}} wire in {{proximity}} {{to each other}} have an equivalent self-capacitance that, when added to any cable capacitance present, resonates with the inductance of the winding. This resonance can accentuate certain <b>frequencies,</b> giving the <b>pickup</b> a characteristic tonal quality. The more turns of wire in the winding, the higher the output voltage but the lower this resonance frequency. The inductive source impedance inherent {{in this type of}} transducer makes it less linear than other forms of pickups, such as piezo-electric or optical. The tonal quality produced by this nonlinearity is, however, subject to taste, and some guitarists and luthiers consider it aesthetically superior to a more linear transducer.|$|R
40|$|It {{is clear}} from simple skin depth {{considerations}} that steady state electromagnetic inspection of thick multi-layered conductors requires low <b>frequency</b> excitation. Conventional <b>pickup</b> sensors, however, lose sensitivity at lower frequencies. Giant magneto resistive materials offer a unique alternative for very low frequency electromagnetic NDE due to their high sensitivity to low frequency fields, small size, ease of use, and low cost. This paper outlines the development and testing of a Very Low Frequency Self-Nulling Probe incorporating a GMR sensor. The initial test results show flaw detectability at depths up to 1 cm in aluminum 2024.

50|$|The {{output voltage}} of {{magnetic}} pickups varies between 100 mV rms to over 1 V rms {{for some of}} the higher output types. Some high-output pickups achieve this by employing very strong magnets, thus creating more flux and thereby more output. This can be detrimental to the final sound because the magnet's pull on the strings can cause problems with intonation as well as damp the strings and reduce sustain. Other high-output pickups have more turns of wire to increase the voltage generated by the string's movement. However, this also increases the pickup's output resistance/impedance, which can affect high <b>frequencies</b> if the <b>pickup</b> is not isolated by a buffer amplifier or a DI unit.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The basic {{requirement}} for the BEPC beam position monitor is the measurement of the beam orbit with 0. 1 mm precision near the collision point. To improve the measurement accuracy, {{the response of the}} beam position monitor pickups was mapped in the laboratory before they were installed in the BEPC ring. The microcomputer-controlled test set consists of high frequency coaxial switches to select each pickup electrode, a movable antenna to simulate the beam, a signal source, a spectrum analyzer to measure the pickup signals, and analysis software. The signal source operates well below the- 3 dB cutoff <b>frequency</b> of the <b>pickups</b> (buttons). We believe that the low-frequency measurement yields the same information as the real beam. The button signals were clear. This calibration technique is satisfactory for BEPC operation...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that oocyte cumulus complex (OCC) pickup rate is inhibited in hamsters when oviducts and OCCs are simultaneously exposed to cigarette smoke solutions, independent of any effect on ciliary beat frequency. The purpose of this research was to determine whether smoke solutions caused a change in adhesion between the OCC and infundibu-lum of the oviduct and to determine whether a change in ad-hesion could account for decreased OCC pickup rate. OCC pickup rate and adhesion were measured before and after in-fundibula or OCCs recovered from acute in vitro exposures to mainstream and sidestream whole, gas, or particulate smoke so-lutions. Ciliary beat frequency was also measured on infundib-ula. Overall, smoke solutions decreased oocyte pickup rate 40 % to 80 % below control levels and increased adhesion 52 % to 91 % above control levels when infundibula were pretreated. A change in adhesion was observed in cases for which decreased OCC pickup rate could not be explained by a change in ciliary beat <b>frequency.</b> OCC <b>pickup</b> rate decreased 20 % to 35 % below control levels and adhesion increased 39 % to 54 % above con-trol levels when OCCs were pretreated. These data show not only that cigarette smoke causes an increase in OCC adhesion to the oviduct, but also that there is a correlation between in-creased adhesion and decreased OCC pickup rate. The results also show that the both the OCC and oviduct are targets of cigarette smoke. The oviduct is more sensitive to the adverse effects of smoke; however, this may be caused by a combined impact on mechanisms involved in both adhesion and ciliary function. cumulus cells; female reproductive tract; oviduct; ovum pickup/ transport; toxicolog...|$|R
40|$|A {{just-in-time}} supply {{pickup and}} delivery system (JSS) manages the logistic operations between a manufacturing plant and its suppliers by controlling the sequence, timing, and <b>frequency</b> of container <b>pickups</b> and parts deliveries, thereby coordinating internal conveyance, external conveyance, and {{the operation of}} cross-docking facilities. The system is important to just-in-time production lines that maintain small inventories. This research studies the logistics, supply chain, and production control of JSS. First, a new meta-heuristics approach (taboo search) is developed to solve a general frequency routing (GFR) problem that has been formulated in this dissertation with five types of constraints: flow, space, load, time, and heijunka. Also, a formulation for cross-dock routing (CDR) has been created and solved. Second, seven issues concerning the structure of JSS systems that employ the previously studied common frequency routing (CFR) problem (Chuah and Yingling, in press) are explored to understand their impacts on operational costs of the system. Finally, a discreteevent simulation model is developed to study JSS by looking at different types of variations in demand and studying their impacts on the stability of inventory levels in the system. The results show that GFR routes at high frequencies do not have common frequencies i...|$|R

In this study, improvement of oocyte quality and ovarian function were attempted using a herbal medicine comprising 7 crude drugs:Angelicae radix,Rehmanniae radix,Plantaginis semen,Lonicerae flos,Carthami flos,Ginseng radix, andCucurbita moschata Duch. Thirty-one women who repeatedly failed to conceive by intracytoplasmic sperm injection took the herbal medicine before breakfast and dinner from the start of menstrual cycle in the ovum pickup cycle. Average patient age was 38. 5 ± 0. 7 years, and the average ovum <b>pickup</b> <b>frequency</b> on the first dosage day was 7. 9 ± 1. 5. To analyze the effects of herbal medicine intake, the number of recovered and mature oocytes, their morphology and physical qualities, as well as the rates of fertilization, oocyte development, and pregnancy was compared before and after intake. The recovered and mature oocyte numbers, oocyte morphology and physical qualities, and fertilization rate were not significantly different before and after drug intake. However, the oocyte development rate was significantly higher(58. 0 %) after herbal medicine intake than before (32. 5 %; p = 0. 0003). Moreover, the successful pregnancy rate was significantly higher after intake than before (6. 9 % versus 0 %; p = 0. 0111).

40|$|The University of Massachusetts Amherst is {{committed}} to sustainability, however, the campus could further reduce its costs and save energy by optimizing the current method of waste removal. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts {{that by the end}} of the century, Earth’s average temperature will rise by 11 degrees Fahrenheit unless society takes action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to the EPA, about one-third of carbon emissions in the U. S. come from transportation. Campus garbage bins are collected by carbon-emitting trucks daily, and large truckable waste compactors are collected about three times per week. The amount of harmful carbon emissions released by trucking all of the compactors to their disposal sites totals 9, 600 pounds of CO 2 (the weight of 12 grand pianos) every week. In this analysis, the current waste removal system is investigated and a method is proposed to save UMass money and energy by reducing the number of waste collections. Initial research focused on how traditional bins could be replaced with solar-powered compactors from Bigbelly Solar Inc. to reduce <b>pickup</b> <b>frequency</b> and generate revenue from separating waste. Findings indicate that solar compactors alone would not have a worthwhile impact on the energy consumption of the UMass campus. Alternatively, a monitoring system that reduces how frequently waste compactors are hauled from campus would have greater impact, saving $ 1, 000 every two weeks, reducing harmful carbon emissions, and using less diesel fuel. Due to the current environmental crisis, UMass should take action to reduce its carbon footprint through this economically favorable system...|$|R

Curator: Rene Christen [...] 'Wavelength' was a group installation project consisting {{of a number of}} discrete works from following artists: Peter Blamey, Monica Brooks, Nicholas Economos, Jon Hunter, Jenny Hyde, Julian Knowles, Emily Morandini, Kusum Normoyle, Jasper Streit. [...] Author's Note: Guitar Environment # 1 is a 5 channel installation work featuring damaged and degraded electric guitar sounds. Compositionally, the work is conceived within a combinatorial or musical 'mobile' framework, where any mix of channels can be listened to in any balance at any time. The playback platform for the installation is designed to create a condition of instability through interference. FM transmitter signals, sharing the same broadcast <b>frequency,</b> compete for <b>pickup</b> by portable FM receivers and headphones worn by listeners. The work thus creates a sense of instability which is articulated through the sound material and platform, aestheticising interference, noise and audio damage. [...] Curator's Note: Sound artists were invited to compose works in a way different from the cinematic baggage associated with surround sound. Each of 5 audio channels for each piece is broadcasted from a different FM transmitter hidden within the space, all transmitting on the same frequency. Audience members are invited to put on headphones tuned into this frequency and explore the soundscape of radio signals which exist within the space by moving through it. Pieces of the artists works emerge and disappear into the cacophony of the cities crowded radio waves and into each other, sometimes ambiguous as to what is the artist's contribution and what is the artifacting inherent in the system or alien signals permeating the boundaries of the installation...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. An {{investigation}} is conducted into the dynamic behaviour {{of a music}} turntable. The dynamic behaviour of the pickup arm is investigated in detail. The dinamic behaviour of the pickup arm {{is important in the}} design of a turntable because it basicly acts as a <b>frequency</b> filter. The <b>pickup</b> arm is under damped and is consequently suseptable to excitation as certain frequencies. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the dynamic behaviour of the turntable experimentally and mathematically by simulation. Chapter 1 serves as the introduction to the study. As the study concerns the music turntable, it is opened with a short background study of music and the role which it plays in today’s society. This is followed by an introduction to dynamic systems in general after which it is shown that the music turntable may be classified as a dynamic system. Chapter 2 describes the construction and the functioning of the turntable. The different components of the turntable is defined and characterised. This is followed by an investigation into the factors that may have an effect on the dynamic behaviour of the turntable. Chapter 3 describes how the turntable was modeled. Firstly mechanical modeling in general is investigated. This is followed by a paragraph. concerning analogy in engineering. Simple models to describe the dynamic behaviour of the pickup arm is presented. The effect of different kinds of damping is investigated. A more complex model is developed and described. The mathematical method used to investigate this modelis also described. Chapter 4 describes the experimental work that was performed to verify the simulation "results. The aim of the experimental work is firstly described and. then followed by the description of the general experimental facilities. The excitation, measurement and data - processing is discussed -in detail. The procedure that was followed to find the transfer function of the pickup arm is set out. This is followed by describing the procedure that was followed to find the dynamic behaviour of the pickup arm when it is excited by an impulse, step and a sweep function. Chapter 5 discusses the experimental and theoretical methods that were used to obtain the constants which were used in the simulation. Values for most of the constants were obtained experimentally. The constants were obtained by comparing the dynamic behaviour of each component with the dynamic behaviour of a simple system that 'can be solved in the closed form. Chapter 6 discusses the results that were obtained by comparing the experimental and the simulation results, that were obtained for the different excitations. This is followed by a discussion about the complex excitations that are possible when a stilus is pulled along a groove. Chapter 7 consists of two paragraphs. The work that was done is briefly summarised and this is followed by an evaluation of this study...|$|R
