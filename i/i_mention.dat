25|$|For myself, I am now in my 63rd year, yet my {{constitution}} is not seriously impaired, {{as you may}} conclude when <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> that I still am able to skate, to play at cricket occasionally with my sons, and that last year I rowed with them upon the Tay, a distance of eight miles, as stroke of a Four-oar? Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised. It is true we used to be told, even in those days, that no man in a Racing-Boat could expect to live to the age of thirty.|$|E

500|$|Dark Horse's Buffy the Vampire Slayer-related comics {{feature the}} lesbian {{characters}} of Willow, Tara and Kennedy and the closeted character Andrew {{from the television}} series. The Buffy Season Eight comics attracted media attention when the title character has a one night stand with another girl who {{had fallen in love}} with her. The encounter was repeated, but both the character and the creators denied that this made Buffy gay, with Joss Whedon saying: [...] "We're not going to make her gay, nor are we going to take the next 50 issues explaining that she's not. She's young and experimenting, and did <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> open-minded?".|$|E
500|$|Despite these partnerships, PewDiePie {{maintains}} that he conducts very few promotions {{and works with}} few brands. Additionally, PewDiePie posted on Reddit, [...] "I make more than I need from YouTube", adding, [...] "with that freedom, but also to respect my fans for making that possible, I don't end up doing many endorsements." [...] On this topic, PewDiePie has claimed that it is disappointing when {{a large chunk of}} people misinterpret a component of his character; he states, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> on Twitter that I find this or that Kickstarter project cool, people immediately start to ask what economical interests I might have in it. Things like that can bring me down. But it's not personal; some people just prefer to believe the worst about others at any given time." ...|$|E
500|$|After Francis' death, Franklin became {{involved}} in promoting inoculation in Philadelphia: he published many studies on its value, working with several physicians, including the famed William Heberden at the Pennsylvania Hospital, which he helped found. In 1774, he founded the [...] "Society for Inoculating the Poor Gratis", {{in order to help}} the poor people of Philadelphia afford inoculation. In his autobiography, Franklin writes: [...] "In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the smallpox taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> {{for the sake of the}} parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen." ...|$|E

Brar wrote, [...] "Now we’ve got another Abbott organ saving a Newman. The character of Delia Abbott was also rich in history because of her parentage: she’s Billy’s child with {{the daughter of the}} Chancellor maid. This was a legacy character belonging to two families: the Abbotts and the Chancellors." [...] Similarly, Jamey Giddens of Zap2it noted Delia to be [...] "not only an Abbott, but the granddaughter of original character, Jill Foster. Did <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> Delia is also the child of Kate Valentine aka Chloe Mitchell, herself the goddaughter of Katherine Chancellor, whose death the canvas is still reeling from?", referring to the death of Katherine Chancellor that occurred only two months earlier, which was still a prominent topic in Genoa City.|$|E
2500|$|In 1801 Godwin {{married his}} {{neighbour}} Mary Jane Clairmont. She brought {{two of her}} own children into the household, Charles and Claire. Journalist H.N. Brailsford wrote in 1913, [...] "She was a vulgar and worldly woman, thoroughly feminine, and rather inclined to boast of her total ignorance of philosophy." [...] While Fanny eventually {{learned to live with}} Clairmont, Mary's relationship with her stepmother was tense. Mary writes, “As to Mrs Godwin, something very analogous to disgust arises whenever <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> her”.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{manuscript}} {{he wrote in}} 1704 in which he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible, Newton estimated {{that the world would}} end no earlier than 2060.
