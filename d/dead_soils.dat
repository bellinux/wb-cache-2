40|$|Póster Sp 2. presentado en el 4 º Congreso ibérico de ecología, 16 - 19 junio 2015 Coimbra (Portugal) Cork oak forests (Quercus suber) of the Iberian Peninsula are {{affected}} by severe problems of tree decline and mortality induced by global-change drivers such as exotic pathogens (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and climate change. Previous {{studies have shown that}} oak decline translates into alterations of ecosystem processes such as mineralization and nutrient availability. We hypothesize that these indirect impacts of global change on soil processes might be amplified in a near future by direct effects of changes in temperature and rainfall on soil processes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a factorial experiment where we analyzed the effect of projected changes in climate on C mineralization and N and P availability in soils taken under Q. suber trees differing in health status (healthy, defoliated, <b>dead).</b> <b>Soils</b> were incubated during a 28 -day period under three different scenarios of temperature (average spring, + 3 ºC and + 5 ºC) and four soil moistures (wet spring, the average spring soil moisture, a reduction of 20 % in soil moisture and an extremely dry spring). We detected a general reduction in C mineralization and N and P availability as a consequence of a decrease in moisture; meanwhile the increase of temperature had a low impact on these variables. However, the negative effect of moisture reduction on soil variables was higher under defoliated and dead trees than under healthy trees. In summary our results suggest that the process of oak decline induces changes in soil properties that reduce their stability against the direct impact of climate-change type drought.

In reality, this is not such a straightforward explanation. Although it is true, farmers did clear the land, which eventually caused salt scalds to form and land to die, the state government and its agencies must also be considered a major proponent in the equation. Government policies with regard to clearing requirements and creating farms in fragile environments, and their subsequent inability to find ‘the’ solution is a matter of record.

40|$|ABSTRACT Need for {{effective}} ground improvement has been attracting {{the attention of}} field consultant and research scholar {{all over the world}} for quite some time. For obvious regions ground improvement is becoming necessary as a large variety of soil conditions exist where ever a sensitive and major construction is planned. Better areas have been utilized and the growth of urban centers has become dependent on building, structures in the peripheral areas, presently under different land uses like supporting surface bodies, belonging to bad land conditions or agricultural lands. It has been found that lands reclaimed from water logged areas and from water bodies possess <b>dead</b> or passive <b>soil</b> layers up to a few meters from top, composed of detrimental material, slush and humus rendering the top soil as totally useless for founding any structure upon. Such areas also support raised water table profiles which further reduces the strength of almost <b>dead</b> and passive <b>soil.</b> Such areas which are invariably present in the out skirts of every growing urban center in countries like India. The field engineer, developers, builders and authorities all face the problem of building economical and safer structures or habitation, particularly with the present trends of high rise structures.

They include direct, or first-order effects {{on a wide variety}} of {{ecosystem}} components—plants, animals, <b>dead</b> biomass, <b>soils,</b> and air, as well as indirect, or second-order effects that take place over time and depend in large part on post-fire phenomena such as weather, land-use, seed availability, and insect and disease occurrence (Reinhardt et al. 2001). Important first-order fire effects include plant injury and mortality, fuel consumption, smoke production, and soil heating. They occur at the time of the fire or within seconds or minutes afterward, and they are generally restricted to the location of the fire. Second-order effects, which are those that are often of most interest to land managers, include vegetation succession, fuel dynamics, erosion, air quality, and water quality. They may take place over days or years following a fire, and may occur off-site. Knowledge of first-order fire effects is necessary but not sufficient to predict second-order effects. Modeling fire effects to provide information for land managers is difficult for three reasons: 1) the intrinsic variability of the natural systems being modeled is large; 2) the data needed for modeling with precision may not be available to decision-makers; and 3) the information needs of land managers are diverse and require predictions at a variety of temporal and spatial scales.|$|R

The use of global averages and necessary methodological assumptions has questioned the ability of the ecological footprint to represent local or national specific concerns. This paper attempts to incorporate greater national relevancy by expanding the sequestration estimate used to calculate the annual carbon footprint of domestic Irish energy use. This includes expanding existing study boundaries to include additional carbon pools such as the litter, <b>dead</b> and <b>soil</b> pools. This generated an overall estimate of 4. 38 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year (t C/ha/yr), resulting in an ecological footprint estimate of 0. 49 hectares per capita (ha/cap) The method employed in this paper also incorporated the potential role of grassland as a carbon sink. The caveat that the resultant value is dependent on the choice of study boundary is discussed. Including the lateral movement of carbon embodied in farm products (effectively placing the boundary around the farm gate) reduces the estimate of grassland carbon sequestration by approximately 44 % to 1. 82 t C/ha/yr. When a footprint calculated using an overall sequestration estimate (based on the distribution of Irish grassland and forestry) is translated into global hectares (gha), the standardized value is reduced by 35 %. sequestration; carbon footprint; forest; grassland...|$|R

During the years 1996 - 2005 first commercial thinning of lodgepole pine at SCA took place. The goal of the hereby presented study was to investigate the growth and stability in those firstly-thinned lodgepole pine stands a few years after thinning. Furthermore, the objective was to investigate the relationship between stand stability and different stand parameters. Additionally, lodgepole pine stem quality was estimated. The study is mainly based on the data collected during an inventory project carried out at SCA in 2008. Altogether 91 lodgepole pine stands in northern Sweden were measured after the first thinning. Since the same stands were inventoried in 2004 and 2005, chosen results such as thinning grade, strip-road width and the distance between strip roads were used as additional data in correlation matrix. It was found that: • The average volume of dead trees in the inventoried 91 lodgepole pine stands was 3, 8 m 3 sk/ha being equal to 2, 3 % of the standing volume at the time of the inventory. • In terms of the number of trees, dead trees formed on average 3, 9 % of the total number of inventoried lodgepole pine trees. • No correlation between the volume of <b>dead</b> trees and <b>soil</b> type, soil moisture, stands dominant slope or stands dominant height above sea level was found.

Our observations show that even relatively light drought decreased total fine root biomass from 272. 0 to 242. 8 g m- 2 and increased the amount of necromass from 79. 2 to 101. 2 g m- 2 in the top 35 cm of soil. Very fine roots, i. e. those with diameter up to 1 mm, were more affected than total fine roots defined as 0 - 2 mm. The effect of reduced water availability was depth-specific, as a result we observed a modification of vertical distribution of fine roots. More roots in drought treatment were produced in the wetter soil horizons at 25 - 35 cm depth than at the surface.
