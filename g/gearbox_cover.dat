It placed third in the 1999 Car of the Century competition.|$|E
40|$|The master’s thesis {{incorporates}} {{the control system}} Sinumerik 840 D to {{the most widely used}} control systems of CNC machine tools. In the first thesis part are analyzed the NC programming methodics, which are relative only to the control system Sinumerik 840 D and an essentials necessary to understand the issue in the area of CNC machine tools. Next part of the thesis includes design of the technology and processing of the NC program for machined component (<b>gearbox</b> <b>cover).</b> The NC program is made by ShopMill that is focused on a workshop area. During the program creation is combined a ShopMill and parametric programming, with using of a conditional jump instructions and repetitions. The final part of the thesis includes verification of the selected component production process by simulation and technical-economic evaluation of the designed technology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- <b>Gearbox</b> top <b>cover</b> {{is a vital}} {{component}} of horizontally split integrally geared centrifugal compressor. Reliability of top cover {{is directly related to}} the structural rigidity and structural integrity of compressor. Assuming that the top cover is designed within the mechanical limits of its construction material, one of the most common causes of top cover failure is resonance. The aim of the designer while designing top cover is to have minimum weight and still have sufficient rigidity to avoid resonance. It is imperative; however, that rigorous engineering analysis is applied in the initial design phase to prevent resonance that will result in failure of <b>gearbox</b> top <b>cover.</b> To meet the objectives of designing a reliable integrally geared centrifugal compressor, <b>gearbox</b> top <b>cover</b> modal analysis is of utmost importance. Numerical modal analysis, usually based on Finite Element Method, is commonly used to determine the vibration characteristics, such as natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes of a structure. This paper addresses finite element analysis and modal testing of <b>gearbox</b> top <b>cover</b> of an integrally geared centrifugal compressor. The goal is to determine, verify and validate the vibration characteristics of the <b>gearbox</b> top <b>cover</b> using both analytical and experimental techniques. The 3 -D solid model of the <b>gearbox</b> top <b>cover</b> was built using Autodesk Inventor®. ANSYS workbench 13 ® was used for preprocessing, solving and post processing. Modal analysis involved extraction of mode shapes and natural frequencies. Impact testing using hammer excitation was used to experimentally determine the vibration properties of the gearbox to...|$|R

A wider rear wheel holding a wider 180 rear section tyre was also fitted. The 'SPR' was 10 kilos lighter than the WP.|$|R
25|$|In {{comparison}} to the older engine, {{the position of the}} inlet trumpets and exhaust manifolds had been switched, so that the exhausts exited on the upper surface of the engine, within the cylinder vee, and the inlets protruded above the chassis pontoons {{on either side of the}} car. Between the chassis pontoons the engine was covered with a removable, curved panel. Completing the engine cowling was a near-circular <b>gearbox</b> and differential <b>cover</b> at the rear, through which the tail pipes of the exhausts protruded. Shifting the inlets to the outer edges of the car allowed the engine to ingest cooler, denser air, boosting the motor's power output. The compact exhaust bundle also allowed a svelte packaging of the engine bay. However, the heat build-up from the confined manifold necessitated cutting a hole in the top of the engine cover. Despite this, the BRM P261's barrel-shaped rear end became one of its most distinctive visual characteristics.|$|R
