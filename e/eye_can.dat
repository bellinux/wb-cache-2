5|$|Retaliatory punishments, or Qisas, are practised: for instance, an <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> be surgically removed at {{the insistence}} of a victim who lost his own eye. This {{occurred}} in a case reported in 2000. Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya, or blood money, by the perpetrator. There has been a growing trend of exorbitant blood-money demands, for example a sum of $11 million was reported as being recently demanded. Saudi officials and religious figures have criticized this trend and said that the practise of diyya has become corrupted.|$|E

5|$|The {{tears of}} the Eye of Ra {{are part of}} a more general {{connection}} between the Eye and moisture. In addition to representing the morning star, the <b>Eye</b> <b>can</b> also be equated with the star Sothis (Sirius). Every summer, {{at the start of the}} Egyptian year, Sothis' heliacal rising, in which the star rose above the horizon just before the sun itself, heralded the start of the Nile inundation, which watered and fertilized Egypt's farmland. Therefore, the Eye of Ra precedes and represents the floodwaters that restore fertility to all of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, P. schultzi {{can take}} in only a small visual field at one time, as the most acute part of a main <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see all of a circle up to 12millimeters wide at 20centimeters away, or up to 18millimeters wide at 30centimeters away. A Portia spider takes a {{relatively}} long time to see objects, possibly because getting a good image out of such tiny eyes is a complex process and {{needs a lot of}} scanning. This makes a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds, frogs, and mantises, which it often cannot identify because of the other predator's size.|$|E
5|$|In Zloda, Belarus, Amador {{uses the}} {{diamonds}} as payment for a proxcard {{to access the}} Todorov Building in Minsk. The team tracks her there, but Amador escapes. Skye and Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons discover a strange video feed linked to Amador, which they soon discover {{to be coming from}} a camera in her eye, the source of her apparent 'powers'. Seeing the name of the hotel Amador is at through the feed, May tracks her down and confronts her. Amador reveals that her prosthetic eye contains a fail safe, so that her handler, who also relays orders in text-form through the <b>eye,</b> <b>can</b> kill her if she refuses to complete her missions. The two fight until Coulson arrives and stuns Amador. Skye hijacks the feed, and relays it through a pair of glasses that Agent Grant Ward wears, carrying out Amador's mission while Agents Fitz and Simmons remove the prosthetic eye.|$|E

5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes. Looking directly at the Sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness. UV exposure gradually yellows {{the lens of the}} eye over a period of years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks directly at the Sun. Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.|$|E

25|$|Gross {{examination}} - {{the examination}} of diseased tissues with the naked eye. This is important especially for large tissue fragments, because the disease can often be visually identified. It is also at this step that the pathologist selects areas that will be processed for histopathology. The <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> sometimes be aided with a magnifying glass or a stereo microscope, especially when examining parasitic organisms.|$|E
25|$|For artists, most {{pigments}} {{and papers}} have a cool or warm cast, {{as the human}} <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> detect even a minute amount of saturation. Gray mixed with yellow, orange, or red is a “warm gray”. Green, blue, or purple create “cool grays”. Note that this sense of temperature is the reverse of that of real temperature; bluer is described as “cooler” even though it corresponds to a higher-temperature black body.|$|E
25|$|Eyes: The <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> be {{directly}} affected {{in the form}} of episcleritis or scleritis, which when severe can very rarely progress to perforating scleromalacia. Rather more common is the indirect effect of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which is a dryness of eyes and mouth caused by lymphocyte infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands. When severe, dryness of the cornea can lead to keratitis and loss of vision. Preventive treatment of severe dryness with measures such as nasolacrimal duct blockage is important.|$|E

25|$|The {{characteristic}} colours are, {{from long}} to short wavelengths (and, correspondingly, from low to high frequency), red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Sufficient differences in wavelength cause {{a difference in}} the perceived hue; the just-noticeable difference in wavelength varies from about 1nm in the blue-green and yellow wavelengths, to 10nm and more in the longer red and shorter blue wavelengths. Although the human <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> distinguish up to a few hundred hues, when those pure spectral colors are mixed together or diluted with white light, the number of distinguishable chromaticities can be quite high.|$|E
25|$|In the hot process, the {{hydroxide}} and the fat are {{heated and}} mixed together at 80–100°C, a little below boiling point, until saponification is complete, which, before modern scientific equipment, the soapmaker determined by taste (the sharp, distinctive {{taste of the}} hydroxide disappears after it is saponified) or by eye; the experienced <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> tell when gel stage and full saponification has occurred.

25|$|As part of {{the peace}} between England and France, Pope Sixtus IV issued in 1483 a Papal bull {{granting}} the Privilege of Neutrality, by which the Islands, their harbours and seas, {{as far as the}} <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see, were considered neutral territory. Anyone molesting Islanders would be excommunicated. A Royal Charter in 1548 confirmed the neutrality. Not that the French behaved, as they attempted to invade Jersey a year later in 1549 but were defeated by the militia. The neutrality lasted another century, until William III of England abolished the privilege due to privateering activity against Dutch ships.|$|E
