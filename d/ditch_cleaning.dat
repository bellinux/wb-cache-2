40|$|The {{distribution}} {{of the most common}} small mammal species was examined with regard to the main forest phases ('afforestations', mature forests and 'reforestations'), plant communities, basic habitat variables and management techniques in a southern, a central and a northern Swedish region. The density indices from trapping with standard methods showed different patterns of population fluctuation in these regions. There were many clear differences in the {{distribution of}} the various species in the different plant communities. For example, field voles Microtus agrestis and shrews Sorex araneus appeared in highest numbers in luxuriant communities on peaty soil in the autumn, and wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus appeared in greatest numbers in areas with plant colonization on recently abandoned fields. In several instances such habitats could be identified as potential surplus areas for the small mammals. Habitat factors especially germane to the abundance of small mammals were depth of litter and humus, amount of boulders, vertical cover and soil moisture. Significant management techniques in this connection were <b>ditching,</b> <b>cleaning</b> in forest and reforestations and burning. Possible causal relations behind the distributions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|One {{fourth of}} the forests in Finland are growing on drained peatlands. Forestry {{operations}} such as ditch network maintenance increase the export of suspended solids and nutrients, and deteriorate water quality in lakes and rivers. Water protection presupposes {{an understanding of how}} forestry operations affect peatland hydrology. The objective was to study the hydrological impacts of <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> on the basis of water table level and runoff measurements from two pairs of artificially delineated catchments in drained peatland forests in Finland. Data from treated and control catchments indicated that <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> lowered the level of the water table in sites where a shallow peat layer was underlain by mineral soil. In sites with deep peat formation, the water table showed no detectable response to <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning.</b> Runoff data suggested that annual runoff clearly increased after <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning,</b> which was in conflict with the previously reported small impacts of ditch network maintenance. The hydrological model FEMMA was calibrated and applied to assess the conformity of the data and the experimental setup. In the model application, the catchments were assumed to behave as independent hydrological units. However, assessment of the model results and the measurements suggested that <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> had an impact on hydrological measurements in both treated and control catchments. It appeared that the independence assumption was violated and there was a hydrological connection between the artificial catchments and, therefore, the results of the data analysis were considered misleading. Finally, a numerical experiment based on the model simulations was conducted to explain how the assumed relationship between soil moisture and transpiration is reflected in the modelled runoff. Modelled runoff decreases and evaporation increases when ditches are cleaned in poorly drained sites, where the initial ditch depth is small and the depth of a highly conductive topsoil layer is low. The numerical experiment can be applied to assess when <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> does not improve evapotranspiration and is unnecessary...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne fourth (5. 5 Mha) {{of forests}} in Finland are growing on peatlands {{that have been}} drained to improve forest growth. Forestry {{operations}} such as cuttings and ditch network maintenance in these areas may increase export of suspended solids and nutrients, and deteriorate water quality in receiving lakes and rivers. Mitigation of the deterioration calls for understanding how forest management operations affect peatland hydrology. A process-based simulation model FEMMA was applied to quantify the effects of ditch network maintenance on peatland water balance. The model has separate computation routines for evapotranspiration in tree stand and understorey vegetation, snow accumulation and melt, water movement in unsaturated and saturated soil, and drainage. Hydraulic characteristics of peat, as well as different drainage designs can be parameterised in the model. The model was applied in artificially delineated research catchments in northern Finland, where the ditch network was maintained by cleaning and digging the ditches deeper. The simulation results indicated that <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> affected the water balance slightly and the effect was dependent on stand characteristics and soil structure. When the growing stock volume was low and poorly conductive soil extended close to the soil surface, <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> increased evapotranspiration. In stands with a high stock volume and a thick topmost layer of highly conductive soil, evapotranspiration was less affected. In the study catchments, the effect of <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> on runoff was small compared to the error between measured and modelled runoff...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Prevention and {{estimation}} of soil erosion from forest roads {{requires an understanding}} of how road design and maintenance affect sediment production. Seventyfour plots were installed on forest roads in the Oregon Coast Range {{to examine the relationship between}} sediment production and road attributes such as distance between culverts, road slope, soil texture, and cutslope height. An additional comparison was made between road segments with cutslopes and ditches freshly cleared of vegetation and segments with established vegetation on cutslopes and in ditches. All road segments were 5 m wide and insloped with aggregate surfacing, light traffic, and no overhanging forest cover. Sediment production was correlated to the product of segment length times road slope squared. Sediment production from aggregate covered roads on a silty clay loam was about 9 times greater than that from roads constructed on a gravelly loam. Sediment production was not correlated to the cutslope height. Road segments where vegetation was cleared from the cutslope and ditch produced about 7 times as much sediment as road segments where vegetation was retained, showing the potential reduction in erosion by revegetation following construction and the potential impact of <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> during maintenance. Relationships and estimates from this study provide a basis for improved erosion estimates by commonly used empirical procedures. 1...|$|E
40|$|According to {{prevailing}} ecological theory {{one would}} expect the most stable vegetation on sites which are least disturbed (Odum 1971). According to theory one would also expect the most diversity of species on undisturbed sites (Odum 1971). This stable and diverse community would be produced {{over a period of}} many years through a process of plant succession where annual herbs are replaced by perennial herbs and finally woody plants would come to dominate and perpetuate the community. Another ecological theory holds that the complexity (structure and species diversity) of a plant community is dependent upon the amount of disturbance to which it is subjected (Woodwell, 1970). According to this theory the normal succession of a plant community through its various stages may be arrested at some point depending upon the nature and severity of the disturbance. In applying these theories to roadside vegetation it becomes apparent that mass herbicide spraying and extensive mowing of roadsides has produced a relatively simple and unstable vegetation. It follows that if disturbances were reduced not only would the roadside plant community increase in stability but maintenance costs and energy usage would be reduced. In this study we have investigated several aspects of reduced disturbances on roadside vegetation. Research has centered on the effectiveness of spot spraying techniques on noxious weed control, establishment of native grass cover where <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> and other disturbance has left the bare soil exposed and the response of roadside vegetation when released from annual mass spraying...|$|E

40|$|För ett regn med 10 -års återkomsttid och 10 minuters varaktighet {{kommer att}} få en nederbördsökning på 4 % enligt den modell som används i P 104 jämfört med modellen i P 90 som användes vid projekteringen. Om intensitets och varaktighetskurvor ritas upp med hjälp av regndata från Uppsala, kommer det att medföra en nederbördsökning på 24 % jämfört med P 90. Ökningar mellan P 90 och P 104 kommer inte att göra att kapaciteten hos magasinen överskrids eftersom ökningen är så liten. Dock så tyder studierna på att vattnet inte alls tar de vägar som har antagits vid projekteringen och som normalt antas vid dagvattenprojekteringar av detta slag. Det troliga är att större delen av den nederbörd som faller aldrig kommer att nå fram till dikena och infiltrera ner i dessa. Vid små nederbördsmängder kommer större delen av vattnet att infiltrera i stödremsan nära asfaltskanten. Om det kommer större mängder nederbörd kan infiltrationskapaciteten hos stödremsan överskridas, då kommer den yta varvid vattnet infiltrerar att sprida sig till övre delen av dikesslänten. Nederbörden som infiltrerar genom stödremsan kommer att perkolera ned genom marken med en i huvudsak vertikal gradient, men en del av vattnet kommer att transporteras horisontellt in i vägkroppen. Den nederbörd som tar sig in i vägkroppen kommer där att leds till terrassdräneringarna via fiberduken i botten av vägterrassen. Det finns en risk för att vattnet som kommer in i vägterrassen orsakar skador på vägen. Även om nederbörden inte går via de stenfyllda dikena så kommer inte reningseffekten att gå förlorad utan reningen kommer att ske i vägkroppen samt ytskikten och troligtvis bli minst lika hög som den hade blivit om nederbörden tagit den väg som det projekterades för. Det skulle kunna vara så att dikena inte kommer att ha annan effekt än sänkor för grundvattnet och säkra avåkningsytor. The {{purpose of this}} work is to {{describe}} the hydraulics in rock-filled stormwater ditches and surface runoff from roadways, {{and to make a}} statement about the degree of purification based on other research. There has been no research in either impact or cost savings / higher expenses by using this type of system compared to a conventional stormwater systems for motorways. If this type of solution is cost effective it would mean savings for future construction in which this solution is chosen. A comparison was made of how well the calculations based on P 90, which were used during the design stage with the upcoming P 104. P 90 and P 104 is published by the interest association Swedish water and can be viewed as guidelines for water and wastewater industry how to make the design of stormwater systems. For a rainfall of 10 -years return period and a 10 -minutes duration, the precipitation will increase 4 %, according to the model used in the P 104 compared to P 90. If the intensity and duration curves are plotted using rainfall data from Uppsala, it will increase the precipitation 24 % compared to P 90. Increases between P 90 and P 104 will not exceed the capacity of the reservoirs since the increase is so small. If these models are inaccurate and precipitation intensity will be equal to the intensity and duration curves, the capacity of the reservoirs will be exceeded. However, as the studies indicate that the water does not take the way that have been adopted in designing and normally assumed by stormwater projections of this kind. It is likely that most of the precipitation that falls will never reach the ditches and infiltrate into these. For small amounts of precipitation, the majority of the water will infiltrate in the support strip {{near the edge of the}} asphalt. If there are large amounts of rainfall the recharge capacity of the support strip will be exceeded, then the surface water will infiltrate in the upper trench slope. Precipitation that infiltrates through the support strip will be percolating down through the soil with an essentially vertical gradient, but some of the water will be transported horizontally into the road structure. The precipitation that enters the road structure will be led to the collector pipes via fiber cloth in the bottom of the embankment. There is a risk that the water that enters the embankment causes damage to the road. Various injuries that can occur are: reduced friction between the grains in the unbound filling materials, redistribution of loads, pumping, depressions, increased cracking of the carriageway and damage that may occur when freezing during the cold season. Even if the water does not go through the stone-filled stormwater <b>ditches,</b> the <b>cleaning</b> effect will not be lost, purification will take place in the road structure and probably be at least as high as it had been if the precipitation took the way that it was designed for. It could be so that the ditches will have no other effect than sinks for ground water and safe running off surfaces. According to the contractor the cost savings were about 15 % compared to a conventional stormwater systems. This figure is probably on the low side when Ramboll came in late in the projection and had to redo parts of the design of the system during construction time...|$|R
