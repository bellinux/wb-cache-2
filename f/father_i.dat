25|$|During {{a lull in}} January 1891, <b>Father</b> <b>I.</b> Moinet visited Ujiji. There {{he found}} Rumaliza flying a German flag and saying {{he was waiting for}} the Germans to arrive so he could hand over to them. In a letter to Joubert in April 1891, Rumaliza asked if he was {{employed}} by the missionaries or by the government of the Congo. Joubert was evasive in his reply, pointing out that Rumaliza sometimes flew the German flag, sometimes the flag of Zanzibar and sometimes that of Britain.|$|E

25|$|He {{ended his}} {{participation}} {{by saying that}} under the circumstances he felt he could be of no further use to the Convention in the matter. His final word in the Convention was the tragic one – Better for us never to have met than to have met and failed. Late in February the malady from which he was suffering grew worse. He left Dublin for London knowing that a settlement from the Convention was impossible. An operation in March 1918 to remove an intestinal obstruction appeared to progress well at first, but then he suffered heart failure. He died {{a few hours later}} at a London nursing home on 6 March 1918. One of the last things he said to the Jesuit Father who was with him to the end, was, <b>Father,</b> <b>I</b> am a broken hearted man. At the Convention, his last move was an adoption of O’Brien’s policy of accommodating Unionist opposition in the North and in the South. It was too late. Had he joined O’Brien ten years before and carried the Irish Party with him, it is possible that Ireland’s destiny would have been settled by evolution.|$|E
25|$|Pownoll's {{death was}} widely mourned, Pellew writing {{in his report}} to the Admiralty that: 'The loss of Captain Pownoll will be {{severely}} felt. The ship's company have lost a <b>father.</b> <b>I</b> have lost much more, {{a father and a}} friend united; and that friend my only one on earth. Never, my lord, was grief more poignant than that we all feel for an adored commander. Mine is inexpressible.' Admiral John Jervis wrote of him that he was ‘the best officer, & most excellent, kind hearted man in the Profession’, and claimed that he had ‘lost the best Partizan, if not the best officer under every line of description in the Service’. Edward Osler wrote in 1835 that 'St Vincent and Pownoll who were brought up under Boscawen, and received their Lieutenant's commission from him, contributed materially to form a Nelson or an Exmouth; each the founder of a school of officers, whose model is the character of their chief, and their example his successes.' As well as Pellew, John Borlase Warren served under Pownoll and {{went on to become a}} leading frigate captain, while Jervis remembered Pownoll's contribution to the navy in 1804, when he promoted Pownoll's grandson, John Bastard. Pellew named his eldest son Pownoll Bastard Pellew in honour of his former captain and his family.|$|E

500|$|Bruce David Forbes, {{author of}} Religion and Popular Culture in America, {{felt that the}} video drew on Madonna's {{childhood}} experiences and dramatized her efforts to renegotiate these relationships, in her daily interactions with her lover and father, and in relation to Catholicism, which the singer {{referred to in the}} line [...] "Oh <b>father</b> <b>I</b> have sinned". Dunn noticed that like the Pepsi commercial shot for her earlier single [...] "Like a Prayer", Madonna's persona is split into a child and adult, who repeatedly fuse and separate. Leslie C. Dunn commented that as the narrative developed, the child is shown singing, but the adult Madonna's voice is heard, and when the adult Madonna appears in a hallway, her shadow is that of a child. Madonna responded to these observations by saying: [...] "I think the biggest reason I was able to express myself and not be intimidated was not having a mother." ...|$|E
500|$|The elder Lajoie, {{who worked}} as a {{teamster}} and laborer, died not long into the younger Lajoie's childhood, which forced him and his siblings to work to support the family. Lajoie dropped out of school to work in a textile mill. He also began playing semi-professional baseball for the local Woonsocket team under the alias [...] "Sandy", because his parents did not approve of their son playing baseball. He earned money as a taxi driver with a horse and buggy and locally was called [...] "Slugging Cabby." [...] "When I told my <b>father</b> <b>I</b> had decided to take the job he was very angry. He shouted that ball players were bums and that nobody respected them, but I was determined {{to give it a try}} at least one season", Lajoie later said. He also received the nickname [...] "Larry" [...] from a teammate who had trouble pronouncing Lajoie. Lajoie admired baseball players such as King Kelly and Charles Radbourn.|$|E
500|$|For the song, {{which is}} a baroque pop ballad, Madonna uses a {{contrast}} of timbre, her higher smoother voice with her lower one. The song begins {{with the sound of}} violins for about 20seconds. After this, a drum machine, string arrangement and piano ushers on top of the violins, as Madonna sings the chorus line [...] "You can't hurt me now, I got away from you, I never thought I would." [...] The violins and the drum beats drop after the chorus, but come back again during the next bridge. As Madonna sings the verse [...] "Oh <b>father</b> <b>I</b> have sinned", the violins change their pitch to a higher one. After the second chorus, there is an instrumental break where she sings about the realization that her father did not want to hurt her but she still ran away. The song ends with the guitar and violins fading out with Madonna's voice. In an interview with Paul Zollo, Madonna commented that the [...] "Father" [...] can refer to Tony, God or all the [...] "authorities in her life".|$|E

500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song that lasts for three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, while Lohan's vocal range spans from F3 to D5. When asked about the lyrical content of the song, Lohan revealed, [...] "A lot of people go through family issues, abuse {{and that kind of}} thing. I think it's important to show that other people go through it. [...] I hope [...] see what I say in the song is, 'I love you,' so many times, that I need him and the crazy things in my life. I hope he sees the positive side of the video rather than the negative. The video is kind of offensive, but it is very raw. He's my <b>father.</b> <b>I</b> need someone to walk me down the aisle when I get married." [...] The single's b-side, [...] "My Innocence", features a similar message to Lohan's father.|$|E
500|$|Elena Pignatti, who had {{employed}} Morisi {{after she}} left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that [...] "seven or eight years ago... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and {{it was said that}} he was going to die. Around then, one morning... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican <b>Father,</b> <b>I</b> was sure that he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E
