500|$|Mirkin {{intended}} {{to pursue a}} career in electrical engineering, which he saw as a more stable employment opportunity than writing or film making. He took a course at Philadelphia's Drexel University which offered six months of teaching followed by a six-month internship at the National Aeronautics Federal Experimental Center. Mirkin found the experience to be monotonous and unenjoyable and chose to abandon this career path. He decided that [...] "making no money doing something I loved was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> than making a good living doing something I didn't", so took [...] "an enormous chance on show business" [...] and moved to Los Angeles. He attended film school at Loyola Marymount University, and graduated in 1978.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Sonic the Hedgehog was {{composed}} by Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True. Nakamura {{stated that he}} was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack for Sonic the Hedgehog, as he had just started with Dreams Come True. He {{wanted to do it}} because Sega said the game was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> than Mario, and was inspired by the team's desire to outperform Nintendo. He adapted the Genesis' sound chip, and believed the hardest part of creating the soundtrack was the number of sounds that could play concurrently: he was limited to four, and said that his lack of knowledge of music on computers made it [...] "impossible". Nakamura wrote the soundtrack concurrently with [...] "Million Kisses", a studio album for Dreams Come True.|$|E

500|$|The {{election}} of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) in 1932 quelled the public affection for dictators. As the country became increasingly enthralled with FDR, who {{was featured in}} countless newsreels, it exhibited less desire for alternative forms of government. Many Hollywood films reflected this new optimism. Heroes for Sale, despite being a tremendously bleak and at times anti-American film, ends {{on a positive note}} as the New Deal appears as a sign of optimism. When Wild Boys of the Road (1933), directed by William Wellman, reaches its conclusion, a dispossessed juvenile delinquent is in court expecting a jail sentence. However the judge lets the boy go free, revealing to him the symbol of the New Deal behind his desk, and tells him [...] "hings are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> here now, not only here in New York, but all over the country." [...] A box-office casualty of this hopefulness was Gabriel Over the White House, which entered production during the Hoover era malaise and sought to capitalize on it. By the time the film was released on March 31, 1933, FDR's election had produced a level of hopefulness in America that rendered the film's message obsolete.*Black, pg. 144.|$|E
500|$|The Beach Boys's leader, Brian Wilson, was {{responsible}} for the musical composition and virtually all of the arrangement for [...] "Good Vibrations". His cousin and bandmate Mike Love contributed the song's lyrics and its bass vocalization in the chorus. During the recording sessions for the 1966 album Pet Sounds, Wilson began changing his writing process. Rather than going to the studio with a completed song, he would record a track containing a series of chord changes he liked, take an acetate disc home, and then compose the song's melody and write its lyrics. For [...] "Good Vibrations", Wilson said, [...] "I had a lot of unfinished ideas, fragments of music I called 'feels.' Each feel represented a mood or an emotion I'd felt, and I planned to fit them together like a mosaic." [...] Most of the song's structure and arrangement was written as it was recorded. Engineer Chuck Britz is quoted saying that Wilson considered the song to be [...] "his whole life performance in one track". Wilson stated: [...] "I was an energetic 23-year-old. ... I said: 'This is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> than [...] "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'."'" ...|$|E

The weather was not so cold as it had <b>been,</b> and <b>going</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better,</b> so they covered the twenty-two miles to their old camp without much difficulty. Here they had to repair the sledge again, and also had to kill off the lame dog. This made a feast for the others, and gave them some food that was much needed.|$|R

I think when I am a little bit older it is definitely something I'd like to pursue." [...] In another interview, she said: [...] "My musical career is indefinitely on hold. I don't like people who become like 'actor slash singer.' I think people should be one or the other because usually you're not going to be great at both. You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> at one, so you might as well stick to the one you're good at. I'm going for acting." ...|$|E

He lost five kilograms during pre-season training {{in which he}} credited his drink driving charge as a key driver behind wanting to improve his training standards. His drive during the pre-season drew public praise from his teammates including Aaron vandenBerg and Tom McDonald, and Melbourne's development and strategy coach, Brendan McCartney, who all stated they believed Oliver was the player to watch for the 2017 season as he could take his [...] "game to new heights." [...] Furthermore, former Melbourne captain, Garry Lyon, nominated Oliver as the player who could surpass all of his teammates {{in the future to}} become the club's best player by stating on SEN Breakfast's, [...] "they've got a great group of youngsters coming through ... and there's a boy called Clayton Oliver who I think is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> than all of them ... this guy is so good and clean in tight that I don't think most people—and I'm not putting him down—but unless you take a particular interest in the kid, you can't see how good he is." ...|$|E

Nevertheless, Frederick Lindemann, Winston Churchill's favorite on the Tizard Committee, remained committed to IR and became increasing obstructionist to the work of the Committee who was otherwise pressing for radar development. Eventually they dissolved the Committee and reformed, leaving Lindemann off the roster, and filling his position with well known radio expert Edward Victor Appleton.|$|R

Although it is implied that Draper has similar convictions, he later acknowledges to his second wife that he feels a general state of disconnect between himself and his children.

60|$|During his {{sickness}} Mrs. Bell spent a {{great deal}} of time at Mary Erskine's house, and other persons, from the village, came every day to watch with Albert, and to help take care of the children. There was a young man also, named Thomas, whom Mary Erskine employed to come and stay there all day, to take the necessary care of the cattle and of the farm. They made a bed for Thomas in the scaffold in the barn. They also made up a bed in the stoop, in a corner which they divided off by means of a curtain. This bed was for the watchers, and for Mary Erskine herself, when she or they wished to lie down. Mary Erskine went to it, herself very seldom. She remained at her husband's bedside almost all the time, day and night. Albert suffered very little pain, and seemed to sleep most of the time. He revived a little the afternoon before he died, and appeared as if he were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better.</b> He looked up into Mary Erskine's face and smiled. It was plain, however, that he was very feeble.|$|E
60|$|As she {{lay there}} through inexorably {{conscious}} hours {{the picture of}} that hideous moment in the box alternated with the vision of her sister's guilty flight. She wanted to fly, herself--to go off and keep going for ever. Lionel was fussily kind to her and he didn't abuse Selina--he didn't tell her again how that lady's behaviour suited his book. He simply resisted, with a little exasperating, dogged grin, her pitiful appeal for knowledge of her sister's whereabouts. He knew what she wanted it for and he wouldn't help her in any such game. If she would promise, solemnly, to be quiet, he would tell her when she got better, but he wouldn't lend her a hand to {{make a fool of}} herself. Her work was cut out for her--she was to stay and mind the children: if she was so keen to do her duty she needn't go further than that for it. He talked {{a great deal about the}} children and figured himself as pressing the little deserted darlings to his bosom. He was not a comedian, and she could see that he really believed he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> and purer now. Laura said she was sure Selina would make an attempt to get them--or at least one of them; and he replied, grimly, 'Yes, my dear, she had better try!' The girl was so angry with him, in her hot, tossing weakness, for refusing to tell her even whether the desperate pair had crossed the Channel, that she was guilty of the immorality of regretting that the difference in badness between husband and wife was so distinct (for it was distinct, she could see that) as he made his dry little remark about Selina's trying. He told her he had already seen his solicitor, the clever Mr. Smallshaw, and she said she didn't care.|$|E
