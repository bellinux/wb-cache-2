5|$|Razer {{made its}} debut in the fourth heat of series two of Robot Wars, which was viewed by almost six million people on BBC Two. It had been {{finished}} late {{the night before the}} recording. Radio interference caused Razer to be hard to control in the Gauntlet stage of the competition, but it successfully navigated the obstacle course and progressed to the Trial. This phase was a robotic football match, wherein Razer scored the first goal to reach the heat semi-final. Its opponent for this one-on-one battle was Inquisitor, a box-shaped robot equipped with a rotating <b>flail.</b> Whilst Razer made the stronger start, crumpling Inquisitor's <b>flail</b> support, the cush drives in its motors sheared after an impact on the arena floor. This rendered Razer immobile and ended a promising run.|$|E

40|$|Forestry {{operations}} in the Pinelands National Reserve (PNR) produce significant quantities of plant residues, {{commonly referred to as}} <b>flailed</b> slash. The residues consist of needles, bark and wood from a variety of pine species that include: pitch pine, Pinus rigida, virginia pine, Pinus virginiana, and shortleaf pine, Pinus echinata. Currently, the slash material is not being utilized and accumulates as a waste product. A more desirable solution would be to process the <b>flailed</b> pine slash into marketable products to provide landowners with an economic incentive that would encourage better management practices. Three experimental container substrates were produced using <b>flailed</b> pine slash of three different ages combined with mushroom compost and dolomitic limestone. An outdoor container production study was performed using conditions similar to a commercial crop production system. Three species of woody plants were grown in each experimental substrate. Shoot growth was measured by height and dry mass. Experimental substrates were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, particle size distribution and bulk density. <b>Flailed</b> pine slash proved to be a successful component of container substrates for woody landscape plant production. Substrates containing 80 % <b>flailed</b> pine slash and 20 % mushroom compost, by volume, that were amended with five pounds of lime per cubic yard of <b>flailed</b> pine slash were able to sustain commercially acceptable plant growth. Substrates containing <b>flailed</b> pine slash, which had been allowed to decompose for three years, produced plants that were statistically better or equal to plants grown in medium commercially available to growers. 	In a second set of experiments, six experimental propagation media were developed for use with cranberries. Three media contained <b>flailed</b> pine slash that had been allowed to decompose for two years and three additional media contained <b>flailed</b> pine slash that had been allowed to decompose for three years. Batches of these media were un-amended or amended with either sand or perlite producing a total of six different media. After mixing, the experimental propagation media were transferred to 38 round cell propagation trays. Hardwood cuttings of American Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon cv. Stevens), 7. 6 cm (3 inches) in length, were dipped in a 1000 mg/l IBA solution and inserted individually into cells. Data on percentage of survival, total top growth per flat (measured by length), total number of secondary branches and total number of tertiary branches was collected. No difference in percent survivability was observed. More cranberry shoot growth was observed on un-amended <b>flailed</b> pine slash media and media amended with perlite, when compared to those amended with sand. The number of secondary and tertiary shoots was greatest with the un-amended mixes and the perlite-amended three-year-old <b>flailed</b> pine slash. In this thesis, <b>flailed</b> pine slash was successfully utilized as a propagation medium for hardwood American Cranberry cuttings. The pine slash can be utilized with or without perlite amendment. This research demonstrates that <b>flailed</b> pine slash can be converted into marketable horticultural products with minimal processing and amendment. Utilization of the pine slash material can provide landowners with an economic incentive to encourage better management practices. <b>Flailed</b> pine slash can provide a sustainable alternative to sphagnum peat moss...|$|R

5|$|A lack {{of field}} {{observations}} limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts {{are known to}} sometimes result in injury or death. The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the spur-winged goose (Plectropterus), the torrent duck (Merganetta) and nine species of lapwing (Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The steamer ducks (Tachyeres), geese and swans (Anserinae), the solitaire (Pezophaps), sheathbills (Chionis), some guans (Crax) and stone curlews (Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents. The jacanas Actophilornis and Irediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius. The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or <b>flail.</b> Swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.|$|E

5|$|During {{the evening}} of 7 August 1944, the attacking forces formed up in six columns, four {{vehicles}} wide, comprising tanks, Kangaroo APCs, half tracks, self-propelled anti-tank guns and Mine <b>flail</b> tanks. At 23:00, Bomber Command commenced the bombardment of German positions along the Caen front. At 23:30, the armoured columns began their advance behind a rolling barrage. Movement was slow at first, many APC drivers became disorientated by the dust caused by the vehicles. Several vehicles became stuck in bomb craters. Simonds had arranged several methods for the columns to maintain direction; some vehicles were fitted with radio direction finders, the artillery fired target-marking shells, Bofors 40 mm guns fired bursts of tracer {{in the direction of}} the advance. In spite of all these measures, there was still confusion. Several vehicles collided or were knocked out.|$|E
5|$|Farming in Egypt was {{dependent}} on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a <b>flail</b> to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.|$|E
5|$|Off-Road Velociraptor Safari {{is a free}} {{downloadable}} vehicle combat {{video game}} released on January 29, 2008 by Flashbang Studios. The game requires the Unity plug-in to run, and can be downloaded from the developers' website. Players {{assume the role of}} a Velociraptor wearing a pith helmet and monocle, driving a jeep with a spiked <b>flail</b> attached, and must accrue as many points as possible in a four-minute period by performing stunts and running down other Velociraptor. Each time a Velociraptor is struck, the game's speed is reduced to slow motion and its catapulted body becomes the focus of the in-game camera. The game operates a global highscore, after each game the player is given a rank for that day and a separate rank compared to the highest ever scores, along with a breakdown of the bonuses they were awarded during play.|$|E

Also, <b>flails</b> don't place their operators at significant risk, unlike manual demining.|$|R
5|$|During battles, {{a weapon}} limit gauge is shown, filling up over time; by waiting to attack until the gauge is filled up, the player {{can use a}} more {{powerful}} attack specific to the currently equipped weapon. The gauge resets to zero whenever the player attacks or gets hit by an attack. The player is able to use various different types of weapons, such as swords, axes and flails, each having a different attack pattern: sword attacks, for example, are mid-ranged swings and stabs, while <b>flail</b> attacks are long-ranged and reach out {{in a straight line}} from the hero. Most weapons {{can also be used to}} affect the environment: the player can cut down trees with axes, for instance. There are also variants of each weapon type with bonus strengths, such as flame variations, which are effective against ice monsters. At various points in the game, the hero is accompanied by non-player characters who help the player defeat enemies. These companions have different abilities that the player can use, such as Fuji's healing spell and Watt's shop.|$|E
5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, <b>flail</b> joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E

After his life was saved by a knight, he has been honing his skills with the sword. Tamber is a sixteen-year-old girl, with a sense of truth and justice, and an air of maturity about her. She lost her parents and little brother due to the great disaster. Tamber's weapon of choice is the bow. Poppen is a nine-year-old boy, who is stubborn and fearless. He lost his mother at birth and his father in the great disaster. Poppen's weapon of choice is the <b>flail.</b> Wanderer is a traveling merchant, a tradition kept throughout the series. He {{is a member of the}} Niccolo tribe of rabbit/cat people who lost his family due to the king of Lorimar during the great disaster. Wanderer's weapon of choice is the hammer.|$|E

5|$|The game {{retains the}} {{real-time}} battle mechanics of previous {{games in the}} Mana series. The game sports four weapons with their own unique abilities: sword, <b>flail,</b> bow and arrow, and hammer. The player can have two weapons ready to attack with at a time, and {{any of the four}} character options can use any weapon. The player can change which weapons they have available at any time. Each weapon has standard normal attacks, special attacks, and fury attacks. The fury attacks are the strongest and require a full Fury Gauge to use, which is filled by striking enemies with standard attacks and taking damage from enemies. Different weapons can have different effects on the environment, such as the hammer's ability to smash pots. In addition to weapons, the player can select from one of eight Elementals, which provide different magical attacks and magical enhancements to weapon attacks. The player can switch between Elementals in the Mana Village. Elemental attacks can be made stronger by equipping Gems, which can also boost the player's attributes.|$|E
5|$|While {{ascending}} the mountain, {{the player}} activates helpful power-up abilities by collecting and planting minerals in marked plots. While {{there are over}} 30 abilities in total, the player starts with the basic four: Flagseed creates an additional checkpoint (in lieu of regressing further down the mountain upon losing a heart), Heartseed creates additional hearts from minerals, and the Crystal ability generates minerals from multiple plots. Thornvine's single-use, protective thorny vine can hurt enemies if aligned correctly, though some enemies require more than one hit to die, and the player forfeits all thorns upon losing a heart. As the game progresses, the player collects additional abilities, such as Flailflower, which turns the seed into an anchor for a spiky <b>flail,</b> and Floodfruit, which fills surrounding holes with water for easy passage. Thus the player constantly weighs whether to use minerals offensively (to eliminate enemies), defensively (to bypass difficult sections), or at all.|$|E
5|$|Specialised armour {{arriving}} in the first wave included AVREs, mine flails, and armoured bulldozers. Clearing paths off the beach proved difficult, as the tanks got stuck in the mud or were taken out by mines. A lone mine <b>flail</b> tank finally cleared a path from the beach up toward the Mont Fleury Battery and Ver-Sur-Mer. This route {{was used by the}} Green Howards and tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, who cleared the remaining resistance at the Mont Fleury Battery. B Company moved on to attack trench positions and machine gun emplacements at Meuvaines Ridge, while C Company moved to the west of Ver-Sur-Mer to help cover the assault on CrÃ©pon, where roads led to the important targets of Bayeux and Caen. The 7th Green Howards attacked the gun battery at Ver-Sur-Mer, where they took 50 prisoners. Colour Sergeant-Major Stanley Hollis earned the only Victoria Cross to be bestowed for actions on D-Day. On the way to the Mont Fleury Battery, Hollis came under machine gun fire while investigating a pillbox, so he shot into the entrance with his Sten gun and dropped a grenade through the roof, killing most of the occupants. He cleared a nearby trench of enemy soldiers, whereupon the occupants of a second pillbox surrendered. Later in the day, he saved the lives of three men during an attempt to take out a field artillery installation at a farm near CrÃ©pon.|$|E

He turns out to be Carey's ex-lover, who in turn came to the show to meet with one of Carey's fellow dancers. As he caresses the female in the dressing room, Carey sees them, and walks by them, bumping into him purposely. Additional scenes are shown of Carey laying alone on the dark runway, apparently after the show has finished, as well as preparing herself for the show. During the second verse, the video then shows Carey driving down a highway in the desert, and as she drives, past memories of the pair are shown, holding each other intimately in a bed. She then pushes old gifts he had given her into the passengers seat, and pulls over the car, continuing the scene {{from the beginning of the}} video. After the car explodes, Carey tears off her necklace in despair, and begins to <b>flail</b> her arms in desperation.
