For this period the <b>Education</b> <b>Department</b> rented it from the Church trustees. A new school was built, on donated land, opposite the church and next to the recreation ground. This state school was opened in a ceremony on 23 August 1929. The school remained open as late as the end of 1954.|$|E

40|$|Successful Strategies for Long-term Planning in the <b>Education</b> <b>Departments</b> of Science Museums??? {{centers around}} how <b>education</b> <b>departments</b> {{establish}} long-term goals and benchmarks for their departments. The three main categories of inquiry {{in this study}} are the impact of informal science education on science literacy, the structure and programming efforts of museum <b>education</b> <b>departments,</b> and the contributions of <b>education</b> <b>departments</b> to institutional strategic planning. The methods for this thesis were two-fold: a review of the primary literature concerning public science education and interviews with content experts. The ultimate result {{of this study is that}} there are practical, replicable models for science education planning that can be adapted to suit the needs of any informal education center, regardless of discipline. These models suggest that departmental planning must always be linked to mission and institutional strategic planning, and that the creation of goals, strategies and objectives should be based on community needs and organizational strengths...|$|R

5|$|William Bryan and {{his wife}} donated land and built a school at nearby Glenore in 1862. The Bryans left a bequest that fully funded the school until 1914, when the state's <b>education</b> <b>department</b> assumed {{responsibility}} for {{the building and the}} teacher's salary. By 1921 56 students were attending. The building had been condemned by 1926 and a new brick school building was built a short distance away. Following a direction by Mrs Bryan in her bequest, the school was used at times for religious services, by Methodists and Anglicans. Due to low attendance the school was closed in 1941 and the few remaining pupils continued schooling at Whitemore.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the hurricane, many {{residents}} in shanty towns failed to hear tropical cyclone warnings and watches. Some did hear the warnings, but they did not believe them as the same warning had been issued several weeks before and nothing had happened. In addition, city officials warned the residents living near the dam to take shelter in public buildings though most refused to leave. The government ignored all requests to shore up an earthen dam, as they did not believe Liza would pose a significant threat of damage to the Baja California Peninsula. Along the Gulf Coast, troops evacuated residents, and radio stations warned all nearby ships to remain at harbor.

Following Gomez's meeting with the Sultan, Gomez sought treatment to his face and stomach. Subsequently, he lodged a police report against the Sultan for assault. Gomez elaborated that the Sultan bodyguards, members of the Johor Military Force personnel, were merely onlookers, and that the Sultan was solely responsible for the injuries.|$|E
5|$|World War I caused several {{changes at}} the school. During the {{conflict}} and for some time afterwards, Georgia Tech hosted a school for cadet aviators, supply officers, and army technicians. Tech also started a Reserve Officer Training Corps unit; {{the first in the}} Southern United States, it became a permanent addition to the school. World War I affected the school academically as well: the United States government asked for and financed an automotive school for army officers, a rehabilitation program for disabled soldiers, and a geology department. Federal aid also helped to establish Tech's Industrial <b>Education</b> <b>Department,</b> courtesy of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917. The war also placed on hold extensive fundraising efforts for a new power plant, and made it difficult to find engineers willing to teach at the school; Matheson toured Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and MIT in 1919 but failed to secure a single hire, as none of the students wished to work for such low wages.|$|E
