40|$|The {{office of}} <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> in the {{administration}} of a deceased’s estate requires a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> who must at the utmost ensure himself to have a solemn understanding of his duties and obligations. The <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> must act with the highest degree of trustworthiness and good faith in discharging his office. However, in the process of estate administration, one question that has nagged the office of <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> is that what should be the two distinct capacities of <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> and trustee since the expression of trustee under the Malaysian Trustee Act 1949 includes the duties incidental to the office of a <b>personal</b> <b>representative.</b> The question is relevant because the role of a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> is quite distinct from that of a trustee and is subject to different legal framework and liability. Hence, this paper seeks to examine the legal position of a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> and to identify the line separating the duties of a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> from his duties as a trustee. For this purpose, the paper analyses relevant statutory provisions as provided by the Probate and Administration Act 1959 and the Trustee Act 1949. An analysis of the decided cases is also made to identify the distinction between the offices of a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> to that of a trustee {{in the administration}} of the deceased’s estate. The paper concludes that there is no objective test as to when and how a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> becomes a trustee since a person may be a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> in respects of certain assets and trustee in respect of others. What matter most is that they must carry out their job diligently and reasonably in which failure to do so will result in their facing legal action by the beneficiary or other interested parties...|$|R
50|$|In {{common law}} jurisdictions, a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> or legal <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> {{is a person}} {{appointed}} by a court to administer the estate of another person. If the estate being administered {{is that of a}} deceased person, the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> is either an executor if the deceased person left a will or an administrator of an intestate estate. In other situations, the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> may be a guardian or trustee, or other position. As a fiduciary, a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> has the duties of loyalty, candor or honesty, and good faith. In the United States, punctilio of honor, or the highest standard of honor, is the level of scrupulousness that a fiduciary must abide by.|$|R
25|$|The <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> must {{understand}} and {{abide by the}} fiduciary duties, such as a duty to keep money in interest bearing account and to treat all beneficiaries equally. Not complying with the fiduciary duties may allow interested persons to petition {{for the removal of}} the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> and hold the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> liable for any harm to the estate.|$|R
40|$|A <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> is a {{fiduciary}} put {{in charge}} of administering the estate of a deceased’s person. The <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> must at the utmost act with the highest degree of trustworthiness and good faith to ensure that the estate is administered accordingly. As the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> steps into the dead man’s shoes, he is vested with some powers to enable him to manage and preserve the estate. Nevertheless, one question that has nagged the office of <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> is that what should be the extent of his liabilities for any losses resulting from actions taken in the course of exercising his powers. Hence, this paper seeks to examine the powers vested in a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> and to identify the extent of the <b>personal</b> <b>representative’s</b> liabilities in dealing with the deceased’s estate. For this purpose, the discussion focuses to analyze relevant statutory provisions as provided by the Probate and Administration Act 1959. An analysis of the decided cases is also made to determine the rights of the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> in the exercise of his powers and the available remedy to the legal heirs in cases of mismanagement or negligence on part of the <b>personal</b> <b>representative.</b> The paper predicates that as the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> holds a fiduciary duty to ensure that the estate is administered accordingly, he needs to conform to the fiduciary duties and standard of conduct, failing which would result in personal liability or legal action instituted against him by the legal heirs or other interested parties...|$|R
