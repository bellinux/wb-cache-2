25|$|In 1896, Benz {{designed}} and patented the first internal-combustion <b>flat</b> <b>engine,</b> called boxermotor. During {{the last years}} of the nineteenth century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz & Cie., became a joint-stock company. The first motor car in central Europe {{and one of the first}} factory-made cars in the world, was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra) in 1897, the Präsident automobil.|$|E
25|$|The Testarossa is a two-door coupé that premiered at the 1984 Paris Auto Show. All {{versions}} of the Testarossa had the power fed through the wheels from a rear-mounted, five-speed manual transmission. The rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout (engine between the axles but behind the cabin) keeps the centre of gravity {{in the middle of}} the car, which increases stability and improves the car's cornering ability, and thus results in a standing weight distribution of 40% front: 60% rear. The original Testarossa was re-engineered for 1992 and released as the 512 TR, at the Los Angeles Auto Show, effectively as a completely new car, and an improved weight distribution of 41% front: 59% rear. The F512 M was introduced at the 1994 Paris Auto Show. The car dropped the TR initials and added the M which in Italian stood for modificata, or translated to modified, and was the final version of the Testarossa, and continued its predecessor's weight distribution improvement of 42% front: 58% rear. The F512 M was Ferrari's last mid-engine 12-cylinder car, apart from the limited edition F50, Enzo and LaFerrari, featuring the company's last <b>flat</b> <b>engine.</b> The Testarossa was replaced in 1996 by the front-engined 550 Maranello coupé.|$|E

5000|$|Opposed {{piston engines}} {{should not be}} {{confused}} with <b>flat</b> <b>engines,</b> which are horizontally opposed with one piston per cylinder, and cylinder heads.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>engines</b> offer several {{advantages}} for motorcycles, namely: a low centre of gravity, smoothness, suitability for shaft drive, and (if air-cooled) excellent cooling of the cylinders.|$|R

50|$|The Haacke HFM-2 was a German two {{cylinder}} <b>flat</b> <b>engine</b> {{built in}} the early 1920s.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>engines</b> {{have also}} been used in cars with front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layouts, {{including}} Bradford trucks and vans, the Glas Isar, Jowett cars and trucks, early Tatras, the Scion FR-S and the Subaru BRZ.|$|R
50|$|From 1979 the Wilga 80 {{went into}} production, an {{improved}} model certified for the US market. In the late 1990s the PZL-104MA Wilga 2000 family was developed with Lycoming <b>flat</b> <b>engines</b> and with improved aerodynamics.|$|R
50|$|Boxer <b>engines</b> (and <b>flat</b> <b>engines</b> in general) {{tend to be}} noisier {{than other}} common engines for both {{intrinsic}} and other reasons. In cars, valve clatter from the engine compartment is not damped by air filters or other components.|$|R
50|$|Flat-eight engine, a <b>flat</b> <b>engine</b> with 8 {{cylinders}} horizontally {{opposed to}} each other at 180° apart.|$|E
50|$|Flat-six engine, a <b>flat</b> <b>engine</b> {{with two}} banks of 3 {{cylinders}} horizontally opposed at 180° apart.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>engine,</b> two {{banks of}} {{cylinders}} directly opposite {{each other on}} either side of the crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|Common {{cylinder}} {{arrangements are}} from 1 to 6 cylinders in-line or from 2 to 16 cylinders in V-formation. <b>Flat</b> <b>engines</b> - like a V design flattened out - {{are common in}} small airplanes and motorcycles and were a hallmark of Volkswagen automobiles into the 1990s. Flat 6s are still used in many modern Porsches, as well as Subarus. Many <b>flat</b> <b>engines</b> are air-cooled. Less common, but notable in vehicles designed for high speeds is the W formation, similar to having 2 V engines side by side. Alternatives include rotary and radial engines the latter typically have 7 or 9 cylinders in a single ring, or 10 or 14 cylinders in two rings.|$|R
50|$|Four-cylinder <b>flat</b> <b>engines</b> in {{the boxer}} {{configuration}} have their pistons horizontally opposed, {{so they are}} naturally balanced and do not incur the extra complexity, cost or frictional losses associated with balance shafts (though the slight offset of the pistons introduces a rocking couple).|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s and 1930s Tatra made {{a series}} of {{automobiles}} with front-mounted air-cooled <b>flat</b> <b>engines,</b> including the flat-twin 11 and 12 and the flat-four 30, 54 and 75. In the late 1930s Tatra built the rear-engined 97 with a rear-engined flat-four.|$|R
5000|$|Flat-four engine, a <b>flat</b> <b>engine</b> with 4 {{cylinders}} horizontally {{opposed to}} each other at 180° apart.|$|E
50|$|First {{production}} variant with WN-6 <b>flat</b> <b>engine</b> (small series - about 10, {{converted to}} Wilga C and 3).|$|E
5000|$|Flat-twin engine, a <b>flat</b> <b>engine</b> with 2 opposed {{cylinders}} on {{the same}} crankshaft angled 180° to each other.|$|E
5000|$|Multi-cylinder boxer layouts {{have proved}} to be well suited as light {{aircraft}} engines, as exemplified by Continental, Lycoming, Rotax, Jabiru and Verner. [...] An important factor in aircraft use is the <b>flat</b> <b>engine's</b> absence of vibration, which allows a lighter engine mount.|$|R
50|$|After {{retiring}} from Beechraft, Rawdon performed consulting work for Lockheed, Cessna and Lycoming Engines. He maintained a design {{station in the}} Cessna Engineering Department through the 1970s. He also maintained a consulting and fabrication company which provided aircraft modifications. One notable example was the installation of <b>flat</b> <b>engines</b> on the formerly-radially-equipped Beech 18.|$|R

5000|$|... 1896: Karl Benz {{invented the}} boxer engine, {{also known as}} the {{horizontally}} opposed engine, or the <b>flat</b> <b>engine,</b> in which the corresponding pistons reach top dead center at the same time, thus balancing each other in momentum.|$|E
50|$|There is some {{interest}} in developing the idea for use in cars of the future, {{as evidenced by the}} patent application of inventor-engineer Michael Basnett at Rover Group (GB), who proposes a front transaxle design, rear <b>flat</b> <b>engine</b> architecture.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>engines,</b> {{including}} non-boxer flat-12s, {{have been}} mid-mounted in Porsche and Ferrari racing cars. Porsche {{has made the}} 914 for road use with four or six cylinder air cooled boxer engines, while Ferrari road cars with mid-mounted water cooled non-boxer flat-12s include the 365 GT4 BB, BB 512, BB 512i, Testarossa, 512 TR, and F512 M.|$|R

50|$|In 1973, Fiat's {{successor}} model, the 126, {{was adopted}} in Graz. Here, too, Puch restricted themselves essentially to fitting a Puch <b>flat</b> <b>engine</b> in the otherwise nearly finished car. As early as 1975, production was stopped due to diminishing demand.|$|E
50|$|A {{flat-twin}} is a two-cylinder {{internal combustion}} engine with the cylinders {{on opposite sides of}} the crankshaft. It is a <b>flat</b> <b>engine</b> with two cylinders. Used in motorcycles for more than a century, flat-twins have also been used in automobiles, light aircraft, stationary powerplants, and household appliances.|$|E
50|$|Controlled {{combustion}} engine (CCE) {{is a term}} used by Revetec, an engine design company, to identify a type of experimental internal {{combustion engine}} (ICE) designed by Brad Howell-Smith. It uses two counter-rotating cams instead of a crankshaft. Pairs of cylinders oppose {{each other in a}} boxer <b>flat</b> <b>engine</b> or X engine arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{intending}} {{to sell the}} vehicle with a <b>flat</b> four-cylinder <b>engine</b> as a Volkswagen and with a <b>flat</b> six-cylinder <b>engine</b> as a Porsche, Porsche decided during development that having Volkswagen and Porsche models sharing the same body would be risky for business in the American market, and convinced Volkswagen {{to allow them to}} sell both versions as Porsches in North America.|$|R
50|$|Some early {{motorcycles}} used transverse-crank <b>flat</b> twin <b>engines,</b> especially Douglas motorcycles before World War II.|$|R
