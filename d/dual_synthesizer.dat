40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) sensor is {{required}} to provide information {{that will allow the}} user to detect, classify and identify the target. This is an extremely tough requirement, especially when one considers the limited amount of information provided by most GPRs to accomplish this task. One way of increasing this information is to capture the complete scattering matrix of the received radar waveform. The objective of this thesis is to develop a signal processing technique to extract polarimetric feature vectors from Stepped Frequency Continuous Wave (SFGWV) GPR data. This was achieved by first developing an algorithm to extract the parameters from single polarization SFCW GPR data and then extending this algorithm to extract target features from fully polarimetric data. A model {{is required}} to enable the extraction of target parameters from raw radar data. A single polarization SFCW GPR model is developed based on the radar geometry and linear approximations to the wavenumber in a lossy medium. Assuming high operating frequencies and/or low conductive losses, the model is shown to be equivalent to the exponential model found in signal processing theory. A number of algorithms exist to extract the required target parameters from the measured data in a least squared sense. In this thesis the Matrix Pencil-of-Function Method is used. Numerical simulations are presented to show the performance of this algorithm for increasing model error. Simulations are also provided to compare the standard Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) with the algorithm presented in this thesis. The processing is applied to two sets of measured radar data using the radar developed in the thesis. The technique was able to locate the position of the scatterers for both sets of data, thus demonstrating the success of the algorithm on practical measurements. The single polarization model is extended to a fully polarimetric SFCW GPR model. The model is shown to relate to the multi-dimensional exponential signal processing model, given certain assumptions about the target scattering damping factor. The multi-snapshot Matrix Pencil-of-Function Method is used to extract the scattering matrix parameters from the raw polarimetric stepped frequency data. Those Huynen target parameters that are independent of the properties of the medium, are extracted from the estimated scattering matrices. Simulations are performed to examine the performance of the algorithm for increasing conductive and dielectric losses. The algorithm is also applied to measured data for a number of targets buried a few centimeters below the ground surface, with promising results. Finally, the thesis describes the design and development of a low cost, compact and low power SFCW GPR system. It addresses both the philosophy as well as the technology that was used to develop a 200 - 1600 MHz and a 1 - 2 GHz system. The system is built around a <b>dual</b> <b>synthesizer</b> heterodyne architecture with a single intermediate frequency stage and a novel coherent demodulator system - with a single reference source. Comparison of the radar system with a commercial impulse system, shows that the results are of a similar quality. Further measurements demonstrate the radar performance for different field test cases, including the mapping of the bottom of an outdoor test site down to 1. 6 m...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This work {{deals with}} a {{reliability}} issue of the body channel communication which uses the human body as a signal transmission medium. Due to the body antenna effect, lots of electromagnetic signals are coupled to the on-body receiver, degrading the SIR significantly. In order to reject the in-band interferences, an adaptive frequency hopping scheme using variable sub-channels is proposed. The use of <b>dual</b> frequency <b>synthesizers</b> for frequency hopping improves the data throughput and the acquisition time of the transceiver by eliminating the blank time overhead. The AFH transceiver realized with 0. 18 μm CMOS process sustains 1. 25 Mb/s throughput when the 10 interferences causing- 25 dB SIR exist. I...|$|R

Assuming {{the typical}} Microwave or Sat. feed has an IF {{frequency}} of 70 +- MHz, the circuit of Figure 1 converts a fixed 48 MHz MSB signal to a frequency {{that can be}} placed anywhere within the modem band. The Image filter should be above 600 MHz. A Cellular diplexer at 835 MHz has been used satisfactorily. More than 12 cycles of converted frequency are required per cycle of 48 MHz IF frequency. Figure 2. The receiver modem will have the desired signal somewhere between 50 and 90 MHz. This needs to be converted to a fixed IF frequency for detection. A <b>dual</b> frequency <b>synthesizer</b> is required. This circuit makes no provision for temperature or Doppler shift. There are other circuits that broaden the range for Doppler.

They can provide the LO for both the RF and IF sections. They consist of a low-noise digital PFD (Phase Frequency Detector), a precision charge pump, a programmable reference divider, programmable A and B counters, and a dual-modulus prescaler (P/P+ 1). The A (6 -bit) and B (11 -bit) counters, in conjunction with the dual modulus prescaler (P/P+ 1), implement an N divider (N = BP + A). In addition, the 14 -bit reference counter (R Counter), allows selectable REFIN frequencies at the PFD input. A complete PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) can be implemented if the synthesizers are used with an external loop filter and VCOs (Voltage Controlled Oscillators). Control of all the on-chip registers is via a simple 3 -wire interface. The devices operate with a power supply ranging from 2. 7 V to 5. 5 V and can be powered down when not in use.

40|$|A {{digital signal}} {{processor}} is implemented to control resonant frequency of the RFQ prototype in APT/LEDA. Two schemes are implemented to calculate the resonant frequency of RFQ. One uses the measurement of the forward and reflected fields. The other uses the measurement of the forward and transmitted fields. The former is sensitive and accurate when the operation frequency is relatively far from the resonant frequency. The latter gives accurate results when the operation frequency {{is close to the}} resonant frequency. Linearized algorithms are derived to calculate the resonant frequency of the RFQ efficiently using a fixed-point DSP. The control frequency range is about 100 kHz for 350 MHz operation frequency. A frequency agile scheme is employed using a <b>dual</b> direct digital <b>synthesizer</b> to drive klystron at the cavity`s resonant frequency (not necessarily the required beam resonant frequency) in power-up mode to quickly the cavity to the desired resonant frequency.
