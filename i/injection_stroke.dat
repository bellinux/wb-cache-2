40|$|This thesis {{describe}} about modifying {{of engine}} from four stroke engines to six stroke engines. Two more additional strokes are the fifth stroke, which called water <b>injection</b> <b>stroke</b> while the last stroke is called exhaust stroke. Besides, the stroke engine {{also known as}} engine two-stroke, four-stroke and also six-stroke which are new things for us. Some modification has {{to do at the}} conventional four-stroke to six-stroke. Whereas some of them are modification at the camshaft, which is gear to contact between camshaft and crankshaft with ratio 3 : 1, shape of plunger, head cover engine and add more other components such as water injector and pump to make the system operate well. After the modification, performance results outcomes are compare with the conventional four-stroke engines. Unfortunately, this engine is not running as well as expected when some problems occur at few part of the engine. To fix the entire problems, analysis has been undertaken to improve some part of the followers, especially since his main problems in their engines. For the future work, the follower must be upgrading the level to get the best design and strength to make sure this engine running well...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to develop an {{optimized}} nozzle for the needle-free injection device currently under construction in MIT's Bio-Instrumentation Laboratory. Initial predictions from ANSYS, a finite element modeling program, indicated that the injection performance could be noticeably improved with a new nozzle design. After running several flow simulations, a final nozzle design was selected, and a strategy was developed to manufacture the new nozzle. The new nozzle {{was placed in the}} injection device and measurements of the jet velocity were recorded via a high speed camera. A 2 mm long nozzle with a contoured profile consisting of a linear segment tangent to an arc segment at the nozzle exit produced an exit velocity of 45. 5 m/s {{at the end of the}} <b>injection</b> <b>stroke.</b> This showed almost a 19 percent increase in velocity compared to the older nozzle which produced 38. lm/s upon termination of the injection cycle. However, the results of the new nozzle vary from injection to injection. Thus there is a need for continued testing in the future, and possibly more refined measuring techniques such as depth of penetration into the gel or developing improvements with the current video setup. by Gabriel Nestor Sanchez.

40|$|Lithium is a mood {{stabilizer}} {{shown to have}} neuroprotective effects against several chronic and acute neuronal injuries, including stroke. However, it is unknown whether lithium treatment protects against brain injury post-stroke in a rat model of permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) combined with transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (CCAo), a model that mimics human stroke with partial reperfusion. In addition, whether lithium treatment alters Akt activity {{as measured by the}} kinase activity assay has not been reported, although it is known to inhibit GSK 3 β activity. After stroke, Akt activity contributes to neuronal survival while GSK 3 β activity causes neuronal death. We report that a bolus of lithium <b>injection</b> at <b>stroke</b> onset robustly reduced infarct size measured by 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining at 48 h post-stroke and inhibited cell death in the ischemic penumbra, but not in the ischemic core, as shown by TUNEL staining performed 24 h post-stroke. However, lithium treatment did not alter the reduction in Akt activity as measured by Akt kinase assay. We further showed that lithium did not alter phosphorylated GSK 3 β protein levels, or the degradation of β-catenin, a substrate of GSK 3 β, which is consistent with previous findings that long-term treatment is required for lithium to alter GSK 3 β phosphorylation. In summary, we show innovative data that lithium protects against stroke in a focal ischemia model with partial reperfusion, however, our results dispute the importance of Akt activity in the protective effects of lithium...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{depletion}} of world petroleum reserves results in two crisis that are rising prices {{of fuel and}} global warming problems. The energy security can be maintained by improving the efficiency of energy producing components. Efforts are being made to find the alternatives. Bio-fuels are those whose energy is derived from carbon fixation. Biodiesel is made from vegetable oil, animal fats, and non edible seeds. These resources are available and also can be grown in plenty. Bio-fuels can be used blended with diesel {{and can be used}} to run engines which reduces the dependence on the non renewable resources. There are different types of bio-fuels like Karanja, Jatropha, Mahua etc. These fuels can be blended with ordinary diesel and can be used. Karanja, Jatropha are already being used in engines along with diesel. Bio-fuels can be blended alone with a diesel or two bio-fuels blended separately can be mixed with ordinary diesel. Bio-fuels are still a new entry and a lot of research is being carried to find more effective bio-fuels so that it adds to the overall performance wherever it is used. Our project concentrates mainly on preparing biodiesel from fish oil and then comparing the properties of these with ordinary diesel and also experiments were conducted on Injection pressures of 200 and 225 bars and compression ratio’s 17. 5 : 1 and 14 : 1 as constant to study the performance and emission characteristics of a TV 1, Kirloskar make, direct <b>injection,</b> Four <b>Stroke</b> single cylinder diesel engine using blends of Fish oil methyl esters with diesel.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The most {{important}} adverse effect of BoNT-A is the systemic diffusion of the toxin. There {{is some evidence}} that the administration of high doses can increase the risk of systemic diffusion and the development of clinically evident adverse effects, however an international consensus does not exist about its maximum dose. AIM: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate changes in autonomic heart drive induced by high doses (higher than 600 units) of incobotulinumtoxinA <b>injection</b> in spastic <b>stroke</b> patients. Moreover, the treatment safety by monitoring adverse events occurrence was assessed. DESIGN: Case control study. POPULATION: Eleven stroke survivors with spastic hemiplegia. METHODS: Patients were treated with intramuscular focal injections of IncobotulinumtoxinA (NT 201; Xeomin®, Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany). Doses were below 12 units/Kg. Each patient underwent an ECG recording before injection and 10 days after treatment. Linear and non-linear Heart Rate variability (HRV) measures were derived from ECGs with a dedicated software. RESULTS: None of the variable considered showed statistically significant changes after BoNT-A injection. CONCLUSION: The use of incobotulinumtoxinA in adult patients at doses up to 12 units/kg seems to be safe regarding autonomic heart drive.

40|$|Background and Purpose—In animal {{models of}} stroke, {{functional}} improvement has been obtained after stem cell transplantation. Successful therapy {{depends largely on}} achieving a robust and targeted cell engraftment, with intraarterial (IA) injection being a potentially attractive route of administration. We assessed the suitability of laser Doppler flow (LDF) signal measurements and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for noninvasive dual monitoring of targeted IA cell delivery. Methods—Transient cerebral ischemia was induced in adult Wistar rats (n 25) followed by IA or intravenous (IV) injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide. Cell infusion was monitored in real time with transcranial laser Doppler flowmetry while cellular delivery was assessed with MRI in vivo (4. 7 T) and ex vivo (9. 4 T). Results—Successful delivery of magnetically labeled MSCs could be readily visualized with MRI after IA but not IV injection. IA stem cell <b>injection</b> during acute <b>stroke</b> resulted in a high variability of cerebral engraftment. The amount of LDF reduction during cell infusion (up to 80 %) was found to correlate well with the degree of intracerebral engraftment, with low LDF values being associated with significant morbidity. Conclusions—High cerebral engraftment rates are associated with impeded cerebral blood flow. Noninvasive dual-modality imaging enables monitoring of targeted cell delivery, and through interactive adjustment may improve th...|$|R

A single spray plume was isolated for this analysis and measurements were obtained across the plume at a fixed distance from the nozzle exit. The droplet measurements were grouped into bins and maps were created showing droplet sizes and velocities against time and position during and post injection.

40|$|Objective To {{analyze the}} {{variations}} in coagulation function,biochemical indicator and cytokines of the rats suffering from heat stroke,and explore the protective effects of Xuebijing <b>injection</b> against heat <b>stroke.</b> Methods Twenty-four SPF male SD rats were randomly divided into the following three groups(8 each) : normal control(NC group),saline treatment for heat stroke(NS-HS group),and Xuebijing injection treatment for heat stroke(XBJ-HS group). 2. 3 ml blood samples were drawn from femoral artery at 0, 47 and 57 min after the initiation of heat exposure to measure the plasma levels of APTT,PT,FDP,D-dimers,Cr,BUN,AST,ALT,ALP,IL- 1 β,IL- 6 and TNF-α. The rats were sacrificed immediately at 57 min after the initiation of heat exposure,and the liver was then harvested and fixed with formalin. The paraffin section of liver was stained by HE and observed under the light microscope. Results Rats in both NS-HS and XBJ-HS group displayed an excessive systemic inflammation and excessive coagubility,as well as the tissue ischemia and injury. Excessive systemic inflammation during heat stroke was shown by increased levels of IL- 1 β,IL- 6,and TNF-α in plasma. Hypercoagubility were shown by increased plasma levels of APTT,PT,FDP,and D-dimers. Tissue ischemia and injury was shown by increased levels of creatinine,BUN,AST,ALT,and ALP in plasma. Xuebijing injection significantly decreased the plasma levels of APTT,PT,FDP,D-dimers,Cr,BUN,AST,ALT,ALP,IL- 1 β,IL- 6,and TNF-α(P < 0. 05),and alleviate the pathological lesion of liver.

These cellular pathologies are coincident in stroke, which is considered a risk factor for AD. This study investigated the co-morbid effects of AD and stroke on behavioural and cellular pathology in two rodent models. Motor function, memory and microglial neuroinflammation were investigated in a <b>stroke</b> and Aβ <b>injection</b> model and mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic model with <b>stroke.</b> <b>Injections</b> of endothelin- 1 into the right striatum were used to model stroke and AD was modelled through either intracerebroventricular Aβ 25 - 35 injections or a transgenic rat that overproduces a mutated form of human APP. Furthermore, the effectiveness of a targeted antioxidant therapy (CAT-SKL) was investigated in the <b>stroke</b> and Aβ <b>injection</b> model. Memory deficits were present in both co-morbid conditions and CAT-SKL was able to ameliorate the memory deficit in the <b>stroke</b> and Aβ <b>injection</b> model. In the transgenic model, the co-morbid condition resulted in gait alterations. Levels of activated microglia in the infarct region were increased in the transgenic co-morbid condition.

MethodsSixty anesthetized rats were randomized into three groups and intravenously injected twice daily for 3 days with 4 mL XBJ (XBJ group) or phosphate buffered saline (HS and Sham groups) per kg body weight. HS was initiated in the HS and XBJ groups by placing rats in a simulated climate chamber (ambient temperature 40 °C, humidity 60 %). Rectal temperature, aterial pressure, and heart rate were monitored and recorded. Time to HS onset and survival were determined, and serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, alanine-aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate-aminotransferase (AST) were measured. Hepatic tissue was harvested for pathological examination and electron microscopic examination. Kupffer cells (KCs) were separated from liver at HS initiation, and the concentrations of secreted TNF-α, IL-β and IL- 6 were measured. ResultsTime to HS onset and survival were significantly longer in the XBJ than in the HS group. Moreover, the concentrations of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, ALT and AST were lower and liver injury was milder in the XBJ than in the HS group. Heat-stress induced structural changes in KCs and hepatic cells were more severe in the HS than in the XBJ group and the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-β and IL- 6 secreted by KCs were lower in the XBJ than in the HS group. ConclusionXBJ can alleviate HS-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome and liver injury in rats, and improve outcomes. These protective effects {{may be due to}} the ability of XBJ to inhibit cytokine secretion by KCs...|$|R

YQFM is widely used in clinical practice in the People’s Republic of China, mainly {{for the treatment of}} microcirculatory disturbance-related diseases. However, little is known about its role in animals with ischemic stroke. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of YQFM on brain edema and blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction induced by cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury. Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice underwent right middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1  hour with a subsequent 24 -hour reperfusion to produce I/R injury. YQFM (three doses: 0. 336, 0. 671, and 1. 342  g/kg) was then given intraperitoneally (IP). The results demonstrated that YQFM significantly decreased infarct size, improved neurological deficits, reduced brain water content, and increased cerebral blood flow after I/R injury. 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose micro-positron emission tomography imaging and hematoxylin and eosin staining results indicated that YQFM is able to ameliorate brain metabolism and histopathological damage after I/R. Moreover, YQFM administration reduced BBB leakage and upregulated the expression of zona occludens- 1 (ZO- 1) and occludin, which was confirmed by Evans Blue extravasation, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence assay. Our findings suggest that YQFM provides protection against focal cerebral I/R injury in mice, possibly by improving BBB dysfunction via upregulation of the expression of tight junction proteins.

40|$|Air {{entrapment}} during diecasting {{die filling}} {{is a major}} problem that causes most rejects, after quality inspection, due to unattended and dangerous gas porosity, especially in high performance and structural parts. In the past years, many technologies were developed in order to reduce air entrapment during filling; among them, optimal results were mainly obtained by active (vacuum) and passive (chill vents) air evacuation systems. Nevertheless, only small knowledge on how to optimize dies design for those technologies is available for the die maker. In the same way, at now, many casting simulation software lacks in this specific field and today ventings, vacuum channels and chill vents are designed according to proprietary formulas and, mainly, experience. In order to understand what happens to air inside a die cavity before and during metal injection, an analytical model was developed to calculate and forecast air pressure and flow through vents. This model takes into account, in a very detailed way, all the phenomena that occurs during injection, with particular relevance to process parameters (<b>injection</b> speeds and <b>strokes,</b> temperatures, vacuum pressures…) as well as flow-related phenomena that can impact on air escape, like premature vents clogging. This mathematical model was then validated and optimized through extensive casting trials in different venting simulation (with vacuum, only vents, chill vents, no air escape…) on different casting shapes and with different process parameters. The model allows to the die designer to optimize vents and related operating process parameters, simulate and compare different air evacuation solutions and forecast the mean gas porosity fraction in the casting with a calculation time of only few seconds. Calculations were useful to demonstrate the influence of process parameters on air trapping and the main result was that venting (with or without vacuum) is ineffective without an optimal setup of casting parameters and a correct air escape area calculation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Treatment with neural {{stem cells}} {{represents}} a potential strategy to improve functional recovery of post-ischemic cerebral injury. The potential benefit of such treatment in acute phases of human ischemic stroke {{depends on the}} therapeutic viability of a systemic vascular delivery route. In spite of {{the large number of}} reports on the beneficial effects of intracerebral stem cells <b>injection</b> in experimental <b>stroke,</b> very few studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the systemic intravenous delivery approach. METODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We utilized a novel in vitro model of transient focal ischemia to analyze the brain distribution of neurosphere-derived cells (NCs) in the early 3 hours that follow transient occlusion of the medial cerebral artery (MCA). NCs obtained from newborn C 57 /BL 6 mice are immature cells with self-renewal properties that could differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. MCA occlusion for 30 minutes in the in vitro isolated guinea pig brain preparation was followed by arterial perfusion with 1 x 10 (6) NCs charged with a green fluorescent dye, either immediately or 60 minutes after reperfusion onset. Changes in extracellular pH and K(+) concentration during and after MCAO were measured through ion-sensitive electrodes. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: It is demonstrated that NCs injected through the vascular system do not accumulate in the ischemic core and preferentially distribute in non-ischemic areas, identified by combined electrophysiological and morphological techniques. Direct measurements of extracellular brain ions during and after MCA occlusion suggest that anoxia-induced tissue changes, such as extracellular acidosis, may prevent NCs from entering the ischemic area in our in vitro model of transitory focal ischemia and reperfusion suggesting a role played by the surrounding microenviroment in driving NCs outside the ischemic core. These findings strongly suggest that the potential beneficial effect of NCs in experimental focal brain ischemia is not strictly dependent on their homing into the ischemic region, but rather through a bystander mechanism possibly mediated by the release of neuroprotective factors in the peri-infarct region...|$|R
40|$|Massage is {{an ancient}} {{treatment}} that still is commonly used in humans. Massage {{is reported to have}} several beneficial effects including activation of the relaxation and growth response that is proposed to be mediated by oxytocin (OT). In the present thesis the effects of repeated massage-like stroking (stroking) in rats has been studied. The experimenter restraints the rat with one hand and with the other hand the abdomen of the rat was firm but gently stroked at a speed of 30 - 40 strokings/min for 5 minutes. In order to analyze the individual behavioral treatment response the stroking sessions were video recorded (paper III and IV). In paper I, the effects of stroking on plasma levels of gastrin, insulin, CCK, somatostatin and glucose were investigated. Plasma levels of gastrin and insulin decreased after 14 stroking sessions, whereas plasma levels of glucose and body weight increased. In paper II, rats were treated postnatally with either stroking early in life or with OT <b>injections.</b> Both postnatal <b>stroking</b> and OT-treatment decreased the diastolic blood pressure measured with the tail-cuff method in adulthood in these rats. In paper III, female rats surgically prepared with telemetric blood pressure equipment were used. The rats were their own controls and the experiment started with a 5 days control period followed by 10 days with stroking. Each stroking session was video recorded and blood pressure measured with telemetry. Blood pressure increased during stroking and was maintained high during the 10 days stroking period compared to the control period. Latency time to relaxation decreased during the stroking period. In paper IV, the effects of stroking on social interaction were studied. Stroking in male rats did not alter the social interaction or the plasma levels of OT and corticosterone. However, home-cage dominance as well as interaction between dominance and stroking altered the social behavior. In conclusion, most of the results indicate that the rat experiences distress rather than anti-stress during stroking. Since rats had to be restrained during stroking, the sympathetic nervous system probably was activated. This might have hidden the suggested stroking induced reflex activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. For future studies another animal model that can be stroked without restraint, i. e. dog is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{collaborative}} research program between the Department {{of energy and}} Electro-Motive Diesels, Inc. {{on the development of}} common rail fuel injection system for locomotive diesel engines that can meet US EPA Tier 2 exhaust emissions has been completed. This final report summarizes the objectives of the program, work scope, key accomplishments and research findings. The major objectives of this project encompassed identification of appropriate injection strategies by using advanced analytical tools, development of required prototype hardware/controls, investigations of fuel spray characteristics including cavitation phenomena, and validation of hareware using a single-cylinder research locomotive diesel engine. Major milestones included: (1) a detailed modeling study using advanced mathematical models - several various injection profiles that show simultaneous reduction of NOx and particulates on a four stroke-cycle locomotive diesel engine were identified; (2) development of new common rail fuel injection hardware capable of providing these injection profiles while meeting EMD engine and injection performance specifications. This hardware was developed together with EMD's current fuel injection component supplier. (3) Analysis of fuel spray characteristics. Fuel spray numerical studies and high speed photographic imaging analyses were performed. (4) Validation of new hardware and fuel injection profiles. EMD's single-cylinder research diesel engine located at Argonne National Laboratory was used to confirm emissions and performacne predictions. These analytical ane experimental investigations resulted in optimized fuel injection profiles and engine operating conditions that yield reductions in NOx emissions from 7. 8 g/bhp-hr to 5. 0 g/bhp-hr at full (rated) load. Additionally, hydrocarbon and particulate emissions were reduced considerably when compared to baseline Tier I levels. The most significant finding from the injection optimization process was a 2 % to 3 % improvement in fuel economy over EMD's traditional Tier I engine hardware configuration. the common rail fuel injection system enabled this added benefit by virtue of an inherent capability to provide multiple <b>injections</b> per power <b>stroke</b> at high fuel rail pressures. On the basis of the findings in this study, EMD concludes that the new electronically-controlled high-pressure common rail injection system has the potential to meet locomotive Tier 2 NOx and particulates emission standards without sacrificing the fuel economy. A number of areas to further improve the injection hardware and engine operating characteristics to further exploit the benefits of common rail injection system have also been identified...|$|R
