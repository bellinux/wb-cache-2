50|$|Design of {{the legs}} of a {{humanoid}} robot is certainly the most challenging part in the design procedure. The 6 DOF leg structure allows the foot to have dexterous motion {{with respect to the}} pelvis. The lower-body joints are actuated by EC motors and a combined timing belt-pulley and <b>harmonic</b> <b>drive</b> module is exploited for power transmission. Rigid and light-weight structure may greatly enhance performance of a position controlled walking machine. In order to alleviate the vibration of the joints which may be existed due to flexibility of <b>harmonic</b> <b>drive</b> or the cross modules (in ankle and hip), by employing high resolution absolute encoders at the joints output, the cascade position control loop has been exploited which decreased the vibration of the joints. In order to increase rigidity of the links, while keeping the robot’s weight low as much as possible, aluminum plates have been used for the shanks and thighs.|$|E

50|$|Strain wave gearing {{also known}} as <b>Harmonic</b> <b>Drive</b> is a special type of {{mechanical}} gear system that can improve certain characteristics compared to traditional gearing systems such as helical gears or planetary gears. It was invented in 1957 by C.W. Musser {{while he was a}} research advisor at United Shoe Machinery (USM). The advantages include: no backlash, compactness and light weight, high gear ratios, reconfigurable ratios within a standard housing, good resolution and excellent repeatability when repositioning inertial loads, high torque capability, and coaxial input and output shafts. High gear reduction ratios are possible in a small volume (a ratio from 30:1 up to 320:1 is possible in the same space in which planetary gears typically only produce a 10:1 ratio).Disadvantages include a tendency for 'wind-up' (a torsional spring rate) in the low torque region. Strain wave gears are typically used in industrial motion control, machine tool, printing machine, robotics and aerospace, for gear reduction but may also be used to increase rotational speed, or for differential gearing.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Since its {{inception}} in 1955, the <b>harmonic</b> <b>drive</b> has found widespread acceptance among practitioners. This mechanical transmission, occasionally called "strain-wave gearing", employs a continuous deflection wave along non-rigid gear to allow for gradual engagement of gear teeth (Figure 1). Because of this unconventional gear-tooth meshing action, harmonic drives can deliver high reduction ratios {{in a very small}} package. In fact, the radical mechanical operation of this gear train defies conventional understanding of gear behaviour and creates a new arena for exploration and understanding.
