The design of the ideal separation package is outlined and severance pay emerges as a natural component of job displacement insurance packages, serving both as scheduled reemployment wage insurance and, if search moral hazard is a problem, as scheduled UI. Like any firm-financed separation expenditure, severance pay can induce excessive job retention, but such distortions do not appear to be of practical significance at benefit levels typically mandated in the industrialized world.

50|$|The {{author has}} the {{exclusive}} right {{to exploit the}} work in any way or form, subject to the legal limitations on the exclusivity, and notably the rights of reproduction, distribution, public communication and transformation (art. 17). The author may transfer {{any or all of}} these rights to another person, although such a transfer cannot prevent the author from producing a collection (partial or complete) of his/her works (art. 22). Any agreement to transfer rights of exploitation must be made in writing (art. 45): it cannot cover the totality of the future works of an author (art. 43.3), cannot require the author not to produce works in the future (art. 43.4) and cannot cover forms of distribution which do not exist {{at the time of the}} agreement (art. 43.5). Such an agreement must normally guarantee the author a reasonable share of the income derived from the exploitation of the work (art. 46.1, 47), although a <b>fixed-sum</b> <b>payment</b> is allowed in certain cases (art. 46.2). The different rights of exploitation are independent of one another (art. 23).|$|R
