She continued to experiment with her physique, leading to a disappointing 1990 Ms. Olympia. There, she was criticized as not having the fullness or muscularity compared to winner Lenda Murray, and subsequently worked on becoming as massive and symmetrical as possible for the 1991 Olympia. After the ensuing 2nd-place finish and resulting controversy, she retired from bodybuilding.|$|E

40|$|Respiratory {{symptoms}} among hairdressers {{are often}} {{ascribed to the}} use of bleaching powders that contain persulfate salts. Such salts can act as allergens and airway irritants but the mechanisms behind the negative health effects are not fully known. In order to understand why some hairdressers experience respiratory symptoms during, and after, sessions of <b>hair</b> <b>bleaching,</b> it is of importance to characterize how exposure occurs. In this work we used time and particle size resolved instrumentation with the aim to measure the concentration of particles that hairdressers are exposed to during sessions of <b>hair</b> <b>bleaching.</b> We also used filter samples to collect particles for quantitative determination of persulfate (S 2 O 8 (2 -)) content and for analysis by light microscopy. Two different types of bleaching powders were used, one marked as dust-free and one without this marking (denoted regular). The time resolved instrumentation revealed that particles 10 µm) were emitted during application of the bleaching, when both the regular and the dust-free powders were used. The measured level of persulfate, sampled in the breathing zone of the hairdressers, was on average 26 µg m(- 3) when the regular powder was used and 11 µg m(- 3) when the dust-free powder was used. This indicates that use of dust-free powder does not eliminate exposure to persulfates, it only lowers the concentration. We show that the site of sampling, or position of the hairdresser with regards to the hair being bleached, is of high importance in the determination of persulfate levels and exposure. This work focuses on the physical and chemical characterization of the particles released to the air and the results are important for accurate exposure assessments. Accurate assessments may in turn lead {{to a better understanding of}} why some hairdressers experience respiratory symptoms from <b>hair</b> <b>bleaching</b> sessions...|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} the {{development}} and use of cosmetics has been reviewed (Zviak, 1986 a,b). The dyeing of human hair can be traced back at least 4000 years: evidence from Egytian tombs indicates the use ofhenna, from Lawsonia inermis, for dyeing hair, nails and skin, and there is evidence in other early eastern Mediterranean cultures of the use ofhenna and indigo for dyeing hair. During the time of the Roman civilization, a number of methods were used for colouring hair; one was the use of lead combs dipped in vinegar (presumably producing lead acetate), and another was the use of walnut stain. Pliny cited more than 100 recipes for colouring hair with vegetable and minerai materials. ln England, the Elizabethans treated hair with potash alum (aluminium potassium sulfate) followed by a concoction of rhubarb in order to produce a red tone, which was popular because of the colour of the Queen's hair. At the time of the French Revolution, 24 milion pounds (11 000 tonnes J of starch were sold each year in France for use in colouring hair. ln this technique, starch, a binder and, possibly, small amounts of colouring material were applied to the <b>hair.</b> <b>Bleaching</b> of hair has also been popular for many centuries. ln order to mimic th...|$|E
40|$|A flow-injection {{system with}} a glassy carbon disk {{electrode}} modified with Prussian Blue film is proposed for the determination of persulfate in commercial samples of <b>hair</b> <b>bleaching</b> boosters by amperometry. The detection was obtained by chronoamperometric technique and the sample is injected into the electrochemical cell in a wall jet configuration. Potassium chloride at concentration of 0. 1 mol L- 1 acted as sample carrier at a flow rate of 4. 0 mL min- 1 and supporting-electrolyte. For 0. 025 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) applied voltage, the proposed system handles ca. 160 samples per hour (1. 0 10 - 4 - 1. 0 10 - 3 mol L- 1 of persulfate), consuming about 200 ÃŽÂ¼L sample and 11 mg KCl per determination. Typical linear correlations between electrocatalytic current and persulfate concentration was ca. 0. 9998. The detection limit is 9. 0 10 - 5 mol L- 1 and the calculated amperometric sensibility 3. 6 103 ÃŽÂ¼A L mol- 1. Relative standard deviation (n = 12) of a 1. 0 10 - 4 mol L- 1 sample is about 2. 2 %.

40|$|The physico-chemical {{characteristics}} by bleaching treatments {{were assessed}} by several instrumental analyses such as surface morphology, chemical structural change, color change {{as well as}} tensile strength. The change of morphological characteristic was observed through scanning electron microscope(SEM). The observation of the fine structure on hair surface by SEM showed the bleached hair had much damaged to hair cuticle, and some of cuticle surface were worn away. To investigate the chemical structural changes in hair keratin, the cross-sections of hair samples were directly analysed using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy(FT-IRM). The results showed the cysteic acid S=O band intensity was distinctively increased by performing the bleaching treatment. The cleavage of cystine was appeared to proceed primarily through the sulfur-sulfur (-S-S-) fission whereby cysteic acid was formed as a principal oxidation products. The distribution of amide I band in hair keratin was determined by attenuated total reflectance(ATR) FT-IR mapping image. The {{results showed that the}} outer side of hair cortex was more damaged than the inner side of the hair cortex. Also, during chemical bleaching of the hair with alkaline peroxide, the hair was turned to reddish yellow due to the oxidative degradation of eumelanin. This means the eumelanin is more unstable than pheomelanin in chemical oxidation. With bleaching, the tensile strength was also reduced as a results of the chemical oxidation.

40|$|Ammonium persulfate {{is widely}} used to "boost" {{peroxide}} <b>hair</b> <b>bleaches.</b> These persulfates can produce a variety of cutaneous and respiratory responses, including allergic eczematous contact dermatitis, irritant dermatitis, localized edema, generalized urticaria, rhinitis, asthma, and syncope.

Patch tests may be performed with 2 % to 5 % aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate. Scratch tests may result in asthma and syncope.

40|$|Today, {{forensic}} hair {{analysis is}} considered to be a standard method for identifying chronic drug users since information about drug use stored and located in hair can cover several months to even years. When interpreting these results, one should be aware of all kind of pitfalls. External factors such as bleaching might influence the analytical result. Although the effect of hydrogen peroxide on cocaine in a solution was described before, it was never investigated whether the described reaction products (ecgonine methylester, benzoylecgonine, hydroxynorcocaine and dihydroxycocaine) are indeed found on contaminated or user hair. Since it is of great importance in forensic hair analysis to know whether cocaine and/or reaction products are detectable in hair after bleaching, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization mass spectrometric imaging (MALDI-MSI) was used to study the effect of hydrogen peroxide treatment on incorporated cocaine in hairs. Cocaine oxidation products were identified in a solution based on MS/MS spectra and spatial distribution of these products in hair was explored using MALDI TOF-MS. All images were accomplished by spraying alpha-Cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as a MALDI-matrix. Images revealed a loss of detectability of cocaine and its reaction products in hairs already after a short bleaching period. Since all compounds of interest are found in the hydrogen peroxide and wash solution, these findings indicate that all evidence of cocaine use might be lost after a <b>hair</b> <b>bleaching</b> treatment. Therefore, forensic toxicologists should take into consideration whether hair samples were bleached before making any conclusions from hair analysis results...|$|E
40|$|Occupational asthma among hairdressers {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{for some years}} and cases of work related asthma due to hair bleaches containing persulphates and hair dyes have been reported. The extent of the disease among hairdressers remains unknown. An investigation was carried out on an entire hairdressing salon, which specialised in <b>hair</b> <b>bleaching</b> and colouring and which employed 23 staff. On the basis of history and specific and non-specific bronchial provocation testing, four out of 23 staff {{were found to have}} occupational asthma due to the persulphate salts contained in hair bleaches. Only one of these had a positive skinprick test response to persulphate salts. Tests for non-specific bronchial reactivity to histamine in this work force were more sensitive for the diagnosis of asthma than simple lung function tests or recordings of peak flow rates performed four times daily for three weeks. The response to these agents was studied in greater detail by specific bronchial provocation tests in 14 members of the salon as well as one hairdresser from elsewhere with occupational asthma, three individuals with non-occupational asthma, and four normal subjects. Only those with a history of work related asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity responded positively, confirming that the response to bleach powders was specific. Studies of pulmonary mechanics after challenge showed that the response arose from changes in airway calibre not lung volumes. Measurement of neutrophil chemotactic activity after challenge showed significant rises in those affected, suggesting that mast cells may play a part in the pathogenesis of occupational asthma due to persulphates...|$|E
40|$|Background: Persulfate salts are potent {{oxidizing}} agents in hair bleach products that accelerate the bleaching process. Ammonium and potassium persulfates may cause delayedtype and immediate skin reactions. Also allergic asthma and rhinitis have been described. Objectives: Ammonium and potassium persulfates may cause delayed-type and immediate skin reactions. Also allergic asthma and rhinitis have been described. Methods: Case 1 A 36 -year-old female hairdresser suffered from contact urticaria after exposure to bleaching agents for ten years. She also experienced asthma and rhinitis when {{she worked in}} the hair salon for the same period. Several minutes after accidental contact with bleaching powder she developed an urticarial reaction on the neck, facial angioedema, and dyspnoea. We performed prick-to-prick tests with serial dilutions of freshly prepared persulfates starting with 0. 1 %. Prick-to-prick tests with ammonium persulfate 1. 0 % aqua and potassium persulfate 1. 0 % aqua showed wheals of 8 mm (positive control 6 mm). Ten minutes after the prick-to-prick tests, she suffered from asthmatic complaints which cleared after inhalation of b 2 -sympathicomimetics. Patch testing with ammonium persulfate 2. 5 % petrolatum and potassium persulfate 2. 5 % aqua resulted in wheals at the test site after 20 minutes. Prick tests with ammonium and potassium persulfate 1. 0 % aqua were negative in four controls. Case 2 A 48 -year-old woman showed pruritus of the scalp and facial angioedema which started several minutes after application of a <b>hair</b> <b>bleaching</b> product. Forty-five minutes after application she fainted with increased heart rate and low blood pressure. She was treated with clemastine, dexamathasone, and saline and transferred to a hospital. Prick tests with ammonium persulfate 2. 0 % aqua and potassium persulfate 2. 0 % aqua showed wheals of 4 mm (positive control 7 mm). Intradermal testing with ammonium persulfate 0. 1 % aqua and potassium persulfate 0. 1 % aqua showed wheals of almost 20 mm. Several hours after the intradermal tests, she became increasingly dizzy which cleared after treatment with fexofenadine. Patch tests with ammonium persulfate 2. 5 % petrolatum and potassium persulfate 2. 5 % aqua were negative after 20 minutes. Intradermal tests with ammonium and potassium persulfate 0. 1 % aqua were negative in three controls. Results: We presented two cases of immediate type hypersensitivity to persulfates with an anaphylactic reaction in one patient. These reactions have never been adequately documented. Conclusion: It seems that the reactions are immunologic and based on release of IgE. In patients suspected of allergic reactions to persulfates, prick and patch tests should be performed. Because severe respiratory symptoms and anaphylaxis may occur, we recommend to start with prick-toprick testing...|$|E
