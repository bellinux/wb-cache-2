5|$|Argon has {{electronic}} properties (ionization {{and/or the}} emission spectrum) <b>desirable</b> for some applications.|$|E
5|$|Fossil-fuel {{energy systems}} have {{different}} production, transmission, and end-use costs and characteristics than do renewable energy systems, and new promotional policies {{are needed to}} ensure that renewable systems develop as quickly and broadly as is socially <b>desirable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hexagonal {{boron nitride}} forms atomically thin layers, {{which have been}} used to enhance the {{electron}} mobility in graphene devices. It also forms nanotubular structures (BNNTs), which have with high strength, high chemical stability, and high thermal conductivity, among its list of <b>desirable</b> properties.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} that fighter escort was inherently <b>desirable,</b> {{but no one}} could quite conceive how a small fighter could have the range of the bomber yet retain its combat maneuverability. Failure to see this issue through proved one of the Air Corps Tactical School's major shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|Lane ranked at No. 79 on VH1's 100 Greatest Kid Stars. She {{was ranked}} No. 45 on AskMen.com's Top 99 Most <b>Desirable</b> Women in 2005, No. 85 in 2006 and No. 98 in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Like titanium, tantalum, and aluminium, niobium can be {{heated and}} {{anodized}} ("reactive metal anodization") {{to produce a}} wide array of iridescent colours for jewelry, where its hypoallergenic property is highly <b>desirable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The well-bred palfrey, {{which could}} equal a destrier in price, was popular with nobles and highly ranked knights for riding, hunting and {{ceremonial}} use. Ambling was a <b>desirable</b> trait in a palfrey, as the smooth gait allowed the rider to cover long distances quickly in relative comfort.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is {{used for}} the {{surgical}} instruments used in image-guided surgery, as well as wheelchairs, crutches, and any other products where high strength and low weight are <b>desirable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{was also}} number forty-three on FHMs 100 Sexiest Women in the World list in 2007. She {{has also been}} on AskMen.com's list of the Most <b>Desirable</b> Women in the World twice: she was number twenty-two in 2006 and number sixty-five in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Although a large {{horse is}} not {{required}} to carry an armoured knight, it is held by some historians that a large horse was <b>desirable</b> to increase the power of a lance strike. However, practical experiments by re-enactors have suggested that the rider's weight and strength is of more relevance than the size of the mount, and that little of the horse's weight is translated to the lance.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} coating able {{to change}} color was tested on Royal Navy submarines. On suggestion by Professor Leslie Cromby, lead oxide {{was applied to the}} hull, enabling it to become black on application of a solution of sulphite and sea water for night operation. For day sailing, a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sea water would be applied, producing sulphate and returning the hull to a white colour <b>desirable</b> for daytime conditions.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates make up {{the bulk}} of the fruit bodies, {{comprising}} 9.23% of the fresh weight (see table), and 65.4% of the dry weight. The carbohydrate component contains the monosaccharides glucose, mannitol and α,α-trehalose, the polysaccharide glycogen, and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide chitin, which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the nutritionally <b>desirable</b> high proportion of insoluble fibre in B.edulis.|$|E
5|$|Connectivity to the Game Boy Advance was {{discussed}} {{as an opportunity}} among the developers, but they eventually agreed that Double Dash!! was not suited to these connectivity ideas and decided to exclude it. It was <b>desirable</b> to narrow down {{the gap between the}} ability of veteran and novice players. Therefore, gameplay features like the ability to escape the banana were removed; the staff wanted both veteran and novice players to enjoy themselves.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{models and}} {{algorithms}} developed for binary mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen {{can not be}} used for gases containing significant amounts of other diluent gases without modification {{to take into account the}} different solubilities and diffusion constants of the alternative or added diluents. It is also highly <b>desirable</b> to test any such modifications, to make sure the schedules produced by them are acceptably safe.|$|E
5|$|Elaborate sexual {{displays}} and posturing are {{encountered in the}} behavioural ecology of animals. The birds-of-paradise, for example, sing and display elaborate ornaments during courtship. These displays serve a dual purpose of signalling healthy or well-adapted individuals and <b>desirable</b> genes. The displays are driven by sexual selection as an advertisement of quality of traits among suitors.|$|E
5|$|Growing up, Butlin {{had lived}} with his aunt Jessie in the Swan Pub in Coaley, in his later life {{he was able to}} {{purchase}} <b>desirable</b> property for himself; for many years living on The Bishops Avenue. His house there was Dane Court in Hampstead, which he purchased in 1947. Butlin sold Dane Court in 1951, and moved to a property in Grosvenor Square. He remained in this property through the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Had Eisenhower {{postponed}} the invasion, {{the next}} available period {{with the right}} combination of tides (but without the <b>desirable</b> full moon) was two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. As it happened, during this period the invaders would have encountered a major storm lasting four days, between 19 and 22 June, that would have made the initial landings impossible.|$|E
5|$|In {{nuclear energy}} studies, xenon {{is used in}} bubble chambers, probes, and in other areas where a high {{molecular}} weight and inert chemistry is <b>desirable.</b> A by-product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon-133 and xenon-135. These isotopes are monitored to ensure compliance with nuclear test ban treaties, and to confirm nuclear tests by states such as North Korea.|$|E
5|$|In {{the good}} time coming, the refining, elevating, and {{strengthening}} influences of high intellectual and aesthetic culture {{will be considered}} as <b>desirable</b> in the agricultural profession {{as they are in}} medicine, law or theology... If practical farmers are to remain ignorant of all the higher branches of learning, and to have only the mental discipline and culture of the country public schools, they can never occupy their proper position in society.|$|E
5|$|Looting {{has been}} linked to the {{economic}} and political stability of the possessing nation, with levels of looting increasing during times of crisis. It also appears that art collectors have stelae, or portions of them, stolen to order by browsing archaeological books and catalogues for <b>desirable</b> pieces. Examples of this may be found at Aguateca and El Perú, both in Guatemala's Petén department, where only the better preserved hieroglyphs and human faces were cut away.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the area}} remains, however, {{one of the poorest}} in Britain. This is in spite of rising {{property}} prices and the extensive building of luxury apartments centred largely around the former dock areas and alongside the Thames. With rising costs elsewhere in the capital and the availability of brownfield land, the East End has become a <b>desirable</b> place for business.|$|E
5|$|Mustering is a {{labour-intensive}} {{process that}} results {{in one of two}} major outcomes: slaughter for sale, or relocation. It may be assisted by feed-luring in which bales of hay are strategically placed to attract feral horses to a location where capture is feasible. Complicating this process is low demand for the captured horses, making it less <b>desirable</b> than fertility control or shooting, which reduce the population without having to find alternative locations for them.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{there are}} many {{scenarios}} where customized allocators are <b>desirable.</b> Some {{of the most common}} reasons for writing custom allocators include improving performance of allocations by using memory pools, and encapsulating access to different types of memory, like shared memory or garbage-collected memory. In particular, programs with many frequent allocations of small amounts of memory may benefit greatly from specialized allocators, both in terms of running time and memory footprint.|$|E
5|$|Selective {{glucocorticoid}} receptor modulators (SEGRMs) {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) {{formerly known as}} dissociated glucocorticoid receptor agonists (DIGRAs) are a class of experimental drugs designed to share many of the <b>desirable</b> anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or anticancer properties of classical glucocorticoid drugs but with fewer side effects such as skin atrophy. Although preclinical evidence on SEGRAMs’ anti-inflammatory effects are culminating, currently, the efficacy of these SEGRAMs on cancer are largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{title is}} derived from the 1965 Milton Bradley board game for teenage girls, Mystery Date, wherein several female players draw cards to advance to opening a door, hoping to find one of a variety of <b>desirable</b> male dates on the other side, while {{simultaneously}} hoping to avoid the lone undesirable one. A vintage television commercial for the game is viewed by Don's daughter Sally during the episode.|$|E
5|$|The fortifications of Malta {{consist of}} a number of walled cities, citadels, forts, towers, batteries, redoubts, entrenchments and pillboxes. The fortifications were built over {{thousands}} of years, from around 1450 BC to the mid-20th century, and they are a result of the Maltese islands' strategic position and natural harbours, which have made them very <b>desirable</b> for various powers.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as vulnerable as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by habitat destruction. A conservation plan has been drawn up for this species, and research into its current distribution is ongoing. Some of the indigenous peoples of Cameroon either respect this species or, in some cases, fear it. Today, this rockfowl {{is considered one of}} Africa’s most <b>desirable</b> birds by birders and is a symbol of ecotourism across its range.|$|E
5|$|Today these {{generators}} aren't used {{any more}} in modern turbines. Instead today most turbines use variable speed generators combined with partial- or full-scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system, which generally have more <b>desirable</b> properties for grid interconnection and have Low voltage ride through-capabilities. Modern concepts use either doubly fed machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators (both permanently and electrically excited) with full scale converters.|$|E
5|$|Within four days, 2,300 men had {{answered}} Ellsworth's call. A selection {{of only the}} most <b>desirable</b> men cut that number to 1,100, which was considered a regiment's full strength. When the state {{could not afford to}} supply the new troops, fundraisers were successful in raising $60,000 for the regiment, enough to provide uniforms, several different models of Sharps rifles, and provisions.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium {{is a good}} nuclear fuel-rod {{cladding}} metal, {{with the}} <b>desirable</b> properties of a very low neutron capture cross-section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear-reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free zirconium is the main source for hafnium.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} tendency for estate agents to describe properties in the less <b>desirable</b> areas of Layerthorpe, Burnholme and Tang Hall as being in the more <b>desirable</b> Heworth causing some confusion about the extent of the area.|$|E
