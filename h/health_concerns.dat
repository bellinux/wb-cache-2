Before the announcement, the Cleveland Cavaliers had said to Nash's agent that {{they were interested in}} him as a backup for Kyrie Irving if Nash asked for a buyout. Nash refused it, due to both his <b>health</b> <b>concerns</b> and wanting to retire as a Laker in gratitude for the opportunity given by the club. Nash was later on approached by another former team of his, the Dallas Mavericks, to have one last season with them instead, but he declined due to his aforementioned <b>health</b> <b>concerns.</b>|$|E

Labour were the other party to make gains, taking an extra 2 seats, including gaining Areley Kings from <b>Health</b> <b>Concern</b> by 39 votes.

5|$|Mercury also {{enters into}} the {{environment}} through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats. Due to <b>health</b> <b>concerns</b> (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, the amount of mercury sold in thermostats in the United States decreased from 14.5 tons in 2004 to 3.9 tons in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 24,000 {{metric tons}} of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest {{a wide array of}} this {{floating}} debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous <b>health</b> <b>concerns,</b> including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Health</b> <b>Concern</b> {{suffered}} {{a net loss}} of 2 councillors after losing 3 seats and only gaining 1 in Oldington and Foley Park. Despite the losses <b>Health</b> <b>Concern</b> said that would continue as a minority administration on the council. The Conservatives strengthened their position as the main opposition on the council after increasing their number of seats to 9 including a shock gain from Labour in Wolverley. They put their gains down to a focus on [...] "community issues" [...] including crime, tax and health and disillusionment with <b>Health</b> <b>Concern.</b>|$|R

5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific <b>health</b> <b>concerns</b> and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{meat and}} blubber of the {{dolphins}} caught {{has been found}} to have high levels of mercury, cadmium, the pesticide DDT, and organic contaminants like PCBs. The levels are high enough to pose a health risk for those frequently eating the meat and researchers warn that children and pregnant women shouldn't eat the meat at all. Because of the <b>health</b> <b>concerns,</b> the price of dolphin meat has decreased significantly.|$|E
50|$|Labour {{lost their}} {{majority}} {{on the council}} after <b>Health</b> <b>Concern</b> won 7 of the seats contested, gaining 6 of them from Labour. The local Labour MP David Lock accused the <b>Health</b> <b>Concern</b> campaigners of having gained support by scaremongering over the closure of Kidderminster Hospital, which he said had never been an option.|$|R

5|$|There {{are three}} breed {{clubs in the}} UK {{supporting}} the breed, although it is registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club due to its low number of puppy registrations on a yearly basis. The breed is friendly but tough and is suitable for interaction with older children. There are no breed specific <b>health</b> <b>concerns,</b> {{but they can be}} affected by spinal problems due to their elongated body and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate.|$|E
5|$|Two genetic <b>health</b> <b>concerns</b> seen in {{the breed}} are von Willebrand disease (vWD) and craniomandibular {{osteopathy}} (CMO); Scottie cramp, patellar luxation and cerebellar abiotrophy are also sometimes seen in this breed. Common eye conditions seen {{in a variety of}} breeds such as cataracts and glaucoma can appear in Scotties as they age. There are no specific conditions relating the skin that affect the breed, but they can be affected by common dog related conditions such as parasites and mange. Scotties typically live from 11 to 13 years.|$|E
5|$|Young Gaudí {{suffered}} from poor health, including rheumatism, {{which may have}} contributed to his reticent and reserved character. These <b>health</b> <b>concerns</b> and the hygienist theories of Dr. Kneipp contributed to Gaudí's decision to adopt vegetarianism early in his life. His religious faith and strict vegetarianism led him to undertake several lengthy and severe fasts. These fasts were often unhealthy and occasionally, as in 1894, led to life-threatening illness.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{election}} the Conservatives ran the council {{as a minority}} administration with them holding 18 seats, as compared to 10 for <b>Health</b> <b>Concern,</b> 7 Liberals, 3 Labour, 2 Liberal Democrats and 2 independents. 14 seats were contested at {{the election}} with the Conservatives defending 6, Liberals 3, independents 2 and <b>Health</b> <b>Concern,</b> Labour and Liberal Democrats 1 each.|$|R
50|$|The Conservatives {{needed to}} gain 4 seats {{to win a}} majority, but <b>Health</b> <b>Concern</b> were also hoping to make gains to take over as largest party on the council. <b>Health</b> <b>Concern</b> campaigned on issues {{including}} bringing more entertainment facilities to the council area and opposing a new fleet of black taxis, {{as well as their}} health policies.|$|R

Matsuno provided the original concept and plot but {{was forced to}} bow out of his roles midway through production due to <b>health</b> <b>concerns.</b> The team was restructured as a consequence: the new directorial duo consisted of Ito and Hiroshi Minagawa, while Akitoshi Kawazu of SaGa series fame became the game's executive producer. Series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi was disappointed by Matsuno's departure and declined {{to play the game}} beyond its introduction.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Dodd {{stepped down}} as head {{football}} coach due to <b>health</b> <b>concerns,</b> and he was succeeded by assistant Bud Carson. Dodd simply retained his athletic director position, which he had acquired in 1950 from William Alexander. Dodd retired as athletic director in 1976 and was followed in the position by Doug Weaver. Dodd continued to serve during his retirement years as an Alumni Association consultant and as a fundraiser for Georgia Tech. In 1983, he expressed interest in running a United States Football League team if Atlanta were awarded one, but the league folded before Atlanta received a team.|$|E
5|$|On June24,2011, it was {{reported}} that Brulé had been traded along with a fourth-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for forward Ryan Smyth. Due to <b>health</b> <b>concerns,</b> the deal never materialized as Brulé had not yet been cleared to play following his concussion (under league rules, an injured player can be traded but cannot be bought out, which is what the Kings had planned on doing). Furthermore, Kings General Manager Dean Lombardi made it apparent to the media that the team wanted someone with a smaller salary cap hit if Brulé could not be bought out. The Oilers ultimately acquired Smyth in exchange for forward Colin Fraser (whose cap hit was over $1 million less) and a seventh-round pick in the 2012 draft.|$|E
