40|$|Most {{hosts and}} parasites exist in diverse {{communities}} wherein {{they interact with}} other species, spanning the parasite-mutualist continuum. These additional interactions {{have the potential to}} impose selection on hosts and parasites and influence the patterns and processes of their evolution. Yet, <b>host-parasite</b> <b>interactions</b> are almost exclusively studied in species pairs. A wave of new research has incorporated a multispecies community context, showing that additional ecological interactions can alter components of host and parasite fitness, as well as interaction specificity and virulence. Here, we synthesize these findings to assess the effects of increased species diversity on the patterns and processes of host and parasite evolution.

40|$|AbstractClimate {{change is}} {{occurring}} very {{rapidly in the}} Arctic, and the processes that have taken millions of years to evolve in this very extreme environment are now changing on timescales as short as decades. These changes are dramatic, subtle and non-linear. In this article, we discuss the evolving insights into <b>host–parasite</b> <b>interactions</b> for wild ungulate species, specifically, muskoxen and caribou, in the North American Arctic. These interactions occur {{in an environment that}} is characterized by extremes in temperature, high seasonality, and low host species abundance and diversity. We believe that lessons learned in this system can guide wildlife management and conservation throughout the Arctic, and can also be generalized to more broadly understand <b>host–parasite</b> <b>interactions</b> elsewhere. We specifically examine the impacts of climate change on <b>host–parasite</b> <b>interactions</b> and focus on: (I) the direct temperature effects on parasites; (II) the importance of considering the intricacies of host and parasite ecology for anticipating climate change impacts; and (III) the effect of shifting ecological barriers and corridors. Insights gained from studying the history and ecology of host–parasite systems in the Arctic will be central to understanding the role that climate change is playing in these more complex systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree to}} which parasites use hosts is {{fundamental}} to host–parasite coevolution studies, yet difficult to assess and interpret in an evolutionary manner. Previous assessments of parasitism in eugregarine–host systems suggest high degrees of host specificity to particular host stages and host species; however, rarely have the evolutionary constraints on host specificity been studied experimentally. A series of experimental infections were conducted {{to determine the extent}} of host stadium specificity (larval vs. adult stage) and host specificity among 6 tenebrionid host species and 5 eugregarine parasite species. Eugregarines from all host species infected both the larva and adult stages of the host, and each parasite taxa colonized several host species (Tribolium spp. and Palorus subdepressus). Parasite infection patterns were not congruent with host phylogeny, suggesting that host phylogeny is not a significant predictor of <b>host–parasite</b> <b>interactions</b> in this system. However, the two host stages produced significantly different numbers of parasite propagules, indicating that ecological factors may be important determinants of host specificity in this host–parasite system. While field infections reflect extant natural infection patterns of parasites, experimental infections can demonstrate potential <b>host–parasite</b> <b>interactions,</b> which aids in identifying factors that may be significant in shaping future <b>host–parasite</b> <b>interactions...</b>|$|R

50|$|Trisporoids {{are also}} used in the {{mediation}} of the recognition between parasite and host. An example is the <b>host-parasite</b> <b>interaction</b> of a parasexual nature observed between Parasitella parasitica, a facultative mycoparasite of zygomycetes, and Absidia glauca. This interaction is an example for biotrophic fusion parasitism, because genetic information is transferred into the host. Many morphological similarities in comparison to zygospore formation are seen, but the mature spore is called a sikyospore and is parasitic. During this process, gall-like structures are produced by the host Absidia glauca.This coupled with further evidence (Schimek et al., 2003) {{has led to the}} assumption that trisporiods are not strictly species specific and that trisporiods represent the general principle of mating recognition in Mucorales.|$|E

It was during his post-doctoral studies at Harvard Medical School, he elucidated the effect of uridine nucleotides on an epimerase. Later, he continued his researches at Jadavpur University and discovered methodologies for the purification of Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and for the regulation of UDP-glucose 4-epimerase from S. fragilis. His researches revealed that the enzyme was allosterically activated by metabolically-related sugar phosphates and its allosteric kinetics is uni-directional, a property helpful in the regulation of galactose metabolism. He also proposed a protocol for the desensitization of the enzyme by heat, thereby generating hyperbolic kinetics and demonstrated that the addition and dissociation of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide activated or de-activated the enzyme. His work {{was reported to have}} widened the understanding about the active sites of the enzyme {{as well as of the}} molecular mechanisms of allostericity.

40|$|Changes in {{environmental}} nutrients {{play a crucial}} role in driving disease dynamics, but global patterns in nutrient-driven changes in disease are difficult to predict. In this paper we use ecological stoichiometry as a framework to review <b>host–parasite</b> <b>interactions</b> under changing nutrient ratios, focusing on three pathways: (i) altered host resistance and parasite virulence through host stoichiometry (ii) changed encounter or contact rates at population level, and (iii) changed host community structure. We predict that the outcome of nutrient changes on <b>host–parasite</b> <b>interactions</b> depends on which pathways are modified, and suggest that the outcome of infection could depend on the overlap in stoichiometric requirements of the host and the parasite. We hypothesize that environmental nutrient enrichment alters infectivity dynamics leading to fluctuating selection dynamics in host–parasite coevolution. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Gastrointestinal {{nematodes}} may {{elicit a}} variety of host immune responses depending on the initial immune status of the host, parasite species, and environmental conditions. The body has several physical defense mechanisms against parasites including the continual sloughing of the gut epithelium to prevent parasite attachment. However, once an infection has occurred, the host’s immune system attempts to limit {{the damage caused by}} the worm. Apart from the importance of the extrinsic factors of weather, climate and grazing management, the immune status of cattle is perhaps the most significant of all host factors influencing infection with O. ostertagi. Unlike other common gastrointestinal nematodes of cattle, who are subject to a quick host immune response after relatively short periods of exposure and immune system memory, a protective host immune response against O. ostertagi requires far longer periods of exposure and is not always permanent. The failure to respond quickly to Ostertagia may be a result of the suggested immunosuppression or impairment of antibody and cellular responses. O. ostertagi has been shown to induce cytokines and T-cells in the adaptive immune response in cattle, and recent advances have been made to produce suitable vaccines targeting adult stage Ostertagia. The major limitations to reducing parasitic load using vaccines is the complex and dynamic <b>host-parasite</b> <b>interaction</b> that is unique to each species of host and parasite, which is often influenced by several environmental factors.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} <b>host–parasite</b> <b>interactions,</b> it {{is necessary}} to quantify variation and covariation in defence traits.

We quantified sex and morph differences in parasite resistance (prevalence and intensity of water mite infections) and morph-specific fitness tolerance in the females in natural populations for over a decade. Therewas no evidence for higher parasite susceptibility in males as a cost of sexual selection, whereas differences in defence mechanisms between female morphs are consistent with correlational selection operating on combinations of parasite resistance and tolerance. We suggest that tolerance differences between female morphs interact with frequency-dependent sexual conflict, which maintains the polymorphism locally. <b>Host–parasite</b> <b>interactions</b> can therefore shape intra-and intersexual phenotypic divergence and interfere with sexual selection and sexual conflict...|$|R
