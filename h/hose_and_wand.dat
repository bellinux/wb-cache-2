40|$|The {{integration}} of uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs) into controlled airspace has generated {{a new era}} of autonomous technologies and challenges. Autonomous aerial refueling would enable UAVs to travel further distances and loiter for extended periods over time-critical targets. The NASA Dryden Flight Research Center recently has completed a flight research project directed at developing a dynamic <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> drogue system model to support the development of an automated aerial refueling system. A systematic dynamic model of the <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> drogue system would include the effects of various influences on the system, such as flight condition, <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> drogue type, tanker type and weight, receiver type, and tanker and receiver maneuvering. Using two NASA F/A- 18 aircraft <b>and</b> a conventional <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> drogue aerial refueling store from the Navy, NASA has obtained flight research data that document the response of the <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> drogue system to these effects. Preliminary results, salient trends, and important lessons are presente...|$|R
