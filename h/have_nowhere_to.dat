The title {{refers to a}} phrase from the gospels of St Matthew and St Luke that Harrison had taken to quoting when referring {{to the lack of}} privacy afforded him and his Beatles bandmates during the 1960s. In his adaptation, the phrase became: [...] "Foxes have holes and birds have nests, but Beatles <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> lay their heads." [...] Leng views the song as a reflection on [...] "what a man loses when he becomes a media entity: a connection with other people that everyone else takes for granted".|$|E

The film received predominantly negative reviews from critics, but with a total collection of , it proved to be a commercial success.

The video utilizes a synthesized voice and shows floating cloud images using a time lapse method as the speaker addresses the leaders of Scientology directly: [...] "We shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form..." [...] The video goes on to state: [...] "We recognize you as serious opponents, and do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame. However, you will not prevail forever against the angry masses of the body politic. Your choice of methods, your hypocrisy, and the general artlessness of your organization have sounded its death knell. You <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> hide because we are everywhere... We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us."

2500|$|Suri and Chapman {{argue that}} a net {{pollution}} reduction may not actually be occurring on global scales. Wealthy nations have a trend of exporting the activities that create the most pollution, like manufacturing of clothing and furniture, to poorer nations that {{are still in the}} process of industrial development (Suri and Chapman, 1998). This could mean that as the world's poor nations develop, they will <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> export their pollution. Thus, this progression of environmental clean up occurring in conjunction with economic growth cannot be replicated indefinitely because there may be nowhere to export waste and pollution intensive processes. However, Gene Grossman and Alan B. Krueger, the authors who initially made the correlation between economic growth, environmental clean-up, and the Kuznets curve, conclude that there is [...] "no evidence that environmental quality deteriorates steadily with economic growth." [...] And Yandle et al. conclude that [...] "policies that stimulate growth (trade liberalization, economic restructuring, and price reform) should be good for the environment".|$|E

The United Nations coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Robert Serry condemned the decision: [...] "These actions heighten tensions and undermine international efforts to create conditions for fruitful negotiations to achieve peace." [...] The US State Department called it a [...] violation of Israel's obligations under the Road map for peace. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said [...] "Tonight, while these new settlers from abroad will be accommodating themselves and their belongings in these Palestinian houses, 19 newly homeless children will <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> sleep."
