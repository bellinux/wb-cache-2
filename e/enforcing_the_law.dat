5|$|The Reverend John Vachell {{stayed on}} as vicar of St George's Littleport in title until 1830; he {{appointed}} a curate, George Britton Jermyn from 1817. Some of the St George's church registers were destroyed during the riots. The remaining registers start from 1754 (marriages), 1756 (burials), and 1783 (baptism). General unrest and riots {{such as that}} at Littleport {{may have been a}} factor in the government passing the Vagrancy Act of 1824. Due in part to some difficulties in <b>enforcing</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and to continued public unease, the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829 was created leading to the first modern police force.|$|E

5|$|Changes in the grazing {{habits of}} Ethiopia's {{indigenous}} peoples following the recent trend of settling in permanent villages have negatively impacted the Stresemann's bushcrow. While previously grazers left the soil loose {{and covered in}} dung to support the bushcrow's prey, this new lifestyle has resulted in overgrazing and soil compaction in some areas. The idea of private land ownership has also led to intensive planting of cash crops such as maize. The rich soil that the species needs to forage is also prime farming land. In the Yabello Wildlife Sanctuary, acacia trees are being collected for firewood, removing the bushcrow's nesting site. While protected under law, this sanctuary has difficulties <b>enforcing</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> It is believed that between 1999 and 2003 {{the population of the}} bushcrow declined by 80%.|$|E

25|$|When Cochise County was {{initially}} formed, both Wyatt Earp and Johnny Behan sought the new sheriff's position. It was a lucrative job, far beyond its salary. The sheriff {{was not only}} responsible for <b>enforcing</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> but was also county assessor, tax collector, and responsible for collecting prostitution, gambling, liquor, and theater fees. The county supervisors allowed the sheriff to keep ten percent of all amounts paid. This made the job worth more than $40,000 a year (about $ today).|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{a sheriff}} is an {{official}} in a county or independent city responsible for keeping the peace and <b>enforcing</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> Unlike most officials in law enforcement in the United States, sheriffs are usually elected, although many states (such as California) have state laws requiring that a person possess certain law enforcement qualifications before being able {{to run for the}} office.

25|$|The {{state of}} Minnesota passed laws {{limiting}} what railroads could charge {{in that state}} and established severe penalties, including fines and jail for violators. Some shareholders of Northern Pacific Railway filed a lawsuit in the United States Circuit Court for the District of Minnesota asserting that the laws were unconstitutional as violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, {{as well as the}} Dormant Commerce Clause. The shareholders sued the railroads to prevent them from complying with the law. They also sued Edward T.

25|$|Young {{argued that}} the Eleventh Amendment, which prohibits states from being sued by {{citizens}} of other states, meant that {{the court did not}} have jurisdiction to hear the case.

The court ordered Young to explain his actions, and he reiterated his Eleventh Amendment claim, whereupon the court held Young in contempt. Young was placed in the custody of the U.S. Marshal, and so he filed a petition with the United States Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus for his release.|$|E

25|$|In 1921, Ireland was partitioned, {{with the}} unionist-dominated {{north-east}} becoming Northern Ireland, while later, in 1922, {{the remainder of}} Ireland left the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to form the Irish Free State. Northern Ireland continued to use the UK's Union Flag and created its Ulster Banner derivation of the flag of Ulster with a crown {{on top of a}} six pointed star. Furthermore, for many years the tricolour was effectively banned in Northern Ireland under the Flags and Emblems (Display) Act (Northern Ireland) 1954 which empowered the police to remove any flag that could cause a breach of the peace but specified, rather controversially, that a Union Flag could never have such an effect. In 1964, the enforcement of this law by the Royal Ulster Constabulary at the behest of Ian Paisley, involving the removal of a single tricolour from the offices of Sinn Féin in Belfast, led to two days of rioting. The tricolour was immediately replaced, highlighting the difficulty of <b>enforcing</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anahuac {{was placed}} {{under the control of}} Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn. Bradburn {{enforced}} the 1830 laws strictly, angering many colonists. He forbade the state commissioner from granting property titles to squatters and insisted on <b>enforcing</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> freeing any slave who set foot in Mexican territory. He and his men also confiscated settlers goods for their own personal wealth. This angered many of the Anglos. They believed that their rights under the Mexican Constitution of 1824 were being violated. In 1832, local men organized a militia, supposedly to protect the settlement from Indian attacks, although all Indians in the area were peaceful. Mexican law forbade residents from creating militias, so Bradburn arrested the ringleader, Patrick C. Jack. Citizens were very angry. In Brazoria, residents held a town meeting to decide what to do. William H. Wharton complained that there was little support within Austin's colony to oppose Bradburn with military force; he and other advocates of armed conflict felt that their opposition from other settlers was as deep as that of the Mexican soldiers in the area. Bradburn eventually agreed to release Jack, and tensions cooled for a brief period.|$|E

500|$|Sam Dotson, {{chief of}} the St. Louis Police Department, coined the term [...] "Ferguson effect" [...] to {{describe}} what he believed was a change in enforcement behavior following the shooting of Michael Brown and subsequent unrest. According to Dotson, his officers were less active in <b>enforcing</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> {{because they were afraid}} they might be charged with breaking the law. FBI Director James Comey suggested that the Black Lives Matter movement is partly leading to a national rise in crime rates because police officers have pulled back from doing their jobs. A study published by the Justice Department, said there was an increase in homicides in 56 large cities over the course of 2015, and examined the [...] "Ferguson effect" [...] as one of three plausible explanations. Other researchers have looked for this [...] "Ferguson effect" [...] in the rise in crime rates and failed to find evidence for it on a national level. A report over the increased homicide rate in St. Louis concluded there was an [...] "absence of credible and comprehensive evidence" [...] for the Ferguson effect being responsible for that city's homicide increase.|$|E
500|$|The {{death in}} 1135 of HenryI left England with a disputed succession; {{although}} {{the king had}} persuaded his most powerful barons to swear support for the Empress Matilda, {{just a few days}} after Henry's death Stephen of Blois arrived from France to lay claim to the throne. The importance of the city and its Tower is marked by the speed at which he secured London. The castle, which had not been used as a royal residence for some time, was usually left in the charge of a Constable, a post held at this time by Geoffrey de Mandeville. As the Tower was considered an impregnable fortress in a strategically important position, possession was highly valued. Mandeville exploited this, selling his allegiance to Matilda after Stephen was captured in 1141 at the Battle of Lincoln. Once her support waned, the following year he resold his loyalty to Stephen. Through his role as Constable of the Tower, Mandeville became [...] "the richest and most powerful man in England". When he tried the same ploy again, this time holding secret talks with Matilda, Stephen had him arrested, forced him to cede control of his castles, and replaced him with one of his most loyal supporters. Until then the position had been hereditary, originally held by Geoffrey de Mandeville (a friend of William the Conqueror's and ancestor of the Geoffrey that Stephen and Matilda dealt with), but the position's authority was such that from then on it remained {{in the hands of an}} appointee of the monarch. The position was usually given to someone of great importance, who might not always be at the castle due to other duties. Although the Constable was still responsible for maintaining the castle and its garrison, from an early stage he had a subordinate to help with this duty: the Lieutenant of the Tower. Constables also had civic duties relating to the city. Usually they were given control of the city and were responsible for levying taxes, <b>enforcing</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and maintaining order. The creation in 1191 of the position of Lord Mayor of London removed many of the Constable's civic powers, and at times led to friction between the two.|$|E
