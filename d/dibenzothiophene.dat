2500|$|A {{family of}} {{substrates}} that are particularly common in petroleum are the aromatic sulfur-containing heterocycles called thiophenes.

2500|$|Thiophene and {{especially}} its derivatives occur in petroleum, sometimes in concentrations up to 1–3%. The thiophenic content {{of oil and}} coal is removed via the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process. In HDS, the liquid or gaseous feed is passed over a form of molybdenum disulfide catalyst under a pressure of H2. Thiophenes undergo hydrogenolysis to form hydrocarbons and hydrogen sulfide. [...] Thus, thiophene itself is converted to butane and H2S. [...] More prevalent and more problematic in petroleum are benzothiophene and <b>dibenzothiophene.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} thermochemical and kinetic parameters {{pertinent to the}} homogeneous gas-phase formation of two groups of pollutants, polychlorinated <b>dibenzothiophenes</b> (PCDT) and polychlorinated thianthrenes (PCTA) from their 2 -chlorothiophenol (2 -CTP) precursor. We compare the enthalpic profiles of the formation mechanism of PCDT/TA with the corresponding reactions involved in the gas-phase synthesis of PCDD/F (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, also known as dioxins). Overall, the presence of sulfur atoms greatly reduces the activation enthalpies of the rate determining steps {{in reference to the}} oxygenated system of PCDD/F. The rate constants of all elementary reactions are calculated using the transition state theory (TST) over a wide temperature range of 300 - 1200 K. We performed kinetic calculations for the formation of chlorinated <b>dibenzothiophenes</b> and chlorinated thianthrenes that could be applied to predict yields of these pollutants from 2 -CTP up to ~ 1200 K, that is, prior to the emergence of dechlorination and oxidation reactions.

30|$|The HDS of <b>dibenzothiophenes</b> {{generally}} {{takes place}} by two routes: (a) a hydrogenation (HYD) pathway involving aromatic ring hydrogenation, followed by C–S bond cleavage; and (b) a direct desulfurization (DDS) or hydrogenolysis pathway via direct C–S bond cleavage without aromatic ring hydrogenation [13].

50|$|Heterocyclic {{compounds}} can be usefully classified {{based on}} their electronic structure. The saturated heterocycles behave like the acyclic derivatives. Thus, piperidine and tetrahydrofuran are conventional amines and ethers, with modified steric profiles. Therefore, the study of heterocyclic chemistry focuses especially on unsaturated derivatives, and the preponderance of work and applications involves unstrained 5- and 6-membered rings. Included are pyridine, thiophene, pyrrole, and furan. Another large class of heterocycles are fused to benzene rings, which for pyridine, thiophene, pyrrole, and furan are quinoline, benzothiophene, indole, and benzofuran, respectively. Fusion of two benzene rings {{gives rise to a}} third large family of compounds, respectively the acridine, <b>dibenzothiophene,</b> carbazole, and dibenzofuran. The unsaturated rings can be classified according to the participation of the heteroatom in the pi system.|$|E
50|$|Attempts to {{characterize}} the mechanism of hydrogen spillover have seen the use of radiation photoelectron spectroscopy to analyze the shift between different oxidation states of the support (commonly metal oxides) via their respective emission spectra. In general, the mechanism is thought to proceed via the transfer of neutral hydrogen atoms to the support upon overcoming an activation energy barrier. This has even been observed at temperatures as low as 180K in metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts laced with Palladium nanoparticles (PdnP’s). Upon transfer to the support, they {{assume the role of}} Lewis bases where they donate electrons and reversibly reduce the sorbent. Additionally, the hydrodesulfurization of <b>dibenzothiophene</b> show that hydroxyl groups seem to favor the migration of spillover hydrogen, whereas sodium cations may trap the spillover hydrogen and are detrimental to hydrogenation pathway.|$|E
40|$|Research {{has been}} carried out to {{determine}} the feasibility of partial least-squares regression (PLS) modeling of infrared (IR) spectra of crude oils as a tool for fast sulfur speciation. The study is a continuation of a previously developed method to predict long and short residue properties of crude oils from IR and near-infrared (NIR) spectra. Retention data of two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC GC) of 47 crude oil samples have been used as input for modeling the corresponding IR spectra. A total of 10 different PLS prediction models have been built: 1 for the total sulfur content and 9 for the sulfur compound classes (1) sulfides, thiols, disulfides, and thiophenes, (2) aryl-sulfides, (3) benzothiophenes, (4) naphthenic-benzothiophenes, (5) <b>dibenzothiophenes,</b> (6) naphthenic-dibenzothiophenes, (7) benzonaphthothiophenes, (8) naphthenic-benzo-naphthothiophenes, and (9) dinaphthothiophenes. Research was carried out on a set of 47 IR spectra of which 28 were selected for calibration by means of a principal component analysis. The remaining 19 spectra were used as a test set to validate the PLS regression models. The results confirm the conclusion from previous studies that PLS modeling of IR spectra to predict the total sulfur concentration of a crude oil is a valuable alternative for the commonly applied physicochemical ASTM method D 2622. Besides, the concentration of <b>dibenzothiophenes</b> and three different benzothiophene classes can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. The corresponding models offer a valuable tool for quick on-site screening on these compounds, which are potentially harmful for production plants. The models for the remaining sulfur compound classes are insufficiently accurate {{to be used as a}} method for detailed sulfur speciation of crude oils...|$|R
30|$|Most of the oils in the Rewapu Block {{are light}} and normal oils, which are {{distinctly}} {{different from those}} heavy oils {{in the northern part}} of the Halahatang region. Significant biodegradation can be eliminated due to lack of 25 -norhopanes and the absence of a “hump” on the baseline of chromatograms. Exceptions are extremely heavy oils in Wells RP 7 and RP 101 C. These oils have an apparent chromatographic baseline “hump,” but no 25 -norhopanes. The alkylated <b>dibenzothiophenes</b> were apparently reduced. Therefore, biodegradation was not severe and water washing appears to be the principal factor causing the origin of heavy oils in Wells RP 7 and RP 101 C.

5000|$|... ==Ionization methods== Ionization of nonpolar {{petroleum}} components can {{be achieved}} by field desorption ionization and atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI). field desorption FT-ICR MS has enabled the identification {{of a large number of}} nonpolar components in crude oils that are not accessible by electrospray, such as benzo- and <b>dibenzothiophenes,</b> furans, cycloalkanes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). A drawback of field desorption is that it is slow, mainly due to the need of ramping the current to the emitter in order to volatilize and ionize molecules. APPI can ionize both polar and nonpolar species, and an APPI spectrum can be generated in just a few seconds. However, APPI ionizes a broad range of compound classes and produces both protonated and molecular ion peaks, resulting in a complex mass spectrum.|$|R
