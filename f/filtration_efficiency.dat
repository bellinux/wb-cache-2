40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Key Engineering Materials [© Trans Tech] and is available at: www. scientific. net. A new manufacturing route for foam ceramics based on gel casting has been developed and is being commercialised. Gel casting employs an organic monomer that is polymerised to cause the insitu gelation of a foamed aqueous ceramic slurry. The primary advantage is the inherent flexibility of the process; the foams can be near net shape manufactured in a variety of shapes and sizes and after production are simply dried and fired. In addition, the porosity and pore size distribution can be varied to suit the application and a wide range of ceramics can be foamed with densities ranging from 5 - 40 % of theoretical. Applications are diverse and include the potential to be used as diesel particulate filters (DPF).

50|$|The use of {{nanofiber}} webs as a {{filtering medium}} is well established. Due {{to the small}} size of the fibers London-Van Der Waals forces are an important method of adhesion between the fibers and the captured materials. Polymeric nanofibers have been used in air filtration applications for more than seven decades. Because of poor bulk mechanical properties of thin nanowebs, they are laid over a filtration medium substrate. The small fiber diameters cause slip flows at fiber surfaces, causing an increase in the interception and inertial impaction efficiencies of these composite filter media. The enhanced <b>filtration</b> <b>efficiency</b> at the same pressure drop is possible with fibers having diameters less than 0.5 micrometer. Since the essential properties of protective clothing are high moisture vapor transport, increased fabric breath-ability, and enhanced toxic chemical resistance, electrospun nanofiber membranes are good candidates for these applications.|$|E
50|$|An {{oil bath}} air cleaner {{consists}} of a sump containing a pool of oil, and an insert which is filled with fibre, mesh, foam, or another coarse filter media. When the cleaner is assembled, the media-containing body of the insert sits a short distance above {{the surface of the}} oil pool. The rim of the insert overlaps the rim of the sump. This arrangement forms a labyrinthine path through which the air must travel in a series of U-turns: up through the gap between the rims of the insert and the sump, down through the gap between the outer wall of the insert and the inner wall of the sump, and up through the filter media {{in the body of the}} insert. This U-turn takes the air at high velocity across the surface of the oil pool. Larger and heavier dust and dirt particles in the air cannot make the turn due to their inertia, so they fall into the oil and settle to the bottom of the base bowl. Lighter and smaller particles are trapped by the filtration media in the insert, which is wetted by oil droplets aspirated there into by normal airflow. Oil bath air cleaners were very widely used in automotive and small engine applications until the widespread industry adoption of the paper filter in the early 1960s. Such cleaners are still used in off-road equipment where very high levels of dust are encountered, for oil bath air cleaners can sequester a great deal of dirt relative to their overall size without loss of <b>filtration</b> <b>efficiency</b> or airflow. However, the liquid oil makes cleaning and servicing such air cleaners messy and inconvenient, they must be relatively large to avoid excessive restriction at high airflow rates, and they tend to increase exhaust emissions of unburned hydrocarbons due to oil aspiration when used on spark-ignition engines.|$|E
40|$|The <b>filtration</b> <b>efficiency</b> of fibrous filters {{shows in}} the {{submicron}} particle regime a bold reduction. The reason for this behavior is the transition from interceptional to diffusional particle capture. Particle size dependent filtration mechanisms cause a minimum in <b>filtration</b> <b>efficiency</b> at particle sizes about 0, 2 micrometer. Previous investigations have shown that a reduction of particle penetration, i. e. enhancement of <b>filtration</b> <b>efficiency</b> due to variation of the filterstructure (diameter of fibres, packing density, depth of filterlayer) results in a higher resistance to flow and causes a higher pressure drop. Another way to improve <b>filtration</b> <b>efficiency</b> without changing the filter structure {{is the use of}} additional electric particle capture mechanisms. The main advantage is the higher <b>filtration</b> <b>efficiency</b> without increasing the pressure drop. Today electric particle capture mechanisms are mainly applied in electret filters, which consist of electric inhomogeneous charged fibres. However, the fibres of electret filters loose their charge with time and particle loading. The electric field inside the filter layer will be neutralized so that <b>filtration</b> <b>efficiency</b> decreases. To avoid this disadvantage a new type of filter can be used, in which dielectric fibres become polarized by an external electric field. This field maintains an inhomogeneous electric field inside the filter layer. Aim of this thesis is {{the development of a new}} filter, which will be optimized for <b>filtration</b> <b>efficiency</b> without increased pressure drop in conjunction with external electric fields. The new filter will be produced with alternating thin translucent conducting layers and filterlayers of dielectric fibres. In that way it will be possible to obtain strong electric fields at low applied voltages inside the filter layers. The applied voltage should be in the range of 220 V.

A thermally insulated closed-loop test set-up was used to conduct experiments using beds formed of fibers only and fibers intermixed with particulate debris. A total of three particulate mixes were used to simulate the particulate debris. The head loss data were obtained for theoretical fiber bed thicknesses of 0. 125 inches to 4. 0 inches; approach velocities of 0. 15 to 1. 5 ft/s; temperatures of 75 F and 125 F; and sludge-to-fiber nominal concentration ratios of 0 to 60.

For test conditions where the beds are fairly uniform, the head loss data were predictable within an acceptable accuracy range by the semi-theoretical model. The model was equally applicable for both pure fiber beds and the mixed beds. Typically the model over-predicted the head losses for very thin beds and for thin beds at high sludge-to-fiber mass ratios. This is attributable to the non-uniformity of such debris beds.

These methods rely on the measurement of <b>filtration</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (FEs).

Human puffing behaviour records were obtained from 10 smokers, each smoking six commercial cigarettes ranging from 1 mg to 12 mg ‘tar’ yields [International Standard (ISO) values]. These records were used to drive a human smoke duplicator and the resulting ‘tar’ and nicotine yields obtained from duplication were compared with the estimates obtained from ‘whole’ and ‘part filter’ analysis.

40|$|A general recent {{trend in}} {{determining}} the quality of filter media and filters lies in counting particles rather than weighing the media or filter. By using counters {{before and after the}} filtration – as in the standardized multi pass test- the filter efficiency can be determined in a detailed way by listing the quotient of captured over total particles as a function of particle diameters. This measure can also be simulated on detailed models of fibrous filter media with GeoDict. In this work, we report on multi pass test results for an oil filter media exhibiting a non-intuitive filtration behavior. After an initial rise, the fractional <b>filtration</b> <b>efficiencies</b> decrease again, until the filter material is clogged. To understand the cause for these experimental findings, fractional efficiencies are determined numerically taking into account a possible re-entrainment of particles. To achieve statistically reliable efficiency results, a large number of particles must be considered. Filter loading experiments are carried out on at least a few square centimeters of media. Even for those, the statistics of particle counting for large particles usually rely on very few particles. Media scale simulations, on the other hand, consider even smaller surfaces of about a square millimeter. For these smaller surface areas, arrivals of large particles are even less probable than in experiments and the predicted filter efficiency curves would have low statistical relevance. By interspersing filter efficiency simulations with many more particles than would actually arrive at the media during life time simulations, the quality of the filtration statistics of media scale simulations can be improved such that a quantitative comparison with experimental data becomes possible...|$|R
