40|$|The {{relationship}} between European Union law (hereafter, ‘EU law’ or, {{in a more}} general sense, ‘European law’ 1) and international law has been a concern for European and international lawyers alike for quite some years now. 2 Although the question is a classical one, this article argues that answers that have traditionally been given ought to be revisited {{in the light of}} important changes in international and European law. Recent developments in the European case-law since 2005, and those triggered by the Kadi case, 3 provide this article’s starting point. Drawing on the three decisions that were successively made in that case, the article reframes some of the legal categories used to date to describe the articulation between the international and the European <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> and more specifically: the validity, the rank and the effects of international law within the EU <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> There is one concept in particular that has become very popular and is widely used to capture the change of paradigm in the {{relationship between}} the <b>international</b> and European <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> and, in some cases at least, to replace traditional legal categories: it is the concept of legal pluralism. That concept actually lies, for instance, {{at the core of the}} reasoning of the Advocate-General in the Kadi case and supplies the key to the exegesis of the Kadi jurisprudence. As that concept can mean different things to different people, the article will examine it more closely in order to unpack its implications within the European <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> The ultimate goal of the present contribution is to develop a theoretical framework for future reflections on the relationship between a plurality of autonomous albeit overlapping <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders,</b> in the first place to each other, but also ultimately and inevitably between them and national <b>legal</b> <b>orders.</b> My claim indeed is that these three autonomous layers of the European <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> lato sensu ought to be considered at the same time when assessing the articulation between any two of them. Only a few scholars have examined the issue in this integrated fashion 4 and this constitutes a blind spot in contemporary legal analysis of the European <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> The article’s argument is three-pronged. In a first section, it starts by clearly identifying the different questions raised by the relationship between the European and <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> and presents the answers that have traditionally been given to those questions in the European case-law. The second section turns to recent developments in practice and uncovers the new perspectives one may draw from the Kadi case in particular. In its third section, the article broaches some of the concerns European lawyers are facing post-Kadi. Drawing on those concerns, it delineates a more comprehensive approach to the relationship between the European and the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders,</b> by revisiting the contours and meanings of European legal pluralism and its implications for domestic <b>legal</b> <b>orders...</b>|$|R

40|$|More {{and more}} legal {{scholars}} {{are turning to}} constitutional law {{to make sense of}} the growth of transnational and <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders.</b> They often employ constitutional terminology loosely, in a bewildering variety of ways, with little effort to clarify their analytical frameworks or acknowledge the normative presuppositions embedded in their analysis. The potential of constitutional analysis as an instrument of critique of transnational <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> is frequently lost in methodological confusion and normative controversy. An effort at clarification is necessary. We propose a functional approach to supraconstitutional analysis that applies across issue areas, accommodates variation in kinds and degrees of supraconstitutionalization, recognizes its simultaneously domestic and transnational character, and reflects its uneven incidence and impacts. We apply this framework to NAFTA to consider whether and how it superimposes a supraconstitutional <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> on member states 2 ̆ 7 domestic constitutional orders. We show that the main thrust of this contemporary supraconstitutional project is to restructure state and international political forms to promote market efficiency and discipline, enable free capital movement, confer privileged rights of citizenship and representation on corporate capital, insulate key aspects of the economy from state interference, and constrain democratic decision-making...|$|R

40|$|This work studies {{causation}} {{in the law}} {{of international}} State responsibility. It is submitted {{that the absence of}} causation as an element of the internationally wrongful act owes more to the structure of international law, than to the inadequateness of causation as a conceptual and legal construct to ascribe international responsibility. The lack of causal analysis for breach owes to the subsidiary role of primary rules in the process of determining the existence of an internationally wrongful act. Primary rules are even less relevant for the determination of reparations, which stem from injury arising from the international wrong. Moreover, international law carries out the attribution of wrongful conduct pursuant to the agency theory, which operates en lieu of causation. The absence of causal analysis from the determination of internationally wrongful acts is the result of consistent State practice, based on a clear distinction between the national and <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders.</b> <b>International</b> responsibility is not domestic liability writ large; it is international accountability of international actors in the international community. The differences that international responsibility bears with domestic <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> respond to the legal articulation of an international system of rules, distinct from the <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> of the sovereign subjects it addresses. Causal analysis is only relevant for the assessment of damage and subsequent reparation of breaches of international law...|$|R

40|$|Hans Kelsen {{identified}} three possible {{relationships between the}} <b>international</b> and domestic <b>legal</b> <b>orders.</b> Dualism understands the <b>international</b> and domestic <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> as separate and independent. Monism describes a single and comprehensive <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> but can operate with either domestic law or international law as a higher order law. Like many domestic <b>legal</b> <b>orders,</b> that of the United States has never fully worked out which of these three options specifies the status of international law in its domestic <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> While {{the text of the}} United States Constitution suggests a form of monism in which international law is automatically part of the domestic <b>legal</b> <b>order,</b> the structure of the Constitution does not permit such automatic incorporation. In a 2008 decision, the U. S. Supreme Court articulated a theory that borders on dualism. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision makes sense of some recent U.

In a bid to maintain and indeed improve its character as an obligatory and objectified set of norms, principles and procedures governing all facets of the states of peace and war, international law responds to this challenge basically on two fronts First, there is the effort to create law more rapidly and effectively. Thus, new types of sources of obligation and methods for creating them make their debut, and take their place in the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> alongside the more traditional ones? Secondly, new subject-areas concerning international law make a showing in international relations, such as environmental law.

To assess the evidence and its theoretical implications, I combine the analytical concept of political opportunity structure developed in the transnational studies literature with pluralist approaches to law. I argue that trade political actors can become aware of the pathways to influence that legal uncertainty opens, in particular under conditions of multi-level governance where national, regional and <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> are intertwined.

40|$|Legal systems, {{institutions}} and organizations comprise {{more than just}} rules, regulations and laws. They are also made up of individuals that create, implement and regulate those systems, {{institutions and}} organizations. Humans themselves, however, are not so easily compartmentalized and will tend to bring their home legal cultures into the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> Additionally, they will tend to create new legal cultures within those international intergovernmental organizations (2 ̆ 2 lOs 2 ̆ 2) and fields. But, the interactions and operations of those legal cultures- be they domestic or international, new or old, competing or complementing- will often have significant implications for the processes and functions of those different legal cultures, individually or together. Accordingly, examination of those legal cultures and their interactions is necessary to really understand the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order,</b> on its own or in its interactions with domestic systems. This article will thus introduce the idea of applying comparative legal cultural analyses to the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order,</b> and specifically to lOs-the backbone of the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> Because such analyses are somewhat unusual and little known, this paper will also provide a methodological toolbox for those analyses...|$|E

The order established by revolution or coup d’etat has to be considered as a modification of the old order, not as a new order, if this order is valid for the same territory. The government brought into permanent power by a revolution or coup d’etat is, according to international law, the legitimate government of the State, whose identity is not affected by these events. Hence, according to international law, victorious revolutions or successful coups d’etat are to be interpreted as procedures by which a national <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> can be changed.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the legitimacy of}} the expanding powers of the Security Council and addresses the question of whether such hypertrophy serves the purpose of strengthening the rule of law in international relations, as endeavoured by the 2000 United Nations Millennium Declaration. When the Security Council acts as a legislator, adjudicator and enforcer, its extraordinary degree of compulsory jurisdiction aggravates the democratic deficit within the main political organ of the United Nations and raises concern not only with lack of representation but also with the absence of mechanisms of control and judicial review which are part of the evolution of nation states to prevent abuses of power. As the jurisdiction of the Security Council is expanded through practice, rather than through reform, and the concept of what constitutes a threat to international peace and security evolves within that political organ, concerns on legitimacy and legality of its mandatory decisions become even more relevant and challenging for those nation states which are not permanent members of the Security Council and cannot participate in the process nor exercise consent. The thesis is based on comparative concepts pertaining to national and <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> as well as its historic and political analysis. This multidisciplinary approach seeks to assess the relationship between international public law and international politics {{and the extent to which}} a more legally grounded global community contributes to stability and legitimacy in international relations...|$|R
40|$|The present book brings {{together}} perspectives from different disciplinary fields {{to examine the}} significant legal, moral and political issues which arise {{in relation to the}} use of lethal force in both domestic and international law. These issues have particular salience in the counter terrorism context following 9 / 11 (which brought with it the spectre of shooting down hijacked airplanes) and {{the use of force in}} Operation Kratos that led to the tragic shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes. Concerns about the use of excessive force, however, are not confined to the terrorist situation. The essays in this collection examine how the state sanctions the use of lethal force in varied ways: through the doctrines of public and private self-defence and the development of legislation and case law that excuses or justifies the use of lethal force in the course of executing an arrest, preventing crime or disorder or protecting private property. An important theme is how the domestic and <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> intersect and continually influence one another. While legal approaches to the use of lethal force share common features, the context within which force is deployed varies greatly. Key issues explored in this volume are the extent to which domestic and international law authorise pre-emptive use of force, and how necessity and reasonableness are legally constructed in this context.
