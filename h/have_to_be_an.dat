5|$|The {{preceding}} German large cruiser design, , was {{an incremental}} increase over previous armored cruisers. Blücher was armed with twelve 21cm(8.3in) guns, {{and designed to}} counter what the Germans knew about the British , which were assumed to be larger iterations of the basic armored cruiser type. Once sufficient information about the new British cruisers became available, {{it was obvious that}} they were not simply an enlargement on previous designs but a whole new type of warship—the battlecruiser—to which Blücher was quite inferior. However, there were insufficient funds to alter Blüchers layout, so the cruiser assigned for 1907 would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> entirely new design.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, more {{specifically}} in fractal geometry, a fractal dimension is a ratio providing a statistical index of complexity comparing how detail {{in a pattern}} (strictly speaking, a fractal pattern) changes with the scale at which it is measured. It has also been characterized {{as a measure of}} the space-filling capacity of a pattern that tells how a fractal scales differently from the space it is embedded in; a fractal dimension does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> integer.|$|E

But eliminating all possible irregular arrangements is very difficult, {{and this is}} what made the Kepler conjecture so hard to prove. In fact, there are irregular arrangements that are denser than the cubic close packing arrangement over a small enough volume, but any attempt to extend these arrangements to fill a larger volume always reduces their density.|$|E

500|$|Australian Cattle Dogs {{had been}} {{classified}} in the [...] "miscellaneous" [...] category at the American Kennel Club (AKC) since the 1930s; to get the breed full recognition, the AKC required that a National Breed Parent Club be organised for promotion and protection of the breed. In 1967 Esther Ekman met Chris Smith-Risk at an AKC show, and the two fell into conversation about their Australian Cattle Dogs {{and the process of}} establishing a parent club for the breed. By 1969 the fledgling club had 12 members and formally applied to the AKC for instructions. One of the requirements was that the Club had to start keeping its own registry for the breed and that all dogs on the registry would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> extension of the Australian registry, tracing back to registered dogs in Australia. The AKC Parent Club members began researching their dogs, including exchanging correspondence with McNiven, and discovered that few of them had dogs that could be traced back to dogs registered in Australia. The AKC took over the club registry in 1979 and the breed was fully recognised in September 1980. The Australian Cattle Dog Club of America is still active in the promotion of the breed and the maintenance of breed standards. The National Stock Dog Registry continued to recognise Cattle Dogs without prerequisite links to Australian registered dogs, on the condition that any dog of unknown parentage that was presented for registry would be registered as an [...] "American Cattle Dog", and all others would still be registered as [...] "Australian Cattle Dogs".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Los Angeles Times, Seth MacFarlane responded to Palin's criticism, saying that the series always uses satire as the basis of its humor, and that the show is an [...] "equal-opportunity offender." [...] In addition, Andrea Fay Friedman, who voiced Ellen, and who herself has Down syndrome, also responded to the criticisms saying that the joke was aimed at Sarah Palin and not her son, and that [...] "former Governor Palin does not have a sense of humor." [...] In a subsequent interview, Friedman rebuked Palin, accusing her of using her son, Trig, as a political prop to pander for votes, saying that she has a normal life and that Palin's son should be treated as normal, rather than like a [...] "loaf of French bread." [...] Later, MacFarlane addressed both Palin's statement and Friedman's rebuttal in an appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher calling Palin's outrage a presumptuous attempt to defend people with Down syndrome, and characterizing Friedman's statement as her way of saying that she does not need feigned pity from Palin. Family Guy cast member Patrick Warburton stated that he objected to the joke, saying, [...] "I know that you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> equal-opportunity offender, but {{there are some things that}} I just don't think are funny." [...] While frequent MacFarlane critic Parents Television Council touched on the Palin controversy in its assessment of the episode, the rest of the show's content—which contained [...] "mean-spirited pot-shots, explicit language, and strong sexual content"—earned the watchdog group's [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] title. The PTC specifically cited the Broadway-style song, which the PTC said [...] "contained all the stereotypes of mental retardation" [...] and [...] "disturbing sexual references," [...] and the climatic scene in the subplot, where Peter pretends to be a psychic, which the PTC said also contained sexual humor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{project of}} co-writing was {{expedited}} by the {{collaboration between the}} four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in Birdman came from Skype sessions {{at two in the}} morning where he and Giacobone were [...] "cracking each other up". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said [...] "We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be [...] "very, very sure about what was on the page." [...] As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> idiot to do it all in one shot. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. Birdman looks like a good idea now, but [...] we did not know how we would land." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) {{called the}} first episode [...] "atmospheric" [...] and [...] "gripping". He said, [...] "While Kat shines in Redwater, it's {{fair to say that}} Alfie seems a little bit lost and directionless in {{the first episode}}, with even scenes of him {{experiencing}} weird visions and nearly dying (twice!) seeming like time-fillers." [...] He said the characters of Agnes and Dermott had [...] "immediately caught our attention" [...] but wondered if the show would appeal to viewers who are not EastEnders fans, saying [...] "surely you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> EastEnders watcher to really care about Kat's quest for her son?" [...] but said [...] "for us it's a thumbs up if Redwater can keep up the suspense, surprises, gothic tone and sense of foreboding that sets it apart from EastEnders." [...] The series was reviewed on BBC Radio 5 Live's Afternoon Edition, where TV critic Emma Bullimore from TV Times said that it was [...] "enjoyable" [...] but more [...] "soapy" [...] and less [...] "complex" [...] than Broadchurch, and said that viewers should not expect it to be like EastEnders or Broadchurch but should [...] "accept it as a new thing", adding that it had good production values and deemed it a [...] "worthy experiment". Sinéad Garvan from Newsbeat, speaking at the same time, said that she found it [...] "weird" [...] seeing Kat and Alfie in a different setting and was more intrigued by the new characters but said that that Kat and Alfie still had the same chemistry that they have in EastEnders.|$|E
2500|$|Fallback and auto-detection: [...] UTF-8 {{provided}} {{backwards compatibility}} for 7-bit ASCII, but much software and data uses 8-bit extended ASCII encodings designed {{prior to the}} adoption of Unicode to represent the character sets of European languages. [...] Part of the popularity of UTF-8 {{is due to the fact}} that it provides a form of backward compatibility for these as well. [...] A UTF-8 processor which erroneously receives an extended ASCII file as input can [...] "fall back" [...] or replace 8-bit bytes using the appropriate code-point in the Unicode Latin-1 Supplement block, when the 8-bit byte appears outside a valid multi-byte sequence. Though it does happen, the 8-bit characters in extended ASCII encodings do not usually have the correct form for UTF-8 multi-byte sequences. This is because the 8-bit bytes which introduce multi-byte sequences in UTF-8 are primarily accented letters (mostly vowels) in the common extended ASCII encodings, and the UTF-8 continuation bytes are punctuation and symbol characters. [...] To appear as a valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, a series of 2 to 4 extended ASCII 8-bit characters would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unusual combination of symbols and accented letters. In short, extended ASCII character sequences which look like valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequences are unlikely. Fallback errors will be false negatives, and these will be rare. Moreover, in many applications, such as text display, the consequence of incorrect fallback is usually slight. Only legibility is affected, and not significantly. [...] These two things make fallback feasible, if somewhat imperfect. Indeed, as discussed further below, the HTML5 standard requires that erroneous bytes in supposed UTF-8 data be replaced upon display on the assumption that they are Windows-1252 characters. [...] The presence of invalid 8-bit characters outside valid multi-byte sequences can also be used to [...] "auto-detect" [...] that an encoding is actually an extended ASCII encoding rather than UTF-8, and decode it accordingly. A UTF-8 stream may simply contain errors, resulting in the auto-detection scheme producing false positives; but auto-detection is successful in the majority of cases, especially with longer texts, and is widely used.|$|E
