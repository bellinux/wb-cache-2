40|$|Five {{isolates}} of a filamentous bacterial morphotype {{with the}} distinctive diagnostic microscopic features of Eikelboom Type 1863 {{were obtained from}} activated sludge sewage treatment plants in Victoria, Australia. On the basis of phenotypic evidence and 16 S rDNA sequence data, these isolates proved to be polyphyletic. <b>Two</b> (<b>Ben</b> 06 and Ben 06 C) are from the Chryseobacterium subgroup {{which is in the}} Cytophaga group, subdivision I of the Flexibacter- Cytophaga-Bacteroides phylum. <b>Two</b> (<b>Ben</b> 56 and Ben 59) belong to the genus Acinetobacter, and one (Ben 58) is a Moraxella sp., closest to Mor. osloensis.

5000|$|BEND2 has <b>two</b> <b>BEN</b> domains at <b>its</b> C-terminus.

[...] BEN domains are predicted to form four alpha helices that allow this domain to interact with its DNA target.|$|R
50|$|Winnebago Deal are a {{rock music}} band from Oxford, United Kingdom. They started {{life in the}} late 1990s at Bartholomew School in Eynsham, with Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (then on guitar) writing songs then {{recruiting}} a drummer and bass player through an ad.
