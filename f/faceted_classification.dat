500|$|The {{classification}} {{was originally}} enumerative, {{meaning that it}} listed all of the classes explicitly in the schedules. Over time it added some aspects of a <b>faceted</b> <b>classification</b> scheme, allowing classifiers to construct a number by combining a class number for a topic with an entry from a separate table. Tables cover commonly used elements such as geographical and temporal aspects, language, and bibliographic forms. For example, a class number could be constructed using 330 for economics + [...]9 for geographic treatment + [...]04 for Europe to create the class 330.94 European economy. Or one could combine the class 973 for United States + [...]05 for periodical publications on the topic {{to arrive at the}} number 973.05 for periodicals concerning the United States generally. The classification also makes use of mnemonics in some areas, such that the number 5 represents the country Italy in classification numbers like 945 (history of Italy), 450 (Italian language), 195 (Italian philosophy). The combination of faceting and mnemonics makes the classification synthetic in nature, with meaning built into parts of the classification number.|$|E

We analyze the reducing power of dynamic taxonomies and conventional taxonomies and report experimental results on real data, which confirm that monodimensional taxonomies are not useful for browsing/retrieval on large databases, whereas dynamic taxonomies can effectively manage very large databases and exhibit a very fast convergence.
