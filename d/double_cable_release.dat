Damping in <b>double</b> <b>Cables</b> {{suspension}} bridge composed of steel reinforcement beams and reinforced concrete tower is non-classical, {{which leads to}} coupled equations of motion in main coordinate system. Based on the complex damping theory, the viscous damping ratio is solved, {{which can be used}} to describe energy dissipation characteristics of non-classical damping system approximately. Seismic response of double chains {{suspension bridge}} is analyzed through an example of double chains suspension bridge, considering the geometric nonlinearity and non-classical damping. And numerical calculation is presented for seismic response subjected to independent effect or combination effect of three orthogonal components of seismic wave. Single cable suspension bridge can be taken as a special case of <b>double</b> <b>cable</b> suspension bridge, after the main cable shape coefficient is introduced. The dynamic responses of <b>double</b> <b>cable</b> suspension bridge and single cable suspension bridge are compared to reveal the characteristics of Seismic Response of <b>double</b> <b>cable</b> suspension bridge. The study of the dynamic responses characteristics of <b>double</b> <b>cable</b> suspension bridge has a positive significance on structural form selection of such type bridge during designing, dynamic performance evaluation and reinforcement design has positive significance...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we report}} the {{synthesis}} via the Grignard metathesis method (GRIM) of donor/ acceptor <b>double</b> <b>cable</b> copolymers with diblock and random sequences, where the conjugated polythiophene backbone is substituted with hexyl chains and with alkyl chains bearing fullerene. First, the monomers 2, 5 -dibromo- 3 -hexylthiophene and 2, 5 -dibromo- 3 -(l, 3 -dioxa- 2 -octyl) thiophene were randomly copolymerized and yielded after the grafting of fullerene C 60 the <b>double</b> <b>cable</b> CoPTR-C. Second, the same monomers {{were used to}} synthesize a diblock copolymer with a block made from a random copolymerization of both monomers while the second block is pure poly(3 -hexylthiophene). After the grafting of fullerene, the block <b>double</b> <b>cable</b> CoPTBl-C was obtained. Both <b>double</b> <b>cable</b> copolymers were investigated through various characterization methods. NMR ID and 2 D experiments allowed the full structural characterization and {{the determination of the}} final composition of the copolymers. The thermal behavior was investigated by TGA and DSC measurements, indicating that the incorporation of fullerene increased the thermal stability of the materials. The optical properties of these <b>double</b> <b>cable</b> copolymers were investigated by UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results showed no interaction at ground-state between the donor and acceptor moieties and a quenching of fluorescence of the polythiophene main chains in solution. AFM analysis on drop-casted films showed the dependence of the morphology of the <b>double</b> <b>cable</b> systems (random or diblock) on the aggregation. © 2008 American Chemical Society...|$|R
