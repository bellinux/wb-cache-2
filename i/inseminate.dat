5|$|Diane {{remained}} {{in love with}} Victor, and stole his frozen sperm to artificially <b>inseminate</b> herself. Unbeknownst to her, Ashley had also stolen Victor’s sperm to <b>inseminate</b> herself. Diane gave birth to Christian Victor Newman, but was shocked to discover the sperm she’d stolen was that of Jack. Ashley had received Victor’s actual sperm sample and gives birth to Abby Carlton, whom she decides to pass off as Brad’s child. Victor and Nikki later reunite, and in 2002, Maxwell Hollister (Sam Behrens) attempts to destroy Victor, using his estranged wife, revealed to be Lorie Brooks, in his plot. Originally, Max attempted to lead a hostile takeover of Julia Newman Martin's design firm, which Victor prevented. Now, Max used Lorie to keep Victor and Nikki apart, but Lorie could not follow through, and a ruined Max ends up leaving town. Months after, Victor and Nikki remarry {{in front of all}} of their loved ones. Ashley reveals that Abby is in fact Victor’s daughter as she was diagnosed with cancer, and he welcomes her with open arms. After rescuing Nikki from a carjacker, Victor is diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Victor and Nikki's marriage slowly strained as he was caught up in taking Jabot Cosmetics away from Jack, dealing with NVP Retreats, and Nikki's campaign for State Senator, which resulted in an affair with her campaign manager David Chow. Victor and Nikki eventually divorce after six years in 2008. Soon after, Hope dies and Victor’s estranged son, now known as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), comes to Genoa City and works at Newman Enterprises.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the male}} and female in any particular species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to <b>inseminate</b> the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E
25|$|When a male finds a female, {{he climbs}} {{over her head}} over her opisthosoma onto her underside, where he inserts his pedipalps to <b>inseminate</b> her.|$|E
25|$|Workers are rarely, if ever, <b>inseminated.</b> None of {{the workers}} from pre-matrifilial and matrifilial colonies were {{observed}} by Keeping, M.G. (2002) to be <b>inseminated.</b> Overwintering gynes from Sterkfontein cave had the highest percent insemination. Lack of insemination has frequently {{been used as a}} criterion for distinguishing queens from workers in social wasps. All queens and nearly 98% of subordinate foundresses were <b>inseminated.</b> Workers may not be <b>inseminated</b> because they emerge over the period of the colony cycle when males are absent. <b>Inseminated</b> daughters were only recorded from late February onwards, coinciding with the period of male production. Of course, <b>inseminated</b> individuals are more likely to lay eggs and are seen as part of the reproductive caste.|$|R
25|$|In Xylocoris maculipennis, after a male traumatically <b>inseminates</b> another male, the {{injected}} sperm {{migrate to}} the testes.

25|$|Because {{of their}} motility, animal sexual {{behavior}} can involve coercive sex. Traumatic insemination, for example, {{is used by}} some insect species to <b>inseminate</b> females through a wound in the abdominal cavity—a process detrimental to the female's health.|$|E
25|$|Others {{have argued}} that the {{practice}} of traumatic insemination may have been an adaptation for males to circumvent female resistance to mating to eliminate courtship time, allowing one male to <b>inseminate</b> many mates when contact between them is brief; or that it evolved as a new development in the sperm competition as a means to deposit sperm as close to the ovaries as possible.|$|E
25|$|Voronoff's {{later work}} {{included}} transplants of monkey ovaries into women.

After cows had estrus synchronized, each was artificially <b>inseminated</b> with one straw of Angus semen plus one straw of Simmental semen; semen in one straw was thawed in warm water, the other in the <b>inseminating</b> gun. Calves produced indicated the fertilizing sperm. Of the 20 cows that conceived at the synchronized estrus, 16 conceived to warm water-thawed semen and 4 to semen thawed in the gun.

The percentage of PMNs on the endometrial surface and within histological sections was evaluated together {{with the presence of}} aerobic bacteria in the uterine lumen. For endometrial cytology, there was no significative difference on the number of inflammatory cells between bitches not <b>inseminated</b> (3. 05 ± 1. 74 PMNs) and those <b>inseminated</b> with fresh semen (3. 55 ± 1. 51 PMNs); There was a significative difference in both groups compared to the <b>inseminated</b> with semen plus extender (7. 80 ± 1. 67 PMNs) (p< 0. 05).

25|$|Courtship is not elaborate; {{the female}} must raise her wing {{to allow the}} male to couple with her. The moths remain in copula for up to an hour, but the {{transfer}} of the spermatophore is usually accomplished within 10 minutes. Male moths can <b>inseminate</b> more than one female. Multiple mating in females is possible, but uncommon, because the female stops releasing the attracting pheromone after mating. After mating, the females begin depositing the eggs.|$|E
25|$|Males {{of certain}} species have evolved mating {{behaviors}} {{in which they}} forcefully attempt to mate with and <b>inseminate</b> females, often employing grasping techniques. These male grasping devices exist to increase the duration of copulation and restrict females from mating with other males. They are in some ways a form of mate guarding. While some males have evolved different types of modifications to aid in grasping, others just grab females and attempt to force copulation.|$|E
25|$|Roughly a {{week after}} the nest is complete, the first larvae begin to hatch, and these will become adults {{approximately}} 30 days after hatching, marking the end of the pre-emergence phase {{and the beginning of the}} post emergence phase. It is at this point when the emergence of workers is largely dependent on the necessity to produce reproductive females that will become queens. Because of the fact that S. septentrionalis is a polygynous species, more than one queen will exist at a given time, and often the number of queens will fluctuate. When queen number is small, worker number will be high and thus females will grow ovaries that are well developed so that they may reproduce as queens. When queen number is high, worker number is small, and steps will be taken to <b>inseminate</b> females in order to keep them from reproducing, and they will become workers.|$|E

40|$|Black {{coloured}} queens were instrumentally <b>inseminated</b> with semen from yellow coloured drones, {{and were}} allowed to mate naturally in an area containing black drones. Since yellow body colour is dominant over black, any black coloured worker progeny would indicate additional natural mating of the mother-queen. Together 308 queens were investigated, and body colour of 188 300 workers was determined. Nine groups of queens were investigated. Queens of the control group mated solely naturally. The others were instrumentally <b>inseminated</b> either with 8 µl semen and treated with CO 2 or not, or were <b>inseminated</b> twice, with 4 µl of semen each time.

25|$|This {{method of}} {{insemination}} quickly gained popularity among dairy producers for several reasons. Dairy bulls are notoriously dangerous {{to keep on}} the average dairy facility. AI also {{makes it possible to}} speed the genetic improvement of the dairy herd because every dairy farmer has access to sperm from genetically superior sires. Additionally, AI has been shown to reduce spread of venereal diseases within herd that would ultimately lead to fertility problems. Many producers also find it to be more economical than keeping a bull. On the other hand, AI does require more intensive reproductive management of the herd as well as more time and expertise. Detection of estrus, becomes reliant on observation in the absence of bulls. It takes considerable expertise to properly <b>inseminate</b> a cow and high quality sperm is valuable. Ultimately, because dairy production was already a management intensive industry the disadvantages are dwarfed by the advantages of the AI for many dairy producers.|$|E
25|$|Male-to-male {{competition}} {{for access to}} females and for resources that the females require {{for themselves and their}} offspring is common and can explain the morphological phenotypic traits and behaviors, such as large body size, weapons, territoriality, and early sexual maturation that increase their possibilities of gaining access to the females. In many social insects, larger males are more competitive and tend to monopolize females or the resources that they need. In bees, females may choose males who are faster, more agile, or more persistent fliers. Sequestering of females and forced copulation may also favor large male size. Males with longer horns and mandibles can use them to fight, or for take over attempts when rivals are copulating. In beetle species, the male horns can be as long as the male’s body. Early sexually mature males can start their reproductive life before the rest of the male population. Under scramble competition to <b>inseminate</b> females, the early matured males are smaller but can be favored in some cases where courtship occurs on the ground and attain the highest reproductive success. Thus, in the fly Drosophila suboscura, smaller males are better than large males at tracking females during the courtship dance.|$|E

500|$|Pseudocopulation {{occurs when}} a flower mimics a female of a certain insect species, {{inducing}} the males to try to copulate with the flower. This is much like the aggressive mimicry in fireflies described previously, but with a [...] more benign outcome for the pollinator. This form of mimicry has been called Pouyannian mimicry, after Maurice-Alexandre Pouyanne, who first described the phenomenon. It is most common in orchids, which mimic females of the order Hymenoptera (generally bees and wasps), and may account for around 60% of pollinations. Depending on the morphology of the flower, a pollen sac called a pollinia {{is attached to the}} head or abdomen of the male. This is then transferred to the stigma of the next flower the male tries to <b>inseminate,</b> resulting in pollination. Visual mimicry is the most obvious sign of this deception for humans, but the visual aspect may be minor or non-existent. It is the senses of touch and olfaction that are most important.|$|E
500|$|Veterinary {{professor}} Byeong Chun Lee {{took over}} {{leadership of the}} team behind Snuppy. In 2008, Snuppy {{became involved in the}} first known successful breeding between cloned canines, after sperm taken from Snuppy was used to artificially <b>inseminate</b> two cloned females, which resulted in the birth of 10 puppies. Nine of the puppies survived. The SNU team, under Lee, have gone on to successfully clone over 30 dogs and five wolves. After successfully breeding the cloned wolves, Lee claimed that the ability to breed cloned canines makes it possible for working dogs which are usually sterilised before training, such as sniffer dogs and guide dogs, to reproduce. SNU, which claimed to own the patent for the process used to clone Snuppy, formed a license agreement with RNL Bio, a commercial pet cloning company. Hwang entered into a partnership with RNL Bio's competitor, BioArts International, which caused an ongoing legal battle into who owns the patent rights although Bio Arts withdrew from dog cloning in 2009.

50|$|In {{support of}} {{ejaculate}} adjustment, {{research has shown}} that a male typically increases the amount he <b>inseminates</b> sperm into his partner after they have been separated for a period of time. This is largely {{due to the fact that}} the less time a couple is able to spend together, the chances the female will be <b>inseminated</b> by another male increases, hence greater sperm competition. Increasing the number of sperm a male <b>inseminates</b> into a female acts to get rid of any rival male's sperm that may be stored within the female, as a result of her potential extra-pair copulations (EPCs) during this separation. Through increasing the amount he <b>inseminates</b> his partner following separation, a male increases his chances of paternal certainty. This increase in the number of sperm a male produces in response to sperm competition is not observed for masturbatory ejaculates.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the number of spermatozoa residing in the oviduct sperm-storage tubules (SST) and the relationship between these numbers and the number of spermatozoa embedded in the perivitelline layer of oviductal eggs after a single insemination of 200 X 104 spermatozoa. The SST of hens <b>inseminated</b> within one week before the expected onset of egg production were filled faster (4 h vs. 2 days) and possessed more spermatozoa (4. 1 vs. 2. 0 X 106) than the SST of hens <b>inseminated</b> after the onset of egg production. Furthermore, for hens in egg production, significantly fewer spermatozoa were recovered from the SST if the hen was <b>inseminated</b> within 2 h before or after oviposition than if <b>inseminated</b> more than 2 h before or after the oviposition. There was a strong positive correlation between the number of spermatozoa in the SST and the number of spermatozoa embedded in the perivitelline layer of the oviductal eggs (r = 0. 85, p 3 ̆c 0. 01). These data show that the population of spermatozoa actually accepted by the SST is quite small relative to the number of spermatozoa <b>inseminated</b> and that maximum sperm-storage is achieved when the hen is <b>inseminated</b> just prior to the onset of egg production. It is suggested that the sperm-storage capacity of the oviduct {{and the quality of the}} semen sample can be estimated on the basis of numbers of spermatozoa embedded in the egg penvitelline layer...|$|R
500|$|With a few exceptions, frogs use {{external}} fertilisation. The male grasps {{the female}} tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or {{in front of}} the back legs, {{or in the case of}} Epipedobates tricolor, around the neck. They remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm. Roughened nuptial pads on the male's hands aid in retaining grip. Often the male collects and retains the egg mass, forming a sort of basket with the hind feet. An exception is the granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously. The tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) exhibits internal fertilisation. The [...] "tail" [...] is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to <b>inseminate</b> the female.

40|$|Reproductive {{interactions}} between species can carry significant costs (e. g., wasted time, energy, and gametes). In traumatically <b>inseminating</b> insects, heterospecific mating costs may be intensified, with indiscriminate mating and damaging genitalia leading to damage or death.

Here {{we report on}} a cryptic species of traumatically <b>inseminating</b> plant bug, Coridromius taravao, living sympatrically with its sister species, Coridromius tahitiensis, in French Polynesia.
