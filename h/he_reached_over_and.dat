50|$|In {{the third}} season, Sean offers Quentin a limited {{partnership}} after Christian neglects {{to return to}} work after being attacked by the Carver. Initially, Christian refuses to accept having Quentin as an associate, but later changes his mind and supports the decision. A couple of episodes later, he and Sean go to a frat party together. They end up receiving fellatio from two college girls, during which Costa winks at Sean. This bothers Sean and he leaves the room. In the same episode Christian asks Costa to help take Kit McGraw off his hands because he is tired of the three-way relationship with her and Kimber Henry. While in bed with Kit on one side and Christian and Kimber on the other <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> touches Christian's buttocks. Costa later explains that he is bisexual, and assumed Christian was as well. After Sean briefly leaves the practice, Costa remains to assist Christian with surgeries. Later Christian believes that Costa is on drugs and calls Sean to assist with the facial transplant surgery they are working on. Sean later returns to the practice.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> {{secured the}} whiskey bottle. Kemp {{stared at the}} devouring {{dressing}} gown.

6000|$|Well, he run on, and on, and on, {{making up}} stuff about Hicksville and {{everybody}} in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and wondering how {{this was going to}} help me out of my scrape; and at last, still talking along, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off {{with the back of her}} hand, and says: ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{slipped out}} of his straps, shook himself, and felt the twisted arm. [...] "Nope. Sound as a dollar, thank you. And no kick to register, either." [...] <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> wiped his muddy hands on a low-bowed spruce. [...] "Just my luck; but I got a good rest, so what's the good of makin' a beef about it? You see, I tripped on that little root there, and slip! slump! slam! and slush!--there I was, down and out, and the buckle just out o' reach. And there I lay for a blasted hour, {{everybody}} hitting the lower path." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{surprise}} of Evans and the mate admitted of no concealment; but it passed unnoticed by their visitor, who, fidgeting in his seat, {{appeared to be}} labouring with some mysterious problem. After a long pause, during which all watched him anxiously, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> the table <b>and</b> shook hands with Evans again.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> to her <b>and</b> {{felt her}} arm at the biceps. The {{pressure}} of the encircling fingers was firm and honest, and Saxon thrilled to it. There was magic in this man-boy. She would have known only irritation had Bert or any other man felt her arm. But this man! IS HE THE MAN? she was questioning, when he voiced his conclusion.|$|R
5000|$|As Sutton {{recalled}} his breaking into Marvel, editor-in-chief Stan Lee ...looked at {{the stuff that}} I had brought in, was stuff that I had done in the service for Stars and Stripes in Tokyo. I think he was rather impressed {{by the fact that}} I had actually done a daily comic strip for two years. He didn't get many people who had done that. ... <b>He</b> just <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> pulled off this huge pile of blank paper. And he said, 'OK, do me a couple of Westerns and I'll see you next week. Have fun.' I remember that very well. 'Have fun.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suddenly Mr. Toad {{remembered that}} he had on his working clothes, which were very old, very dirty and very ragged. For just a minute he didn't know what to do. Then he dived under a cabbage leaf and began to pull off his old suit. But the old suit stuck! He {{was in such a}} hurry and so excited that he couldn't find the buttons. Finally he got his {{trousers}} off. Then <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> got hold of the back of his coat and tugged and hauled until finally he pulled his old coat off right over his head just {{as if it were a}} shirt.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I didn't allow it. I {{pushed him}} away, {{and when he}} laughed at me I told {{him that if he}} tried it again I would box his ears. Then, just after we had passed this place, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> caught hold of me and tried to pull me toward him. Then I boxed him, just as I had said I would. That made him furious, and he put on a burst of speed, and the next minute there was a terrible bump and a crash, and both of us were almost thrown out of the car. The wind-shield was broken and also, I think, the front axle, and he was {{scratched}} in several places. Oh, it was awful!" [...] And again Grace hid her face on Sam's shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly a great {{volume of}} sound filled the corridor, {{and the band}} burst forth into what many {{supposed}} to be [...] "The Watch on the Rhine." [...] Some people were plainly delighted; the veterans, once recovered from their surprise, shouted their reminiscences above the music, undismayed; Jethro held on to himself until the refrain, {{when he began to}} squirm, {{and as soon as the}} tune was done and the scattering applause had died down, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> grabbed Mr. Amasa Beard by the knee. Mr. Beard did not immediately respond, being at that moment behind logworks facing a rebel charge; he felt vaguely that some one was trying to distract his attention, and in some lobe of his brain was registered the fact that that particular knee had gout in it. Jethro increased the pressure, and then Mr. Beard abandoned his logworks and swung around with a snort of pain.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{his most}} memorable plays {{occurred}} during the 1980 NBA Finals, when he executed a seemingly impossible finger-roll behind the backboard. He drove past Lakers forward Mark Landsberger on the right baseline and went in for a layup. Then 7′2″ center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar crossed his way, blocking the route to the basket and forcing him outwards. In mid-air, {{it was apparent that}} Erving would land behind the backboard. But somehow <b>he</b> managed to <b>reach</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> score on a right-handed layup despite the fact that his whole body, including his left shoulder, was already behind the hoop. This move, along with his free-throw line dunk, {{has become one of the}} signature events of his career. It was called by Sports Illustrated, [...] "The, No Way, even for Dr J, Flying Reverse Lay-up". Dr J called it [...] "just another move".|$|R
60|$|About {{three o'clock}} {{of the morning}} after the great wedding-day, the Giant Tur-il-i-ra arrived at his castle gate. He had walked all the way home, and he felt in such a good humor that the road never seemed so short to him before. But, for some reason, he could not open the gate. There seemed to be an unusual number of locks and bolts, and the big key he carried did not seem to fit any of the {{numerous}} key-holes. <b>He</b> could easily <b>reach</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> undo the bolts, but the locks were too much for him; and, I am sorry to say, he got a little angry, and was about to take his club and smash his magnificent gate, when his wife, who had been sitting up for him, and had heard the noise he had been making, came down and let him in.|$|R
5000|$|The video {{opens with}} Takeru (the lead singer) in {{what appears to}} be an old {{abandoned}} warehouse or factory using a paper cutter to make counterfeit money. After finishing, he puts the bills away and smiles, and the words, [...] "Life is all good." [...] appear as subtitles {{on the bottom of the}} screen. <b>He</b> then <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> turns on a stereo, starting the song. The song plays, showing scenes of the band dressed in Oshare Kei costumes playing their instruments and singing apparently outside of the factory at night, surrounded by fog, dead plants, dirt, and litter with paper cut-outs of animals and colored balls suspended in the air around them. Scattered images of a ventilation fan spinning, and close-ups of Takeru on a chair surrounded by subwoofers and singing into a large lollipop are shown as well. At the [...] of the song, Takeru throws the fake money into the air and continues to sing as it falls on the band like rain. After the song ends, the video cuts back to the room with the paper cutter, this time with all the band members in it counting the fake money. Their speech replaced with English subtitles, the band exclaims that they will now be able to buy anything and throw handfuls of the counterfeit bills into the air. As they continue to celebrate in silence, the English phrase, [...] "Is there the value that you can't buy for money?" [...] appears in the center of the screen and the video fades to black.|$|R
60|$|The nest {{was simply}} a great {{platform}} of sticks. When Farmer Brown's boy reached it, he found {{that he could not}} get where he could look into it, so <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> felt inside. Almost at once his fingers touched something that made him tingle all over. It was an egg, a great big egg! There was no doubt about it. It was just as hard for him to believe as it had been for Blacky the Crow to believe, when he first saw those eggs. Farmer Brown's boy's fingers closed over that egg and took it out of the nest. Mrs. Hooty swooped very close, and Farmer Brown's boy nearly dropped the egg as he struck at her with his stick. Then Mrs. Hooty and Hooty seemed to lose courage and withdrew to a tree near by, where they snapped their bills and hissed.|$|E
6000|$|I {{did not see}} the {{application}} and told him so. For reply <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said, [...] "The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow. That is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout, if he sprout at all, there's some promise, and I wait till the ear begins to swell." [...] He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on gravely, [...] "You were always a careful student, and your case book was ever more full than the rest. And I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker. Even if you have not kept the good practice, {{let me tell you that}} this case of our dear miss is one that may be, mind, I say may be, of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam, as your people say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises. Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We learn from failure, not from success!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Most of {{the spectators}} were too {{attentive}} to the play to have many thoughts for each other; but before long I noticed a lady who evidently had an eye for her neighbours {{as well as for}} the table. She was seated about half-way between my friend and me, and I presently observed that she was trying to catch his eye. Though at Homburg, as people said, [...] "one could never be sure," [...] I yet doubted whether this lady were one of those whose especial vocation it was to catch a gentleman's eye. She was youthful rather than elderly, and pretty rather than plain; indeed, a few minutes later, when I saw her smile, I thought her wonderfully pretty. She had a charming gray eye and a good deal of yellow hair disposed in picturesque disorder; and though her features were meagre and her complexion faded, she gave one a sense of sentimental, artificial gracefulness. She was dressed in white muslin very much puffed and filled, but a trifle the worse for wear, relieved here and there by a pale blue ribbon. I used to flatter myself on guessing at people's nationality by their faces, and, as a rule, I guessed aright. This faded, crumpled, vaporous beauty, I conceived, was a German--such a German, somehow, as I had seen imagined in literature. Was she not a friend of poets, a correspondent of philosophers, a muse, a priestess of aesthetics--something in the way of a Bettina, a Rahel? My conjectures, however, were speedily merged in wonderment as to what my diffident friend was making of her. She caught his eye at last, and raising an ungloved hand, covered altogether with blue-gemmed rings--turquoises, sapphires, and lapis--she beckoned him to come to her. The gesture was executed with a sort of practised coolness, and accompanied with an appealing smile. He stared a moment, rather blankly, unable to suppose that the invitation was addressed to him; then, as it was immediately repeated with a good deal of intensity, he blushed to the roots of his hair, wavered awkwardly, and at last made his way to the lady's chair. By the time he reached it he was crimson, and wiping his forehead with his pocket-handkerchief. She tilted back, looked up at him with the same smile, laid two fingers on his sleeve, and said something, interrogatively, to which he replied by a shake of the head. She was asking him, evidently, if he had ever played, and he was saying no. Old players have a fancy that when luck has turned her back on them they can put her into good-humour again by having their stakes placed by a novice. Our young man's physiognomy had seemed to his new acquaintance to express the perfection of inexperience, and, like a practical woman, she had determined to make him serve her turn. Unlike most of her neighbours, she had no little pile of gold before her, but she drew from her pocket a double napoleon, put it into his hand, and bade him place it on a number of his own choosing. He was evidently filled with a sort of delightful trouble; he enjoyed the adventure, but he shrank from the hazard. I would have staked the coin on its being his companion's last; for although she still smiled intently as she watched his hesitation, there was anything but indifference in her pale, pretty face. Suddenly, in desperation, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> laid the piece on the table. My attention was diverted at this moment by my having to make way for a lady with a great many flounces, before me, to give up her chair to a rustling friend to whom she had promised it; when I again looked across at the lady in white muslin, she was drawing in a very goodly pile of gold with her little blue-gemmed claw. Good luck and bad, at the Homburg tables, were equally undemonstrative, and this happy adventuress rewarded her young friend for the sacrifice of his innocence with a single, rapid, upward smile. He had innocence enough left, however, to look round the table with a gleeful, conscious laugh, in the midst of which his eyes encountered my own. Then suddenly the familiar look which had vanished from his face flickered up unmistakably; it was the boyish laugh of a boyhood's friend. Stupid fellow that I was, I had been looking at Eugene Pickering! ...|$|E
5000|$|However, as {{he later}} admitted, his {{outspokenness}} and feuding with Rockies general manager Ray Miron did not endear Cherry to management. While Cherry {{did much to}} motivate the players, goaltending was still the team's weakness as Miron refused to replace Hardy Åström, whom Cherry dubbed [...] "The Swedish Sieve". Cherry recalled one game where his players had taken ten shots on goal without scoring, but Åström then conceded a goal from the opponent's first shot and so was yanked from net. Of course, Cherry didn't help things when, after watching defenseman Mike McEwen ignore him and refuse to come off during a game, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> the boards <b>and</b> manhandled McEwen to the bench. When the Toronto Maple Leafs' Lanny McDonald was abruptly traded to Colorado, McDonald found himself at the centre of another power struggle between Cherry and Miron. Cherry was sympathetic {{to the fact that}} McDonald's wife was less than two weeks away from giving birth (as Cherry had not been present when his own wife Rose had given birth), and gave McDonald permission to leave the team on off-days to return to his wife in Toronto. However, general manager Miron did not approve of McDonald's leave. This became another factor that led to Cherry's contract not being renewed after one season.|$|R

50|$|Actress Ellen Burstyn {{recalled}} that evening:Late in the evening, I {{wandered into the}} greenroom and saw Lee sitting next to Anna, watching the taping on the monitor. I {{sat next to him}} and we chatted a little. Lee wasn't one for small talk, so I didn't stay long. But before I got up, I said, 'Lee, I've been asked to run for president of Actors Equity.' <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> patted me on the back, 'That's wonderful, dahling. Congratulations.' Those were the last words he ever said to me.... Two days later, early in the morning, I was still asleep when the door to my bedroom opened. I woke up and saw my friend and assistant, Katherine Cortez, enter the room and walk toward me.... 'We just got a call. Lee Strasberg died.' No, no, no, I wailed, over and over. 'I'm not ready', and pulled the covers over my head. I had told myself that I must be prepared for this, but I was not prepared. What was I to do now? Who would I work for when I was preparing for a role? Who would I go to when I was in trouble?.... His memorial service was held at the Shubert Theater where A Chorus Line was playing. Lee's coffin was brought down the aisle and placed center stage. Everybody in the theater world came - actors, writers, directors, producers, and most, if not all of, his students. He was a giant of the theater and was deeply mourned. Those of us who had the great good fortune to be fertilized and quickened by his genius would feel the loss of him {{for the rest of our}} lives.|$|E
