5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. <b>Dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|On a {{laboratory}} scale, lead(II) nitrate provides {{one of two}} convenient and reliable sources of <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide.</b> By carefully drying lead(II) nitrate and then heating it in a steel vessel, nitrogen dioxide is produced, which dimerizes into the desired compound.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen forms nine {{molecular}} oxides, some {{of which}} were the first gases to be identified: N2O (nitrous oxide), NO (nitric oxide), N2O3 (dinitrogen trioxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), N2O4 (<b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide),</b> N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide), NO3 (nitrogen trioxide), N4O (nitrosylazide), and N(NO2)3 (trinitramide).)3 |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1145–8 |doi=10.1002/anie.201007047}} All are thermally unstable towards decomposition to their elements. One other possible oxide that has not yet been synthesised is oxatetrazole (N4O), an aromatic ring.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> {{could be}} {{regarded}} as two nitro groups (-NO2) bonded together. It forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> is a {{powerful}} oxidizer that is hypergolic (spontaneously reacts) upon contact with various forms of hydrazine, which makes the pair a popular bipropellant for rockets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> {{can also}} be made through the {{reaction}} of concentrated nitric acid and metallic copper. This synthesis is more practical in a laboratory setting and is commonly used as a demonstration or experiment in undergraduate chemistry labs. The oxidation of copper by nitric acid is a complex reaction forming various nitrogen oxides of varying stability which depends on the concentration of the nitric acid, presence of oxygen, and other factors. The unstable species further react to form nitrogen dioxide which is then purified and condensed to form <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as nitrogen tetroxide, is the chemical compound N2O4. It is a useful reagent in chemical synthesis. It forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia {{can also}} be used to make {{compounds}} in reactions which are not specifically named. Examples of such compounds include: ammonium perchlorate, ammonium nitrate, formamide, <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide,</b> alprazolam, ethanolamine, ethyl carbamate, hexamethylenetetramine, and ammonium bicarbonate.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s {{and early}} 1950s, aniline was used with nitric acid or <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> as rocket fuel for small {{missiles}} and the Aerobee rocket. The two fuel components are hypergolic, producing a violent reaction on contact. Aniline was later replaced by hydrazine.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, {{after the}} UR-500 booster began flying, the Chelomei Bureau offered a counterproposal to Korolev's N-1 in the UR-700, a Saturn V-class booster with nine F-1 sized engines powered by <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> and UDMH. Korolev was an outspoken {{opponent}} of hypergolic propellants {{due to their}} toxicity, often citing the 1960 Nedelin catastrophe {{as evidence of the}} danger posed by them, and had also objected to the UR-500 for the same reason.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen tetroxide {{is used as}} an {{oxidizer}} in one of {{the more}} important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature. In early 1944 research on the usability of <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> as an oxidizing agent for rocket fuel was conducted by German scientists, although the Nazis only used it to a very limited extent as an additive for S-Stoff (fuming nitric acid). It became the storable oxidizer of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. It is a hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel. One of the earliest uses of this combination was on the Titan family of rockets used originally as ICBMs and then as launch vehicles for many spacecraft. Used on the U.S. Gemini and Apollo spacecraft and also on the Space Shuttle, it continues to be used as stationkeeping propellant on most geo-stationary satellites, and many deep-space probes.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas is a {{rapid and}} {{effective}} sterilant for use against {{a wide range}} of microorganisms, including common bacteria, viruses, and spores. The unique physical properties of NO2 gas allow for sterilant dispersion in an enclosed environment at room temperature and ambient pressure. The mechanism for lethality is the degradation of DNA in the spore core through nitration of the phosphate backbone, which kills the exposed organism as it absorbs NO2. This degradation occurs at even very low concentrations of the gas. NO2 has a boiling point of 21°C at sea level, which results in a relatively high saturated vapour pressure at ambient temperature. Because of this, liquid NO2 may be used as a convenient source for the sterilant gas. Liquid NO2 is often referred to by the name of its dimer, <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> (N2O4). Additionally, the low levels of concentration required, coupled with the high vapour pressure, assures that no condensation occurs on the devices being sterilized. This means that no aeration of the devices is required immediately following the sterilization cycle. NO2 is also less corrosive than other sterilant gases, and is compatible with most medical materials and adhesives.|$|E

2500|$|Some aprotic systems also undergo such dissociation, such as <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> into nitrosonium and nitrate, {{antimony}} trichloride into dichloroantimonium and tetrachloroantimonate, and phosgene into chlorocarboxonium and chloride: ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{variants}} of hydrazine {{that are used}} as rocket fuel are monomethylhydrazine, (CH3)NH(NH2) (also known as MMH), and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, (CH3)2N(NH2) (also known as UDMH).

These reactions are extremely exothermic, and the burning is also hypergolic (it starts burning without any external ignition).|$|E

Its main engine, which is a {{derivative}} of the system used on India's communications satellites, uses the bipropellant combination monomethylhydrazine and <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> to achieve the thrust necessary for escape velocity from Earth. It was also used {{to slow down the}} probe for Mars orbit insertion and, subsequently, for orbit corrections.|$|E
2500|$|Main {{propulsion}} comprises 24 paired bipropellant 10N thrusters, {{with four}} pairs of thrusters {{being used for}} delta-v burns.

2500|$|When {{used as a}} propellant, <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> {{is usually}} {{referred}} to simply as 'Nitrogen Tetroxide' and the abbreviation 'NTO' is extensively used. Additionally, NTO is often used {{with the addition of}} a small percentage of nitric oxide, which inhibits stress-corrosion cracking of titanium alloys, and in this form, propellant-grade NTO is referred to as [...] "Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen" [...] or [...] "MON". Most spacecraft now use MON instead of NTO; for example, the Space Shuttle reaction control system used MON3 (NTO containing 3wt%NO).|$|E
2500|$|Nitrous oxide {{also may}} be used in a {{monopropellant}} rocket. In the presence of a heated catalyst, [...] will decompose exothermically into nitrogen and oxygen, at a temperature of approximately [...] Because of the large heat release, the catalytic action rapidly becomes secondary, as thermal autodecomposition becomes dominant. In a vacuum thruster, this may provide a monopropellant specific impulse (Isp) of as much as 180 s. While noticeably less than the Isp available from hydrazine thrusters (monopropellant or bipropellant with <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide),</b> the decreased toxicity makes nitrous oxide an option worth investigating.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tendency}} of N2O4 to reversibly break into NO2 {{has led to}} research into its use in advanced power generation systems as a so-called dissociating gas. [...] "Cool" [...] <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> is compressed and heated, causing it to dissociate into nitrogen dioxide at half the molecular weight. [...] This hot nitrogen dioxide is expanded through a turbine, cooling it and lowering the pressure, and then cooled further in a heat sink, causing it to recombine into nitrogen tetroxide at the original molecular weight. [...] It is then much easier to compress to start the entire cycle again. [...] Such dissociative gas Brayton cycles {{have the potential to}} considerably increase efficiencies of power conversion equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The Lunar Modules used Aerozine 50 (fuel) and <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> (oxidizer) propellants, {{chosen for}} {{simplicity}} and reliability; they ignite hypergolically – upon contact – {{without the need}} for a spark. These propellants produce a nearly transparent exhaust. The same fuel was used by the core of the American Titan II rocket. The transparency of their plumes is apparent in many launch photos. The plumes of rocket engines fired in a vacuum spread out very quickly as they leave the engine nozzle (see above), further lessening their visibility. Finally, rocket engines often run [...] "rich" [...] to slow internal corrosion. On Earth, the excess fuel burns in contact with atmospheric oxygen, enhancing the visible flame. This cannot happen in a vacuum.|$|E

The originally planned power was to be 660 W at 1.5 AU but a faulty connection has reduced the amount of power available by 30%, to about 460 W. This loss of power does significantly impact the science return of the mission. Power is stored in three lithium-ion batteries with a total capacity of 64.8 Ah for use during eclipses. The power is fully regulated at 28 V, and the Terma power module (also used in Rosetta) is redundant. Main propulsion consists of 24 bipropellant 10N thrusters.
