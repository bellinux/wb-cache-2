40|$|Study {{objective}} - The aim of {{the study}} was to investigate the electrophysiological effects of acetylcholine in Purkinje <b>fibres</b> surviving infarction. Design - Infarction in canine hearts was produced by coronary occlusion. Ischaemic tissue was removed and surviving Purkinje <b>fibres</b> were compared for effects of increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (1 - 100 μM) with control Purkinje <b>fibres</b> from normal hearts and normal Purkinje <b>fibres</b> treated with barium. Subjects - Experimental animals were mongrel dogs of either sex, weight 10 - 15 kg, n = 14 (control), 9 (infarction group), 11 (Ba treated group). Measurements and main results - Acetylcholine caused concentration dependent shortening of action potential duration in normal Purkinje <b>fibres</b> and in <b>fibres</b> surviving infarction, but had no effect when potassium conductance was decreases with Ba. Acetylcholine induced a small hyperpolarisation in normal Purkinje <b>fibres</b> and in <b>fibres</b> surviving infarction perfused with a 4 mM potassium solution without affecting action potential amplitude or dV/dt(max). Reduction in K concentration to 1 and 2 mM caused a greater depolarisation of diastolic potential in normal <b>fibres</b> than in <b>fibres</b> surviving infarction or Ba treated <b>fibres.</b> Acetylcholine produced hyperpolarisation under these conditions in normal <b>fibres</b> only. Acetylcholine decreased automaticity in normal <b>fibres</b> only at high concentration (100 μM). A lesser effect was seen in Ba treated <b>fibres</b> and in <b>fibres</b> surviving infarction. Conclusions - Since Ba treated Purkinje <b>fibres</b> had similar action potential characteristics to those seen in Purkinje <b>fibres</b> surviving infarction and responded in the same way to the modifications of K concentration, a decrease in K conductance might be the underlying mechanism for some of the electrophysiological changes in <b>fibres</b> surviving infarction. The results also suggest that after 24 h ischaemia, surviving Purkinje <b>fibres</b> have a different sensitivity to acetylcholine from normal <b>fibres.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
