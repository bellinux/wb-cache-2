Instead he used the kite to collect some electric charge from a storm cloud, showing that lightning was electrical. On October 19 in a letter to England with directions for repeating the experiment, Franklin wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{measurement}} purposes, the Earth {{serves as}} a (reasonably) constant potential reference against which other potentials can be measured. An <b>electrical</b> <b>ground</b> system should have an appropriate current-carrying capability {{to serve as an}} adequate zero-voltage reference level. In electronic circuit theory, a [...] "ground" [...] is usually idealized as an infinite source or sink for charge, which can absorb an unlimited amount of current without changing its potential. Where a real ground connection has a significant resistance, the approximation of zero potential is no longer valid. Stray voltages or earth potential rise effects will occur, which may create noise in signals or if large enough will produce an electric shock hazard.|$|E
2500|$|Cars {{can build}} up static charge by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire {{compounds}} contain enough carbon black {{to provide an}} <b>electrical</b> <b>ground</b> which prevents charge build-up. Newer [...] "high mileage" [...] tires use more silica and can increase the buildup of static. A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a conductive part of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put {{into contact with the}} metallic filler neck of the vehicle. Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this filling operation are below the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the static discharge causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gas cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the loose fit between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich vapor concentration in the ullage (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the nozzle, hose, swivels and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point. The Petroleum Equipment Institute has recorded incidents of static-related ignition at refueling sites since early 2000.|$|E
50|$|For {{building}} <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> {{systems or}} earthing systems {{there is a}} low resistance conductor bonding the metalwork and this is connected to a groundbed. The electrodes for <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> are often called ground rods and are often made from steel with a copper clad surface - typically 1 to 2m long and 20 mm in diameter. These are driven vertically {{into the ground and}} bonded together with bare copper wire.|$|R
40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> is {{probably}} the most over-looke~ ignored, and misunderstood part of electrical energy source circuits. A faulty ground circuit am have lethal potential to the worker, can damage electrical equipment" or components, and can lead to higher consequences. For example, if the green-wire ground return circuit (in a three-wire power circuit) is fhulty or is open (someone cut the prong, etc.) a person can receive an electrical shock by touching the conductive enclosure, and the result can be lethal. If high explosives are involved m the process, sneak electrical energy paths may cause electrical threats that lead to ignition, which results to higher damage consequences. Proper <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> is essential to mitigate the electrical hazard and improve work place safety. A designer must ask the question, "What grounding is proper?" continuously through a process design and in its application. This question must be readdressed with any process change, including tiom layout, equipment, or procedure changes. <b>Electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> varies ilom local work area grounding to the multi-point grounding found in large industrial areas. These grounding methods become more complex when the designer adds bonding to the grounding schemes to mitigate electrostatic discharge (ESD) and surfkce potentials resulting from lightning currents flowing through the facility structure. Figure 1 shows a typical facility power distribution circuit and the current flow paths resulting ffom a lightning discharge to a facility. This paper discusses <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> methods and their characteristics and identifies potential sneak paths into a process for hazardous electrical energy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAcupuncture in Oriental {{medicine}} {{has been widely}} used as a core therapeutic method due to its minimal side-effects and therapeutic efficacy. However, the electrical response to acupuncture stimulation (ERAS) has not been clearly studied under acupuncture conditions that might affect the efficacy of acupuncture therapy. In this study, the ERAS was objectively investigated by measuring meridian electric potentials (MEPs) when the <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> conditions of the operator and subject were varied, and when the insulation conditions of acupuncture needle were varied. MEPs between Sang-geoheo (ST 37) and Ha-geoheo (ST 39) of the Stomach Meridian (ST) were measured by stimulating Jok-samni (ST 36) with an acupuncture needle. For non-insulated acupuncture stimulation (NIAS), the average MEP peak was 148. 6 ± 20. 6 when neither the operator nor the subject were electrically grounded, 23. 1 ± 8. 8 when the subject only was electrically grounded, 348 ± 76. 8 when the operator only was electrically grounded, and 19. 9 ± 4. 7 when both the operator and the subject were electrically grounded. The MEPs presented various magnitudes and patterns depending on the <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> conditions. The MEP pattern was {{very similar to that}} of the charge and discharge of a capacitor. For insulated acupuncture stimulation (IAS), the average MEP peak was 20 ± 4 in all <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> conditions, which is not a significant electric response for acupuncture stimulation. In terms of electricity, this study verified that acupuncture therapy might be affected by acupuncture conditions such as (1) the <b>electrical</b> <b>grounding</b> condition of the operator and the subject and (2) the insulation condition of the acupuncture needle...|$|R
2500|$|Gauge {{symmetry}} {{is closely}} related to charge conservation. Suppose that there existed some process by which one could briefly violate conservation of charge by creating a charge q at a certain point in space, 1, moving it to some other point 2, and then destroying it. We might imagine that this process was consistent with conservation of energy. We could posit a rule stating that creating the charge required an input of energy E1=qV1 and destroying it released E2=qV2, which would seem natural since qV measures the extra energy stored in the electric field because of the existence of a charge at a certain point. Outside of the interval during which the particle exists, conservation of energy would be satisfied, because the net energy released by creation and destruction of the particle, qV2-qV1, would be equal to the work done in moving the particle from 1 to 2, qV2-qV1. But although this scenario salvages conservation of energy, it violates gauge symmetry. Gauge symmetry requires that the laws of physics be invariant under the transformation , which implies that no experiment should be able to measure the absolute potential, without reference to some external standard such as an <b>electrical</b> <b>ground.</b> But the proposed rules E1=qV1 and E2=qV2 for the energies of creation and destruction would allow an experimenter to determine the absolute potential, simply by comparing the energy input required to create the charge q at a particular point in space in the case where the potential is [...] and [...] respectively. The conclusion is that if gauge symmetry holds, and energy is conserved, then charge must be conserved.|$|E
