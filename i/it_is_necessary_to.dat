5|$|In this stage, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> inquire into, firstly, {{the object}} of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of {{differentiation}} against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration {{the object of}} the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers {{the object of the}} statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E

5|$|The {{management}} of narcosis {{is simply to}} ascend to shallower depths; the effects then disappear within minutes.

5|$|Unlike the laminar {{boundary}} layer equations, the presence of two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. {{the inner and outer}} scaling) has made finding a universal similarity solution for the turbulent {{boundary layer}} difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans both regions of the flow, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> asymptotically match the solutions from both regions of the flow. Such analysis will yield either the so-called log-law or power-law.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of trespass to goods; while trespass to the person requires intent, the requirements for trespass to goods have never been tested in court. The common remedy is damages, which may be awarded regardless of if any actual harm is suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable {{if he could have}} reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences are those of statutory authority, consent, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> interfere with the goods, or jus tertii.|$|E

From the very beginning, the IPA and its President Yuri Savenko had to take on human rights functions in addition to educational ones: first, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> uncover the ideological basis on which the Soviet psychiatry carried out its punitive activities; second, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> develop legal norms which would forever prevent such abuses; third, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> show that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not society that needs to be protected from the mentally ill, but the ill need to be protected from society as a whole, not only from the authorities; fourth, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> overcome rigidity and inhumane nature of modern domestic psychiatry detached from its old roots and, at the same time, artificially isolated from Western humanistic trends.|$|R
5|$|More {{problematic}} for non-commercial plants is the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves).

Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E
