40|$|The flow of {{students}} {{from one country to}} another has increased dramatically in the last 10 - 20 years. Initially, non-native students were in small numbers and were expected to adapt <b>to</b> the dominant <b>teaching</b> paradigm, but with overseas numbers increasingly significantly in more recent years, adjustments to courses and modules – from <b>design,</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>to</b> assessment – are required and have been investigated globally (Nieto and Booth 2010). Of those studying overseas, many only study for one year – as a foreign exchange (for example ERASMUS students) or a top-up route (final year or taught masters). Such a one-year scenario is the most challenging for all, particularly in terms of language ability and an ability to develop effective communication skills within a multi-cultural environment quickly.
