40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{preliminary results}} {{and analysis of}} a cantilever load test on two types hollow-core composite insulators and summarizes {{the response of the}} insulators to different types of loading. The tube of the insulator is a cylindrical shell of fibers-glass in a resin-based matrix with aluminum flange end fittings. The integrity of the tube-flange connection is checked for leaks, slip, damage, and bond degradation. Tests indicate that he actual cantilever load causing failure was much higher than the rated SML provided by the manufacturers. While there were occasionally sounds indicating that something {{was going on in the}} insulator prior to catastrophic failure, there was no change in the <b>force</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> of the test. While there were slight changes in the damping and frequency of the insulators as the loading increased, the changes were small and did not indicate degradation of the insulator. Two failure modes were observed: failure of the lower flange and shear failure at the tube-flange connection. In one case the shear failure was in the bond to the flange and in the other it was in the tube adjacent to the bonding material. In the unbonded tube, there was clear friction damping. In bonded tubes, the presence of friction damping needs further investigatio...|$|E

The specimens failed at the shear bond eighty percent of the time. The positions in a wall where the bricks are attached to the mortar when constructing the wall, produces a weaker brick mortar bond than, where the mortar is applied to the bricks. The characteristic shear strength equations obtained for a double and a single wall through experimentation, gives shear strength values respectively of 4. 2 and 2. 8 times greater than the recommended equations of the European and South African codes of masonry design.

50|$|When {{a spring}} is {{compressed}} or stretched from its resting position, it exerts an opposing force approximately proportional to its change in length (this approximation breaks down for larger deflections). The rate or spring constant of a spring {{is the change}} in the force it exerts, divided by the change in deflection of the spring. That is, it is the gradient of the <b>force</b> versus <b>deflection</b> <b>curve.</b> An extension or compression spring's rate is expressed in units of force divided by distance, for example lbf/in or N/m. A torsion spring is a spring that works by twisting; when it is twisted about its axis by an angle, it produces a torque proportional to the angle. A torsion spring's rate is in units of torque divided by angle, such as N·m/rad or ft·lbf/degree. The inverse of spring rate is compliance, that is: if a spring has a rate of 10 N/mm, it has a compliance of 0.1 mm/N. The stiffness (or rate) of springs in parallel is additive, as is the compliance of springs in series.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to calculate strain energy for a rubber cylinder using fi-nite element analysis (FEA) and compare using analytical equations for simple exten-sion, bonded tension, and bonded compres-sion. Constitutive laws were derived for sim-ple extension including linear, large defor-mation, and hyperelastic material models. The strain energy or work done on the sys-tem was calculated by using finite element analysis (FEA) software. The work done on the system is calculated by using a trapezoi-dal rule for numerical integration of the <b>force</b> versus <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> over small trapezoid regions. The FEA model consisted of a 2 -D axisymmetric model of a rubber cylinder representing shape factors of 0. 5, 2, and 8. The FEA model used 8 node iso-parametric structural solid elements with and without large deformation effects, 8 node mixed u-p hyperelastic solid elements, and 8 node hyperelastic solid elements with reduced in-tegration. The neo-Hookean material model was used for the hyperelastic elements. Classical analytical equations were com-pared to the FEA results with agreement de-pending on the loading mode.

30|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} for detecting localized defects such as edge knots using a bending <b>deflection</b> <b>curve.</b> The coordinates of a bottom edge (edgeline) of an unloaded piece of lumber are extracted from a digital image, and a bending <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> is obtained from the displacement of the edgeline of the lumber using a digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Depending on the knots within the beam, the bending <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> is shifted from the curve of a defect-free beam. The measured bending <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> is regressed to a theoretical curve by elementary beam theory. A finite element method (FEM) model of the beams including defects as simplified knot structure has been performed. Comparison between the bending experiment and FEM analysis shows that cross-sectional reductions cause characteristic variations in the bending <b>deflection</b> <b>curves</b> depending on the position of encased knots, and local grain distortions cause variations in the curves depending on the direction of spike knots. Using the residual variance between the measured <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> and a polynomial regression curve, {{it is possible to}} detect knots at which failures initiate.|$|R

The instantaneous modulus of the specimen at a given time, which is given by the gradient of the <b>force</b> versus <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> when the strained specimenis subjected to a further deformation {{at the time of}} measurement. The importance of these two parameters {{lies in the fact that}} the decay of the force on the specimen under constant strain is a good estimate of the cleave of the chemical bonds on the rubber network with time while the instantaneous modulus is an indication of the influence of the secondary network formed by the cleaved bonds on the rubber. The theories of stress relaxation and the equipment available for stress relaxation Measurements are discussed in detail it: this work in addition to the details of the proposed technique. It should be mentioned that especial emphasis was made here to reduce the cost of equipment when compared with the standard equipments available so that this technique could be made more popular among quality control as well as research workers. In this respect, the proposed equipment was designed in such a way that the load measuring device, which is the most expensive component in the set up could be shared among number of specimens under obesrvations, without disturbing their deformations. Number of specimens prepared under similar conditions were tested using the proposed equipment to study its reproducibility. It was found that the decay of the force on the strained specimen with time was showing excellent reproducibility even though the instantaneous modulus did not show such behavior.

For the {{research}} of beam’s deformation, material mechanics uses equation of small <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> which neglects 1 st order derivative of deflection and regards bending moment M is merely a function of abscissa x, and then gets the approximate solution of vertical displacement.

This paper takes a slightness beam from temperature controlling device as an example and shows detailed process of mathematical modeling and solving. For iteration, firstly governing equations are founded, then an initial value is put into it {{to work out a}} new value, next see the new value as a new initial value and calculate again, by doing the operation repeatedly steady-state solution will be got in the end.

Physically-based polynomial models, b-splines, and other arbitrarily parameterized equations are used to describe facial and lip contours, though with varied degrees of complexity and resolution. This study examined the constraints and conditions necessary to utilize a standard Euler-Bernoulli beam as an effective model for the human lip.

Beam characteristics such as cross sectional shape, length, and elasticity were investigated in order to define deflection models for four different beam configurations: a clamped prismatic beam, a simply supported prismatic beam, a clamped tapered beam, and a simply supported tapered beam.
