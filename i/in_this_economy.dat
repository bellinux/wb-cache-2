500|$|The Fame {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, based on 13 reviews. Matthew Chisling from Allmusic called the album [...] "a well-crafted sampling of feisty anti-pop in high quality", and wrote that it [...] "fails {{to come up}} short on funky sounds to amuse fans of this dance genre." [...] Nicole Powers of URB complimented its [...] "irony-laden lyrics, delivered in a style that owes {{a little something to}} Gwen Stefani," [...] as well as the album's [...] "deluxe ditties". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "remarkably (and exhaustingly) pure in its vision of a world in which nothing trumps being beautiful, dirty, and rich. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>economy,</b> though, her high-times escapism has its charms". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian found it [...] "packing an immensely addictive melody or an inescapable hook, virtually everything sounds like another hit single", and predicted that it [...] "certainly sounds like it could be big." [...] Daniel Brockman from The Phoenix wrote that [...] "Gaga ups the ante in terms of catchy songwriting and sheer high-in-the-club-banging-to-the-beat abandon." [...] Ben Hogwood of musicOMH praised Gaga's [...] "blend of sassy attitude, metallic beats and sharp, incisive songwriting", elements which he felt are integral to [...] "creating pop music".|$|E

Would you take the deal?" [...] Zimmerman concluded that more Americans should study Chinese, but [...] "on our own terms, making sure that it also reflects our best civic language of freedom, open discussion, and democracy." [...] Chinese history professor Jonathan Lipman from Mount Holyoke College expressed the dilemma of accepting CI funding thus: [...] "By peddling a product we want, namely Chinese language study, the Confucius Institutes bring the Chinese government into the American academy in powerful ways. The general pattern is very clear. They can say, 'We'll give you this money, you'll have a Chinese program, and nobody will talk about Tibet.' <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>economy,</b> turning them down has real costs." [...] Professor Terry Russell at the University of Manitoba questioned the Hanban's real motivation, fearing the university {{would not be able}} to organize certain activities judged [...] "sensitive" [...] to the Chinese, such as bringing the Dalai Lama onto campus. He said, [...] "'We have a real conflict of our principles of academic freedom,' with the potential to have a faculty version of Chinese history and a Confucius Institute version being taught on campus." [...] According to Cameron Morrill, president of the University of Manitoba Faculty Association, [...] "It is inappropriate to allow any government, either foreign or domestic, control over a university classroom, regardless of how much money they offer." [...] The university later decided against taking Chinese government money to set up CIs.|$|E
