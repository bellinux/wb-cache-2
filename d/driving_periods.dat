Attentional Drift is an insidious form of distraction where primary task attention is slowly eroded by secondary tasking. It can occur in either very low or very high cognitive demand situations. Recent studies have shown eye fixation duration and glance duration measures have close correlations to attentional demand in visual tasks. In this study, participants completed two 20 -minute <b>driving</b> <b>periods</b> in a STISIMtm based simulator wearing a head-mounted eye-tracking system. Eye fixation measures recorded in a single-task low mental demand test did not show a significant increase in eye fixation duration over time in all participants. A second test incorporating secondary task through varied types of conversation did show that eye fixation duration values were affected by thee added cognitive workload. Eye fixation measures showed statistically significant changes in duration as direct result of varying secondary cognitive demand. It is concluded that further experimentation incorporating eye blink-rate factors, utilization of a fixed-base eye-tracking system with a gaze dwell time function and significantly lengthened test runs is both feasible and warranted.

In this experiment, student participants were trained to drive a low-fidelity computer simulated passenger train on an intercity route. Vigilance task performance was measured as the distance along the track between the detection point of a safety critical event and the event object position, and was obtained while manipulating two IVs: between-subjects variable - Level-Of-Automation (LOA), having four levels: nil, low, intermediate, and high; and within-subjects variable -time-on-task, having two levels: safety critical event onset before 10 (Early) and after 60 (Late) minutes of driving.

We define substorm-like activations as periods where the hourly average AL is below − 200 [*]nT. Using the OMNI data set, we demonstrate that there are limiting solar wind speed, interplanetary magnetic field magnitude, and driving electric field values below which substorm-like activations (AL[*]<[*] 200 [*]nT, intensification and decay of the electrojet) do not occur. These minimum parameter values are V[*]<[*] 266 [*]km/s, B[*]<[*] 1. 4 [*]nT, and E[*]<[*] 0. 025 [*]mV/m; such low values are observed less than 1 % of the time. We also show that for {{the same level of}} driving solar wind electric field, the electrojet intensity is smaller (by few tens of nT), and the electrojet resides farther poleward (by over 1 °) during extended quiet solar driving in 2009 than during average solar activity conditions. During the solar minimum period in 2009, we demonstrate that substorm-like activations can be identified from the IMAGE magnetometer chain observations during periods when the hourly average IL index is below − 100 [*]nT. When the hourly IL activity is smaller than that, which covers 87 % of the nighttime observations, the electrojet does not show coherent behavior.

This result may also be true for other industrialised countries. Demands on comfort and prevention of noise induced fatigue during long <b>driving</b> <b>periods</b> is becoming an important car purchaser requirement.

40|$|It {{is likely}} that the early Universe was pervaded by a whole host of scalar fields which are {{ubiquitous}} in particle physics models and are employed everywhere from <b>driving</b> <b>periods</b> of accelerated expansion to the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetries. Just as these scalar fields are important from a particle physics point of view, they can also have serious implications for the evolution of the Universe. In particular in extreme cases their dynamical evolution can lead to the failure of the synthesis of light elements or to exceed the dark matter bound in contrast to observation. These scalar fields are not however isolated systems and interact with the degrees of freedom which comprise their environment. As such two interrelated effects may arise; fluctuations and dissipation. These effects, which are enhanced at finite temperature, give rise to energy transfer between the scalar field and its environment and as such should be taken into account for a complete description of their dynamical evolution. In this thesis we will look at these effects within the inflationary era in a scenario termed warm inflation where amongst other effects, thermal fluctuations can now act as a source of primordial density perturbations. In particular we will show how a model of warm inflation based on a simple quartic potential can be brought back into agreement with Planck data through renormalizable interactions, whilst it is strongly disfavoured in the absence of such effects. Moving beyond inflation, we will consider the effect of fluctuation-dissipation dynamics on other cosmological scalar fields, deriving dissipation coefficients within common particle physics models. We also investigate how dissipation can affect cosmological phase transitions, potentially leading to late time periods of accelerated expansion, as well as presenting a novel model of dissipative leptogenesis...|$|E

Increasing drivers’ own awareness of their drowsiness levels using such tools may also reduce risk of accidents. The study examined the effects of real-time blink-velocity-derived drowsiness feedback on driver performance and levels of alertness in a military setting. A sample of 15 Army Reserve personnel (1 female) aged 21 – 59 (M= 41. 3, SD= 11. 1) volunteered to being monitored by an infra-red oculography-based Optalert Alertness Monitoring System (OAMS) while they performed their regular driving tasks, including on-duty tasks and commuting to and from duty, for a continuous period of 4 – 8 weeks. For approximately half that period, blink-velocity-derived Johns Drowsiness Scale (JDS) scores were fed back to the driver in a counterbalanced repeated-measures design, resulting in a total of 419 <b>driving</b> <b>periods</b> under “feedback” and 385 periods under “no-feedback” condition. Overall, the provision of real-time feedback resulted in reduced drowsiness (lower JDS scores) and improved alertness and driving performance ratings. The effect was small and varied across the 24 -h circadian cycle but it remained robust after controlling for time of day and driving task duration. Both the number of JDS peaks counted for each trip and their duration declined in the presence of drowsiness feedback, indicating a dynamic pattern that is consistent with a genuine, entropy-reducing feedback mechanism (as distinct from random re-alerting) behind the observed effect. Its mechanisms and practical utility have yet to be fully explored. Direct examination of the alternative, random re-alerting explanation of this feedback effect is an important step for future research...|$|E

Research indicates stimulants improve some cognitive functions but impair driving ability, and stimulant use is common among truck drivers. In addition, stimulant use {{is linked to}} collisions. Research to date on collision culpability among stimulant-positive truck drivers is sparse and presents with limitations due to small sample sizes {{and a lack of}} control over confounding variables. The present study investigated the influence of stimulants on unsafe driving actions (UDAs) in collisions. The odds of being stimulant-positive were expected to be statistically significantly higher for drivers who committed at least one UDA that led to a collision. Using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database, the author compared truck drivers who had at least one UDA recorded to a control group of drivers who had none. Logistic regression was used in order to account for the influence of confounding variables (age, previous driving record, and other drug-use) and to calculate the odds ratio of being stimulant-positive {{in the event of an}} UDA. Results indicate that the odds of being stimulant-positive are statistically significantly greater for truck drivers who committed an UDA (OR 2. 29, 95 % CI 1. 7 - 3. 0). In addition, Pearson?s Chi-square models indicated stimulant-positive truck drivers were significantly more likely to have a history of infractions on their driving record and to have other drugs in their system. The results suggest stimulants negatively influence driving ability and truck drivers should not use stimulants while driving. In addition, the results support the inclusion of previous driving record and other drug use data as control variables for future studies. Despite this, the finding that 0. 58 % of truck drivers in the FARS database tested positive for stimulants suggests that stimulant use is not common...|$|E

Focal point {{of the project was}} how coupling of truck convoys can be implemented on German roads taking into account the new task demands of the truck driver. Part of the new task will be the persistent confrontation with highly small gaps during automated <b>driving</b> <b>periods.</b> The distance between participating motor vehicles of the convoy is declared by less than ten meters when driving with 100 km/h (0, 3 sec). Common time headways are 1, 0 sec; the German law recommends time headways of 1, 8 sec. Driving with small gaps of the mentioned size has not been experienced by the driver yet. Thus, we addressed the consequences for non automated manual driving after driving in electronic coupled convoys. Three studies in a passenger car driving simulator were accomplished. As expected, we found risky driving behaviour in form of choosing too short time headways. Driving with small gaps {{as a consequence of the}} coupling period may be mediated by means of several factors and may involve different psychological processes: Coupling with short gaps over time may mediate the effect. The coupling and decoupling procedure itself may also have a short term effect. In addition, coupling per se may have its own effects.

There were no changes in insulin and T 3 levels in either periods; the lowest T 4 concentration was observed during the <b>driving</b> <b>period.</b> The serum T 4 concentration increased after 56 d of post-driving, and it was greater than the concentrations detected on the other days. The highest levels of cortisol were identified after 28 d of post-driving. An increase in IGF-I concentration was observed after 56 and 84 d of post-driving. Moving cattle by driving does not alter the weight of the animals and weight gain occurs during the post-driving period due to an increase in the T 4 and IGF-I levels...|$|R
