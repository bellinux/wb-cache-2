5000|$|... 'Dry rot' is an 18th-century {{term that}} {{generally}} described {{what is now}} called brown rot. The term was used because the damage was present in cured or <b>dried</b> <b>timber</b> of ships and buildings and was thought to be caused by internal ‘fermentations’ rather than water. This contributes to the Etymological fallacy that dry rot requires less or no water than other species that use the brown rot decay mechanism.|$|E

50|$|Although hügelkulture beds {{can safely}} retain water in {{light-duty}} applications (for example, conserving the moisture of rain that {{falls on the}} bed), creating heavy-duty rainwater retention areas behind hügelkulture beds on contour, to catch surface runoff from surrounding areas, can be dangerous. Some designers conflate the hügelkultur bed's appearance with that of solid earthworks, but hügelkultur beds cannot predictably control large amounts of stormwater {{in the way that}} solid earthworks can. Whereas embankment dams or the hillsides of swales can be relied on to hold back many thousands of gallons of water for weeks to allow it to seep into the ground, and berms can slow runoff, hügelkultur beds are different in two ways: earthworks have no buoyant core (whereas hügelkultur mounds contain logs), and the soil that they are made of is compacted. If fresh or <b>dried</b> <b>timber</b> is used in the bed, it may become buoyant in the water-saturated substrate, bursting from the soil covering and releasing all the sitting water through a breach. This can be an issue for years, until the wood is sufficiently rotten and infused with water. Another consideration is that hügelkultur beds will degrade, shrinking over time into much lower mounds of soft, rich soil. This means that the retention area will have less depth as time goes on, but it also means that the uncompacted soil will remain a threat to breaching even if the logs become saturated.|$|E

40|$|The {{strengths}} of conventionally and high temperature dried spruce timber have been compared. Material from both southern and northern Sweden {{was included in}} the study. A total number of 1050 specimens (50 mm x 150 mm x 5 m) were dried by using five different drying methods and then strength tested. The drying temperatures varied between 70 °C and 125 °C. The material was also strength graded by using a Cook Bolinder grading machine and the yield in class C 30 was evaluated. Fracture energy (perpendicular to the grain direction) was measured for 25 % of the tested material. The results show a decreased bending strength by, on the average, 5 % for timber dried at 125 °C compared to conventionally <b>dried</b> <b>timber</b> (at 70 °C). For the 5 th percentile value (characteristic value) corresponding decrease was 13 %. The tensile strength was reduced more than the bending strength. The stiffness was not affected by high temperature drying, neither in bending nor in tension. The results also indicate that material from northern Sweden is more affected by high temperature drying than material from southern Sweden. No difference in fracture energy was found for the material dried by using the different drying methods. However, the maximum force measured during the fracture energy testing was significantly lower for the high temperature dried material. This indicated that the tensile strength perpendicular to the grain decreased during high temperature drying. The bending strength was lower after machine strength grading (class C 30) for the high temperature <b>dried</b> <b>timber</b> compared to the conventionally <b>dried</b> <b>timber.</b> This was expected as the grading machine measures stiffness and the stiffness is, as shown, not affected by high temperature drying...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThe {{impact of}} the {{variability}} in timber properties has been a challenge for companies involved in drying timber, which have to handle these variations {{and at the same}} time meet the requirements stated in the Australian/New Zealand Standard for the assessment of <b>dried</b> <b>timber</b> quality (2001). The definition of quality considered in this study is to both minimize the dispersion of the final moisture contents in <b>dried</b> <b>timber</b> boards, and to reduce cracking/checking. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that the timber properties of plantation timber appear to be more variable compared with the properties of old growth or regrowth timber. Therefore, this thesis focuses on measuring the amount of variability of timber properties by conducting drying experiments using timber boards taken from different locations within a single tree and between trees, for regrowth and plantation blackbutt timber (Eucalyptus pilularis Sm.). The quantified variabilities were then used to develop optimized timber drying schedules that are intended to dry regrowth and plantation blackbutt boards as quickly as possible (highest productivity) without cracking (quality loss) in the presence of large biological variability. Blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis Sm.) was the chosen species for this thesis because of its abundance in New South Wales. It is considered to be one of the most important eucalypts for planting in NSW. It has superior growth and high survival rates compared with other eucalyptus species, and the timber is marketable. Lastly, conventional kiln drying was considered in this thesis compared with other drying methods such as air drying and solar kilns due to (arguably) better control of the drying conditions and faster throughput in conventional drying. The higher costs of conventional kiln drying are compensated, relative to open—air drying, by the reduction in stock level and faster turnaround of green to <b>dried</b> <b>timber.</b> Firstly, an overview of previous work on the development and evaluation of different drying schedules was given. Previous work either developed optimized drying schedules to minimize the dispersion of the final moisture contents, or reduced cracking/checking. No schedule has been developed to satisfy both aspects of quality. In addition, only one report has taken into consideration biological variability in the development of an optimized drying schedule, but this approach has not been tested experimentally. In addition, the information on the variability of biological parameters was very limited, was assumed to be normally distributed, and the parameters were assumed to be uncorrelated with one another. There is little information about the variability in timber properties with respect to drying, including how strongly they are correlated. This thesis has particularly addressed this aspect of the problem. Drying experiments using conventional kiln drying were conducted. The properties of two regrowth blackbutt logs (36 boards) and two plantation blackbutt logs (24 boards), have been measured and analysed for the within—tree variation of timber properties. In a separate set of experiments, two boards were taken from each log, from a total of 12 regrowth logs and 10 plantation logs, to study the between—tree variability of the timber properties of blackbutt timber. The timber properties measured consisted of the basic density, the initial moisture content, the diffusion coefficient, the failure strain, the failure stress, the modulus of elasticity and the shrinkage. The amount of cracking or checking and the dispersion of final moisture contents were assessed. 90...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium and Zinc (Al-Zn) alloy {{coated steel}} sheet (JIS G 3141) {{was used as}} a heat {{reflector}} in timber dry kiln. After six months continuous service at 110 oC in moist condition, the heat reflector is corroded. Failure analysis method was used to analyze this corrosion phenomena.

The elemental composition of corroded heat reflector that were detected by SEM-EDS are sulphur, chloride, calcium, and potassium.
