25|$|Physics in non-inertial {{reference}} frames was historically {{treated by}} a coordinate transformation, first, to an <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> performing the necessary calculations therein, and using another {{to return to}} the non-inertial reference frame. In most such situations, the same laws of physics can be used if certain predictable fictitious forces are added into consideration; an example is a uniformly rotating reference frame, which can be treated as an <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> if one adds a fictitious centrifugal force and Coriolis force into consideration.|$|E

25|$|The speed, {{and thus}} the kinetic energy of a single object is frame-dependent (relative): it can take any non-negative value, by {{choosing}} a suitable inertial frame of reference. For example, a bullet passing an observer has kinetic energy in the reference frame of this observer. The same bullet is stationary {{from the point of}} view of an observer moving with the same velocity as the bullet, and so has zero kinetic energy. By contrast, the total kinetic energy of a system of objects cannot be reduced to zero by a suitable choice of the <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> unless all the objects have the same velocity. In any other case the total kinetic energy has a non-zero minimum, as no <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> can be chosen in which all the objects are stationary. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the system's invariant mass, which is independent of the reference frame.|$|E

50|$|It {{was argued}} against the conventionality of the one-way {{speed of light}} that this concept {{is closely related to}} dynamics, the laws of motion and <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frames.</b> Salmon {{described}} some variations of this argument using momentum conservation, from which it follows that two equal bodies at the same place which are equally accelerated in opposite directions, should move with the same one-way velocity. Similarly, Ohanian argued that <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> are defined so that Newton's laws of motion hold in first approximation. Therefore, since the laws of motion predict isotropic one-way speeds of moving bodies with equal acceleration, and because of the experiments demonstrating the equivalence between Einstein synchronization and slow clock-transport synchronization, it appears to be required and directly measured that the one-way speed of light is isotropic in inertial frames. Otherwise, both the concept of <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> and the laws of motion must be replaced by much more complicated ones involving anisotropic coordinates.|$|R

25|$|According to {{the theory}} of relativity, due to their {{constant}} movement and height relative to the Earth-centered, non-rotating approximately <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> the clocks on the satellites are affected by their speed. Special relativity predicts that the frequency of the atomic clocks moving at GPS orbital speeds will tick more slowly than stationary ground clocks by a factor of , or result in a delay of about 7 μs/day, where the orbital velocity is v = 4km/s, and c = the speed of light. The time dilation effect has been measured and verified using the GPS.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} {{involved are}} not always so trivial. Special relativity predicts that an observer in an <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> doesn't see objects he would describe as moving faster {{than the speed of}} light. However, in the non-inertial reference frame of Earth, treating a spot on the Earth as a fixed point, the stars are observed to move in the sky, circling once about the Earth per day. Since the stars are light years away, this observation means that, in the non-inertial reference frame of the Earth, anybody who looks at the stars is seeing objects which appear, to them, to be moving faster than the speed of light.|$|E
25|$|An {{inertial}} frame of reference, in classical physics, is {{a frame of}} reference in which bodies, whose net force acting upon them is zero, are not accelerated, that is they are at rest or they move at a constant velocity in a straight line. In analytical terms, it is a frame of reference that describes time and space homogeneously, isotropically, and in a time-independent manner. Conceptually, in classical physics and special relativity, the physics of a system in an {{inertial frame}} have no causes external to the system.

25|$|At the time, it {{was known}} that Maxwell's equations, when applied to moving bodies, led to asymmetries (moving magnet and {{conductor}} problem), {{and that it had}} not been possible to discover any motion of the Earth relative to the 'light medium'. Einstein puts forward two postulates to explain these observations. First, he applies the principle of relativity, which states that the laws of physics remain the same for any non-accelerating frame of reference (called an <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame),</b> to the laws of electrodynamics and optics as well as mechanics. In the second postulate, Einstein proposes that the speed of light has the same value in all inertial frames of reference, independent of the state of motion of the emitting body.|$|E
25|$|Einstein (1908) tried– as a {{preliminary}} {{in the framework}} of special relativity– also to include accelerated frames within the relativity principle. In the course of this attempt he recognized that for any single moment of acceleration of a body one can define an <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> in which the accelerated body is temporarily at rest. It follows that in accelerated frames defined in this way, the application of the constancy of the speed of light to define simultaneity is restricted to small localities. However, the equivalence principle that was used by Einstein in the course of that investigation, which expresses the equality of inertial and gravitational mass and the equivalence of accelerated frames and homogeneous gravitational fields, transcended the limits of special relativity and resulted in the formulation of general relativity.|$|E
25|$|The {{motion of}} a body can only be {{described}} relative to something elseother bodies, observers, or a set of space-time coordinates. These are called frames of reference. If the coordinates are chosen badly, the laws of motion may be more complex than necessary. For example, suppose a free body that has no external forces acting on it is at rest at some instant. In many coordinate systems, it would begin to move at the next instant, even though there are no forces on it. However, a frame of reference can always be chosen in which it remains stationary. Similarly, if space is not described uniformly or time independently, a coordinate system could describe the simple flight of a free body in space as a complicated zig-zag in its coordinate system. Indeed, an intuitive summary of inertial frames can be given as: In an <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> the laws of mechanics take their simplest form.|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} {{that there is a}} {{connection}} between the fundamental forces of electromagnetism and gravitation. This connection occurs because of: 1) the fundamental significance of the finite and invariant velocity of light in <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> in the special theory, and 2) the reliance of the general theory of relativity upon the special theory of relativity locally in spacetime. The connection between the fundamental forces of electromagnetism and gravitation follows immediately from these two points. A brief review is provided of: 1) the role of the finite and invariant velocity of light in <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> in the special theory, and 2) certain fundamental concepts of the general theory, including its reliance on the special theory locally.

25|$|The Alcubierre metric {{defines the}} warp-drive spacetime. It is a Lorentzian {{manifold}} that, if interpreted {{in the context}} of general relativity, allows a warp bubble to appear in previously flat spacetime and move away effectively faster than lightspeed. The interior of the bubble is an <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> and inhabitants suffer no proper acceleration. This method of transport does not involve objects in motion at speeds faster than light with respect to the contents of the warp bubble; that is, a light beam within the warp bubble would still always move faster than the ship. Because objects within the bubble are not moving (locally) faster than light, the mathematical formulation of the Alcubierre metric is consistent with the conventional claims of the laws of relativity (namely, that an object with mass cannot attain or exceed the speed of light) and conventional relativistic effects such as time dilation would not apply as they would with conventional motion at near-light speeds.|$|E
25|$|Newton's laws {{of motion}} {{describe}} {{the motion of}} an object in an inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference. When Newton's laws are transformed to a rotating frame of reference, the Coriolis force and centrifugal force appear. Both forces are proportional to {{the mass of the}} object. The Coriolis force is proportional to the rotation rate and the centrifugal force is proportional to its square. The Coriolis force acts in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and to the velocity of the body in the rotating frame and is proportional to the object's speed in the rotating frame (more precisely, to the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation). The centrifugal force acts outwards in the radial direction and is proportional to the distance of the body from the axis of the rotating frame. These additional forces are termed inertial forces, fictitious forces or pseudo forces. They allow the application of Newton's laws to a rotating system. They are correction factors that do not exist in a non-accelerating or <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{exploring}} the equivalence {{of gravity and}} acceleration {{as well as the}} role of tidal forces, Einstein discovered several analogies with the geometry of surfaces.
