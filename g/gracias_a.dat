5|$|Since Alvarado's {{supporters}} {{had been}} confirmed {{in the town}} council of <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios, and used obscure legalistic arguments to refuse Cáceres' authority, he withdrew to a nearby Indian village and plotted to overthrow the town council. The Spanish infighting encouraged the local Indians in their defiance of the invaders. Cáceres launched a coup at dawn early in 1537, entered <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios with twenty well-armed soldiers and imprisoned the town council, including Gonzalo de Alvarado. Cáceres declared Montejo as governor of Honduras-Higueras, and named himself as lieutenant governor and captain-general. He met little opposition from {{the majority of the}} Spanish citizens, and appointed a new town council.|$|E
5|$|Cáceres left <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios {{under the}} command of Xuárez de Ávila, and {{launched}} punitive expeditions against the emboldened native resistance. He penetrated the mountainous region of Cares, around the Peñol de Cerquín, and was moderately successful against fierce indigenous resistance. He penetrated eastward to the Comayagua valley and brought an extensive region under nominal Spanish control.|$|E
5|$|Juan de Chávez {{headed for}} the Valley of Maniani, which had been {{proposed}} by Cerezeda as {{a good place for}} a new town. It is likely that the Spanish chose the Indian town of Maniani as the location for the new Spanish settlement. On 20 July 1536, Pedro de Alvarado sent instructions to found the new city, to be called <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios, to provide better communication between Honduras and Guatemala. Pedro de Alvarado used the town of Tencoa as a base of operations, and sent his brother Gonzalo with 40 Spanish soldiers, and an unspecified number of indigenous allies, to help establish the new town. Alvarado appointed the members of the town council, and assigned 100 Spanish citizens to inhabit it. The natives around <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios where not completely subjugated, however, and there were violent indigenous rebellions in the province until around 1539. As at San Pedro, Alvarado annulled all previous encomiendas in the region and reassigned them. Gonzalo de Alvarado had been exploring the central region around Siguatepeque, the Tinto River and Yoro, successfully dealing with native resistance and collecting supplies for San Pedro. He had about a dozen cavalry and fifteen or so infantry under his command, and joined up with ten more soldiers under Gaspar Xuárez de Ávila, who was to serve as his lieutenant. They proceed to <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios with the legal documentation establishing its formal existence.|$|E

5|$|Montejo {{then set}} out to pacify the north coast, leaving Xuárez de Ávila {{commanding}} <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios. He first went to San Pedro to present his formal documents of governorship. He was recognised as governor on 16 April, and the following day he annulled all encomiendas issued by Pedro de Alvarado in both the district of San Pedro and in that of <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios; he then re-partitioned the province to his own soldiers and supporters. Montejo then sent Alonso de Reinoso with about a hundred soldiers into the mountains around San Pedro to put down native resistance. Montejo marched to Naco, where previous campaigns by Cerezeda and Alvarado had left a large indigenous population dispersed from their settlements and hostile to the encroaching Spanish. Victory was rapid, and many native rulers came to swear allegiance to Montejo. They implored him to protect the trade route to Yucatán, and offered their loyalty in return. Montejo accepted their supplications, and considered a large stretch of the north coast to be at last conquered, and under effective Spanish control. He applied the same moderate treatment to the natives that had been so successful around <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios, with similar results; many returned to their villages and the encomienda system began to function.|$|E
5|$|The {{column of}} sixteen Spaniards {{retreating}} from Xocorro were ambushed at Guaxeregui and killed to a man. The only {{survivor of the}} expedition was a seriously wounded African slave. The reinforcements sent from Comayagua to the Peñol were also attacked in Cares, and had to fight their way through to join the Spanish at the Peñol, suffering considerable hardship. The citizens of Santa María de Comayagua appealed to Montejo for help, and he sent a dozen mixed cavalry and infantry, who managed {{to break through the}} hostile natives encircling the settlement, and reinforce the town, where they were cut off from further Spanish assistance. Montejo was left with only eleven soldiers, and returned to <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios to protect the colonists there, who included women and children. The Indians killed isolated Spaniards wherever they could find them. The natives, seeing the success of their fortress at Cerquín, started construction of a similar fortress near <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios, and gathered a great quantity of supplies in storehouses there. Montejo urgently needed to halt their progress, but was unable to attack directly. Instead, he sent an African servant who managed to set the storehouses ablaze. The dismayed Indians of that district then sued for peace. A local Indian ruler called Mota plotted to attack <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios, but the plan was betrayed to Monetejo. In a lighning raid, Mota was seized and taken back to Gracias as a prisoner, only to escape and resume his plans for an assault. Montejo eventually discovered his hiding place and launched another rapid raid, and kept him hostage in Gracias under close guard as guarantor of his people, thus defusing the immediate threat against <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios.|$|E

5|$|Montejo {{travelled}} overland from Mexico {{with his}} considerable expedition, which included soldiers, Mexican auxiliaries, provisions and livestock; {{he sent a}} smaller detachment by sea, with additional supplies {{as well as his}} family and household. He arrived in Santiago de Guatemala early in 1537, where he purchased more provisions, arms, and livestock, and recruited more soldiers. The new provisions included cattle, sheep and pigs, crossbows, arquebuses, and gunpowder. He now had between 80 and 100 Spanish soldiers, including veterans of Yucatán. He arrived in <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios towards the end of March 1537, while Cáceres was still in the Comayagua valley. The seaborne detachment fared less well; after resupplying in Cuba, it was plundered by pirates with little loss of life, but most of the provisions were taken. With what could be salvaged, they put into Puerto de Caballos in the spring of 1537, where there were met by Montejo. The strong combined Spanish force now in Honduras-Higueras placed Montejo in a solid position, both militarily and politically. Montejo was installed as governor without opposition on 24 March at <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios. He released the imprisoned members of the former town council, and sought their support for continued conquest.|$|E
5|$|The same {{tropical}} {{wave that}} {{led to the formation of}} Julia moved off the western coast of Africa on September11, leading to the development of a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on September23 about 565mi (910km) east of Cabo <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios. Steered west to west-northwest by a subtropical ridge to its north, the depression steadily organized, intensifying into Tropical Storm Matthew six hours after formation and attaining peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) by 18:00UTC on September23, an intensity it maintained while making just south of Cabo <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios an hour later. The system briefly emerged into the Gulf of Honduras on September25 before making a second landfall north-northeast of Monkey River Town, Belize, with winds of 40mph (65km/h) around 15:00UTC. The system weakened quickly once inland, falling to a tropical depression by 18:00UTC and degenerating into a remnant low by 12:00UTC on September26. The remnant low turned southwest and dissipated twelve hours later.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado's subjugation of Honduras proved superficial, {{and largely}} limited to Higueras. His {{conquest of the}} Naco valley and the lower Ulúa River firmly {{established}} a Spanish presence there, but beyond that Spanish control was fragile. Expeditions had penetrated deeply across Honduras, and distant native rulers had come to offer homage to the Spanish Crown. The settlement at <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios was not as secure as it had appeared when Alvarado left, and no effective assistance {{had been sent to}} Trujillo. Many native rulers, who had been cowed by Alvarado's formidable reputation and military skill, rose in rebellion as soon as he left the province. Alvarado had also encouraged the enslavement of natives that fought against the Spanish, and their subsequent sale, as well as general harsh treatment of the indigenous population; this produced considerable resentment among the Indians, and left them susceptible to rebellion. Many natives resisted passively, by not providing supplies or labour to their encomenderos. Continued slave raids, and ferocious treatment {{at the hands of the}} Achi Maya auxiliaries increased their hatred and resistance, and many Indians abandoned their settlements and fled to the mountains and forests. The greater part of the districts of San Pedro and <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios were at war, and the Spanish position was again precarious.|$|E

Its central part follows the outline of a medieval road, Via Francisca, documented in 1057. Its current name was approved in 1932. Before 1867, it was known as Travesera, with the older spelling and no reference to the neighbourhood, since <b>Gràcia</b> was <b>an</b> independent village.

5|$|As a {{developing}} tropical cyclone over the Leeward Islands, Anna produced strong winds over Grenada, though damage {{was limited to}} some crops, trees, and telephone poles. Other islands experienced gusty winds, but no damage. Passing just north of Venezuela, the hurricane produced strong winds over the country, peaking as high as 70mph (115km/h). Strong winds caused widespread damage in northern Honduras. Throughout the country, at least 36homes were destroyed and 228were damaged. Severe damage in the <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios Department left hundreds of people homeless. Additionally, high winds toppled approximately 5,000coconut trees. Overall, Anna caused a fatality and $300,000in damage (1961USD), primarily in Central America.|$|E
5|$|By summer 1537, Montejo {{believed}} that Higueras {{had been almost}} completely pacified, with very few casualties amongst either the Spanish or the natives. <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios and San Pedro were more secure, and many Indians had returned to their villages, encouraged by Montejo's moderate policies. In reality, only the areas around the Spanish settlements had been thoroughly conquered, and in the remoter areas {{the vast majority of}} the natives were still hostile to the Spanish, and determined to resist. In contrast to other provinces, the Spanish were unable to recruit reliable native auxiliaries to assist their conquest.|$|E

5|$|Gonzalo de Alvarado {{and his men}} {{decided to}} remain; the area was {{apparently}} well-populated enough to provide worthwhile tribute, {{and the existence of}} precious metal deposits in the region had already been established by earlier forays. Alvarado decided to found the new town of <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios at Opoa, rather than at the nearby site that had been set aside by Chávez. In late 1536, Gonzalo de Alvarado finally founded the new town, assigning officials as had been designated by his brother. Although 100 citizens had been assigned by Pedro de Alvarado, in reality it had about 40 upon its foundation. The town only remained at Opoa for a brief period, before it was transferred to a new site. Gonzalo and his men campaigned to impose their control over a wide area, penetrating as far as the Comayagua valley. Although claiming conquest of a wide region, Gonzalo had too few soldiers to effectively control it. Native resistance was such that the colonists were soon threatened by starvation, and the natives refused to serve the Spanish. San Pedro was in a similar situation, and was unable to provide any kind of relief to <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios. The colonists appealed to Maldonado in Guatemala for assistance, and were informed that Francisco de Montejo would soon be taking up governorship, and would provide any assistance necessary.|$|E
5|$|In 1544, the Spanish {{established}} the Audiencia de los Confines in <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios (now Gracias, in Lempira Department, {{and not to}} be confused with the cape of the same name). They selected this location in western Honduras for its central location in Central America; it was a centre for mining with a high indigenous population. The Audiencia was established as the administrative centre governing Honduras, Chiapas, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, Tabasco, and Yucatán. It was thought that this location would support the Audiencia of Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1537, Montejo sent {{reinforcements}} to Cáceres, who {{was still}} in the fertile Valley of Comayagua. By late spring or early summer, the valley had been completely conquered. In December 1537, under orders from Montejo, Alonso de Cáceres founded the town of Santa María de Comayagua; it was sited in a strategic position half-way between the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. Cáceres then distributed the Indian settlements in encomienda.

5|$|Montejo {{immediately}} {{sought to}} curb the worst excesses of the Spanish, and impressed upon the colonists the need to treat the natives fairly, and within the law. He sent many of the Achi Maya auxiliaries back to Guatemala due to their depredations among the generally peaceful Chontal Maya of the Sula littoral. The moderation of Montejo's actions encouraged considerable numbers of natives {{to return to their}} villages, especially around <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios, and the encomienda system began to function as was intended, which greatly alleviated the constant struggle for provisions.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after this first encounter, on 14 August 1502, Columbus arrived on the {{mainland}} of Honduras. He dropped anchor at a place he named as Punta Caxinas, afterwards generally known as the Cape of Honduras, near the modern town of Trujillo. He claimed possession of the territory for the king of Spain, and the coastal inhabitants greeted him in a friendly manner. After this he sailed eastward along the coast, struggling against gales and storms for a month, until the coast turned southward along {{what is now the}} east coast of Honduras, and he entered calmer waters. The Spanish named this point Cabo <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios, giving thanks for their liberation from the storms. Colombus sailed on southwards as far as Panama, before turning back into the Caribbean Sea to be wrecked off Jamaica, before being rescued and taken to Hispaniola, and from there returning to Spain.|$|E
5|$|About {{two months}} into the siege of the Peñol de Cerquín, the {{majority}} of Spanish soldiers in Honduras were concentrated around the fortress. Small groups were scattered elsewhere, and both <b>Gracias</b> <b>a</b> Dios and Santa María de Comayagua were dangerously vulnerable, with almost no soldiers left there. Seeing {{the vulnerability of the}} Spanish positions across the greater province, Lempira declared a general uprising. The whole region south of the Peñol rose up, as well as neighbouring parts of El Salvador around San Salvador and San Miguel, where they caused serious damage to the Spanish. The Comayagaua Valley joined the revolt, as did the mountain regions around San Pedro, and outlying areas around Trujillo.|$|E
