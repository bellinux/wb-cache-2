25|$|Even though Clinton roughly {{received}} 3.1 {{million more}} votes than Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis had four years earlier, the Democrats recorded a 2.6 percentage point decrease in {{their share of}} the popular vote compared to 1988 due to the higher turnout. His 43% share of the popular vote was the second-lowest for any winning candidate in the 20th century after Woodrow Wilson in 1912 (41.8%). President Bush's 37.5% was the lowest percentage total for a sitting president seeking re-election since William Howard Taft, also in 1912 (23.2%); <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one, the 1912 election was also a three-way race (that time between Taft, Woodrow Wilson, and Theodore Roosevelt). It was also the lowest percentage for a major-party candidate since Alf Landon received 36.5% of the vote in 1936. Bush had a lower percentage of the popular vote than even Herbert Hoover, who was defeated in 1932 (39.7%). However, none of these races included a major third candidate. As of the 2016 election, Bush has been the last president voted out of office after one term, as Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama were all re-elected to second terms in office.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Hiruma {{has been well}} received by manga readers, and as the series continued {{he went on to}} become one of the most popular characters among the Eyeshield 21 reader base, having consistently placed near the top of the Weekly Shōnen Jump character popularity polls of the series. In the first poll he placed second, behind Sena, but in another two he ranked first. He was also chosen by the readers as the character who would win an [...] "Evil Showdown" [...] against Agon Kongo, as well as the best quarterback in the series. In an interview, Atsushi Tamura said about Hiruma: [...] "I look <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> guy"; and stated that he [...] "think there is a lot of other people who want to do the Hiruma's role". Several pieces of merchandise based on Hiruma have also been released, including decals and statues of ceramic and resin.|$|E
500|$|Most of xx was {{recorded}} from late December to late January before McDonald and Smith began an exhaustive mixing process, which lasted two weeks. For each song, they mixed {{one or two}} tracks of each instrument and used Waves Audio components to equalize the recordings. Having enjoyed how the demos captured unintended background noises such as street sounds, McDonald deliberately left certain sounds that would have otherwise been unwanted in the final mix. [...] "I wanted it to sound like people in a room, rather than this polished kind of perfect crystalline thing", he explained. [...] "It was all the small details that we really liked." [...] In February, the group wrote and recorded [...] "Fantasy", [...] "Shelter", and [...] "Infinity" [...] before finishing xx by month's end. Sim sang his vocals for [...] "Infinity" [...] {{on the side of}} the studio opposite from Croft after his microphone had been unintentionally moved there, which resulted in a distant-sounding vocal exchange on the song. While recording [...] "Shelter", a mechanical part from the guitar amplifier loosened and caused it to make a clattering sound, which McDonald and the xx chose to retain. [...] "It was <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> missing piece of percussion that the track needed!", McDonald recalled.|$|E

2500|$|Sound the Alarm is {{the first}} album in a trilogy with the theme of self-discovery. It was {{followed}} by Under the Boards (2007) and Daybreak (2011). Conley said that Sound the Alarm was [...] "an expression of discontent. Under the Boards is reflection and remorse. Daybreak is acceptance." [...] He {{also said that the}} three-album concept was: [...] "just a bit of a therapeutic experiment". I felt like all twisted up and broken inside and just angry and confused and depressed and sad and I couldn’t really deal with the world or myself. So I was <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> has got to end, I have to at least try and get a grip on the world and on myself. So I dove into the depths of my mind and brought out what I was finding, so the first album was filled with all the anger, the surface pain, and all the paranoid delusional thoughts that were there.|$|E
