50|$|Wheels must {{be fitted}} {{with the correct}} type of lug nuts on wheel studs, or bolts. Lug nuts (aka wheel nuts in British English) are usually either <b>flat,</b> <b>tapered</b> (generally at 60 degrees and {{referred}} to as conical seat), or ball seats, meaning the mounting surfaces are <b>flat,</b> <b>tapered,</b> or spherical respectively.Most Mercedes have ball lug seats from the factory while most aftermarket wheels have a tapered lug design. Wrong lug nuts for the wheel will not properly center it and cause wobble. Some manufacturers (e.g. Toyota and Lexus) have used taper lug nuts for steel wheels and flat seated lug nuts for alloy wheels.|$|R

50|$|Hubbard {{described}} the breed as {{much like the}} Welsh sheepdog and old working collie types. It worked quietly, quickly and low-to-ground. The head was rather broad and <b>flat,</b> <b>tapering</b> to a medium-length muzzle. The ears fell over to the front or were semi-erect and rather small. The body was fairly long and extremely lithe, with light but muscular legs and a low-set tail carried at the trail. The coat was fairly heavy and quite dense. Cumberland sheepdogs were black with white blaze, chest, feet and tip of tail. Height was about 20 inches and weight ranged 40-50 pounds.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Punch {{is a key}} {{component}} in Socket-Spanner extrusion and its shape influence the extrusion molding heavily. Using the FEA software DEFORM, the paper simulated the extrusion process of three kinds of upper and lower extrusion punch combinations which have different shape and studied the influences of the punch shape on metal flowing, Z direction punch load and equivalent stress. By contrasting the simulation data, the best punch shape was chosen. Our results could provide theory evidence for optimization design of Socket-Spanner extrusion punch. It was shown that the tapered bottom punch is the most suitable shape for the socket-spanner extrusion than the <b>flat</b> <b>tapered</b> and the <b>flat</b> one...|$|R
40|$|In joint {{replacement}} one of {{the most}} important demands for the save function is a sufficient strength of the bone cement. Besides the standardized characterizat ion by quasistatic tests, fatigue investigations should be performed. Three test ing procedures are discussed: The four-point-bending arrangement, a uniaxial pur e tensile test with <b>flat</b> <b>tapered</b> specimens and a uniaxial compression-tension te st with cylindrical tapered samples. S-N-curves were measured for Palacos R and Simplex P. The three procedures and their results are compared. The results show that the strength levels in the testing arrangements differ markedly which can be explained by differences in the loaded volume. However the three test methods seem to be equally suited to characterize the fatigue behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Bone cements are {{a common}} tool for the {{fixation}} of high load bearing endoprostheses. One {{of the most important}} requirements for their save function is a sufficient strength under long-term loading conditions. Therefore, fatigue investigations are increasingly performed in addition to the usual characterization by quasistatic tests. Meanwhile, such fatigue testing methods are also discussed by the responsible ISO-committee. Three testing procedures are considered: A 4 -point-bending arrangement, a pure tensile test with <b>flat</b> <b>tapered</b> specimens and a uniaxial tension/compression test with cylindrical tapered samples. Up to now, a direct comparison of these three methods has not been conducted. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the three procedures with respect to their applicability for the assessment of the fatigue properties of bone cements. Whereas tension/compression leads to uncertainties in the interpretation of the results, it turns out that bending and pure tension deliver consistent evaluations. With respect to practicability, simplicity, and costs the bending test method which is already standardized for the quasistatic testing of bone cements is the preferable fatigue testing arrangement...|$|R

40|$|With new fiber systems {{available}} for 3 μm, Erbium lasers become more interesting for precise tissue ablation {{in a water}} environment enabling new application in e. g. dentistry. The dynamics of explosive bubble formation was investigated at 2. 78 μm (Er,Cr;YSGG) and 2. 94 μm (Er:YAG), in relation to energy (10 - 50 mJ), pulse length (20 - 150 μs) and fiber tip shape (<b>flat</b> or <b>taper).</b> The dynamics of exploding and imploding vapor bubbles were captured with high speed imaging (10 - 300 μs range). Increasing the pulse length and energy, the vapor bubble became more elongated with an opaque surface for <b>flat</b> tip fibers. <b>Tapered</b> fibers produced spherical vapor bubbles with an optically transparent surface expected to be more forceful for creating mechanical effects in both hard and soft tissues.

40|$|Four roller {{profiles}} used in {{cylindrical roller}} bearing design and manufacture were analyzed using both a closed form solution and finite element analysis (FEA) for stress and life. The roller profiles analyzed were <b>flat,</b> <b>tapered</b> end, aerospace, and fully crowned loaded against a flat raceway. Four rolling-element bearing life models were chosen for this analysis and compared. These were those of Weibull, Lundberg and Palmgren, Ioannides and Harris, and Zaretsky. The flat roller profile without edge loading has the longest predicted life. However, edge loading can reduce life {{by as much as}} 98 percent. The end tapered profile produced the highest lives but not significantly different than the aerospace profile. The fully crowned profile produces the lowest lives. The resultant predicted life at each stress condition not only depends on the life equation used but also on the Weibull slope assumed. For Weibull slopes of 1. 5 and 2, both Lundberg-Palmgren and Iaonnides-Harris equations predict lower lives than the ANSI/ABMAJISO standards. Based upon the Hertz stresses for line contact, the accepted load-life exponent of 10 / 3 results in a maximum Hertz stress-life exponent equal to 6. 6. This value is inconsistent with that experienced in the field...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{effects of}} {{different}} tool pin profiles of <b>flat</b> and <b>tapered</b> shoulder geometries on the peak temperature in {{friction stir welding}} are investigated analytically. The developed models used for the analytical investigations considered the welding process as a combination or mixture of the pure sliding and the pure sticking. From the results, the amount of heat generation and the peak temperature are directly proportional {{to the number of}} edges in the pin profiles {{in such a way that}} the heat generated and peak temperature in the profiles increases from the triangular pin profile to hexagonal pin profile. Also, the rate of heat generation and the peak temperature in flat shoulder are greater than in tapered/conical shoulder.

50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the IAR.22 was <b>flat</b> sided, <b>tapering</b> to the rear. It was a Warren {{truss structure}} with duralumin gussets; the forward fuselage was plywood covered, the remain fabric clad. Rounded decking, {{together with a}} head fairing behind the rear cockpit, gave the aircraft a slightly humped profile. The front cockpit was just behind {{the leading edge of}} the wing and the rear one at mid-chord. The nose line dropped slightly over the cowling of the 97 kW (130 hp) de Havilland Gipsy Major engine, an inverted air-cooled inline engine carried on a steel mounting and which drove a two-bladed propeller. The undercarriage had a wide track of over 2.5 m (100 in), with near vertical IAR-made shock absorber legs, split axles hinged at the fuselage centre line and trailing struts. The wheels had independent brakes but were not faired in.|$|R
50|$|The wooden {{monocoque}} fuselage {{was equally}} refined and polished, its oval section tapering towards the tail. Towards the nose the fuselage flattened {{to accommodate the}} three four-cylinder blocks of its 340 kW (450 hp) W-12 Hispano-Suiza 12 Gb engine, driving a low-set two-blade propeller with a large spinner. This was water-cooled, with under-wing radiators from the root to half span, assisted by a single ventral radiator just aft of the undercarriage. The fixed, tricycle undercarriage had unfaired single mainwheels on a single axle, attached by bungee cord to two <b>flat,</b> faired, <b>tapered</b> legs. These legs were cross-braced with streamlined stays. The open cockpit was at the wing trailing edge. Because the Hispano engine of the V.2 was mounted lower in the nose than the Lorraine-Dietrich, another W-12, of the V.1, the central cylinder bank did not so completely obscure the pilots forward view.|$|R

50|$|As {{the name}} implies, the spray pattern {{appears as a}} flat sheet of liquid. The pattern is formed by an {{elliptical}} or a round orifice on a deflective surface that is tangent to the exit orifice. The orifice has an external groove with a contoured internal cylindrical radius, or “cat’s eye” shape. In the elliptical orifice design, the pattern sprays out of the orifice {{in line with the}} pipe. In the deflector design, the spray pattern is perpendicular to the pipe. There are two categories of <b>flat</b> spray, <b>tapered</b> and even, depending on the uniformity of the spray over the spray pattern. Flat spray patterns with tapering edges are produced by straight-through elliptical spray nozzles. This spray pattern is useful for overlapping patterns between multiple nozzle headers. The result is uniform distribution across the entire sprayed surface. Non-tapered flat spray nozzles are used in cleaning applications that require a uniform spray pattern without any overlap in spray area.|$|R
