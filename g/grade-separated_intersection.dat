5|$|The Triangle Link is {{partially}} financed with tolls, with toll collection {{taking place at}} Føyno. It is constructed as a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>intersection,</b> such that any car passes through the plaza once. Cars driving along the E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo {{need to use the}} interchange. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount. It is estimated that the tunnel will be paid off and the tolls removed in 2012 or 2013.|$|E

It is anticipated that the parkway will bring both business and residents to the current Bumstead area.|$|R
50|$|Plans for the {{motorway}} were officially {{formulated in}} 1974 {{and the construction}} was started in 1977.

As {{the first stage of}} the A6 motorway construction spanning between Zagreb and Rijeka neared completion in the 2000s, construction of a proper motorway along the A7 route started.
