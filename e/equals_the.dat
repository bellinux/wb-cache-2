5|$|Similar {{methods can}} be used to enclose an {{arbitrary}} simple polygon within a curve of constant width, whose width <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> diameter of the given polygon. The resulting shape consists of circular arcs (at most as many as sides of the polygon), can be constructed algorithmically in linear time, and can be drawn with compass and straightedge. Although the regular-polygon based Reuleaux polygons all have an odd number of circular-arc sides, it is possible to construct constant-width shapes based on irregular polygons that have an even number of sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{determinant}} det(A) or |A| of {{a square}} matrix A {{is a number}} encoding certain properties of the matrix. A matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is nonzero. Its absolute value <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> area (in R2) or volume (in R3) of the image of the unit square (or cube), while its sign corresponds to the orientation of the corresponding linear map: the determinant is positive if and only if the orientation is preserved.|$|E

5|$|The {{most natural}} and {{convenient}} {{way to express}} the relation involves the algebraic concept of exact sequences: sequences of objects (in this case groups) and morphisms (in this case group homomorphisms) between them such {{that the image of}} one morphism <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> kernel of the next. In general, this does not allow (co)homology groups of a space to be completely computed. However, because many important spaces encountered in topology are topological manifolds, simplicial complexes, or CW complexes, which are constructed by piecing together very simple patches, a theorem such as that of Mayer and Vietoris is potentially of broad and deep applicability.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{a matrix}} A is {{the maximum number}} of linearly {{independent}} row vectors of the matrix, which is the same as {{the maximum number of}} linearly independent column vectors. Equivalently it is the dimension of the image of the linear map represented by A. The rank–nullity theorem states that the dimension of the kernel of a matrix plus the rank <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> number of columns of the matrix.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} circle may {{be either}} internally or externally tangent {{to each of}} the given circles. An external tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact; they lie {{on opposite sides of the}} tangent line at that point, and they exclude one another. The distance between their centers <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> sum of their radii. By contrast, an internal tangency is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact; the two circles lie on the same side of the tangent line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> difference of their radii. As an illustration, in Figure1, the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium-sized given black circle on the right, whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left.|$|E

5|$|One inefficient {{approach}} {{to finding the}} GCD of two natural numbers a and b is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number b. The number of steps of this approach grows linearly with b, or exponentially {{in the number of}} digits. Another inefficient approach is to find the prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted above, the GCD <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers a and b. Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|The {{most basic}} {{property}} of the Reuleaux triangle {{is that it has}} constant width, meaning that for every pair of parallel supporting lines (two lines of the same slope that both touch the shape without crossing through it) the two lines have the same Euclidean distance from each other, regardless of the orientation of these lines. In any pair of parallel supporting lines, one of the two lines will necessarily touch the triangle at one of its vertices. The other supporting line may touch the triangle at any point on the opposite arc, and their distance (the width of the Reuleaux triangle) <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> radius of this arc.|$|E
5|$|This angular scaling {{can be seen}} in the apsidal precession, i.e., in {{the gradual}} {{rotation}} of the long axis of the ellipse (Figure3). As noted above, the orbit as a whole rotates with a mean angular speed Ω=(k−1)ω, where ω <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> mean angular speed of the particle about the stationary ellipse. If the particle requires a time T to move from one apse to the other, this implies that, in the same time, the long axis will rotate by an angle β=ΩT=(k−1)ωT=(k−1)×180°. For an inverse-square law such as Newton's law of universal gravitation, where n equals 1, there is no angular scaling (k=1), the apsidal angle α is 180°, and the elliptical orbit is stationary (Ω=β=0).|$|E

5|$|Adding a {{multiple}} of any row to another row, or {{a multiple}} of any column to another column, {{does not change the}} determinant. Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by −1. Using these operations, any matrix can be transformed to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the determinant <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> product of the entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the determinant of any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors, that is, determinants of smaller matrices. This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of determinants (taking as starting case the determinant of a 1-by-1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the determinant of a 0-by-0 matrix, which is 1), that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer's rule, where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E

5|$|If all edge weights of an {{undirected graph}} are positive, then the minimax {{distances}} between pairs of points (the maximum edge weights of minimax paths) form an ultrametric; conversely every finite ultrametric space comes from minimax distances in this way. A data structure constructed from the {{minimum spanning tree}} allows the minimax distance between any pair of vertices to be queried in constant time per query, using lowest common ancestor queries in a Cartesian tree. The root of the Cartesian tree represents the heaviest minimum spanning tree edge, {{and the children of}} the root are Cartesian trees recursively constructed from the subtrees of the minimum spanning tree formed by removing the heaviest edge. The leaves of the Cartesian tree represent the vertices of the input graph, and the minimax distance between two vertices <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> weight of the Cartesian tree node that is their lowest common ancestor. Once the minimum spanning tree edges have been sorted, this Cartesian tree can be constructed in linear time.|$|E
5|$|This duality {{extends from}} {{individual}} cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle {{space of a}} graph {{is defined as the}} family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it {{can be viewed as a}} vector space over the two-element finite field, with the symmetric difference of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut space of a graph is defined as the family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle space of any planar graph and the cut space of its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a planar graph (the dimension of its cut space) <b>equals</b> <b>the</b> cyclotomic number of its dual (the dimension of its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed in exactly one way as a symmetric difference of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle in the minimum weight cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one of the cuts in the Gomory–Hu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is still true that the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the minimum weight cycle bases of the graph.|$|E
