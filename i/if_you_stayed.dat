60|$|What is {{the secret}} of the portier's devotion? It is very simple: he gets FEES, AND NO SALARY. His fee is pretty closely regulated, too. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> a week, <b>you</b> give him five marks--a dollar and a quarter, or about {{eighteen}} cents a day. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> a month, <b>you</b> reduce this average somewhat. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> two or three months or longer, you cut it down half, or even more than half. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> only one day, you give the portier a mark.|$|R

Hudson, I'll give you a small check to-morrow if you are satisfied, but it's fair {{to tell you that}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> and completed the improvements you would get more for it when you held the patent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no doubt," [...] Mr. Blagrove said, [...] "that ere long a British army {{will be sent}} out, and the French {{compelled}} to leave Egypt. If I thought {{that the war was}} likely to go on for some time as at present, I should say that you had better leave the service. As it is, you would not be doing much good <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> here, and so may as well hold on." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The only {{alteration}} {{would be}} that you must accompany me instead of staying here. Even putting aside {{the fact that you}} would be made a prisoner, you would, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> here, be a hindrance rather than a help to the business. Muller would carry it on as a purely German firm, while if you were here it would be evident that I had merely left temporarily, and that you were my representative. That would be fatal to Muller doing business with the French." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The moment I {{saw your}} card, Peter, I knew why you had come here," [...] she said, trying to steady her voice. [...] "It was to induce {{me to go}} back to my husband. You don't know how it hurts me to give you pain. I love you--I love you as I love Uncle Tom and Aunt Mary. You are a part of me. But oh, you can't understand! I knew you could not. You have never made any mistakes--you have never lived. It is useless. I won't go back to him. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> here for weeks you could not make me change my mind." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{she said}} at last, [...] "you're right. You only said--I would have said it {{for you if you}} had not. You're so right, Stephen.... I suppose, poor silly little things, that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> we should {{certainly}} begin making love to each other. It would be--necessary. We should fence about a little and then there it would be. No barrier--to stop us. And neither of us wants it to happen. It isn't what we want.

6000|$|... "You'll excuse me, sir," [...] he said, when a {{few yards}} away from the door; [...] "but I see that you're green, an' don't know what a rascally place you've got into. I've been fleeced there myself, and yet I'm fool enough to go back! Most o' the parties there--except the sailors an' sodgers--are thieves an' blackguards. They've drugged your beer, I know; that's why I capsized it for you, and the feller that has got hold o' you is a {{well-known}} decoy-duck.

Perhaps--oh! it wrings my heart to say it--this is our last meeting on the earth. If so, then we must hope to meet in heaven. At the least be sure of this, while I live I will be true to you, and father or no father, I will die before I break my troth. I am young to speak so largely, but it shall be as I say. Oh! this parting is more cruel than death. Would that we were asleep and forgotten among men. Yet it is best that you should go, for <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> what could we be to each other while my father lives, and may he live long!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Farewell, Gentiles," [...] he said, {{bowing to}} us in mockery, [...] "we wish you a quick journey to Sheol, or {{wherever}} such swine as you may go. Listen, you Orme. I have a message for you from the Walda Nagasta. It {{is that she is}} sorry she could not ask you to stop for her nuptial feast, which she would have done had she not been sure that, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed,</b> the people would have cut your throat, and she did not wish the holy soil of Mur to be defiled with your dog's blood. Also she bids me say that she hopes that your stay here will have taught you a lesson, and that in future you will not believe that every woman who makes use of you for her own ends is therefore a victim of your charms. To-morrow night and the night after, I pray you think of our happiness and drink a cup of wine to the Walda Nagasta and her husband. Come, will you not wish me joy, O Gentile?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Late in the drowsy summer afternoons I {{should have}} the Court of the University all to myself, and might study unmolested the blazons of the noble youth who have {{attended}} the school in different centuries ever since 1200, and have left their escutcheons on the walls to commemorate them. At {{the foot of the}} stairway ascending to the schools from the court is the statue of the learned lady who was once a professor in the University, and who, if her likeness belie not her looks, must have given a great charm to student life in other times. At present there are no lady professors at Padua any more than at Harvard; and during late years the schools have suffered greatly from the interference of the Austrian government, which frequently closed them for months, on account of political demonstrations among the students. But now there is an end of this and many other stupid oppressions; and the time-honored University will doubtless regain its ancient importance. Even in 1864 it had nearly fifteen hundred students, and one met them everywhere under the arcades, and could not well mistake them, with that blended air of pirate and dandy which these studious young men loved to assume. They were to be seen a good deal on the promenades outside the walls, where the Paduan ladies are driven in their carriages in the afternoon, and where one sees the blood-horses and fine equipages for which Padua is famous. There used once to be races in the Prato della Valle, after the Italian notion of horse-races; but these are now discontinued, and there is nothing to be found there but the statues of scholars and soldiers and statesmen, posted in a circle around the old race-course. If you strolled thither about dusk on such a day as this, you might see the statues unbend a little from their stony rigidity, and in the failing light nod to each other very pleasantly through the trees. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> in Padua over night, what could be better to-morrow morning than a stroll through the great Botanical Garden,--the oldest botanical garden in the world,--the garden which first received in Europe the strange and splendid growths of our hemisphere,--the garden where Doctor Rappaccini doubtless found the germ of his mortal plant? ...|$|E
5000|$|His younger-than-normal age for {{a studio}} {{executive}} was usually mentioned {{even after he}} left Universal to help start up MGM. Screenwriter Agnes Christine Johnson, who worked with Thalberg for years, described his contribution during meetings: He's so marvelous that no one who doesn't know him can believe it. Seeing him sitting in with all the important people, looking such a boy, and deferred to by everybody, you'd think that either they were crazy or you were. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> and listened, you'd understand. He has a mind like a whip. Snap! He has an idea—the right idea—the only idea! ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Marina Pacini from 1988, Emlen describes his experience studying under Lhote in Paris:“No, it was fluid. People came and went in the classes. You know, sometimes people came and somebody would be very annoyed at something he destroyed, something they’d done on a canvas, and they were horrified and would never come back. It was in America, I was fascinated when I came back. It was done more like, to please the student; you’d say something was good and never touch it. But Lhote would barge right in and the students, the whole class, would follow round behind, and he would take one easel, one painting at a time, and whatever he was emphasizing that day, he would rub it in, and how! Much to the, sometimes, students’ annoyance. The reason I’m telling you this is to explain {{why it was so}} fluid. There was no point in having a method of teaching composition one day, and one day color was that you got different people and you didn’t follow through with it. And with his method you eventually got all the different facets <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> long enough.” ...|$|E
