25|$|While {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in the islet transplantation field, many obstacles remain that currently preclude its widespread application. Two of the most important limitations are the currently inadequate means for preventing islet rejection, and the limited supply of islets for transplantation. Current immunosuppressive regimens are capable of preventing islet failure for months to years, but the agents used in these treatments are expensive and may increase the risk for specific malignancies and opportunistic infections. In addition, and somewhat ironically, the most commonly used agents (like calcineurin inhibitors and rapamycin) are also known to impair normal islet function and/or insulin action. Further, like all medications, the agents have other associated toxicities, with side effects such as oral ulcers, peripheral edema, anemia, weight loss, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diarrhea and fatigue. Perhaps of greatest concern to the patient and physician is the harmful effect of certain widely employed <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agents</b> on renal function. For the patient with diabetes, renal function is a crucial factor in determining long-term outcome, and calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and ciclosporin) are significantly nephrotoxic. Thus, while some patients with a pancreas transplant tolerate the <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agents</b> well, and for such patients diabetic nephropathy can gradually improve, in other patients the net effect (decreased risk due to the improved blood glucose control, increased risk from the <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agents)</b> may worsen kidney function. Indeed, Ojo et al. have published an analysis indicating that among patients receiving other-than-kidney allografts, 7%–21% end up with renal failure as a result of the transplant and/or subsequent immunosuppression.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} most {{immunosuppressive}} regimens is prednisolone, a corticosteroid. Prednisolone suppresses the immune system, but its long-term use at high doses causes {{a multitude of}} side effects, including glucose intolerance and diabetes, weight gain, osteoporosis, muscle weakness, hypercholesterolemia, and cataract formation. Prednisolone alone is usually inadequate to prevent rejection of a transplanted kidney. Thus other, non-steroid <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agents</b> are needed, which also allow lower doses of prednisolone.|$|E
25|$|Decreasing {{doses of}} {{immunosuppressive}} therapy then allows donor T-cells {{to eradicate the}} remaining recipient HSC and to induce the graft-versus-tumor effect. This effect is often accompanied by mild graft-versus-host disease, the appearance of which is often a surrogate marker {{for the emergence of}} the desirable graft versus tumor effect, and also serves as a signal to establish an appropriate dosage level for sustained treatment with low levels of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|E

25|$|According {{to their}} findings, {{presented}} at the University of Bologna in 2010, Callas had dermatomyositis, a disease that causes {{a failure of the}} muscles and tissues, including the larynx. They believe she was showing signs of this disease as early as the 1960s. Fussi and Paolillo cite an initial report by physician Mario Giacovazzo, who in 2002 revealed he had diagnosed Callas with dermatomyositis in 1975. Treatment includes corticosteroids and <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agents,</b> which affect heart function.|$|E
25|$|Fauci {{has made}} a number of basic {{scientific}} observations that contribute to the current understanding of the regulation of the human immune response, and is recognized for delineating the mechanisms whereby <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agents</b> adapt to the human immune response. He has developed therapies for formerly fatal diseases such as polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. In a 1985 Stanford University Arthritis Center Survey of the American Rheumatism Association membership ranked the work of Fauci on the treatment of polyarteritis nodosa and granulomatosis with polyangiitis {{as one of the most}} important advances in patient management in rheumatology over the previous 20 years.|$|E
40|$|FK 506 {{was used}} as a primary <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agent</b> in 125 cases of renal {{transplantation}} in a randomized trial comparing FK 506 /prednisone with FK 506 /azathioprine/prednisone. With a mean follow-up of 5. 5 +/- 2. 5 months, there has been a 6 -month actuarial patient survival of 99 % and graft survival of 88 %. There is no difference thus far between the two-drug and three-drug groups, although there may be less rejection and diabetes in the three-drug group. These results suggest that FK 506 is a useful <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agent</b> in kidney transplantation...|$|R

25|$|A newer {{treatment}} approach, non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation, also termed reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), uses {{doses of}} chemotherapy and radiation {{too low to}} eradicate all the bone marrow cells of the recipient. Instead, non-myeloablative transplants run lower risks of serious infections and transplant-related mortality while relying upon the graft versus tumor effect to resist the inherent increased risk of cancer relapse. Also significantly, while requiring high doses of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agents</b> {{in the early stages}} of treatment, these doses are less than for conventional transplants. This leads to a state of mixed chimerism early after transplant where both recipient and donor HSC coexist in the bone marrow space.|$|E
25|$|After a liver transplantation, {{there are}} three types of graft {{rejection}} that may occur. They include hyperacute rejection, acute rejection and chronic rejection. Hyperacute rejection is caused by preformed anti-donor antibodies. It {{is characterized by the}} binding of these antibodies to antigens on vascular endothelial cells. Complement activation is involved and the effect is usually profound. Hyperacute rejection happens within minutes to hours after the transplant procedure. Unlike hyperacute rejection, which is B cell mediated, acute rejection is mediated by T cells. It involves direct cytotoxicity and cytokine mediated pathways. Acute rejection is the most common and the primary target of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agents.</b> Acute rejection is usually seen within days or weeks of the transplant. Chronic rejection is the presence of any sign and symptom of rejection after 1 year. The cause of chronic rejection is still unknown but an acute rejection is a strong predictor of chronic rejections.|$|E
25|$|Bone marrow {{transplantation}} {{usually requires}} that the recipient's own bone marrow be destroyed (myeloablation). Prior to the administration of new cells (engraftment) patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of white blood cells to help fight infection. This puts a patient {{at high risk of}} infections, sepsis and septic shock, despite prophylactic antibiotics. However, antiviral medications, such as acyclovir and valacyclovir, are quite effective in prevention of HSCT-related outbreak of herpetic infection in seropositive patients. The <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agents</b> employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of opportunistic infection. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their acquired immunity, for example immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or polio. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood vaccines once they are off immunosuppressive medications.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Tacrolimus is an <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agent</b> {{that can}} show {{a wide variety}} of {{neurologic}} side effects, including leukoencephalopathy. Although the prognosis is good— after cessation or dose reduction, complete recovery usually occurs—the differentiation with treatable diseases such as progressive multifocal encephalopathy can be difficult, making a stereotactic biopsy of the white matter lesion sometimes necessary. We describe the case of a 12 -year-old girl with a severe, reversible tacrolimus-related leukoen-cephalopathy and only mild histopathologic abnormalities. Tacrolimus (FK- 506) is an <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agent</b> frequently used after organ transplantation. A wide variety of neurologic side effects has been de-scribed, resembling those in cyclosporine therapy (1). Although they are reported to be minor (headache...|$|R

2500|$|Initial {{treatment}} involves addressing any existing {{infections that}} may have occurred due to the broken state of the skin. Existing wounds are treated with warm compresses, non-adherent (non-stick) dressing, and topical antibiotic ointment. <b>Immunosuppressive</b> <b>agents</b> are administered in attempt to decrease blistering; this is not often effective. The first medication given aiming to heal the wounds are high dose corticosteroids. This is followed by steroid sparing agents [...] which may reduce steroid intake and therefore lessen the side effects. Skin lesions {{are more likely to}} respond to this line of treatment than mucosal lesions. However, a high level of caution is advised in patients with a confirmed malignancy, where immunosuppression is vital and dictates treatment options. If the initial therapy fails to control the symptoms of PNP, and the condition of the patient deteriorates, a more aggressive approach may be necessary.|$|E

40|$|Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) {{is a new}} <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agent</b> that {{selectively}} inhibits {{the proliferation}} of T and B lymphocytes. The use of MMF in renal transplantation significantly reduced the incidence of acute rejection episodes {{in the first year}} after transplantation. The main toxicities of MMF are the occurrence of diarrhea and leucopenia. This potent <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agent</b> is devoid of the nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin and of the multiple adverse effects of corticosteroids. Clinical trials are currently in progress to assess whether the use of MMF will allow the discontinuation of cyclosporine or corticosteroid therapy without leading to an increased risk of rejection. If results were positive, MMF would represent a significant advance in the field of renal transplantation. English AbstractJournal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
