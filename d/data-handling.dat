5|$|The {{nomination}} in April 2005 {{of a new}} NASA Administrator with an engineering rather than accounting background, Michael D. Griffin, changed the situation, as Griffin stated he would consider a manned servicing mission. Soon after his appointment Griffin authorized Goddard to proceed with preparations for a manned Hubble maintenance flight, saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions. In October 2006 Griffin gave the final go-ahead, and the 11-day mission by Atlantis was scheduled for October 2008. Hubble's main <b>data-handling</b> unit failed in September 2008, halting all reporting of scientific data until its back-up was brought online on October 25, 2008. Since {{a failure of the}} backup unit would leave the HST helpless, the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the primary unit.|$|E

50|$|The {{ethos of}} the {{development}} of the system has been that in the majority of cases, producing large-scale <b>data-handling</b> and storage facilities, with the appropriate level of security, access, backups, etc., would not be economical for an individual railway.

5000|$|The VERLORT radar {{fulfilled}} the S-band requirement {{with only a}} few modifications. Significant ones were the addition of specific angle-track capability and additional angular scan modes. At Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, the MPQ-31 radar was used for S-band tracking by extending its range capability to meet Project Mercury requirements. The <b>data-handling</b> equipment was essentially the same as for the FPS-16.

50|$|To {{understand}} AST, it {{is necessary}} to specify the correct definition of attention. The word is used colloquially in many ways, leading to some possible confusion. Here it is used to mean that Kevin’s brain has focused some resources on the processing of the apple. The internal model of the apple has been boosted in signal strength, and as a result Kevin’s brain processes the apple deeply, is more likely to store information about it in memory, and is more likely to trigger a behavioral response to the apple. In this definition of the word, attention is a mechanistic, <b>data-handling</b> process. It involves a relative deployment of processing resources to a specific signal.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the five main instruments, nine avionic subsystems were allocated to the bus module. [...] These were the Communication and <b>Data-Handling</b> Subsystem (C&DH), Inter-Orbit Communication Subsystem (IOCS), Mission Data Processing Subsystem (MDPS), Optical Data Recorder (ODR), Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS), Paddle Subsystem (PDL), Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS), Reaction Control Subsystem (RCS), and the Direct Transmission Subsystem (DTL). The C&DH subsystem received and decoded the satellite's tracking control command signals and acted as a processing interface between the instruments. It was capable of adjusting settings on the instruments [...] - [...] such as temperature and voltage. The IOCS was used to communicate with data relay satellites (see Data transfer).|$|E
5000|$|To obtain {{reliability}} {{in providing}} accurate trajectory data, the Mercury spacecraft {{was equipped with}} C-band and S-band cooperative beacons. The ground radar systems had to be compatible with the spacecraft radar beacons. The FPS-16 radar in use at most national missile ranges was selected to meet the C-band requirement. Although it originally had a range capability of only 250 nmi km, most of the FPS-16 radar units selected for the project had been modified for operation up to 500 nmi km, a NASA requirement, and modification kits were obtained for the remaining systems. In addition to the basic radar system, it was also necessary to provide the required <b>data-handling</b> equipment to allow {{data to be transmitted}} from all sites to the computers.|$|E

50|$|When {{a device}} is {{plugged into the}} USB bus, the master device, or host, sets up {{communications}} with the device and handles service provisioning (the host's software enables or does the needed <b>data-handling</b> such as file managing or other desired kind of data communication or function). That allows the devices to be greatly simplified compared to the host; for example, a mouse contains very little logic and relies on the host to do {{almost all of the}} work. The host controls all data transfers over the bus, with the devices capable only of signalling (when polled) that they require attention. To transfer data between two devices, for example from a phone to a printer, the host first reads the data from one device, then writes it to the other.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the ability}} of rapid {{screening}} of diverse compounds (such as small molecules or siRNAs) to identify active compounds, HTS {{has led to an}} explosion in the rate of data generated in recent years.Consequently, one of the most fundamental challenges in HTS experiments is to glean biochemical significance from mounds of data, which relies on the development and adoption of appropriate experimental designs and analytic methods for both quality control and hit selection.HTS research is one of the fields that have a feature described by John Blume, Chief Science Officer for Applied Proteomics, Inc., as follows: Soon, if a scientist does not understand some statistics or rudimentary <b>data-handling</b> technologies, he or she may not be considered to be a true molecular biologist and, thus, will simply become [...] "a dinosaur." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{is roughly}} cylindrical in shape, and has four major components. At the fore {{of the spacecraft}} is the Mirror Support Platform, which supports the X-ray telescope assemblies and grating systems, the Optical Monitor, and two star trackers. Surrounding this component is the Service Module, which carries various spacecraft support systems: computer and electric busses, consumables (such as fuel and coolant), solar arrays, the Telescope Sun Shield, and two S-band antennas. Behind these units is the Telescope Tube, a 6.8 m long, hollow carbon fibre structure which provides exact spacing between the mirrors and their detection equipment. This section also hosts outgassing equipment on its exterior, which helps remove any contaminants from {{the interior of the}} satellite. At the aft end of spacecraft is the Focal Plane Assembly, which supports the Focal Plane Platform (carrying the cameras and spectrometers) and the <b>data-handling,</b> power distribution, and radiator assemblies.|$|E
5000|$|Based on the F-16C/D Block 50/52, it {{features}} improved radar and avionics and conformal fuel tanks; {{it has only}} been sold to the United Arab Emirates. At one time, this version was incorrectly {{thought to have been}} designated [...] "F-16U." [...] A major difference from previous blocks is the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-80 Active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, which gives the airplane the capability to simultaneously track and destroy ground and air threats. The Block 60's General Electric F110-GE-132 engine is a development of the −129 model and is rated at 32,500 lbf (144 kN). The Electronic Warfare system is supposed to be quite advanced and includes the Northrop Grumman Falcon Edge Integrated Electronic Warfare Suite RWR together with the AN/ALQ-165 Self-Protection Jammer. Falcon Edge, which was developed by Northrop Grumman specifically for the Block 60, is capable of showing not only the bearing of any threat but also the range. The Block 60 allows the carriage of all Block 50/52-compatible weaponry as well as AIM-132 Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) and the AGM-84E Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM). The CFTs provide an additional 450 US gallon (2,045 L) of fuel, allowing increased range or time on station. This has the added benefit of freeing up hardpoints for weapons that otherwise would have been occupied by underwing fuel tanks. The MIL-STD-1553 data bus is replaced by MIL-STD-1773 fiber-optic data bus which offers a 1,000 times increase in <b>data-handling</b> capability. UAE funded the entire $3 billion Block 60 development costs, and in exchange will receive royalties if any of the Block 60 aircraft are sold to other nations. According to press reports quoted by Flight International, this is [...] "the first time the US has sold a better aircraft F-16 overseas than its own forces fly".|$|E
