5000|$|In a 1989 {{article in}} Assembly, the {{magazine}} of the U.S. Military Academy's Association of Graduates, his son Bruce B.G. Clarke described Gorham's leadership style: In researching the paraskiers I found Art Gorham described as “soft spoken.” Elsewhere he {{is described as}} [...] "Hard-nose" [...] Gorham because of his strictness and insistence on discipline within his battalion. Brigadier General Walt Winton has written: “he exemplified the good commander, demonstrating leadership, concern, initiative, and intelligence. One example of his leadership was his joining then Colonel Gavin {{and a few others}} in experimental <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> <b>jumps.</b> The normal static line jump was quite exciting enough for most. Art had an abiding concern for his subordinates. When the regiment made PCS change of station moves to Camp Mackall and then to Fort Bragg, Colonel and Mrs. Gorham threw open their quarters on post to shelter others.|$|R

50|$|What {{remains is}} a micro-g {{environment}} moving in <b>free</b> <b>fall,</b> i.e. {{there are no}} forces other than gravity acting on the people or objects in this environment. To prevent air drag making the <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> less perfect, objects and people can free-fall in a capsule that itself, while not necessarily in <b>free</b> <b>fall,</b> is accelerated as in <b>free</b> <b>fall.</b> This {{can be done by}} applying a force to compensate for air drag. Alternatively <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> can be carried out in space, or in a vacuum tower or shaft.|$|R

50|$|In Newtonian physics, <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> is any {{motion of}} a body where gravity is the only force acting upon it.

5000|$|An {{alternative}} to the clinostat for simulating microgravity is the <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> machine (FFM). Small samples (such as cell suspensions) are allowed to <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> under gravity for about a metre, with the period of <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> lasting just under a second. They are then pushed {{back to the top}} of the apparatus by a briefly applied large force (c. 20 g for 20 ms - the [...] "bounce"), and allowed to fall again, and so on. The principle of the machine is that most of the time is spent in zero g <b>free</b> <b>fall.</b> The periods spent under high g are assumed to be too short to be detected by the physiological mechanism of the biological samples, which consequently only perceive the time spent in <b>free</b> <b>fall.</b>|$|R
