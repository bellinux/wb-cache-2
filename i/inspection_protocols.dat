There were only two bridges built to a similar design, one upstream at St. Marys, West Virginia, and the notably longer Hercilio Luz Bridge at Florianópolis, Brazil. The St. Marys bridge was immediately closed to traffic and the bridge was demolished by the state in 1971. A small truss bridge was kept to allow access to an island in the river. The Hi Carpenter Memorial Bridge was later built to replace the demolished bridge. The Hercilio Luz Bridge remained in active service until 1991 and still stands at Florianópolis due to being built to a higher safety factor than the West Virginia bridge. Modern non-destructive testing methods allow some of the older bridges to remain in service where they are located on lightly traveled roads. Most heavily used bridges of this type have been replaced with modern bridges of various types.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Bovine Tuberculosis (BTB) is a {{widespread}} and endemic disease of cattle in Ethiopia posing a significant threat to public health. Regular surveillance by skin test, bacteriology and molecular methods is not feasible {{due to lack of}} resource. Thus, routine abattoir (RA) inspection will continue to play a key role for national surveillance. We evaluated efficiency of RA inspection for diagnosis of Mycobacterium bovis infection and discussed its public health implications in light of a high risk of human exposure. Methods The study was conducted in five abattoirs: Addis Ababa, Adama, Hawassa, Yabello and Melge-Wondo abattoirs. The efficiency of routine abattoir (RA) inspection was validated in comparison to detailed abattoir (DA) inspection, followed by culture and microscopy (CM) and region of difference (RD) deletion analysis. Diagnostic accuracies (with corresponding measures of statistical uncertainty) were determined by computing test property statistics (sensitivity and specificity) and likelihood estimations using web-based SISA diagnostic statistics software. Post-test probability of detecting TB infected carcasses was estimated using nomograms. Agreement between RA and DA inspections was measured using kappa statistics. The study was conducted and reported in accordance with standards for reporting of diagnostic accuracy (STARD) requirements. Both routine and detailed meat <b>inspection</b> <b>protocols</b> were performed on a subpopulation of 3322 cattle selected randomly from among 78, 269 cattle slaughtered during the study period. Three hundred thirty seven carcasses identified through detailed meat <b>inspection</b> <b>protocols</b> were subjected to culture and microscopy; of the 337, a subset of 105 specimens for culture and microscopy were subjected to further molecular testing. Results There was a substantial agreement between RA and DA inspections in Addis Ababa (Kappa = 0. 7) and Melge-Wondo abattoirs (Kappa = 0. 67). In Adama, Hawassa and Yabello abattoirs, the agreement was however poor (Kappa ≤ 0. 2). RA inspection was able to detect only 117 of the total 3322 carcasses inspected (3. 5 %). The sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of RA inspection were 28. 2 % (95 / 337) [95 %CI: 23. 4 - 33. 0] and 99. 3 % (2963 / 2985) [95 %CI: 99. 0 - 99. 6], respectively, when DA inspection was considered as reference test. When culture and microscopy (CM) was considered as reference test, the Sn and Sp of RA were 55. 2 % (58 / 105) [95 %CI: 45. 7 - 64. 7] and 84. 1 % (195 / 232) [95 %CI: 79. 3 - 88. 8]. RA inspection failed to detect 71. 8 % (242 / 337) and 44. 8 % (47 / 105) of TB infected carcasses as judged by DA inspection and CM, respectively. On the other hand, a much higher sensitivity of DA was obtained when CM and RD deletion analysis were considered as reference tests (96. 3 % (105 / 109) and 100. 0 % (24 / 24), respectively). Conclusions The study results indicate that meat <b>inspection</b> <b>protocols</b> currently utilized in abattoirs are insufficient to detect the majority of TB lesions at the gross level. DA <b>inspection</b> <b>protocols</b> were demonstrated to improve the detection level by approximately 3 -fold. The failure of current inspection techniques to detect approximately 70 % of carcasses presented with grossly-visible lesions of TB at the slaughter-plants indicates the magnitude of meat-borne zoonotic TB as an on-going risk to public health. Standardization of abattoir <b>inspection</b> <b>protocols</b> (in line with international sanitary requirements), enhanced training and proficiency testing of meat inspections, and raising public awareness are recommended as essential and cost-effective interventions to improve meat inspection service in Ethiopia, with subsequent protection of consumers' health. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) has {{experienced}} {{an increase in}} their construction projects (e. g., INDOT’s construction spending was $ 789 million in 2006 and increased to $ 1, 081. 4 million in 2010); while the level of its in-house inspection staff and resources has either remained the same or declined. There are different strategies {{to deal with the}} need for construction inspection resources and they may include strategies such as outsourcing the inspection of construction activities and using quality control and quality assurance certification programs to reduce the need for in-process inspection. One strategy that could reduce the inspection workload is prioritizing construction activities for inspection. However, reducing the number of inspections also has risks, such as functional failures and reduced design life, if defects are not identified before the work is covered. Thus, available inspection resources should be allocated to the activities with significant risk consequences due to reduced inspection. The objective of this study was to: (1) evaluate the current inspection practices of INDOT and (2) develop a risk-based <b>inspection</b> <b>protocol</b> to facilitate efficient allocation of available inspection resources to minimize the risks associated with reduced inspection. First, the current inspection practices implemented by INDOT, other State Departments of Transportation, and consulting firms were identified and compared. The comparison between the inspection practices revealed that there is consistency between INDOT’s and consultants’ and other State Departments of Transportation’s inspection practices. To develop a risk-based <b>inspection</b> <b>protocol,</b> first, the risk consequences associated with reduced inspection were identified for different transportation construction activities, based on the data collected from 20 site visits to INDOT projects. These risk consequences include short and long-term functional failures, reduced design life, reduced safety, and increased maintenance cost. Based on data collected from 23 state Departments of Transportation, 58 engineers and inspectors from the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), and 20 inspection consultants in the Midwest, the subjective perceived probabilities associated with the occurrence of each risk consequence were encoded using fuzzy analysis. Using these subjective probabilities, the risk impacts due to reduced inspection were derived. The construction activities subsequently were prioritized based on the risk impacts associated with reduced inspection into five priority levels: high, medium-high, medium, medium-low, and low. The greater the risk impacts were due to reduced inspection, the higher the priority would be for inspection of that activity. The study also included identification of value added of inspection and the critical items to be watched for different activities related to transportation construction.

40|$|Stormwater runoff {{should be}} treated during construction, and {{especially}} from pollutants and sediments that are induced by excavations. Urbanization affects the catchment hydrology increasing runoff and pollutant flushes. During construction, the changes occur in phases, and cold climate and seasonal variations complicate them further. The stormwater runoff threatens receiving waterbodies and possibly the human health. Sediments transported from construction sites end up in receiving waterbodies and in the drainage system, possibly clogging the system causing financial losses. Pollutants are transported in stormwater runoff and discovering the sources and transportation systems of pollutants prevents detriments. Other important information is pollutant response to rain events and pollutant association to particulate matter {{and the effects of}} changing seasons. Stormwater runoff management begins in the planning stage. The sediment transportation needs to be controlled and surface soil should be covered as widely as possible. It is important to maintain the stormwater runoff management systems and inspect the construction sites regarding it. The stormwater runoff in construction sites is treated with best management practices, which are based on filtration and sedimentation. Monitoring stormwater runoff is challenging due to variability of pollutant concentrations and flows. The inspections are important in order for the stormwater runoff management to function at construction sites. Runoff management begins is important in decision making and includes many stakeholders. The purpose of this thesis was to study construction time stormwater runoff in Vuores, which is located in Tampere. To create an <b>inspection</b> <b>protocol,</b> <b>inspection</b> needs were looked for during field observations, and possible stormwater pollutants were charted from samples. On-site observations were analyzed as such and in a larger context. The pollutant concentrations were levelled up with the development of the area in Vuores, especially during the rain event and as associated with particulate matter. Sulfate concentrations were also high at some parts of Vuores. Observations at construction sites revealed that space was scarce and thus joint management systems should be favored. Sediments are already managed in some extent in Vuores, but still sediments and erosion protection need to be paid attention, especially during rain events. Winter, snow and its melting are also significant. Furthermore, the maintenance of finished systems, such as ditches, needs to be attended to. The stormwater runoff management would benefit from an <b>inspection</b> <b>protocol</b> created on a basis of this thesis...|$|R

The rapid response afforded by the Northern Territory Government resulted in the successful eradication of the exotic bivalve from Australian coastal waters. To ensure the initial eradication event was successful in the long term an Aquatic Pest Management (APM) unit was established with the NT Fisheries Group. This unit has been proactive in the development of risk mitigation protocols in terms of minimising the chance of introduction of marine pest species, and in the monitoring of Territory waters for the appearance of exotic species. The APM is active in three main areas: environmental monitoring, inspection and treatment of high risk vessels, and public education. A total of 103 species of native fouling organisms have been recorded over three years of biological monitoring. Strong seasonal cycles in species composition and water quality are also evident. The Wet Season influx of freshwater renders the artificial environments of the lock-accessed marinas susceptible to invasion by exotic species.

An alternate <b>inspection</b> <b>protocol</b> that emphasizes screening [...] a rapid primary scan of all containers, followed by a more careful secondary scan of only a few containers that fail the primary test [...] holds promise as a feasible solution for meeting the 100 % scanning requirement.

40|$|Traceability {{exists in}} many food supply chains for valid {{economic}} reasons, {{one of which}} is improving food safety and quality. Some politicians and consumer groups are calling for increased identity preservation in systems where traceability has not yet been adopted. In this paper, we explore the implications of adding traceability to a food supply chain that already includes an <b>inspection</b> <b>protocol.</b> Our objective is to determine whether the addition of traceability will change the feasibility of a market for safer food and whether it will change the allocation of profits between producers and processors. We find that the addition of traceability to this system does influence whether or not the market will be feasible. If traceability is too high, then processors will not demand safer food, and if traceability is too low, then producers will not deliver safer food. We also show that the feasibility of the market depends on the sensitivity of the test used to inspect foodFood Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — To provide network {{services}} consistently under various network failures, enterprise networks increasingly utilize path diversity through multi-homing. As a result, multi-homed non-transit autonomous systems (ASes) become to surpass single-homed networks in number. In this paper, we address an inevitable problem {{that occurs when}} networks with multiple entry points deploy stateful inspection firewalls in their borders. In this paper, we formulate this phenomenon into a state-sharing problem among multiple firewalls under asymmetric routing condition. To solve this problem, we propose a state-ful <b>inspection</b> <b>protocol</b> that requires very low processing and messaging overhead. Our protocol consists of the following two phases: 1) Generation of a TCP SYN cookie marked with the firewall identification number upon a SYN packet arrival, and 2) State sharing triggered by a SYN/ACK packet arrival {{in the absence of}} the trail of its intial SYN packet. We demonstrate that our protocol is scalable, robust, and simple enough to be deployed for high speed networks. It also transparently works under any client-server configurations. Last but not least, we present experimental results through a prototype implementation. I...|$|R
