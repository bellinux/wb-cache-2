50|$|A <b>guaranteed</b> <b>investment</b> {{contract}} (GIC) is {{a contract}} that guarantees repayment of principal and a fixed or floating interest rate for a predetermined period of time. <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>investment</b> contracts are typically issued by life insurance companies qualified for favorable tax status under the Internal Revenue Code (for example, 401(k) plans). A GIC is used primarily as a vehicle that yields a higher return than a savings account or United States Treasury securities and GICs are often used as investments for stable value funds. GICs are {{sometimes referred to as}} funding agreements, although this term is often reserved for contracts sold to non-qualified institutions.|$|E
50|$|Despite the name, a TFSA {{does not}} have to be a cash savings account. Like an RRSP, a TFSA may contain cash and/or other {{investments}} such as mutual funds, certain stocks, bonds, or <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Investment</b> Certificates (GICs).|$|E

We find that under shareholders' wealth maximization, the presence of credit insurance yields high investment relative {{to the level of}} investment without credit insurance. We also obtain a U shape relationship between the project debt maturity and its investment size, with more investment undertaken with short and long maturities and less investment with intermediate maturities.

50|$|Although {{traditional}} {{fixed income}} investments such as <b>guaranteed</b> <b>investment</b> certificates (GICs) and bonds provide investment security {{with little or}} no risk of capital loss, they provide modest returns. While stocks have the potential to deliver substantial returns, they do so at much greater risk.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Investment</b> Certificate (GIC) is a Canadian {{investment}} {{that offers a}} guaranteed rate of return over a fixed period of time, most commonly issued by trust companies or banks. Due to its low risk profile, the return is generally less than other investments such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. It {{is similar to a}} time or term deposit as known in other countries.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} risks faced by South African life {{insurance}} companies {{arising from the}} provision of <b>investment</b> <b>guarantees</b> in products sold. The current thinking and practice of the larger South African life insurance companies regarding <b>investment</b> <b>guarantees</b> is set out following their responses to a survey. The paper examines the forms of <b>investment</b> <b>guarantee</b> available and the business issues created by the writing of these guarantees. These include issues around the design and pricing of new business, {{as well as the}} risk management of in-force business. The paper also compares existing methods used internationally to value life insurance business with <b>investment</b> <b>guarantees,</b> focusing on the use of stochastic models. The different allowances for risk within each valuation method and the appropriateness of these allowances when valuing <b>investment</b> <b>guarantees</b> are considered. The stochastic models compared include both statistically based real-world models and market-consistent state-price-deflator or risk-neutral models. Practical issues around the building of such asset–liability stochastic models are briefly discussed. Finally, the authors put forward their own views of possible developments in the future within South Africa that may impact on life insurance business with <b>investment</b> <b>guarantees,</b> and the possible implications.

50|$|Insurance is {{restricted}} to registered member institutions, and covers only the first $100,000 in very specific categories of accounts, such as savings accounts and chequing accounts, <b>guaranteed</b> <b>investment</b> certificates (GICs) and other term deposits with an original term to maturity of five years or less, money orders, travellers' cheques and bank drafts issued by CDIC members and cheques certified by CDIC members, and debentures issued by loan companies that are CDIC members. Credit unions and Quebec and New Brunswick's caisses populaires are not insured federally, because they are created under provincial charters and backed by provincial insurance plans, which generally follow the federal model. Deposits in foreign currencies are not insured, even when held by a registered CDIC financial institution. <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Investment</b> Certificates with a term longer than 5 years are also not insured. Funds in foreign banks operating in Canada are not covered. Some funds in Registered Retirement Savings Plans or Registered Retirement Income Funds at a bank may not be covered if they are invested in mutual funds or held in specific instruments like debentures issued by government or corporations. The general principle is to cover reasonable deposits and savings, but not deposits deliberately positioned to take risks for gain, such as mutual funds or stocks.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, the New York State Insurance Department (the “NYID”) {{enabled the}} monolines to write {{insurance}} on <b>guaranteed</b> <b>investment</b> contracts (“GICs”). GICs were envisioned as “stable,” highly rated investments sold by insurance companies, largely to pension {{funds in the}} 1970s and 1980s. With an insured GIC, the monoline would pay out in the event the original insurer failed.In 1999, the NYID issued guidance regarding insurance of obligations under credit default swaps, which facilitated the participation by financial guaranty insurers in the CDS market. The NYID guidance was subsequently codified by amendments to Article 69 of the New York Insurance Law.|$|E

Encouraged by the government <b>guarantees,</b> <b>investment</b> flowed in {{and a series of}} new rail companies were established, leading to rapid expansion of the rail system in India. Soon several large princely states built their own rail systems and the network spread to the regions that became the modern-day states of Assam, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. The route mileage of this network increased from [...] in 1860 to [...] in 1880, mostly radiating inland from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta.|$|R
5000|$|The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 {{broadened the}} MSRB's {{rulemaking}} authority to also regulate so-called municipal advisors, which include financial advisors, swap advisors, brokers of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>investment</b> contracts and other market participants that advise on {{the issuance of}} municipal securities and provide certain other types of advice {{to state and local}} governments, public pension funds and other municipal entities on municipal derivatives, investment strategies and other financial matters. , since the SEC has not released the definition of [...] "municipal advisor", the MSRB's rules in this regard are suspended and there is considerable concern in the industry as to whether underwriters and/or other regulated professionals may be viewed as municipal advisors, thereby having the related fiduciary duties. The MSRB's investor protection rules will be extended to protect municipal entities as well.|$|E
5000|$|Stable value {{funds have}} {{been around since the}} {{inception}} of US defined contribution plans in the 1970s. [...] Initially they consisted of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>investment</b> contracts, or GICs, which were backed solely by the issuer’s claims-paying ability. GICs are issued by insurance companies and guarantee principal invested plus a periodically-reset interest rate for a specific duration. The primary concern plan sponsors had in regards to GICs was the lack of flexibility and ownership of assets, which was partly remedied with the creation of separate account GICs. Separate account GICs hold the assets of the plan in a separate account that cannot be used to settle claims against the insurer’s general account. [...] Then in mid-1988 a broader array of stable value funds began to be offered, including the now common synthetic GIC. A synthetic GIC is a contract for a separately managed portfolio of fixed securities that is owned by the plan, often referred to as a wrap because it wraps the portfolio and protects it against rate fluctuations.|$|E

Information on the Canadian system is found at http://www.cdic.ca. Insurance is restricted to registered member institutions, and covers only the first C$100,000 in very specific categories of accounts. Credit unions and Quebec’s caisse populaire system are not insured Federally, because they are created under Provincial charters and backed by Provincial insurance plans, which generally follow the Federal model. Funds in a foreign currency, not Canadian dollars, are not insured, such as a US dollar accounts even when held in a registered CDIC financial institutions. <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Investment</b> Contracts with a longer term than 5 years are also not insured. Funds in foreign banks operating in Canada {{may or may not be}} covered depending on whether they are members of CDIC. Some funds in the Registered Retirement Savings Plan or Registered Retirement Income Fund at their bank may not be covered if they are invested in mutual funds or held in specific instruments like debentures issued by government or corporations. The general principle is to cover reasonable deposits and savings, but not deposits deliberately positioned to take risks for gain, such as mutual funds or stocks.|$|E
