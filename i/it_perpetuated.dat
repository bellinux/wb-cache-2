25|$|However, the {{decision}} also has attracted defenders by libertarians: the Cato Institute and the scholars Richard Epstein and Randy Barnett, {{who argue that}} Lochner was correct in its protection of economic liberty. Randy Barnett has argued that Lochners presumption in favor of liberty of contract was basically right; {{the decision}} was wrong only in that <b>it</b> <b>perpetuated</b> the misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment that {{was established in the}} Slaughter-House Cases. According to Barnett, liberty of contract is properly found in the Privileges or Immunities Clause, not in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. David Bernstein, in Rehabilitating Lochner: Defending Individual Rights Against Progressive Reform, argues that the decision in Lochner was well grounded in Supreme Court precedent and that the decision's emphasis on limits to the states' police powers informed the Court's early civil liberties and civil rights cases.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, {{the disease was}} seen as similar to smallpox, due to its {{analogous}} symptoms. The personal physician of the Pope, Giovanni Maria Lancisi, recommended the slaughter of all infected and exposed animals. This policy was not very popular and used only sparingly {{in the first part}} of the century. Later, it was used successfully in several countries, although it was sometimes seen as too costly or drastic, and depended on a strong central authority to be effective (something which was notably lacking in the Dutch Republic). Because of these downsides, numerous attempts were made to inoculate animals against the disease. These attempts met with varying success, but the procedure was not widely used and was no longer practiced at all in 19th-century Western or Central Europe. Rinderpest was an immense problem, but inoculation was not a valid solution: In many cases, it caused too many losses. Even more importantly, <b>it</b> <b>perpetuated</b> the circulation of the virus in the cattle population. The pioneers of inoculation did contribute significantly to knowledge about infectious diseases. Their experiments confirmed the concepts of those who saw infectious diseases as caused by specific agents, and were the first to recognize maternally derived immunity.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the end of}} Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth and the Restoration of Charles II, {{those in}} England and Wales who were not members of the Church of England found {{themselves}} in an uncomfortable position. Several pieces of legislation, known collectively as the Clarendon Code, made their lives difficult. [...] The first restricted public office to Anglicans. [...] The Act of Uniformity the following year was a step too far for many clergymen, and about 2,000 of them left the established church in the Great Ejection of 1662. [...] The third act forbad unauthorised religious meetings of more than five people. [...] The final one prohibited Nonconformist clergymen from living within five miles of a parish from {{which they had been}} banned. [...] Where the ministers went, their flocks tended to follow. Some of these restrictions were ameliorated a generation later, with the passing of the Act of Toleration 1689, which guaranteed freedom of worship for certain groups. It allowed Nonconformists (or Dissenters) their own places of worship and their own teachers and preachers, subject to certain oaths of allegiance and to the registering of these locations and leaders, but <b>it</b> <b>perpetuated</b> their existing social and political disabilities, including their exclusion from political office and also from universities (Oxford and Cambridge were the only universities in England and Wales at that time).|$|E

Liner notes for the single claimed [...] "Truganini was the sole surviving Tasmanian Aborigine, {{the last of her}} race, when she died in 1876." [...] The Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre, representing over 7000 contemporary Tasmanians, called for the single to be boycotted as <b>it</b> <b>perpetuated</b> a 'white' myth about the extinction of Tasmanian Aborigines.

Morris responded with, [...] "My suggestion to these people is to stop shooting themselves in the foot and let a band like Midnight Oil voice its appeal to White Australia on behalf of Black Australia". Critics contended that Morris disparaged Indigenous Australians' ability to represent themselves and overestimated Midnight Oil's ambassadorial powers while diminishing their errors, while some indigenous activists saw benefit in Midnight Oil's highlighting of the issues.
