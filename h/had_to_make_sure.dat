The effects artist looked at NASA footage of floating globules of water to inform the physics of the blood particles. Initially, the blood was to be colored green, but the filmmakers realized that McCoy had referred to Spock as green-blooded.|$|E
5|$|Returning to a {{previous}} setting offered the artists new {{challenges and opportunities}} to expand {{the scope of the}} city. Having the player walk through the streets at night inspired a film noir ambiance. Color shifts and a high degree of contrast pushed the game's look beyond what previous Halo games had offered, but the team <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that even dark portions of the city were playable. The entire core development team looked at commissioned concept paintings to decide how lighting schemes would affect the gameplay. The genre also influenced the character names and archetypes. The player character, for example, fits the concept of a lone, hardboiled detective. To increase the depth of the surroundings, Bungie added touches such as advertisements, trash collectors, and civilian versions of previously seen military hardware.|$|E

In 1528 a royal decree decided that no noble could own more than three clothes of silk. No ladies or maids could wear broad bonnets. Pearls in {{textiles}} as well as textiles containing gold were reserved for royal persons.|$|E

For example, the majority stake he had bought in a chemical company in Griesheim, Germany returned 15 times his investment after two years when the company became part of I. G. Farben. Part of his attraction for investors were the high dividends Kreuger & Toll paid. Therefore, he also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that he had money to pay those dividends.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the Middle Ages, manuals of {{confession}} {{emerged as}} a literary genre. These manuals were guidebooks on how to obtain the maximum benefits from the sacrament. There were two kinds of manuals: those addressed to the faithful, {{so that they could}} prepare a good confession, and those addressed to the priests, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that no sins were left unmentioned and the confession was as thorough as possible. The priest had to ask questions, while being careful not to suggest sins that perhaps the faithful had not thought of and give them ideas. Manuals were written in Latin and in the vernacular.|$|E
25|$|Basel's {{place in}} the last 16 was all but secured, {{although}} they still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> they did not lose to Liverpool in the last game of the first group stage. On the last matchday, Basel were winning 3–0 at half-time through goals from Julio Rossi, Christian Giménez and Timothée Atouba. The second half was a different story, however, and Liverpool fought back to draw 3–3. This was still enough for FCB {{to qualify for the}} next round. In the last 16, Basel faced Manchester United, Juventus, and Deportivo de La Coruña. They had a poor start, losing back to back games against Manchester United at home and Juventus away. FCB then faced Deportivo in a double-header, with the home side winning 1–0 in both games. Arguably, two of FCB's greatest games came next as they held United to a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford and claimed a 2–1 victory over Juventus at St. Jakob-Park. Despite picking up the same number of points as second-placed Juventus, Basel crashed out on goal difference. Basel finished second in the Swiss Super League that season and won the Swiss Cup after beating Neuchâtel Xamax 6–0 in the final.|$|E

25|$|The magistrate's role in {{practice}} faced many other constraints. The runners and yamen officials who {{were sent to}} investigate a crime were locals, often in league with the criminals. Magistrates commonly would therefore set a deadline for bringing in the criminals, threatening to take the policeman's family members as hostage if the deadline was not met. When the accused was brought before him, the magistrate could use torture, such as flogging or making the defendant kneel on an iron chain, but there were clear restrictions. The instruments had to be of a standard size and individually approved by the next higher yamen, and some {{could not be used}} on women or people over the age of seventy. The magistrate could order the use of the ankle-squeezer, for instance, only in cases of murder and robbery, and its use had to be specifically reported to the higher level. Some officials avoided the use of torture because they feared that it would produce false confessions. The magistrate <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that any confession was recorded accurately, word for word, to prevent the clerk from introducing intentional errors that might prejudice the case. The magistrate himself could be punished if he invoked the wrong law or imposed a sentence that was either too harsh or too lenient.|$|E

The car used for the crash was a replica of the original, severed in half prior to filming.

500|$|O'Donnell {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he feels that one problem with games is those that play music non-stop, which he feels detracts from the overall impact. Composers are forced to either write ambient music, he says, or very light music that is not emotionally driven, which he said is a detriment. O'Donnell prefers to write music towards the end of the development cycle, because he would rather score the final timing for things like cinematics and gameplay changes. O'Donnell credits part of the success of the Halo theme to his background writing jingles. For that music, O'Donnell <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> he could write music that would [...] "get in people's heads" [...] after 15 to 30seconds. O'Donnell pushed Bungie to spend money on hiring singers and musicians to record the theme before Macworld as a way to present a strong showing.|$|E

500|$|May {{was delighted}} that Lima [...] "went for {{something}} more fashion-forward" [...] with Susan Sarandon's Queen Narissa. She decided to make {{her look like a}} [...] "runway lady", wearing something that is [...] "still Disney" [...] but also [...] "high fashion, like something John Galliano or Thierry Mugler might design". Since Narissa appears in three media: hand drawn animation, live-action, and computer animation, May <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the costume would be the same throughout in terms of [...] "color, shape, and texture". The costume for Narissa consisted of a leather corset and skirt, which looked [...] "reptilian", as well as a cape. Working with the animators, May incorporated parts of the dragon's form into the costume; the cape was designed to look like wings, the [...] of the skirt wrap around like a tail and a crown that would turn into horns during Narissa's transformation into a dragon.|$|E
500|$|Based on the {{behavior}} of viruses and certain bacteria, the Flood were intended to be [...] "disgusting and nasty". The creatures were constructed from the corpses and bodies of former combatants, so the artists <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the Flood soldiers were recognizable enough while changing their silhouette enough to differentiate them from the uninfected. Many concepts and ideas were discarded due to time constraints—initially, the Flood were intended to convert any species of the alien Covenant into soldiers. [...] "We didn't have the resources to make it happen," [...] McLees recalled, so they modified the game's fiction to suggest that some Covenant were too small or too frail to be combat troops. At one point, the ringworld Halo featured dinosaur-like terrestrial creatures, but these were dropped due to gameplay constraints. An additional consideration was that Bungie felt the presence of other native species would dilute the impact and surprise of the Flood.|$|E
500|$|Bungie began {{development}} of ODST in March 2008. ODST {{was the first}} Bungie title completed {{in less than three}} years, as production lasted 14 months. Since the team—numbering around 70, plus a five-person core design group—had such a small window for development, they had to prioritize features; for example, rather than completely redesigning the enemies, only a small new subset of artificial intelligence behaviors were added. Because the game featured an open world different from most Halo missions, certain gameplay tweaks, such as the revamped weapons and an overhead map, were necessary. Whereas in a traditional Halo game, the designers would know from what locations players would approach groups of enemies, ODST required a different strategy. [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> we had groups of Covenant patrolling the city who could react from wherever you attack from and look intelligent doing it," [...] Creamer said. Though the game engine remained unchanged, graphical enhancements such as fullscreen shader system and parallax mapping added greater detail and realism.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed between October and November 2007 {{in the sixth}} {{production}} block of the series, alongside [...] "Exit Wounds". The sequence of Jack, Ianto and Owen leaving for Gwen's wedding was recorded at Roald Dahl Plass on 25 October 2007. A number of locations {{were used for the}} wedding venue. Producer Richard Stokes notes that [...] "it felt like we were organising a real wedding but one that was being shot in about five different venues". Director Ashley Way states that in directing the wedding scenes, the production team <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the colour scheme co-ordinated in regards to aspects like the bridesmaids costumes and the flower patterns. Costume designer Ray Holman experienced difficulty sourcing a maternity wedding dress to accommodate the nine-month baby bump worn by Eve Myles. He remarks that in trying to source three such dresses from bridal shops in Cardiff he was regarded [...] "as if I was the biggest sinner in the world" [...] and ended up designing the dress worn by Gwen himself.|$|E
500|$|On 20November 2007, a 20th anniversary {{edition of}} The Joshua Tree was released. The album was remastered from the {{original}} analogue recordings {{under the direction of}} the Edge, with the original vinyl album artwork restored. The release was made available in four formats: a single CD; a two-disc deluxe edition with a bonus audio CD of B-sides, rarities, and demos; a three-disc box set with the bonus audio CD and DVD, photograph prints, and hardcover book; and a double vinyl edition. All editions included liner notes by author Bill Flanagan and previously unseen photographs by Anton Corbijn. Manager Paul McGuinness explained, [...] "There has been continuous demand from U2 fans to have The Joshua Tree properly re-mastered. As always, the band <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it was right, and now it is." [...] Some formats include expanded liner notes from the band members, the production team, and Anton Corbijn. In an otherwise favourable review of the remastered album, Andrew Mueller of Uncut said that [...] "any casual listener who can perceive a meaningful difference between this and the original has i) ears like a bat and/or ii) needs to get out more".|$|E
500|$|More {{than one}} scene proved {{problematic}} for Breezy {{during the filming}} of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally {{he would have been}} behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that [...] "By the time we went into it on that one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that she's going to jump out and do it into Scott's arms." [...] In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face.|$|E

500|$|The 2001 film Legally Blonde {{marked a}} turning point in Witherspoon's career; she starred as Elle Woods, a fashion-merchandising major who decides to become a law student in order to follow her ex-boyfriend to Harvard Law School. Witherspoon said about the role, [...] "When I read Legally Blonde, I was like, 'She's from Beverly Hills, she's rich, she's in a sorority. She has a great boyfriend. Oh yeah, she gets dumped. Who cares? I still hate her.' So we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> she was the kind of person you just can't hate." [...] Legally Blonde was a box-office hit, {{grossing}} US$96 million domestically. Witherspoon's performance earned her praise from critics, as the press began referring to her as [...] "the new Meg Ryan". Roger Ebert commented, [...] "Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit", and Salon.com noted that [...] "she [...] delineates Elle's character beautifully". Meanwhile, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer concluded, [...] "Witherspoon is a talented comedian who can perk up a scene just by marching in full of pep and drive and she powers this modest little comedy almost single-handedly." [...] For her work, Witherspoon garnered her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.|$|E

[...] "He hired coaches he trusted, then gave them the resources, {{latitude}} and support they needed to operate as they saw fit – providing they played by the rules."

[...] In 1999, Gable wrote: [...] "Right after I came to coach at the University of Iowa, I {{had a meeting with}} Bump Elliott, who was the Athletic Director. I’ll never forget what Bump said to me: ‘Don’t ask for the moon. Strive to get there, sure, but do it wisely through continuing to build upon what you already have. As you build, come see me, and we’ll see how I can help you out.’ I now call that bit of wisdom the Bump Elliott Rule, and it serves a good reminder to keep things in perspective. Gradual, solid growth is better than any quick fix.""The one thing we emphasized from the start was that our staff <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> we were 100 percent loyal to each other and the university," [...] Elliott said {{at the time of his}} retirement.

500|$|Although Salman Khan was {{initially}} signed {{for the lead}} role, he later withdrew due to creative differences with the director. Shah Rukh Khan (who had originally declined due to a scheduling conflict with Karan Johar's Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna) was later confirmed as Kabir Khan. Khan accepted the role partly because he used to play hockey in college: [...] "I feel hockey as a sport has been monstrously neglected in our country. I used {{to play the game}} during college. In fact, I was quite a good hockey player. So the role was a lot like going back to my past." [...] Some media sources called the actor's role offbeat, since it departed from his usual romantic image and included neither lip synched songs nor a single female lead. Casting of the 16 actresses as the hockey players took over six months. Amin described the process as [...] "very, very difficult" [...] and [...] "very strenuous because the requirement was they had to play – and act". A four-month training camp was held where the girls learned the rules of the game, took acting lessons and followed a strict diet; safety precautions were also taken. According to Amin, [...] "Learning hockey is very tricky unlike, say, football. You {{have to know how to}} hold the stick, how to manoeuvre it, so it doesn't look fake on screen ... For those who were originally players, we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> they were able to act as well. The dialogue was weighty; it isn't frivolous. It has to be delivered with a certain tone, in a certain manner". The actors, including Khan and the rest of the supporting cast, participated in a number of rehearsals and script readings before principal photography began.|$|E
