5|$|According to James, Anne {{wrote to}} him in 1696 {{requesting}} his permission to succeed William, and thereafter promising to restore the Crown to James's line at a convenient opportunity; he <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> his consent. She was probably trying to ensure her own succession by attempting to prevent a direct claim by James.|$|E
5|$|During this process, the Home Office <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Bamber {{the expert}} {{evidence}} it had obtained, so Bamber applied for {{judicial review of}} that decision in November 1994; this resulted in the Home Office handing over its expert evidence. In 1996, without informing Bamber or his lawyers, an Essex police officer destroyed many of the trial exhibits. He {{said he had not}} been aware that the case was ongoing.|$|E
5|$|On Beecham's {{return to}} England in 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert {{together}} that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him the unfettered control {{that he had}} exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again {{it would be as}} a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO).|$|E

5|$|Dead Island, {{originally}} {{announced in}} 2007 by Techland, is an action role-playing survival horror video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, {{it was a}} game about killing zombies, not a game focused on delivering an emotional experience. Until 2011, Techland <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> new information regarding the game as requested by the game's publisher, Deep Silver. With the lack of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had been quietly cancelled. The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately four years after the game's initial announcement.|$|E
5|$|The King and {{parliament}} {{met again}} in February 1310, {{and the proposed}} discussions of Scottish policy were replaced by debate of domestic problems. Edward was petitioned to abandon Gaveston as his counsellor and instead adopt the advice of 21 elected barons, termed Ordainers, who would carry out a widespread reform of both {{the government and the}} royal household. Under huge pressure, Edward agreed to the proposal and the Ordainers were elected, broadly evenly split between reformers and conservatives. While the Ordainers began their plans for reform, Edward and Gaveston took a new army of around 4,700 men to Scotland, where the military situation had continued to deteriorate. Robert the Bruce <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> battle and the campaign progressed ineffectually over the winter until supplies and money ran out in 1311, forcing Edward to return south.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to office, Kogălniceanu {{personally}} organized conspiratorial meetings with the Russian diplomat Aleksandr Nelidov, and approved Russian demands in exchange for co-belligerency. With C. A. Rosetti and Brătianu, he supported the transit of Russian troops and persuaded Carol to accept the Russian alliance, contrary to the initial advice of the Crown Council. He also sought advice on this matter from the French Third Republic, who was {{still one of the}} powers supervising Romania; Louis, duc Decazes, the French Foreign Minister, <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him a reassuring answer, and pointed that, were Romania to join up with Russia, the other powers would cease offering their protection. Making note of this, Kogălniceanu expressed his hope that France would still support his country at the decisive moment.|$|E

5|$|In 1776, Indians at the Bahia {{missions}} {{told the}} soldiers that the Karankawas had massacred {{a group of}} Europeans who had been shipwrecked {{near the mouth of}} the Guadalupe River. After finding the remains of an English commercial frigate, the soldiers warned the Karankawa to refrain from attacking seamen. The soldiers continued to explore the coast, and reported that foreign powers could easily build a small settlement on the barrier islands, which were difficult to access from the mainland, and then ascend the Trinity or San Jacinto Rivers into the heart of Texas. Captain Luis Cazorla, the commander of the La Bahía presidio, recommended that Spain build a small fort on the barrier islands and provide a shallow-draft vessel to continually reconnoiter the coast. The fort would be both a deterrent to the more bloodthirsty tribes and to the English. The Spanish government, fearful of smuggling, <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> permission for a port or a boat on the Texas coast.|$|E
5|$|San Martín was {{not well}} {{received}} in Buenos Aires. Pueyrredón initially <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> further help, citing the conflicts with the federal caudillos {{and the organization of}} a huge royalist army in Cádiz that would try to reconquer the La Plata basin. He thought that Chile should organize the navy against Peru, not Buenos Aires. San Martín discussed with him and finally got financing of 500,000 pesos. He returned to Mendoza with his wife and daughter and received a letter from Pueyrredón, who said that Buenos Aires could only deliver one-third of the promised funds. This complicated the project, as neither Santiago de Chile nor Mendoza had the resources needed. San Martín resigned from the Army, but it is unclear whether his decision to resign was sincere or was to apply pressure to his backers. The government of Buenos Aires still considered San Martín vital to the national defense, so Pueyrredón agreed to pay the 500,000 pesos requested, and encouraged San Martín to withdraw his resignation.|$|E

25|$|The defence case {{began on}} the morning of 12 March 2012 and lasted half a day. The court heard from a number of {{witnesses}} who worked in the offices of Infrastructure Managers Ltd, who spoke {{to the fact that they}} did not see anything out of the ordinary at the premises in Thistle Street on 4 May 2010. Mr Gilroy <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> evidence in his own defence.|$|E
25|$|In time, the ACMA design {{committee}} {{began asking}} Ezekiel for design details, clearly with a mind toward reviewing his work. He <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them. But with {{work on his}} design nearly complete in late 1911, Ezekiel began sending occasional photographs of his work to the ACMA design committee. He asked, however, that these be kept private to reduce interference with his work. A two-thirds size model was finished in early 1912.|$|E
25|$|In the 1939 season, however, Mitchell {{did not do}} {{much work}} because Derbyshire's pace attack was so {{consistently}} effective and he failed to take 100 wickets {{for the first time}} in 11 seasons. Moreover, when he refused to rejoin the team after World War II, the Derbyshire committee <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Mitchell the benefit he had been due to receive in 1940. He did, though, continue to baffle batsmen for Hickleton Main well into his fifties.|$|E

25|$|Although the Steelworkers {{would be}} taking a strike vote on December 17, the New York Times {{reported}} on that same day that the union would consider postponing its strike. The union's strike committee <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Murray the authority to sign a wage pact without approval of the union's membership, and set its next meeting for January 3, 1952. The strike committee's action, requested by Murray, was designed to make calling off a strike much more difficult and thus spur bargaining.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Sangharakshita {{became the}} focus for {{controversy}} when The Guardian newspaper published complaints concerning some of his sexual relationships with FWBO members during the 1970s and 1980s. For a decade following these public revelations, he <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> any response to concerns from within the movement that he had misused his position as a Buddhist teacher to sexually exploit young men. He later addressed the controversy, stressing that his sexual partners were, or appeared to be, willing, and expressed regret for any mistakes.|$|E
25|$|Darrow {{was indicted}} on two charges of jury tampering. His chief {{investigator}} turned state's evidence, and even implicated Samuel Gompers in the bribery attempt. Darrow was in financial difficulty, {{and asked for}} AFL assistance in raising funds for his defense. Gompers <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it. When {{the presidents of the}} United Mine Workers of America and Western Federation of Miners issued an appeal for donations, the AFL Executive Council postponed consideration of a donation until the issue was moot. Darrow was acquitted in his first trial. When charges were brought in the second bribery case, the trial ended in a hung jury.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, up to 21 F1AZs were {{reported}} in storage at AFB Hoedspruit, awaiting a possible buyer. In April 2006, {{it was reported that}} Aerosud had purchased the surviving Mirage F1AZs and spares. On 17 August 2006, French news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that two upgraded ex-South African F1AZs had taken part in a fly-past over Libreville earlier that day in celebration of Gabon's independence day. The refurbishment and upgrade of the aircraft was carried out by Aerosud. Aerosud Group managing director Dr. Paul Potgieter confirmed his company's involvement, but <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> numbers or cite figures.|$|E
25|$|Osborn {{planned to}} send eight flatboats each with 35 {{soldiers}} in {{the first wave of}} his assault. Howe <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the order for the 400-man storming party to attack, waiting for a high tide and hoping that the garrison would evacuate the fort. That evening, Thayer gave the order to abandon Fort Mifflin. The 300 survivors and what equipment could be salvaged were rowed across to Red Bank. Thayer held back a detail of 40 men. These troops burned down the barracks at midnight and soon joined the others in New Jersey. Thayer was the last to leave.|$|E
25|$|The District of Columbia Historic Preservation Review Board {{ruled on}} November 9, 2013, that the {{original}} mansion was historic, but <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> historic protection to the 1956 addition. This removed a major obstacle to the demolition of the 1956 addition. The sale to French Quarter fell through in early December 2013 after the Historic Preservation Review Board denied approval for the six-story addition, saying it would destroy the historic character of the mansion. The Dupont Current newspaper reported on December 11 that another buyer had emerged, but no details were provided (although the property was rumored to be turned into an embassy or luxury condominiums).|$|E
