5|$|Many {{different}} {{energy sources}} {{can be used}} for welding, including a gas flame, an electric arc, a laser, an electron beam, friction, and ultrasound. While often an <b>industrial</b> <b>process,</b> welding may be performed in many different environments, including in open air, under water, and in outer space. Welding is a hazardous undertaking and precautions are required to avoid burns, electric shock, vision damage, inhalation of poisonous gases and fumes, and exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, {{demand for}} {{alkaline}} substances increased. A new <b>industrial</b> <b>process</b> developed by Nicolas Leblanc of Issoundun, France enabled cheap large-scale production of sodium carbonate (soda ash). In this Leblanc process, common salt {{is converted to}} soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, releasing hydrogen chloride as a by-product. Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries, the excess HCl was vented into the air. After {{the passage of the}} act, soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.|$|E

This {{is a white}} paper that describes the role of Systems Engineering in Intelligent <b>Industrial</b> <b>Processes.</b> We first {{try to get a}} grasp of what we mean with Intelligent <b>Industrial</b> <b>Processes</b> and Systems Engineering. The state of the art for Systems Engineering is reviewed with systems life cycle processes and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). It is followed by current problems in process industry and presents MBSE as a partial solution for an industrial framework towards “Intelligent” <b>industrial</b> <b>processes.</b> The white pa- per clearly shows that a lack of consideration of Systems Engineering in <b>industrial</b> <b>processes</b> leads to a deficiency in understanding indus- trial processes and impacts its leadership.

5|$|Solar {{heating systems}} are a well known second-generation {{technology}} and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system {{to move the}} heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses. The heat can also be used for <b>industrial</b> <b>process</b> applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.|$|E
5|$|The biotechnological {{applications}} of toxin-antitoxin systems {{have begun to}} be realised by several biotechnology organisations. A primary usage is in maintaining plasmids in a large bacterial cell culture. In an experiment examining {{the effectiveness of the}} hok/sok locus, it was found that segregational stability of an inserted plasmid expressing beta-galactosidase was increased by between 8 and 22 times compared to a control culture lacking a toxin-antitoxin system. In large-scale microorganism processes such as fermentation, progeny cells lacking the plasmid insert often have a higher fitness than those who inherit the plasmid and can outcompete the desirable microorganisms. A toxin-antitoxin system maintains the plasmid thereby maintaining the efficiency of the <b>industrial</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

5|$|As an <b>industrial</b> <b>process,</b> {{the cost}} of welding {{plays a crucial role}} in {{manufacturing}} decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes {{the cost of}} the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated <b>industrial</b> <b>process,</b> and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E
5|$|Kistiakowsky {{was unhappy}} {{with the state of}} American {{knowledge}} of explosives and propellants. Conant established the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL) near the laboratories of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania in October 1940, and Kistiakowsky initially supervised its activities, making occasional visits; but Conant did not formally appoint him as its Technical Director until the spring of 1941. Although initially hampered by a shortage of facilities, the ERL grew from five staff in 1941 to a wartime peak of 162 full-time laboratory staff in 1945. An important field of research was RDX. This powerful explosive had been developed by the British before the war. The challenge was to develop an <b>industrial</b> <b>process</b> that could produce it on a large scale. RDX was also mixed with TNT to produce Composition B, which was widely used in various munitions, and torpex, which was used in torpedoes and depth charges. Pilot plants were in operation by May 1942, and large-scale production followed in 1943.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{developed}} for welding aluminium and other non-ferrous {{materials in the}} 1940s, GMAW was soon applied to steels because it provided faster welding time compared to other welding processes. The cost of inert gas limited its use in steels until several years later, when the use of semi-inert gases such as carbon dioxide became common. Further developments during the 1950s and 1960s gave the process more versatility and as a result, it became a highly used <b>industrial</b> <b>process.</b> Today, GMAW {{is the most common}} industrial welding process, preferred for its versatility, speed and the relative ease of adapting the process to robotic automation. Unlike welding processes that do not employ a shielding gas, such as shielded metal arc welding, it is rarely used outdoors or in other areas of air volatility. A related process, flux cored arc welding, often does not use a shielding gas, but instead employs an electrode wire that is hollow and filled with flux.|$|E
5|$|The {{major reasons}} for rising {{political}} tensions among the Finns were the autocratic {{rule of the}} Russian Czar and the undemocratic class system of the estates of the realm. The system originated in the Swedish Empire regime, preceding the Russian power, and divided the Finnish people into two groups, separated economically, socially and politically. Finland's population grew rapidly in the 19th century (from 860,000 in 1810 to 3,130,000 in 1917), and a class of industrial and agrarian workers and property-less peasants emerged. The Industrial Revolution was rapid in Finland, though it started later than {{in the rest of}} Western Europe. Industrialization was financed by the state, and some of the social problems associated with the <b>industrial</b> <b>process</b> were diminished via control of the administration. Among urban workers, socioeconomic problems steepened during periods of industrial depression. The position of rural workers had worsened {{since the end of the}} 19th century, as farming became more efficient and market-oriented and the gradually developing industry did not fully utilize the rapid population growth of the countryside.|$|E
