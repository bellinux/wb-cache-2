It was one of then-owner Jack Kent Cooke's final acts before selling the team to Jerry Buss during that summer. While Magic dazzled in his rookie season, Kareem would enjoy an MVP campaign in the Lakers' 60-22 regular season.

Off-duty, many of us work out, even though we ride bicycles at work, and we eat right to keep our bodies healthy. We do this {{because it is the}} smart, safe and healthy thing to do. So with all of this, why would any male bicycle officer resist the use of a noseless saddle to keep {{a very important part of}} his body healthy and safe? In January 2006, male Chicago police officers assigned to bicycle patrol had an opportunity to take part in a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) study. The purpose of the study was to examine the use of bicycle saddles as they relate to genital numbness and sexual dysfunction. Briefly stated, the study concluded that groin pressure from traditional (nosed) saddles was the primary contributor to sexual dysfunction experienced by bicycle officers. As a study participant, I was required to remove the traditional nosed saddles from my department and personal bicycles and replace them with no-nose saddles. While study participants were offered a vast variety of no-nosed saddles to choose from, I chose the ISM Touring saddle. I’ll admit I did not have a “love at first sight ” relationship with this saddle.
