40|$|Autosomal recessive  {{peripheral}} neuropathy with neuromyotonia  (ARAN-NM)   {{is a relatively}} newly described  disease associated  with mutations  in the HINT 1 gene.   It accounts  for a significant  part of the poorly  differentiated  forms  of axonal polyneuropathies.   We present the first in Russia description of the genetically confirmed case of ARAN-NM in a boy aged 14 years and 11 months without the hereditary-tainted anamnesis. On presentation,  the patient experienced  progressive  distal muscular weakness, asymmetric foot deformity,  gait disorders  and minimal manifestations  of neuromyotonia  (stiffness  in the fingers).   During examination,  we detected {{an increase in the}} level of creatine phosphokinase up to 635 U/l, a <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduction</b> of motor and, to a lesser extent, sensory fibers  of  the  peripheral  nerves  (according  to  the  stimulation  electromyography,  EMG),  denervation-reinnervation  changes,  single positive acute waves, fibrillation potentials, complex repeated discharge (according to the data of needle EMG). In the study of exome, a homozygous mutation c. 110 G>C, p. R 37 P was determined in exon 01 of the HINT 1 gene, which confirmed the presence of ARAN-NM. A molecular-genetic  examination of the patient's immediate relatives was carried out. The described case is compared with literature data. An overview of currently available information on ARAN-NM is provided. Diagnostic criteria of the disease are presented. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} injecting morphin in right vagus dogs is to slow or {{practically}} to stop auricular systoles, the circulation being maintained by ectopic, independent, ventricular contractions. The function of conduction is, relatively speaking, undisturbed. The fact that after morphin injections {{there is little}} or no <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduction</b> in right vagus dogs and a profound one in left vagus dogs may be used as a factor in distinguishing between them, especially when there is a reduction in rate greater than usual in left vagus dogs. The effect on left vagus dogs is to slow the rate of the auricles moderately and to increase the length of conduction, so that partial auriculoventricular block or complete auriculoventricular dissociation results. These are precisely the results that have been obtained by faradic stimulation of one vagus nerve, the other being divided. There are slight differences in the results obtained between the two methods, but the explanation for these is probably to be found in the differences in the nature of the experiments. When faradic stimulation is employed, the stimulus is applied a short time only,—in our experiments for periods not longer than ten seconds. The occurrence of the maximum effect is sudden and does not provide for a gradual introduction of the ventricles to new conditions. In right vagus stimulation the ventricles usually stop beating. A gradual introduction is, however, not always necessary, as may be seen in figures 5 and 6 of the paper (4) already quoted, where idioventricular rhythms began without delay. Another difference between the two methods is found in the degree of effect produced on stimulating the left vagus; in the faradic method the change in conduction varies from mere lengthening to a condition so profound that complete dissociation results; these degrees have been described. The morphin method usually produces only incomplete dissociations. Twice only was complete dissociation produced. The similarity between the results of the two methods is sufficiently close to render it likely that in obtaining them an identical mechanism in the heart is involved. It may, therefore, be concluded that the inconstant action of the vagus resulting from morphin injections, called "ungleichartig" by Einthoven and Wieringa, appears so on account of the fact that the predominating effect of morphin may be exercised now on one and now on the opposite cardio-inhibitory system, and not, as was suggested, on account of a shifting of predominance from one to another of the fiber tracts in the vagi themselves. The explanation offered as the results of this series of experiments differs from theirs. The results obtained substantiate the conclusion reached in the former series, that the two vagi act differently. A fact relating to the mechanism of the right vagus nerve can now be added, from a consideration of the cardiac mechanism in right vagus dogs, namely, that derangements in conduction result, to a very slight extent only, as the effect of the influence of the right vagus nerve Although no solution of the production of the extreme grades of sinus irregularity seen in morphin intoxication is offered, the failure of this rhythm to be converted into a more profound irregularity may be explained. There seems little doubt that the occasion for the occurrence of an independent ventricular rhythm in these experiments was due to the slowness of the auricular rate resulting from morphin injection. But in the cases of sinus irregularity (Nos. 683, 685, and 700), the rate of the auricles was never sufficiently low for the ventricles to initiate an independent rhythm. The lowest rates recorded in them were 66. 3 (No. 683), 85. 7 (No. 685), and 91. 4 (No. 700), and it appears that before an independent ventricular rhythm occurred in any of the experiments, the auricular rate had always fallen below 41 (Nos. 686, 688, 697, 698, 706, 715, and 721). On the other hand, the ventricular rates in the cases of sinus irregularity were higher than the highest idioventricular rates observed and no advantage could consequently have been gained by the onset of a new rhythm. No. 683 was an exception, but the rate in this case exceeded the idioventricular rates of all but Nos. 702 and 706 and was only 11. 1 beats below that of the highest recorded. Whether sinus irregularity itself is a morphin irregularity the result of a sino-auricular block, in the sense of Eyster and Meek, has already been discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background P-wave {{dispersion}} (P d) {{is a new}} ECG index used {{in human}} cardiology and veterinary medicine. It {{is defined as the}} difference between the maximum and the minimum P-wave duration recorded from multiple different ECG leads. So far no studies were performed assessing the importance of P-wave dispersion in dogs. Methods The current study was aimed at determining proper value of P d in healthy dogs (group I), dogs with chronic valvular disease (group II) and dogs with <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> supraventricular <b>conduction</b> (group III).

P-wave duration was calculated in 9 ECG leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V 1, V 2, V 4) from 5 cardiac cycles. Results The proper P-wave dispersion in healthy dogs was determined at up to 24 ms.

Compound nerve action potentials and nerve blood flow were evaluated from the start of compression until 30 minutes after release. Endoneurial microvascular permeability was evaluated with Evans Blue albumin.

40|$|Evidence is {{not wanting}} that {{the heart is}} {{affected}} {{in the process of}} anaphylactic shock. Morphological alterations following the injection of foreign protein into sensitized animals, local areas of degeneration of the myocardial cells with round cell infiltration or, later, scar formation, have been reported by Longcope (11), Klinge (9), and by Seegal, Seegal and Jost (14). Electrocardiograms recorded in the intact animal during anaphylactic shock, demonstrating <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduction</b> and abnormalities <b>of</b> origin and spread of the excitatory process in the heart, have been described by Auer and Robinson (1), Hecht and Wengraf (8), Koenigsfeld and Oppenheimer (10) and by Criep (5). But the exact nature of these effects, whether intrinsic, or secondary to asphyxia (5), or to the remote elaboration of substances which secondarily react upon the myocardium (3), is not clearly defined. The proof that any organ is intrinsically affected by the process of anaphylaxis must rest upon certain distinct criteria: (a) It should be shown that the capacity of the tissue to react specifically upon exposure to the appropriate antigen survives its isolation from the remainder of the animal and persists in the organ perfused or immersed in artificial solution, and, (b) the particular reaction should be evoked by doses of antigen which fail to affect an organ isolated from an unsensitized or desensitized animal and should diminish in intensity or disappear with successive exposures thereto. The essential features of anaphylaxis have, indeed, been demonstrated in this fashion in vitro upon isolated segments of intestine (6) from sensitized guinea pigs and upon the isolated uterus (13) from simiIar animals.

Here, we applied this approach to investigate sensitivity and specificity of human and automated classification in discriminating images of atrial working myocardium and specialized tissue <b>of</b> the <b>conduction</b> system. Two-dimensional image sequences from atrial working myocardium and nodal tissue of isolated perfused rodent hearts were acquired using a fiber-optics confocal microscope (Leica FCM 1000). We compared two methods for local application of extracellular fluorophores: topical via pipette and with a dye carrier. Eight blinded examiners evaluated 162 randomly selected images of atrial working myocardium (n = 81) and nodal tissue (n = 81). In addition, we evaluated the images using automated classification. Blinded examiners achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 99. 2 ± 0. 3 % and 98. 0 ± 0. 7 %, respectively, with the dye carrier method of dye application. Sensitivity and specificity was similar for dye application via a pipette (99. 2 ± 0. 3 % and 94. 0 ± 2. 4 %, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity for automated methods of tissue discrimination were similarly high. Human and automated classification achieved high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating atrial working myocardium and nodal tissue.

40|$|Since rheumatic fever {{is known}} to be {{initiated}} by streptococcal infections, considerable attention has been focussed on streptolysin 0 because of its profound effects on the heart (1 - 3). Appreciable circumstantial evidence has accumulated which is compatible with the concept that it may play an etiological role in this illness (4 - 6). For example, the rapidly lethal effect of intravenous streptolysin O for rabbits and mice is preceded by a dramatic disruption of heart function, as evidenced by electrocardiography (6 - 8).

We aimed to investigate the incidence <b>of</b> cardiac <b>conduction</b> disorders after percutaneous aortic valve implantation (PAVI) and to identify possible clinical factors associated with their development. Methods We studied 34 patients (mean age 80 +/- 8 years, 18 male) who underwent PAVI with the CoreValve bioprosthesis (Corevalve Inc, Irvine, CA). Electrocardiographic evaluation was performed pre- and postprocedurally, and at 1 -week and 1 -month follow-up. Other clinical variables {{were obtained from the}} medical history, echocardiography, and angiography. Results After PAVI, 7 patients required PPI, all of whom developed total atrioventricular block within 3 days postprocedurally. A smaller left ventricular outflow tract diameter (20. 3 +/- 0. 5 vs 21. 6 +/- 1. 8 cm, P =. 01), more left-sided heart axis (- 20 degrees +/- 29 degrees vs 19 degrees +/- 36 degrees, P =. 02), more mitral annular calcification (10 +/- 1 vs 5 +/- 4 mm, P =. 008), and a smaller postimplantation indexed effective orifice area (0. 86 +/- 0. 20 vs 1. 10 +/- 0. 26 cm(2) /m(2), P =. 04) were associated with PPI. The incidence of new left bundle-branch block (LBBB) was 65 % and was associated with a deeper implantation of the prosthesis: 10. 2 +/- 2. 3 mm in the new-LBBB group versus 7. 7 +/- 3. 1 mm in the non-LBBB group (P =. 02).

40|$|Experience of endocardial pacing in eighty-two {{patients}} with atrioventricular block after myocardial infarction is described. A unipolar pacing wire was passed into an antecubital fossa vein and {{passed into the}} right atrium and wedged into {{the apex of the}} right ventricle under radiological control using an image intensifier. All patients were attached to an external demand unit set at 60 /min which will pace if there is asystole longer than 1 sec. The disadvantages of pacing are discussed. A fall in mortality occurred from 71 % of unpaced patients to 38 % of thirty-seven patients where demand pacing was given. When suppressant drugs (lignocaine, procainamide and quinidine) were given in addition to pacing the mortality dropped to 11 % of twenty-seven patients. The disadvantages of pacing are few and it is considered that suppressant drugs are only used with safety when a pacing system has been installed. ACUTE myocardial infarction is complicated by complete heart block in 5 - 8 % of all patients (Brown, Hunt & Sloman, 1969) and when untreated carries a mortality rate ranging between 48 - 71 % Transvenous endocardial pacing for the manage-ment of Adams-Stokes disease is now established as a satisfactory method of treatment. More recently temporary transvenous pacing has been successfully used for the treatment <b>of</b> the acute <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> atrio-ventricular <b>conduction</b> which may follow acute myocardial infarction (Epstein et al., 1966; Harris & Bluestone, 1966; Lassers & Julian, 1968). During the past 9 years we have treated ninety-five {{patients with}} second degree or complete atrioventricular block complicating acute myocardial infarction. The majority of these patients have been referred to our unit from other hospitals and hence there must be some element of selection which might have in-fluenced our results.

40|$|<b>Disturbances</b> <b>of</b> interatrial <b>conduction</b> {{are linked}} to {{supraventricular}} arrhythmias. Previous {{studies have shown that}} these disturbances can be detected non-invasively as distinctive appearances of the orthogonal P wave using signal-averaged P-wave analysis (PSAECG). Orthogonal recordings (VCG) are however scarce in clinical practice for practical reasons. The aim of the presented study was to explore the possibility of mathematically transforming conventional 12 -lead ECGs into orthogonal P-wave data with preserved information content regarding P-wave morphology. If feasible, the method would then be used to analyse P-wave data from healthy adult men and women of all ages in order to provide a first reference material of the “normal” P wave for future studies. Study I evaluated the feasibility of lead conversion (ECG into VCG) in both healthy individuals and arrhythmia patients. The study compared P waves from recorded and derived VCG and it was found that information <b>of</b> interatrial <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> is preserved. Study II further evaluated this method in a similar material. Different variations of ECG data mimicking true clinical conditions were explored regarding the preservation of P-wave data. It was found that PSAECG is a robust analysis method also in a proposed clinical setting. Study III and IV were devoted to the analysis of P-wave data retrieved from a large material of healthy individuals using the previously validated method. The main finding of Study III was that P-wave morphologies previously observed in arrhythmia patients were commonly observed also in this normal population. The changes were, however, mostly found in the higher age groups, which is in keeping with the known fact that many arrhythmias are more common with increasing age. In Study IV, a long-term follow-up of the “normal” P-wave morphology was conducted, where it was found that P-wave morphology is mostly unaltered after three years. However, in a small number of individuals, discrete changes were observed that support the theory that age-related changes influence interatrial conduction and may implore susceptibility for developing arrhythmias. The presented study adds to the increasing knowledge about interatrial conduction. It provides a validated method for non-invasive exploration of he impulse propagation and also a reference material of the “normal” signal-averaged P-wave morphology...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} {{that a variety of}} pathological conditions induces structural and electrical remodeling of the heart which can lead to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Clinically, structural remodeling is characterized by changes in the shape, size and function of the heart. These changes are based on diverse and complex cellular reactions to injury and involve both cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes. Histopathologically, remodeling typically involves cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, activation and proliferation of fibroblast, increased extracellular matrix deposition and cell death. Functionally, structural remodeling induces mechanical dysfunction and is accompanied by an increased likelihood of occurrence of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias (Adamson et al., 2005). The electrical remodeling is usually defined as changes related to ion channels, transporters, passive electrical properties, redistribution of the gap junctions and it involves <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> the initiation, <b>conduction,</b> and coordination <b>of</b> the electrical stimulus in the heart. An increase in temporal variability of repolarization has been found in different pathologies to follow the electrical remodeling of the heart. In the first part of my work I have studied heterocellular electrotonic interactions between myofibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, whereas in the second part I have focused on temporal variability of ventricular cardiomyocytes repolarization. In the appendix I have studied the mechanisms of a way to electrically elicit action potentials in single cells: “the anode break excitation”...|$|R

40|$|Configurations and {{calculations}} in {{the limb}} lead {{were conducted in}} normal horses {{as a part of}} project in electrocardiographic studies. The results thus obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Cardiac displacement may be observed in the limb lead by the directions of recordings of R_ and R_ waves. Although 40 % of dropped heart and 30 % of transversed heart were observed, 30 % could not be classified to any types. 2. The intricate triphasic waves in P wave were found in from 70 to 80 %. Appearance of this type was found usually in normal horses in the limb lead. 3. Isoelectric waves in the PR(PQ) were shown in from 70 to 80 %, but other cases indicated descending, ascending and vibratory. No appearances of isoelectric waves were ever found in the latter cases, except for the presence <b>of</b> <b>disturbances,</b> in the results of calculations of PR(PQ) intervals. Therefore, it will be thought that the measurement of PR(PQ) intervals in <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> auriculoventricular <b>conduction</b> has an important significance. 4. Notchings on the down or upstroke were found 20 % in R_I, 10 % in R_ and 20 % in R_, and then, notchings of the apex of R waves in R_ and R_ were seen 20 and 30 % respectively. The appearance of notching in negative R, except for R_I, seemed to have some correlations with the cardiac displacement. 5. Arc curved S waves were found in 80 % in lead I, 66 % in lead II and 90 % in lead III. They appeared on the terminal part of the downstroke of R and succeeded to RS-T segments. 6. In RS-T segments or junctions, each 60 % in leads I and II, and 80 % in lead III indicated isoelectric types. In other cases were found the types of descending, ascending and slight vibratory to the zero line. 7. Monophasic negative waves were always observed in the T wave of lead I. In leads II and III, 66 and 90 % of them indicated monophasic positive waves. Other cases were the diphasic which showed positive deflections after negative. 8. The amplitudes in each wave were higher in the mean values than those of LANNEK & RUTQVIST. The authors considered that such results may be ascribed to the position differences of electrodes. The mean values of durations and intervals nearly approached the results reported by DUKES & BATT and by LANNEK & RUTQVIST...|$|R
