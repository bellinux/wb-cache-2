40|$|This article details {{steps in}} {{creating}} low-power artificial muscles using 3 D printing. It describes a manufacturing {{system that can}} be used to fabricate seamless tubular dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA), for eventual use in biorobotic devices. The focus is on producing passive elastomeric components of DEA and the dimensional changes that occur after printing is complete. A four-axis printing system is described, capable of spray depositing multilayer tubular silicone membranes onto an air-permeable mandrel. Mechanical strain was imparted in the membranes by means of inflation. A laser measurement system was constructed to act as a 3 D scanner, which measured the shape of the inflated ‘‘balloon. ’’ The surface shape was reconstructed in software using the parametric modeling tool Grasshopper. Seamless auxetic tessellations were calculated across the entire surface, and then converted to CNC GCode. These toolpaths were then physically extruded over the surface of the balloon, stacked five layers high. When the <b>extruded</b> <b>silicone</b> structure was completely cured, the pneumatic strain was released, allowing the structure to collapse evenly. The compression in the printed structure was balanced by the tension in the stretched membranes, thus producing a minimum energy structure...|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, the {{combined}} companies established standard wall and corner guards for the architectural market and expanded their inflatable seal business. Midway through the decade, Pawling diversified into mill mixing and <b>extruding</b> of high-purity <b>silicone</b> (then an elastomer) for electrical wire and cable insulation. By {{the end of}} the decade, the company had branched out into molding of silicone and plastics. The company shortened its name to Pawling Corporation in 1987.|$|R
