50|$|In September 1998, Jean-Claude Bianco, a fisherman, found east of Riou Island, {{south of}} Marseille, a silver <b>identity</b> <b>bracelet</b> (gourmette) bearing {{the names of}} Saint-Exupéry and of his wife Consuelo and his American publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock, hooked {{to a piece of}} fabric, presumably from his flight suit. The {{recovery}} of his bracelet was an emotional event in France, where Saint-Exupéry had by then assumed the mantle of a national icon, and some disputed its authenticity as it was found far from his intended flight path, implying that the aircraft might not have been shot down.|$|E
50|$|This {{science fiction}} novel {{takes place in}} the year 2203, if we take {{literally}} the age of 250 years given for a Korean War <b>identity</b> <b>bracelet</b> that is dated 1953. A rogue planet, populated by strange machines known as Pyramids, has stolen the Earth from the Solar system, taking it off into interstellar space. The moon has been 'ignited' by alien technology to serve as a miniature sun around which both planets orbit. This new sun is rekindled every 5 years, though as the book opens, the rekindling is nearly overdue and there is fear among the populace that it may never happen again.|$|E
5000|$|Rodney {{wakes up}} back in the present day on his birthday, on which he {{receives}} an <b>identity</b> <b>bracelet</b> from Del with the name [...] "Rooney". Del's application for a council grant has been rejected, and Raquel receives a letter from her estranged parents, who want to meet her again. It emerges that Rodney and Cassandra have been trying for a baby, which leads to an unsuspecting Uncle Albert drinking one of Cassandra's urine specimens, believing it to be apple juice. Meanwhile at Sid's cafe, Trigger is telling everyone in earshot about a medal he received from the local council for using the same broom for twenty years, {{despite the fact that}} it has actually had 17 new heads and 14 new handles in that time. Del buys tickets for himself and Rodney to attend a publican's fancy dress birthday party, Cassandra goes to Spain with her mother, and Raquel and Damien visit her parents.|$|E
30|$|The {{parents of}} 60 {{children}} allowed {{their children to}} participate; the children were aged 5 – 16  years. Of the participants, 30 were asked to wear QR code <b>identity</b> <b>bracelets,</b> and 30 wore necklaces for 1  week. There were 20 children each in the age ranges of 5 – 8, 9 – 12, and 13 – 16  years.|$|R
50|$|British and Empire/Commonwealth forces (Australia, Canada, and New Zealand) {{were issued}} {{essentially}} identical identification discs of basic pattern during the Great War, Second World War and Korea, though official identity discs were frequently supplemented by private-purchase {{items such as}} <b>identity</b> <b>bracelets,</b> particularly favoured by sailors who rightly believed the official discs were unlikely to survive long immersion in water.|$|R
40|$|Identifying {{patients}} in hospital: are more adverse events waiting to happen? In November 2005, the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) published a directive concern-ing <b>identity</b> <b>bracelets</b> in hospitals, {{and set a}} deadline of May 2006 for trusts to comply. 1 It outlined that all inpatients should wear iden-tification bracelets unless they do not consent, or there is good clinical reason and a formal risk assessment is undertaken to confirm this. In June 2006, in a large UK university hospital, we conducted a prospective review of 54 emergency orthopaedic admissions to assess adherence to the recommendations. Data wer...|$|R
30|$|The {{first group}} {{consisted}} of 54 volunteers of various demographics. There were 18 volunteers {{in each of the}} age ranges of 18 – 30, 31 – 50, and 51 – 70  years. In total, 27 female and 27 male volunteers participated in the study. Of the participants, 27 had no computer experience, and 27 used computers daily for such activities as email, word processing, and internet use. In each group, nine participants were requested to wear each of the QR Code Identity necklace, QR Code <b>Identity</b> <b>bracelet,</b> and QR Code Identity card for 1  week.|$|E
30|$|To receive treatment, {{each patient}} first needs to {{register}} with the hospital system. A unique online profile, password, identification number, and QR code are generated for each patient, and a bracelet containing the QR code {{is placed on the}} patient’s wrist. Incoming patients are also required to provide a detailed medical history. In most hospitals, patients complete a paper copy of the form; however, in our system, patients are encouraged to use on online form, which can be accessed by scanning the QR code on the <b>identity</b> <b>bracelet.</b> The form includes an emergency contact phone number, address, telephone number, blood type, contact information of a person with the same blood type, allergies, illnesses, special conditions, current medications, and other information.|$|E
40|$|Medication errors {{account for}} a {{significant}} number of medical errors. Giving medications to patients is an activity that carries a high risk of error. In an effort to improve patient safety in this area several approaches have been employed. Many of these have taken a systems approach in that they consider how organisational factors such as medicines management, staffing levels, ward layout, shift patterns and staff training have contributed to the errors. None of these studies describe errors in detailed form at task level. This Thesis addresses the gap in knowledge by presenting a systematic analysis of the component tasks of hospital drug administration where none exists and goes on to describe novel design artefacts that assist the identification of drugs. The thesis highlights how hierarchical task analysis, a human factors technique, {{can be applied to the}} hospital drug administration task. Task analysis techniques have been used in many high-risk domains in industry as a means of analysing human activity in complex systems but remains an underused technique in health care. Used with the Systematic Human Error Reduction and Prediction Approach (SHERPA), hierarchical task analysis provides an effective way of predicting where errors in the drug administration task are likely to occur. SHERPA uses a taxonomy of human error modes to highlight types of error and makes suggestions to reduce these errors. Medication errors take many forms however it was decided to focus on the immediate interaction between the nurse and the patient. The measures considered to potentially have a significant influence were adding conspicuous labelling to medication packages. These were enhanced by icons intended to represent categories of drugs. Constructing a three dimensional representation of the icon design was considered to provide nurses with an additional channel of information. Technological solutions were proposed and a patient <b>identity</b> <b>bracelet</b> that uses a programmable chip to link the patient to their prescribed medication was viewed as having a huge potential to simplify the checking aspect of administering medications in which the nurse compares a medication order which is often badly written with available drug stock. The device prevents nurses giving medications to the wrong patient. It also prevents them administering an overdose.

50|$|The only {{clue to the}} woman's <b>identity</b> is a <b>bracelet</b> with {{a family}} crest. Nancy, of course, sets out to track the crest, {{discovering}} {{it belongs to the}} Eldridge family of St. Louis.|$|R
30|$|We have {{developed}} a QR Code Identity Tag system to {{be integrated into the}} Turkish healthcare system. It consists of a QR code-based medical identification alert system and a patient identification system for hospital environments. A unique QR code tag is generated for each member of the medical identification alert system and each patient. When used to facilitate medical identification alerts, the QR Code Identity Tag can be placed on a bracelet, necklace or identification card, whereas while on hospital grounds, patients need to wear QR Code <b>Identity</b> <b>bracelets.</b> The QR codes contain links to the QR Code Identity web page, which contains detailed information about the QR code holder. The code is scanned and decoded using the smartphone application or any QR code scanner. This application provides hierarchical levels of privacy, so that emergency medical responders (e.g., paramedics, firefighters, or police) can access more details than the average smartphone user can. Emergency medical responders and medical care providers can instantly retrieve a patient’s medical history to provide more informed medical care.|$|R
30|$|For this study, we {{designed}} a QR Code Identity Tag system to integrate into the Turkish healthcare system. This system provides QR code-based medical identification alerts and an in-hospital patient identification system. Every {{member of the}} medical system is assigned a unique QR Code Tag; to facilitate medical identification alerts, the QR Code Identity Tag can be worn as a bracelet or necklace or carried as an ID card. Patients must always possess the QR Code <b>Identity</b> <b>bracelets</b> within hospital grounds. These QR code bracelets link to the QR Code Identity website, where detailed information is stored; a smartphone or standalone QR code scanner {{can be used to}} scan the code. The design of this system allows authorized personnel (e.g., paramedics, firefighters, or police) to access more detailed patient information than the average smartphone user: emergency service professionals are authorized to access patient medical histories to improve the accuracy of medical treatment. In Istanbul, we tested the self-designed system with 174 participants. To analyze the QR Code Identity Tag system’s usability, the participants completed the System Usability Scale questionnaire after using the system.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout {{the known}} cyclotides loop 1 {{is the most}} conserved. [...] Apart from the six {{cysteine}} residues, the glutamic acid and serine/threonine residues of loop 1 are the only residues to have 100% <b>identity</b> across the <b>bracelet</b> and Möbius subfamilies. Furthermore, the remaining residue of this loop exhibits only a conservative change i.e. glycine/alanine. [...] This loop is believed {{to play an important}} role in stabilizing the cyclotide structure through hydrogen bonding with residues from loops 3 and 5.|$|R
50|$|The International Identity Federation {{was formed}} in Scotland during 2006. IDFed {{provides}} a web-based {{solution to the problem}} of identification of injured or distressed travellers. Members are issued with a unique number embossed onto an <b>identity</b> tag or <b>bracelet.</b> They use a forum to log their movements and this relates back to a secure data base controlled by a 24-hour monitoring service. In the event of a member being found helpless, the 18-digit unique number (created using an algorithm) is used to inform next of kin or employers and aid in the treatment and/or repatriation of the member. For those undertaking particularly hazardous or dangerous journeys, DNA profiling is also offered through a UK Department of Justice approved specialist DNA laboratory based at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow.|$|R
