The arc heater can be configured to produce a very peaked enthalpy distribution across the nozzle exit, which can give local total enthalpies roughly twice the bulk average level. Facility operations have demonstrated mass flow rates from 0.07-0.18 kg/s. The corresponding maximum run duration is 90-200 s. The maximum operating pressure for the arc heater is 20 atmospheres. A compressed air driven ejector pump provides vacuum conditions in the test section vessel during test runs. The ejector pump has produced test section pressures as low as 4.5 kPa (0.65 psia) without the arc heater running. A mechanical vacuum pump is available to provide a high <b>initial</b> <b>vacuum</b> in the facility's 4.25 cubic meter vacuum tank. The vacuum capability of the facility {{enables the use of}} high expansion ratio nozzles with the arc heater. A programmable, 3-axis traverse system allows probe surveys to be performed within a space of 20 cm wide, 23 cm long and 30 cm deep (8 x 9 x 12 inches). This system can be used to mount models or test articles as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of construction {{materials such as}} concrete from lunar soils {{without the use of}} water requires a different methodology than that used for conventional terrestrial concrete.

In both cases, bending, triaxial compression, extension, and hydrostatic tests will be performed to define the stress-strain strength response of the resulting materials.

40|$|For any <b>vacuum</b> <b>initial</b> data set, {{we define}} a local, non-negative scalar {{quantity}} which vanishes at every {{point of the}} data hypersurface {{if and only if}} the data are Kerr initial data. Our scalar quantity only depends on the quantities used to construct the <b>vacuum</b> <b>initial</b> data set which are the Riemannian metric defined on the initial data hypersurface and a symmetric tensor which plays the role of the second fundamental form of the embedded initial data hypersurface. The dependency is algorithmic in the sense that given the initial data one can compute the scalar quantity by algebraic and differential manipulations, being thus suitable for an implementation in a numerical code. The scalar could also be useful in studies of the non-linear stability of the Kerr solution because it serves to measure the deviation of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>initial</b> data set from the Kerr initial data in a local and algorithmic way.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove two theorems on initial data for general relativity. The results present “rigidity {{phenomena}} ” for the extrinsic curvature, {{caused by the}} negativity of the scalar curvature. More precisely, Theorem 1 states {{that in the case}} of non-vacuum initial data if the metric has everywhere non-positive scalar curvature then the extrinsic curvature cannot be compactly supported. Theorem 4 states a similar but sharper fact for <b>vacuum</b> <b>initial</b> data, namely if the scalar curvature is somewhere negative then a <b>vacuum</b> <b>initial</b> data set cannot be asymptotically flat over a “generic ” Riemannian three-manifold (defined below). Since positivity, negativity of the scalar curvature is strongly influenced by the topology of the underlying three-manifold, we observe a subtle link between the topology of the space-like submanifold and the asymptotic behaviour of the initial data set in a globally hyperbolic space-time. ...|$|R
