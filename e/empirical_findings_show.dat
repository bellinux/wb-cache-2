Furthermore, our <b>empirical</b> <b>finding</b> <b>shows</b> that a more diverse skill set increases the choice of nonprofit start-ups, supporting our hypothesis that nonprofit entrepreneurs are also “Jacks-of-All-Trades”.

40|$|Even {{though the}} Asian {{insurance}} industry has grown {{significantly in the}} past decade, the fluctuation in operating results of insurance companies or the underwriting cycle could be observed in many countries, including Thailand. To {{the extent that the}} underwriting cycle generates the fluctuation in operating results, profits and loss ratio in insurance industry, this phenomenon {{is considered to be a}} major threat that all insurers need to be aware of and develop some measures to mitigate its adverse effects. This dissertation is aiming to develop a study regarding the underwriting cycle in Thai fire insurance industry by exploring the existence, causes and solutions to this phenomenon from both academic and empirical perspectives. The combination of industry secondary data collection and conducting telephone interviews are utilised as methodologies of this study. After all study methodologies and relevant analyses have been conducted, the author concluded that the underwriting cycle exists in Thai fire insurance industry with an average cycle length of six and a half years. This finding is strongly supported by empirical evidences derived from telephone interviews. The <b>empirical</b> <b>finding</b> <b>shows</b> that the most influential hypotheses regarding the causes of underwriting cycle in Thai fire insurance industry, which are partly consistent with academic findings, are capital or capacity constraint and market structure fluctuation or competitor-driven pricing hypotheses. In terms of solutions to the underwriting cycle, an <b>empirical</b> <b>finding</b> <b>shows</b> that a combination of riding the cycle and countercyclical strategies, which is consistent with the academic finding, seems to be the most influential way to manage the underwriting cycle...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT There is {{a common}} <b>empirical</b> <b>finding</b> in many {{countries}} that substantial increases in real per capita income do not correspond to equivalent increases of individual happiness. These findings have puzzled many economists that some have called the “paradox of happiness”. There {{have been a number}} of explanations regarding this paradox. This paper attempts to tackle the paradox of happiness by employing the idea of hierarchical choice. The hierarchical approach implies that there are some basic human needs which must be satisfied before non-basic needs come into the picture. The paper argues that the hierarchical structure of needs implies that the satisfaction of basic needs provides substantial increases to individual happiness compared to the subsequent satisfaction of secondary needs. This might also be an alternative explanation of <b>empirical</b> <b>findings</b> <b>showing</b> a positive relationship between income and happiness up to certain level of income. ...|$|R
