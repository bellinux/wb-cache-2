5|$|There was no autopsy, and {{the cause}} of Lambert's death is unknown. While many sources say that he died of a fatty {{degeneration}} of the heart or of stress on his heart caused by his bulk, his behaviour in the period leading to his death does not match that of someone suffering from cardiac insufficiency; witnesses agree that on the morning of his death he appeared well, before he became short of breath and collapsed. Bondeson(2006) speculates that the most consistent explanation of his death, given his symptoms and medical history, is that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> pulmonary embolism.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E

25|$|Large colon impactions {{typically}} {{occur at}} the pelvic flexure and right dorsal colon, two areas where the lumen of the intestine narrows. Large colon impactions are most frequently seen in horses that have recently <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> decrease in exercise, such as after a musculoskeletal injury. They are also associated {{in the practice of}} twice daily feeding of grain meals, which causes a short-lived but significant secretion of fluid into the lumen of the intestine, resulting in a 15% decrease in plasma volume (hypovolemia of the circulatory system) and the subsequent activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Aldosterone secretion activates absorption of fluid from the colon, decreasing the water content of the ingesta and increasing risk of impaction. Amitraz has also been associated with large colon impaction, due to alterations in motility and retention of intestinal contents, which causes further absorption of water and dehydration of ingesta. Other possible factors include poor dental care, course roughage, dehydration, and limited exercise.|$|E

He adds that he was having a final look to try and understand the fundamental reasons why his approach could not be made to work, when he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> insight that the specific reason why the Kolyvagin–Flach approach would not work directly also meant that his original attempts using Iwasawa theory could be made to work, if he strengthened it using his experience gained from the Kolyvagin–Flach approach. Fixing one approach with tools from the other approach would resolve the issue for all the cases that were not already proven by his refereed paper. He described later that Iwasawa theory and the Kolyvagin–Flach approach were each inadequate on their own, but together they could be made powerful enough to overcome this final hurdle.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> decline {{with rising}} incidences of violence; a nationalist mob killed 22 policemen in Chauri Chaura in 1922. Fearing degeneration into violence, Gandhi asked Indians {{to suspend the}} revolt and undertook a five-day fast to repent and encourage others to stop the rebellion. Although the movement stopped all over India, several Congress leaders and activists were disillusioned with Gandhi. The following year, the caliphate was overthrown by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and the Ali brothers grew distant and critical of Gandhi and the Congress. Azad's close friend Chittaranjan Das co-founded the Swaraj Party, breaking from Gandhi's leadership. Despite the circumstances, Azad remained firmly committed to Gandhi's ideals and leadership. In 1923, he became the youngest man to be elected Congress president. Azad led efforts to organise the Flag Satyagraha in Nagpur. Azad {{served as president of}} the 1924 Unity Conference in Delhi, using his position to work to re-unite the Swarajists and the Khilafat leaders under the common banner of the Congress. In the years following the movement, Azad travelled across India, working extensively to promote Gandhi's vision, education and social reform.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, the NTSB {{declared}} that overvoltage {{was not the}} cause of the Boston incident, as voltage did not exceed the battery limit of 32 V, and the charging unit passed tests. The battery had signs of short circuiting and thermal runaway. Despite this, on January 24 the NTSB announced that it had not yet pinpointed the cause of the Boston fire; the FAA would not allow U.S.-based Dreamliners to fly again until the problem was found and corrected. In a press briefing that day, NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said that the NTSB had found evidence of failure of multiple safety systems designed to prevent these battery problems, and stated that fire must never happen on an aircraft. The Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB) has said on January 23 that the battery in ANA jets in Japan reached a maximum voltage of 31 V (lower than the 32 V limit like the Boston JAL 787), but <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> unexplained voltage drop to near zero. All cells had signs of thermal damage before thermal runaway. ANA and JAL had replaced several 787 batteries before the mishaps. As of January 29, 2013, JTSB approved the Yuasa factory quality control while the American NTSB continues to look for defects in the Boston battery.|$|E

Ricciardo was fourth-fastest, ahead of Williams drivers Bottas and Massa. Alonso, Kvyat, Vettel and Magnussen followed in the top ten. The session was disrupted three times: firstly for Vergne who stopped on track at turn four when his engine <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> loss of power after 11 minutes. The second stoppage was caused by Alonso when his engine caught fire and stopped on the straight between turns three and four. He got out of his Ferrari, ran behind a barrier, and took a fire extinguisher to stop the blaze before marshals could reach his car. Gutiérrez triggered the final red flag period when his car stopped with an energy recovery system failure with thirteen minutes remaining. The final practice session was held in dry but overcast weather conditions and saw Rosberg complete a free practice sweep with the fastest time of one minute and 10.446 seconds on soft compound tyres. Hamilton was second-fastest and locked his tyres and spun while braking for the Senna S chicane. He was later delayed by a Lotus car while on a fast lap. The two Williams drivers were third and fourth (with Massa ahead of Bottas); Ricciardo was fifth and Button sixth. Räikkönen was seventh-fastest, Alonso eighth, Magnussen ninth and Kvyat rounded out the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E

500|$|From Mahler's later {{comments}} on the symphony's gestation, {{it is evident that}} the four-movement plan was relatively short-lived. He soon replaced the last three movements with a single section, essentially a dramatic cantata, based on the closing scenes of Goethe's Faust, the depiction of an ideal of redemption through eternal womanhood (das Ewige-Weibliche). Mahler had long nurtured an ambition to set the end of the Faust epic to music, [...] "and to set it quite differently from other composers who have made it saccharine and feeble." [...] In comments recorded by his biographer Richard Specht, Mahler makes no mention of the original four-movement plans.
