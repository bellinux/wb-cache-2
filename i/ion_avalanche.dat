40|$|We {{present a}} design and {{characterization}} of optically transparent electrodes suitable for atomic and molecular physics experiments where high optical access is required. The electrodes can be operated in air at {{standard atmospheric pressure}} and do not suffer electrical breakdown even for electric fields far exceeding the dielectric breakdown of air. This is achieved by putting an ITO coated dielectric substrate inside a stack of dielectric substrates, which prevents <b>ion</b> <b>avalanche</b> resulting from Townsend discharge. With this design, we observe no arcing for fields of up to 120 kV/cm. Using these plates, we directly verify the production of electric fields up to 18 kV/cm inside a quartz vacuum cell by a spectroscopic measurement of the dc Stark shift of the 5 ^ 2 S_ 1 / 2 → 5 ^ 2 P_ 3 / 2 transition for a cloud of laser cooled Rubidium atoms. We also report on the shielding of the electric field and residual electric fields that persist within the vacuum cell once the electrodes are discharged. In addition, we discuss observed atom loss that results from the motion of free charges within the vacuum. The observed asymmetry of these phenomena on the bias of the electrodes suggests that field emission of electrons within the vacuum is primarily responsible for these effects and may indicate a way of mitigating them...|$|E

40|$|A 1 D {{hydrodynamic}} {{model has been}} used to simulate the development of electron and <b>ion</b> <b>avalanches</b> in SF 6 under the particular conditions of electron impact ionization, attachment, electron detachment from negative ions, negative ion-conversion reactions, and drift within a parallel-plate discharge gap. The reduced field strength range covered was 350 - 360 × 10 - 17 V⋅cm, and fixed temperature and pressure of 300 K and 100 Torr, respectively. This study aims mainly at elucidating the role played by ion conversion reactions among several negative ion species as well as electron detachment. Comparisons with waveforms shapes measured by other groups indicate that the main features of the waveform are reproduced by using the available data on the literature on ion-molecule reactions, electron and ion mobilities, and ionization, attachment, and detachment coefficients. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a new {{two-dimensional}} numerical solver {{is presented}} for the dynamic simulation of the Trichel pulse regime of negative corona discharge in point-plane configuration. The {{goal of this}} thesis is to simulate the corona discharge phenomenon and to improve the existing models so that the results have an acceptable compatibility with the experimentally obtained data. The numerical technique used in this thesis {{is a combination of}} Finite Element Method (FEM) and Flux Corrected Transport (FCT). These techniques are proved to be the best techniques, presented so far for solving the nonlinear hyperbolic equations that simulate corona discharge phenomenon. The simulation begins with the single-species corona discharge model and thedifferent steps of the numerical technique are tested for this simplified model. The ability of the technique to model the expected physical behaviour of ions and electric field is investigated. Then, the technique is applied to a more complicated model of corona discharge, a three-specie model, in which three ionic species exist in the air gap: electrons, and positive and negative oxygen <b>ions.</b> <b>Avalanche</b> ionization, electron attachment and ionic recombination are the three ionic reactions which this model includes. The macroscopic parameters i. e., the average corona current and the Trichelpulses period are calculated and compared with the available experimental data. The technique proves to be compatible with the available experimental results. Finally, the effects of different parameters on the Trichel pulse characteristics are investigated. The results are further compared against the available experimental data for the effect of pressure on Trichel pulse characteristics and are reported to be compatible...|$|R

The rising time of fast time signal is less than 2 ns due to the very fast collection of avalanche electrons, and the rising time of the energy pulse is about 100 ns, which is corresponding to the total collecting time of the electrons and <b>ions</b> in the <b>avalanche</b> process. The counter plateau, energy resolution and the gas gains of the detector have been compared with other groups' experimental results and the Garfield simulation result...|$|R
40|$|The National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX, [M. Ono et al., Nucl. Fusion 40, 557 (2000) ]) {{routinely}} operates with {{neutral beam}} injection as the primary system for heating and current drive. The resulting fast ion population is super-Alfv# 19;enic, with velocities 1 < vfast=vAlfven < 5. This provides a strong drive for toroidicity-induced Alfv# 19;en eigenmodes (TAEs). As the discharge evolves, the fast ion population builds up and TAEs exhibit increasing bursts in amplitude and down-chirps in frequency, which eventually lead to a so-called TAE avalanche. Avalanches cause large (≤ 30 %) fast ion losses over ~ 1 ms, as inferred from the neutron rate. The increased fast ion losses correlate with a stronger activity in the TAE band. In addition, it is shown that a n = 1 mode with frequency well below the TAE gap appears in the Fourier spectrum of magnetic fluctuations {{as a result of}} non-linear mode coupling between TAEs during avalanche events. The non-linear coupling between modes, which leads to enhanced fast <b>ion</b> transport during <b>avalanches,</b> is investigated...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{devices that}} are {{designed}} to use the properties of single atoms such as donors or defects have become a reality with recent demonstrations of donor spectroscopy, single photon emission sources, and magnetic imaging using defect centers in diamond. Improving single ion detector sensitivity is linked to improving control over the straggle of the ion as well as providing more flexibility in lay-out integration with the active region of the single donor device construction zone by allowing ion sensing at potentially greater distances. Using a remotely located passively gated single <b>ion</b> Geiger mode <b>avalanche</b> diode (SIGMA) detector we have demonstrated 100 % detection efficiency at a distance of > 75 um {{from the center of the}} collecting junction. This detection efficiency is achieved with sensitivity to ~ 600 or fewer electron-hole pairs produced by the implanted ion. Ion detectors with this sensitivity and integrated with a thin dielectric, for example 5 nm gate oxide, using low energy Sb implantation would have an end of range straggle of 98 % for counting one and only one ion for a false count probability of 1 E- 4 at an average ion number per gated window of 0. 015.

40|$|International audienceFast {{evacuation}} of <b>avalanche</b> <b>ions</b> in Micromegas makes these detectors capable of withstanding very high rates with {{no loss of}} gain. But this intrinsic high-rate capability is often compromised by sporadic sparking which introduces dead time and is potentially harmful for the readout. Resistive electrode designs, by limiting spark current and keeping voltage drop locally, provide an effective remedy. They are thus quite popular, but there is actually more to them than simply spark attenuation. We propose that the spark probability is also drastically reduced because of charge-up of the resistive electrode surface. The underlying mechanism is a progressive reduction of field (in the region where spark-initiating avalanches develop) by the charges successively incoming onto the surface. We predict that the time constant with which the surface potential is relaxed {{is crucial to the}} success of this quenching mechanism. Small prototypes with a time constant varying over 5 orders of magnitude were built to verify this model. During tests in a high intensity hadron beam, spark quenching was observed for time constants larger than roughly 1 - 10 ns, corresponding to the avalanche timescale in Micromegas. These findings shed light on the basic mechanism of spark quenching in resistive detectors. Of general interest to the gaseous detector community, they also open the way to an optimisation of the resistivity value for best rate capability and full spark suppression...|$|R
