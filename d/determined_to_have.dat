The NHLs in Michigan comprise approximately 2% of the 1,757 properties and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan as of January 2012. The primary difference between a NHL and a NRHP listing is that the NHLs are <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> national significance, while other NRHP properties are deemed significant at the local or state level.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies have}} a high antioxidative capacity, due {{probably}} {{to a combination of}} various organic acids (such as oxalic, citric, malic, succinic and fumaric acids), tocopherols, phenolic compounds and alkaloids; the highest antioxidant activity is in the mushroom caps.

5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of inquiry to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined the inquiry as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme negative G forces during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by adverse weather was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls suggested that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a contributory cause.|$|E

Later in the morning, the center of Hernan was determined to be located underneath the eye and was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> become a hurricane, the fifth of the season, during the afternoon of August 8. Throughout the day, the eye became better defined, indicating that moderate northeasterly wind shear had already begun to diminish.

5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published {{on the front page of}} the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently was the result of the discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Arlene {{developed}} out of {{a tropical}} wave which was first noted near the Dominican Republic on May 23. The wave slowly developed as it moved westward through the Caribbean Sea and developed into an {{area of low pressure}} on May 25. By May 27, the low entered the Gulf of Mexico and a ship report the next day showed that the low had developed a closed low-level circulation. Early the next morning, the low was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> intensified into Tropical Storm Arlene, the first storm of the season, while located 300mi (480km) south-southeast of New Orleans, Louisiana with winds estimated at 40mph (65km/h). Arlene was moving towards the northwest at 10 to 15mph (16 to 24km/h). Arlene slowly intensified throughout the day as it continued towards the northwest at 12 to 15mph (19 to 24km/h). On May 29, Arlene turned towards the west and its foreword motion slowed before becoming nearly stationary that night.|$|E
5|$|Along the Odishan coast, the cyclone {{generated}} a 5–6m (16–20ft) storm surge that brought {{water up to}} 35km (20mi) inland, inundating a large swath of coastal areas. The Indian Ministry of Urban Development estimated a peak storm surge height of 6.7m (22ft). One visually estimated storm surge of 9m (30ft) was reported; however, this estimate was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been too high. Regardless, no in-situ measurement of the peak storm surge exists as all potential instruments were destroyed by the storm. Storm surge was responsible {{for a majority of}} the fatalities linked to the 1999Odisha cyclone, accounting for around 7,000deaths. The intense wave action sank 9,085fishing boats and caused the loss of 22,143fishing nets. Some fishing trawlers were carried and deposited 1.5–2.0km (0.9–1.2mi) inland. A 4km (2.5mi) stretch of road leading out of Paradip was covered by sand dunes measuring 1m (3.3ft) in height and 0.5km (0.3mi) in width. Paradip Port sustained severe damage to several components including various warehouses and its power transmission system, though its core infrastructure remained intact. Damage at the port was estimated at around ₹300million (US$6.9million). The storm surge destroyed nearly every house in Paradip near the point of landfall. In Gopalpur, 27villages were submerged by the surge. To the south in southern Andhra Pradesh, 48trawlers sank.|$|E
