The woman implies that Mulder, <b>feeling</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> the creature, was trying to euthanize the creature, not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously.

Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater.

5|$|In {{order to}} {{discover}} his nemesis's secret identity, Osborn exposes Spider-Man to a gas that nullifies the hero's spider-senses. This allows Osborn to stalk Spider-Man until he learns that his nemesis is Peter Parker, {{a college student}} (and his son's classmate). While Parker is going about his civilian life, Osborn surprises and knocks him out with an asphyxiation grenade, taking him to his waterfront base. After unmasking himself to Parker, the latter goads him into recounting how he became Green Goblin, and uses the time to break free. In the ensuing battle, Spider-Man accidentally knocks Osborn into a mass of electrical wires, wiping out his memory. <b>Feeling</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> his nemesis, and wishing to avoid the shame that would befall the Osborn family (and by extension, Parker's best friend Harry), Spider-Man destroys the Green Goblin costume in the resulting fire and tells the authorities that Osborn lost his memory while helping to defeat the Green Goblin.|$|E

Sigismund, their fourth child, died of meningitis at 21 months on 18 June 1866, {{just a few}} days before the Battle of Königgrätz. This tragedy weakened the Crown Princess, who found no comfort from her mother or her in-laws. Queen Augusta demanded that her daughter-in-law quickly resume her official duties instead of <b>feeling</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> herself. Queen Victoria, who was still mourning the loss of Prince Albert, didn't understand the feelings of her daughter and considered that the loss of a child was much less severe than that of a husband.|$|E

When Annie starts thinking about closing down the First Wives Club, her friends come back, saying that they want to see this to the end and Bill hasn't done anything blatantly wrong, but only as far as he knows. As a result, the wives manage to uncover information revealing that Bill's mistress (Elizabeth Berkley) is actually a minor.|$|E

500|$|After the verdict, the District Attorney Joseph Freitas faced {{a furious}} gay {{community}} {{to explain what}} had gone wrong.

Nor did Freitas question White's frame of mind, lack of a history of mental illness, or bring into evidence city politics, suggesting that revenge may have been a motive. Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver testified on the last day of the trial that White and Milk were not friendly, yet she had contacted the prosecutor and insisted on testifying. It was the only testimony the jury heard about their strained relationship. Freitas blamed the jury whom he claimed had been [...] "taken in by the whole emotional aspect of [...] trial".|$|E
500|$|Labor campaigned {{under the}} slogan [...] "It's Time", {{an echo of}} Menzies' {{successful}} 1949 slogan, [...] "It's Time for a Change".

The party pledged to eliminate university tuition fees and establish a schools commission to evaluate educational needs. The party benefited from the support of the proprietor of News Limited, Rupert Murdoch, who preferred Whitlam over McMahon. Labor was so dominant in the campaign that some of Whitlam's advisers urged him to stop joking about McMahon; people were <b>feeling</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> him. The election saw the ALP increase its tally by 12seats, mostly in suburban Sydney and Melbourne, for a majority of nine in the House of Representatives.

500|$|In the original, non-broadcast pilot, Willow {{was portrayed}} by Riff Regan. However, network {{executives}} requested that Regan be replaced. Willow's character demanded {{that she be}} shy and unsure of herself, and the casting department encountered some difficulty finding actresses who could portray this effectively and still be likable. After seven auditions, Alyson Hannigan was eventually chosen for the role. She was chosen {{for being able to}} spin the character's lines with a self-effacing optimism; she stated, [...] "I didn't want to do Willow as someone who's <b>feeling</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> herself.

[...] Whedon conceived the character as introverted, saying [...] "I wanted Willow {{to have that kind of}} insanely colorful interior life that truly shy people have. And Alyson has that. She definitely has a loopiness I found creeping into the way Willow talked, which was great.

The next day, the newspapers announce that, partly due to the senator's stunt the previous day, the queefing ban has passed. As Stan and his father Randy celebrate, Sharon and Shelley are hurt and insulted by the decision, describing it as an example of sexism that still pervades society, and finally sarcastically congratulate the men for [...] "getting their own way... again." [...] Stan and Randy finally understand the issue was not simply about queefing, but a larger point about women's rights. The two get all the South Park men together and record an inspirational song called [...] "Queef Free", declaring women {{should have the right to}} queef, while photographs of women working various careers are displayed on a television screen. Terrance and Philip, despite a continued disgust with the constant queefing, attempt to marry the two Queef Sisters.

500|$|... "Don't Bother" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira and Leisha Hailey and American pop music {{production}} trio The Matrix, which is composed of Lauren Christy, Graham Edwards, and Scott Spock. Shakira also produced the song.

She assures him that he [...] "won’t ever see me [...] cry" [...] and that she will move on in her life without him. The song contains a spoken bridge in which Shakira lists {{a number of things}} she could do to make him stay with her, such as [...] "move(ing) to a communist country", but admits that they would not have an effect on him. Pam Avoledo from Blogcritics found the theme of the song similar to the one in Shakira's 2002 single [...] "Objection (Tango)". Shakira described the song as a feminist anthem, saying: ...|$|E
