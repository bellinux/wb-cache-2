25|$|After his {{accession}} as the tributary {{ruler of}} Upper Assam under British Government, Purandar Singha began well with his accounts of payments of revenue. But within three year, {{he began to}} make default in his payments. He begged for a considerable reduction {{in the amount of}} revenue, as he explained that the country was badly ravaged by the Burmese invaders, affecting all spheres of life of the people, which includes social and economical. Imposing taxation was also difficult because unlike other parts of India, common people in Assam did not use or very rarely use money for any business transaction or in daily business. Captain Jenkins, the new Commissioner and Political Agent, held an enquiry into Purandar Singh’s administration and found it a <b>hot</b> <b>bed</b> of corruption and misfeasance. His subjects were oppressed and misgoverned and his rule is very distasteful to the bulk of the population. Purandar Singha was himself found guilty of gathering personal fortune rather than concentrating on good governance for his people.|$|E

In fact, Tennessee would furnish more troops for the Union than any other Confederate state, combined. However, over three times that number volunteered for the Confederacy.

The young men of Bengal were amongst the most active in the Swadeshi movement, and the participation of university students drew the ire of the Raj. R.W.

40|$|Mercury has had various uses {{in nuclear}} fuel {{reprocessing}} and other nuclear processes, {{and so is}} often present in radioactive and mixed (radioactive and hazardous) wastes. Test programs performed {{in recent years have}} shown that mercury in off-gas streams from processes that treat radioactive wastes can be controlled using fixed beds of activated sulfur-impregnated carbon, to levels low enough to comply with air emission regulations such as the Hazardous Waste Combustor (HWC) Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards. Carbon <b>bed</b> <b>hot</b> spots or fires have occurred several times during these tests, and also during a remediation of tanks that contained mixed waste. Hot spots occur when localized areas in a carbon bed become heated to temperatures where oxidation occurs. This heating typically occurs due to heat of absoption of gas species onto the carbon, {{but it can also be}} caused through external means such as external heaters used to heat the carbon <b>bed</b> vessel. <b>Hot</b> spots, if not promptly mitigated, can grow into bed fires. Carbon <b>bed</b> <b>hot</b> spots and fires must be avoided in processes that treat radioactive and mixed waste. Hot spots are detected by (a) monitoring in-bed and bed outlet gas temperatures, and (b) more important, monitoring of bed outlet gas CO concentrations.
