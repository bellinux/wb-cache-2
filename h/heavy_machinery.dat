5|$|Although XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} {{to attack}} on Singapore Naval Base again on 6February, this raid was cancelled {{on the third}} of the month by Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Allied forces in the Southeast Asian theatre. Mountbatten ordered that the naval installations at Singapore and Penang not be targeted as they would be needed by Allied forces following the projected liberation of Malaya and Singapore later in 1945. After requesting clarification of this order, Ramsey met with Mountbatten at Kandy. In this meeting Mountbatten assigned targets in the Kuala Lumpur area as XXBomber Command's first priority, while second priority was given to carefully selected areas of Singapore. These areas excluded the King GeorgeVI Graving Dock and several other docks and areas with <b>heavy</b> <b>machinery,</b> but allowed attacks on the West Wall area of Singapore Naval Base, naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities. Saigon was assigned as XXBomber Command's third priority and fourth priority was given to oil storage dumps on islands near Singapore.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reputation}} of the Mars Works grew, so too did the demand for its products. After a few years the Mars Works began exporting its engines inland. Oliver Evans's son George was the first such order, having moved to Pittsburgh in 1809 to operate the Pittsburgh Steam Flour Mill. George and the mill were highly successful, and generated a great deal of interest in Evans's engines across the interior. However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective. In 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like the Mars Works, produce <b>heavy</b> <b>machinery</b> and castings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, the Pittsburgh works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like hinges and fittings.|$|E
5|$|Gold strikes {{from the}} mid-19th to early 20thcenturies {{played a major}} role in {{attracting}} settlers to the upper Colorado River basin. In 1859, a group of adventurers from Georgia discovered gold along the Blue River in Colorado and established the mining boomtown of Breckenridge. During 1875, even bigger strikes were made along the Uncompahgre and San Miguel rivers, also in Colorado, and these led to the creation of Ouray and Telluride, respectively. Because most gold deposits along the upper Colorado River and its tributaries occur in lode deposits, extensive mining systems and <b>heavy</b> <b>machinery</b> were required to extract them. Mining remains a substantial contributor to the economy of the upper basin and has led to acid mine drainage problems in some regional streams and rivers.|$|E

5|$|In fall 1903, {{the flood}} of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks. The gold was deeper than in the Klondike, and it had taken time to dig to it. At Cleary Creek, miner Jesse Noble {{discovered}} what became the richest vein of gold in Alaska. Gold extraction was slow, because almost no <b>heavy</b> <b>machinery</b> was available to remove the overburden above the layers of gold. The gold discoveries of 1903 reversed the trend of people away from the Tanana Valley. By Christmas 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley. Another food shortage arose {{during the winter of}} 1903, alleviated only by the food Barnette had brought in after his trip to the Lower 48.|$|E
5|$|Strickland did {{not take}} into account the swampy lowland and high water table that characterizes the terrain around New Orleans, and so during its career the New Orleans Mint {{building}} has encountered numerous structural problems from the shifting soil beneath its foundation. In the 1840s the building was reinforced with iron rods inserted between the floors. In 1854, the federal government hired West Point engineering graduate (and Louisiana native) Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard to fireproof the building, rebuild the arches supporting the basement ceiling and install masonry flooring. Beauregard completed the work in conjunction with Captain Johnson K. Duncan by 1859. During this period, the Mint's <b>heavy</b> <b>machinery</b> was converted to steam power so a smokestack (since demolished) was built at the rear of the structure to carry away the fumes.|$|E
5|$|John Cunningham {{was born}} in Croydon in south London on 27 July 1917, {{in the midst of}} the First World War. His father, Arthur Gillespie Cunningham, worked for the Dunlop Rubber Company at Fort Dunlop based in Birmingham. He rose to the {{position}} of company secretary. In 1910 he married Evelyn Mary Spencer. Her family owned an engineering company in Coventry which supplied the fabric and textiles company Courtaulds with <b>heavy</b> <b>machinery.</b> In the 1920s, her grandfather was Lord Mayor of Coventry. The family located to Croydon where John was born, along with two elder sisters Mary and Janet and a younger brother, William. John attended Bowden House School, a preparatory school at Seaford, East Sussex until he was 9. He was subsequently a pupil at Whitgift School, a public school in Croydon. In 1926, on a school holiday, he took a flight in an Avro 504. His experiences encouraged him to enter the officers training corps at the school. A personal tragedy occurred in 1930 when his father died. Still, Cunningham did well at school, particularly in the mathematics field. He was keen on entering the aviation industry as a teenager.|$|E

The request for assistance came the following day, with the Philippines requesting food, water, medicine, emergency supplies, and <b>heavy</b> <b>machinery.</b> A team from the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization, specializing with relief coordination and flood management, was also sent. The Red Cross appealed for $418,000 to support 15,000families for one month. A cash grant of $17,300 from the United Kingdom was received on November8. Two United States Air Force AC-130s from Subic bay naval base flew to Cebu carrying ready-to-eat meals. International funding reached $2.5million on November12, with grants of $1.05million, $1million, $188,000 from the Netherlands, Japan, and Australia respectively. Additionally, the United States provided 55,000 packages of food rations. This total nearly doubled two days later with grants from the United Nations Development Programme, World Food Programme, World Vision International, Médecins Sans Frontières, Caritas, various branches of the Red Cross, and the governments of Canada and New Zealand.

5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or <b>heavy</b> <b>machinery</b> increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
5|$|Having, in his view, perfected many of {{his ideas}} and designs for steam engines, Evans turned his {{attention}} once more to the commercial propagation of his inventions. His first steam engines had been constructed on an ad-hoc basis, often with improvised tools and workers, and he had relied heavily on blacksmiths and other metal-working shops in Philadelphia with little experience in the more precise metal-work required to build steam engines. In particular, Evans soon realized that unlike his milling machines of wood and leather he would need specialist skills, precision tools and a large foundry {{in order to build}} steam machines on a commercial basis. Thus, Evans constructed the Mars Works on a large site a few blocks north of his store in Philadelphia. The choice of name, after the Roman god of war, is thought to have been aspirational and a challenge to the Soho Foundry near Birmingham in the United Kingdom, famous for building the Watt and Boulton engines. Indeed, the completed Mars Works was {{one of the largest and}} best equipped outfits of its kind in the United States—by contemporary accounts it featured a substantial foundry, moldmaker's shop, blacksmith's shops, millstone maker, a steam engine works and a large steam engine of its own to grind materials and work wrought iron. With over thirty-five staff, the Mars Works produced a wide range of manufactures ranging from working steam engines to cast iron fittings, as well as milling and farming machines for Evans's now well-established agricultural clientele. Steam engine orders alone proved insufficient to support the extensive business costs; hence the works became highly experienced in producing all kinds of <b>heavy</b> <b>machinery,</b> contributing to Philadelphia's emergence as a leading center for such work in the 19th century. Indeed, the works even received military orders, casting naval cannons during the War of 1812. Evans also proved highly innovative in designing steam power solutions for his clients. In one example where the Mars Works was commissioned to build engines for wool processing factories in Middletown, Connecticut, Evans designed a network of accompanying pipes with radiators to heat the factory with engine exhaust.|$|E
