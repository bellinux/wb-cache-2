500|$|In January 1943, Popovac led the MNVO in {{an attack}} which {{resulted}} in the capture of a communist village predominantly inhabited by Muslims. That same month, the Chetniks carried out a number of massacre against the Muslims, especially in Eastern Bosnia, in the areas of Koraj, Bijeljina, Srebrenica, Višegrad, Foča, Goražde, and Vlasenica. Between January and March 1943, Popovac's Chetniks fought the Partisans as part of the Axis-led military operation known as Case White, but did not distinguish themselves. During the operation itself, the Chetniks committed further atrocities against the Muslims. Nonetheless, Popovac and Pašić continued seeking Muslim recruits. They declared in their [...] "Address to the Brethren Muslims of Čajniče and Other Nearby Districts" [...] that the main goal of the Chetniks was [...] "the intelligent and honest protection of Muslim interests". The Chetniks, they claimed, would [...] "secure a safe future <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>people</b> with the highest principles of Islam: freedom of religion, holiness of the family, respect for private property, social justice, and democratic political freedom." [...] They denied that Muslims were collectively responsible for Ustaše crimes, writing: [...] "Muslims are bound to the brethren of the Orthodox religion by blood and land." ...|$|E
500|$|So William of Champlitte and Geoffry of Villehardouin [...] {{departed}} from the host, and took with them about a hundred knights, and {{a great number of}} mounted sergeants, and entered into the land of Morea, and rode onwards till they came to the city of Modon. Michael heard that they were in the land with so few people, and he collected together a great number of people, a number that was marvellous, and he rode after them as one thinking they were all no better than prisoners, and in his hand. And when they heard tell that he was coming, they refortified Modon, where the defences had long since been pulled down, and there left their baggage, and the lesser folk. Then they rode out a day's march, and ordered their array with as many people as they had. But the odds seemed too great, for they had no more than five hundred men mounted, whereas on the other part there were well over five thousand. But events happen as God pleases; <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>people</b> fought with the Greeks and discomfited and conquered them. And the Greeks lost very heavily, while those on our side gained horses and arms enough, and other goods in very great plenty, and so returned very happy, and very joyously, to the city of Modon.|$|E

Although Pilla recognized that a unique [...] "quality of parish life is a reality in many places" [...] and [...] "richness and diversity are a treasure to be preserved" [...] and that many parishes [...] "founded with strong ethnic roots that were and continue to be important in sustaining people's faith," [...] he wrote that, [...] "We need catechesis in order <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>people</b> to understand and support this vision of vibrant parish life." [...] A similar process of consolidation, which also included sales of assets, described in BusinessWeek as a solution that [...] "could revolutionize the way dioceses manage their affairs nationwide", took place in the Archdiocese of Chicago under Cardinal Joseph Bernardin the Archbishop of Chicago during the 1990s.|$|E

One TD financial adviser says she [...] "invested clients' savings into funds which were not suitable, because of the SR [...] pressure".

2500|$|Fearful of the {{perceived}} humiliation {{of being the first}} to lose to Tampa Bay, opponents prepared carefully for the Buccaneers. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach said, [...] "...we didn't want to be the first. Psychologically, it could have wrecked our year". New York Giants coach John McVay said after a victory, [...] "In 25 years of coaching I've never had as much pressure on me as I did this week". A popular Tampa area T-shirt depicted a sinking pirate ship with the inscription [...] "Go for 0". The franchise finally broke through to victory in a week 13 road game against the New Orleans Saints that led Saints head coach Hank Stram to lament, [...] "What a nightmare. It was the worst experience of my coaching career. We're all ashamed <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>people,</b> for our fans, for our organization". Stram, an early head coaching candidate for the expansion Buccaneers, was fired the following week. The first Buccaneer home victory came in the following week's season-ending game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Cardinals coach Don Coryell, already feuding with team owner Bill Bidwill, was also fired shortly after the loss. The two-game winning streak ended the Buccaneers’ losing streak at 0–26. Howard Cosell honored the Buccaneers’ first victory by choosing it as the lead game for the halftime highlights of ABC TV's Monday Night Football broadcast, and interviewed McKay by telephone during the game. Bill Cosby, filling in for longtime Buccaneer mocker Johnny Carson as host of The Tonight Show, devoted a five-minute comedy routine to the win. No Buccaneers were honored with Pro Bowl selections following the season, although it was believed that Lee Roy Selmon, Dave Lewis, and Dave Pear would all have been chosen had they played on a playoff contender.|$|E
