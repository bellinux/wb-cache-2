The application of advanced superalloys in the hot sections of modern gas-turbines also enables higher temperature operation.

50|$|For {{temperatures}} {{of up to}} , no adjustment {{needs to be made}} in calculating vessel wall thickness. Above this temperature, the allowable stress is derated. Above , <b>high-temperature</b> <b>alloys</b> are used. The rated temperature, which is stamped on the vessel's data plate, applies to the vessel wall itself, not to the gas circulating in the autoclave. This is relevant when internal insulation is used to circulate air or gas at a temperature beyond the rating of the vessel.|$|R
