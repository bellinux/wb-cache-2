25|$|Haptanthus hazlettii is a shrub or tree. It has {{opposite}} leaves spaced at 5.5–6.0cm apart, usually {{arranged in}} two ranks (<b>distichous).</b> The leaves are simple with untoothed (entire) margins. There are no stipules. The leaf stalk (petiole) is short, 7–8mm long, the leaf blade (lamina) 10–13.5cm long by 4.1–5.6cm wide. The entire plant is hairless (glabrous).|$|E
500|$|The {{leaves of}} Aiphanes species are usually pinnately divided—rows of {{leaflets}} emerge {{on either side}} of the axis of the leaf in a feather-like or fern-like pattern. The sole exception to this is A.macroloba which has entire leaves. [...] They are usually spirally arranged, but some species have a <b>distichous</b> leaf arrangement, a condition that is normal in palm seedlings but uncommon among adults. Old leaf bases detach cleanly from the stem, except in A.hirsuta subsp. fosteriorum, which often has old leaf bases attached to the newer portions of the stem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stems of}} grasses, called culms, are usually {{cylindrical}} (more rarely flattened, but not 3-angled) and are hollow, [...] plugged at the nodes, where {{the leaves are}} attached. Grass leaves are nearly always alternate and <b>distichous</b> (in one plane), and have parallel veins. Each leaf is differentiated into a lower sheath hugging the stem and a blade with entire (i.e., smooth) margins. The leaf blades of many grasses are hardened with silica phytoliths, which discourage grazing animals; some, such as sword grass, are sharp enough to cut human skin. A membranous appendage or fringe of hairs called the ligule lies at the junction between sheath and blade, preventing water or insects from penetrating into the sheath.|$|E
2500|$|The {{leaves are}} {{typically}} [...] in length, {{but may be}} as short as [...] or as long as [...] They are flattened and are typically <b>distichous,</b> or two-ranked. The bottom of the leaf is glaucous with two broad and clearly visible stomatal bands, while the top is a shiny green to yellow-green in colour. The leaf margins are very slightly toothed, especially near the apex. The seed cones are ovoid in shape and typically measure [...] in length and [...] in width. The scales are ovate to cuneate in shape and measure [...] in length by [...] in width. The apex {{is more or less}} rounded and is often projected outward. Twenty-four diploid chromosomes are present within the trees' DNA.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species of}} Gasteria has its strap-shaped leaves in two {{opposite}} rows (<b>distichous)</b> and it very closely resembles its two closest relatives, Gasteria pillansii and Gasteria disticha to the north, {{both of which}} are also <b>distichous.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Gasteria armstrongii can be {{distinguished}} by its very dark, retuse, <b>distichous,</b> roughly tuberculate leaves. Its inflorescences are also solitary. (G.nitida is much larger, with smooth leaves that grow in a rosette, not <b>distichous.</b> Its inflorescences are branched.) ...|$|E
50|$|Haemodoraceae is {{characterized}} by <b>distichous</b> leathery leaves, which are alternate, succulent, rather large and often ensiform, with entire margins and parallel veins. The leaves are enclosed by a sheath with free margins and alternate, <b>distichous</b> (= in two vertical ranks).|$|E
5000|$|This {{species of}} Gasteria has its strap-shaped leaves in two {{opposite}} rows (<b>distichous),</b> from whence its Latin species name comes.

5000|$|The {{branched}} {{stems of}} this sympodial orchid climb on trees or rock cliffs, and produce roots from the nodes, similar to E. radicans.

The terminal inflorescence arises from an obtuse spathe and has a short peduncle clothed in <b>distichous,</b> imbricating sheathes below the raceme of light green flowers, 1-2 cm across. The sepals have three veins which do not reach the apex (hence brevivenium); the linear petals have only one.

Sometimes considered a separate species, Gasteria retusa.|$|E
5000|$|It has thick fleshy bluish ("glaucous") leaves {{which are}} <b>distichous</b> in young plants, but soon become a dense rosette. It is the {{distinctive}} grey-green colour of the leaves, {{which are often}} sharply pointed, which distinguishes it from the other gasterias.|$|E
