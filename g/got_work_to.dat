6000|$|Gradually Herminia <b>got</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> her mind; work {{enough to}} support her in the modest way that sufficed her small wants {{for herself and her}} baby. In London, given time enough, you can live down anything, perhaps even the unspeakable sin of having struck a righteous blow in the {{interest}} of women. And day by day, as months and years went on, Herminia felt she was living down the disgrace of having obeyed an enlightened conscience. She even found friends. Dear old Miss Smith-Waters used to creep round by night, like Nicodemus--respectability would not have allowed her to perform that Christian act in open daylight,--and sit {{for an hour or two}} with her dear misguided Herminia. Miss Smith-Waters prayed nightly for Herminia's [...] "conversion," [...] yet not without an uncomfortable suspicion, after all, that Herminia had very little indeed to be [...] "converted" [...] from. Other people also got to know her by degrees; an editor's wife; a kind literary hostess; some socialistic ladies who liked to be [...] "advanced;" [...] a friendly family or two of the Bohemian literary or artistic pattern. Among them Herminia learned to be as happy in time as she could ever again be, now she had lost her Alan. She was Mrs. Barton to them all; that lie she found it practically impossible to fight against. Even the Bohemians refused to let their children ask after Miss Barton's baby.|$|E

[...] exclaim the sweet voices here too,--being of weak judgment, many of them! Poor Katte's Father, a faithful old Soldier, not capable of being more, he does, rather conspicuously, make Feldmarschall, make Reichsgraf; happy, could these honors be a consolation to the old man. The Munchows of Custrin,--readers remember their kindness in that sad time; how the young boy went into petticoats again, {{and came to the}} Crown-Prince's cell with all manner of furnishings,--the Munchows, father and sons, this young gentleman of the petticoats among them, he took immediate pains to reward by promotion: eldest son was advanced into the General Directorium; two younger sons, to Majorship, to Captaincy, in their respective Regiments; him of the petticoats [...] "he had already taken altogether to himself," [...] [Preuss, i. 66.] and of him we shall see a glimpse at Wilhelmina's shortly, as a [...] "milkbeard (JEUNE MORVEUX)" [...] in personal attendance on his Majesty. This was a notable exception. And in effect there came good public service, eminent some of it, from these Munchows in their various departments. And it was at length perceived to have been, in the main, because they were of visible faculty for doing work that they had <b>got</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> do; and the exceptional case of the Munchows became confirmatory of the rule.|$|E

While doing this, Szpilman was allowed to go to the Gentile side of Warsaw. When they could slip away, he and the other workers visited Polish food stalls and bought potatoes and bread. By eating some of the food and selling or trading the rest in the ghetto (where the value skyrocketed), the workers could feed themselves and raise enough money to repeat the exercise the next day.|$|E

5000|$|The lyrics tell {{of a girl}} (Degree 1) who has one of {{the most}} well known of all mental illnesses: Bipolar disorder. With bipolarity, a patient suffers from manic episodes (e.g. [...] "She can't stop pacing, she never felt so alive") {{alternating}} with depressive crashes (e.g. [...] "Then one day, she woke up to find, the perfect girl, had lost her mind"). Bipolar mania often involves heightened energy, flight of ideas ("Her thoughts are racing, set on overdrive."). Manics will often work for hours on end to the point of exhaustion and will often neglect their other duties to attend to whatever goal they have set their minds on at the time. ("They're expecting her, but she's <b>got</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> do.") ...|$|E
5000|$|Before 1934 Campbell's {{athletic}} {{teams were}} known as the [...] "Hornets." [...] Other early known nicknames for the program were simply reflective of the school name, like [...] "Campbells" [...] or [...] "Campbellites." [...] The origin of the name [...] "Fighting Camels" [...] is popularly believed {{to be derived from}} a statement by early school patron Zachary Taylor Kivett, who approached school founder James Archibald Campbell after a fire had destroyed the three then existing school buildings in 1900 and said, [...] "Your name's Campbell; then get a hump on you!

5000|$|In {{his book}} Jack Kerouac: Prophet of the New Romanticism (1976), Robert A. Hipkiss criticizes much of Kerouac's poetry, but {{identifies}} Mexico City Blues as probably containing Kerouac's best poetry, and praises the 235th Chorus in particular. Hipkiss compares the 235th Chorus to Robert Frost's [...] "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening", and interprets the chorus, which reads [...] "How do I know that I'm dead / Because I'm alive / And I <b>got</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> do ...", as referring to obligations which give purpose to the narrator's life, but which are [...] "painful and not satisfying". Unlike in Frost's poem, in Mexico City Blues [...] "there is no satisfactory putting aside {{of the death}} wish by contemplating the 'miles to go before I sleep.'" [...] Hipkiss describes the poem as [...] "an expression of the creative impulse very much {{for its own sake}} - a refusal of rules of creation and a celebration, in the act, of the spontaneity inherent in creativity." ...|$|E

50|$|The show {{begins with}} the {{ensemble}} ("Fire"), after which Molag (Lauren Walker), acting as narrator, speaks to the audience about fire and brings them {{back in time to}} tell the story of its invention ("We Are People Now"). In this time, a 'prolonged intellectual disagreement' known as The Great Debate between Smelly-Balls (Brian Holden) and Chorn (Jamie Burns) is aggravating a small tribe of early Homo Sapiens. Their leader, Jemilla (Meredith Stepien), steps in and solves it by encouraging Smelly-Balls to change his perspective, earning her the title 'Peacemaker'. The tribe then receives a blessing from their deity, a duck known as the Almighty Duck, and Jemilla encourages them to resume their work. However, a tribe member named Zazzalil (Lauren Lopez) pleads for a day off to sing and practice dancing, which has just been invented. Though Zazzalil resists, Jemilla and the rest of the tribe assert that the work must be done ("We <b>Got</b> <b>Work</b> <b>to</b> Do"). While the rest of the tribe perform their jobs, Jemilla meets with Molag, the tribe's former leader. Molag reveals that the duck the tribe worships is but one of many ducks that Molag has captured and used to control the tribe during her time as leader. She also reveals Tiblyn's (Tiffany Williams) duty of holding up the sky is unnecessary and useless. Jemilla is severely shaken by these revelations.|$|E
40|$|So that’s what I did. ‘I {{remember}} when I first got him, doc. He {{was such a}} little mongrel. It {{was love at first}} sight. ’ I swallowed hard, recalling the day Pimpant bounded into our lives. You try telling your child that he cannot have the puppy he’s embracing with all the love of which a 6 -year-old is capable. We kept the dog. That was 12 years ago. For 5 long bloody minutes that dog went Eee eee eee eee eee. The yelps grew softer — the canine ones, that is. Kip died in pain. ‘Can I give you something, Cyril?’ ‘No no, I <b>got</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> do. I’m takin ’ ‘im home with me. He’s going out the back. ’ I didn’t want to know how the miner’s tired body could carve out a grave from the grey scree behind his shack. I just wanted the corpse off my hands. I went home and yapped at the kids for making too much noise and almost kicked the dog. I’ll never do that again. I mean it. When people ask me to put down their animals, I send them to Cyril Johanssen, who’s done a total volte-face. God knows what the poor man suffered during the 2 months nobody saw him. Whatever it was turned his heart. When his grief released him — or he entered the next phase — Cyril bought a. 22 and set himself up as an animal liberator, saying it’s quicker and more humane to put a bullet through their heads. Perhaps he’s right. But that’s not quite the end of the story. The old miner hates me now. Should I have acted differently? Would Cyril still go to the other doctor and cross the street to avoid me if I had refused to put down his dog? Now Pimpant’s hip dysplasia is so bad he drags his hind legs. And I’m dragging my feet.
