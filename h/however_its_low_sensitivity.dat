40|$|Laboratory {{tests for}} the {{detection}} of fungal infections are easy to perform. The main obstacle to a correct diagnosis is the correlation between the laboratory findings and the clinical diagnosis. Among pediatric patients, the most common fungal pathogen is Candida. The detection of fungal colonization may be performed through the use of chromogenic culture media, which allows also the identification of Candida subspecies, from which pathogenicity depends. In neonatology, this test often drives the decision to begin a empiric therapy; in this regard, a close cooperation between microbiologists and clinicians is highly recommended. Blood culture, if positive, is a strong confirmation of fungal infection; <b>however,</b> <b>its</b> <b>low</b> <b>sensitivity</b> results in a high percentage of false negatives, thus decreasing its reliability.

40|$|Diffusion {{weighted}} {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy (DWS) of brain metabolites offers unique access to compartment-specific microstructural information on tissue, and to a more sensitive detection of compartment-specific changes in tissue in health and disease. The specificity of DWS is offset, <b>however,</b> by <b>its</b> relative <b>low</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> intrinsic to all MRS-based methods, and further exacerbated by the signal loss due to the diffusion weighting and long echo times. In this work we first provide an example {{for the type of}} compartment-specific information that can be obtained with DWS from a small volume of interest in brain white matter. We then propose and discuss a strategy for the analysis of DWS data, which includes the use of models of diffusion in compartments with simple geometries and can be used to extract properties, such as the cytosolic diffusion coefficient of metabolites, which are potential markers for intracellular damage in neurological disorders. We conclude with a brief discussion of the potential role of DWS in the larger scope of tissue microstructural characterization and the complementarity of DWS with less specific but more sensitive microstructural tools, such as diffusion tensor imaging...|$|R

In this paper, we develop a near-concentric cavity-enhanced Raman spectroscopy system to directly detect bicarbonate in seawater for the first time. With the aid of this near-concentric cavity-enhanced Raman spectroscopy system, a significant enhancement in HCO 3 − detection has been achieved. The obtained limit of detection (LOD) is determined to be 0. 37 mmol/L—much lower than the typical concentration of HCO 3 − in seawater. By introducing a specially developed data processing scheme, the weak HCO 3 − signal is extracted from the strong sulfate signal background, hence a quantitative analysis with R 2 of 0. 951 is made possible. Based on the spectra taken from deep sea seawater sampling, the concentration of HCO 3 − has been determined to be 1. 91 mmol/L, with a relative error of 2. 1 % from the reported value (1. 95 mmol/L) of seawater in the ocean. It is expected that the near-concentric cavity-enhanced Raman spectroscopy system could be developed and used for in-situ ocean observation in the near future...|$|E

Breast MRI is one of so the called "complementary" breast imaging methods. The {{purpose of this study was}} to improve the {{specificity}} of breast MRI by combining 2 methods: dynamic and morphologic analysis of enhancing lesions. Material and Methods: 222 women aged 19 - 76 years, who underwent breast MRI examination between November 2002 and April 2004 at the Radiology Department of Oncology Center in Bydgoszcz, were included in this study. Results: The pathological examination revealed cancer in 55 women (25 %). No cancer was found in 167 women (75 %), 56 of which were verified pathologically, 111 by cytology and/or during follow-up (at least 24 months). Results of breast MRI were positive in 80 women (36 %), in 54 of which cancer was found during pathological examination, 26 breast MRI results were false positive. Sensitivity and specificity of breast MRI for dynamic analysis were 87 % and 72 %, respectively; in case of morphologic analysis 98 % and 74 %, respectively. The combined dynamic and morphologic analysis achieved high (84 %) specificity without loss of sensitivity (98 %).

EGFR mutational status was assessed by direct sequencing, PNA-LNA PCR clamp, and Ion Torrent PGM in 57 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We evaluated the predictive efficacy of PNA-LNA PCR clamp on the EGFR-TKI treatment in 36 patients with advanced NSCLC retrospectively. Compared to direct sequencing (16 / 57, 28. 1 %), PNA-LNA PCR clamp (27 / 57, 47. 4 %) and Ion Torrent PGM (26 / 57, 45. 6 %) detected more EGFR mutations. EGFR mutant patients had significantly longer progressive free survival (14. 31 vs. 21. 61 months, P = 0. 003) than that of EGFR wild patients when tested with PNA-LNA PCR clamp. However, no difference in response rate to EGFR TKIs (75. 0 % vs. 82. 4 %, P = 0. 195) or overall survival (34. 39 vs. 44. 10 months, P = 0. 422) was observed between the EGFR mutations by direct sequencing or PNA-LNA PCR clamp.

Methods: This case-control study, conducted between 2010 and 2011 in Tehran Heart Center, recruited 362 angiographically confirmed cases of coronary artery disease (CAD) and 337 controls. A standard protocol was used to measure the ABI and different CAD risk factors. Results: A low ABI had specificity of 99. 7 %, positive predictive value of 95. 8 %, negative predictive value of 49. 8 %, sensitivity of 64 %, likelihood ratio of 24. 07, and odds ratio (OR) of 22. 79 (95 %CI: 3. 06 - 69. 76). The role of the associated risk factors was evaluated with OR (95 %CI), with the variables including gender 3. 15 (2. 30 - 4. 30), cigarette smoking 2. 72 (1. 86 - 3. 99), family history 1. 72 (1. 17 - 2. 51), diabetes 1. 66 (1. 15 - 2. 4), and dyslipidemia 1. 38 (1. 02 - 1. 88). In a multivariate model, the following variables remained statistically significantly correlated with CAD [OR (95 %CI) ]: ABI 13. 86 (1. 78 - 17. 62); gender 3. 69 (2. 43 - 5. 58); family history of CAD 2. 18 (1. 41 - 3. 37); smoking 1. 69 (1. 08 - 2. 64); age 1. 04 (1. 02 - 1. 06).

One eumelanin marker, 5, 6 -dihydroxy-indole- 2 -carboxylic acid was identified and quantified in normal urine. <b>However,</b> <b>its</b> <b>low</b> concentration and <b>sensitivity</b> to oxidation made it less suitable for clinical studies. A methylated derivative of this substance, 6 -hydroxy- 5 -methoxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid (6 H 5 MI- 2 -C), was also demonstrated in normal urine. A quantitative method was worked out and the normal urinary concentration of this substance was {{as high as the}} concentration of 5 -S-cysteinyldopa. The concentrations of the eumelanic marker 6 -hydroxy- 5 -methoxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid and the pheomelanic marker 5 -S-cysteinyldopa were determined in the urine of psoriasis patients during PUVA treatment and also in the urine of subjects with different skin colour. The melanocyte activity in albinotic patients and in albinotic mice was studied by the same technique. Some in vitro experiments were performed to show that 5 -S-glutathionyldopa has the molecular properties of forming a mercapto-substituted indole derivative. The following main conclusions were drawn: 1. 5, 6 -Dihydroxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid and 6 -hydroxy- 5 -methoxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid are both present in measurable amounts in normal urine. 2. The urinary concentration of 6 -hydroxy- 5 -methoxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid increased during PUVA treatment in a similar way as for 5 -S-cysteinyldopa. 3. The eumelanic marker 6 -hydroxy- 5 -methoxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid was excreted in larger quantities by people with genetically dark skin, whereas the pheomelanic marker 5 -S-cysteinyldopa was not related to pigment type. 4. In the urine of one albino patient and in the urine of albinotic mice a total absence of 6 -hydroxy- 5 -methoxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid was found. The urinary concentrations of 5 -S-cysteinyldopa in these subjects were measurable but lower than in pigmented subjects. Thus, 6 -hydroxy- 5 -methoxy-indole- 2 -carboxylic acid seems to be a more specific melanocyte marker than the cysteinyldopas...|$|R

Improvement in early diagnosis followed by efficient chemotherapy is the major control strategy for TB. Currently, T-cell based interferon-gamma release assays using Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) antigens from QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assays have shown unclear values in terms of sensitivity and specificity in the diagnoses of active pulmonary and latent TB infections. For this study, two MTB antigens known as VacIII and Ubi-VacIII were evaluated for their diagnostic potential based on dynamic T-cell responses among BCG-vaccinated populations were investigated. Thirty-six patients with active pulmonary TB and 38 healthy controls (HC) from a selected hospital in Kelantan, Malaysia were recruited and tested by using gold standard assays and IGRA. The sensitivity and specificity of QFT-GIT, VacIII and Ubi-VacIII antigens among BCG vaccinated population were 30. 4 % and 88. 9 %, 47. 8 % and 55. 6 %, and 30. 4 % and 18. 5 %, respectively. Even though the overall agreement between IGRA and the gold standards assays showed fairly poor correlation (K values= 0. 320), the T-cell responses against the antigens were considered statistically significant (P< 0. 001). ' In conclusion, all the 3 antigens were unable to discriminate between TB and HC due to high variability of the sensitivities and specificities they demonstrated.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: As {{a unique}} tool to assess {{metabolic}} fluxes noninvasively, (13) C {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} (MRS) could help to characterize and understand malignancy in human tumors. <b>However,</b> <b>its</b> <b>low</b> <b>sensitivity</b> has hampered applications in patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate that with sensitivity-optimized localized (13) C MRS and intravenous infusion of [1 -(13) C]glucose under euglycemia, it is possible to assess the dynamic conversion of glucose into its metabolic products in vivo in human glioma tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measurements were done at 3 T with a broadband single RF channel and a quadrature (13) C surface coil inserted in a (1) H volume coil. A (1) H/(13) C polarization transfer sequence was applied, modified for localized acquisition, alternatively in two (50 ml) voxels, one encompassing the tumor and the other normal brain tissue. RESULTS: After about 20 min of [1 -(13) C]glucose infusion, a [3 -(13) C]lactate signal appeared among several resonances of metabolic products of glucose in MR spectra of the tumor voxel. The resonance of [3 -(13) C]lactate was absent in MR spectra from contralateral tissue. In addition, the intensity of [1 -(13) C]glucose signals in the tumor area was about 50 % higher than that in normal tissue, likely reflecting more glucose in extracellular space due to a defective blood-brain barrier. The signal intensity for metabolites produced in or via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was lower in the tumor than in the contralateral area, albeit that the ratios of isotopomer signals were comparable. CONCLUSION: With an improved (13) C MRS approach, the uptake of glucose and its conversion into metabolites such as lactate can be monitored noninvasively in vivo in human brain tumors. This opens the way to assessing metabolic activity in human tumor tissue...|$|E
40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al XVI Scientific Meeting of the Spanish Society of Chromatography and Related Techniques, celebrado en Sevilla (España) del 2 al 4 de noviembre de 2016. Pectin is {{a generic}} term for some complex {{materials}} {{occurring in the}} cell wall of plants that can be isolated and used as a technological ingredient for huge number applications in pharmacy and, mainly, in the food industry. Basically, it is a α(1 - 4) linked polymer of galacturonic acid (GalA), namely homogalacturonan domain, esterified with methanol at some of its 6 -C carboxylate groups and with acetic acid to some C- 2 and C- 3 hydroxyl groups. This chain together with other domains with rhamnose and GalA branched with arabinogalactan and other odd carbohydrates constitute the complex structure of pectin, which strongly affect its functionality. In spite {{of the more than}} 180 years of pectin research, a renewed interest toward this polysaccharide has emerged {{due to the fact that}} new extraction processes and sources used for its obtainment may afford new structures and properties. One of the main targets is the development of robust analytical methodology which provides new insight in the macromolecular buildup of the pectin polymer. Among the different parameters Mw is particularly important for the characterization of modified pectin. To date, most of the methods are based on the separation by High-Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography (HP-SEC) using refractive index detector (RID), <b>however,</b> <b>its</b> relatively <b>low</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> dependence of response on temperature and flow rate and inability to be used under gradient elution have focused attention toward the use of the Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (ELSD). It can detect any analyte less volatile than the mobile phase and is a good alternative that improves detection sensitivity and baseline stability. Cameron et al. utilized HPLC-SEC to estimate the Mw of GalA oligomers and Condezo-Hoyos et al. for apple pectin of 140 kDa. In this work, a comparative study using HP-SEC with RID or ELSD as detection systems was carried out for the analysis of the Mw distribution of citrus and apple pectin. An optimization of ELSD conditions by CCD provided 85 and 75 °C as evaporator and nebulizer temperatures and 1. 2 mL min- 1 as flow rate of air. The regression curves were constructed with pullulans (10 - 2500 mg L- 1, 0. 342 - 805 kDa) obtaining coefficients of determination (R 2) of 1 and 0. 9804 for quadratic and linear fits, respectively. Detection and quantitation limits were 19. 9 and 25. 7 mg L- 1 for quadratic fit and 6. 7 and 16. 5 mg L- 1 for the linear one; these limits being 30 and 100 mg L- 1 for RID. The precision of ELSD and RID systems, evaluated in different days, was 9. 4 % and 6. 5 %, respectively. These results demonstrated the suitability of the chromatographic separation here used coupled with ELSD for the analysis of pectin with Mw values close to 700 kDa. Project AGL 2014 - 53445 -R.

40|$|Despite <b>its</b> <b>low</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and {{specificity}} (67 % and 72 %, respectively), exercise testing has remained {{one of the}} most widely used noninvasive tests to determine the prognosis in patients with suspected or established coronary disease. As a screening test for coronary artery disease, the exercise stress test is useful in that it is relatively simple and inexpensive. It has been considered particularly helpful in patients with chest pain syndromes who have moderate probability for coronary artery disease, and in whom the resting electrocardiogram (ECG) is normal. The following case presentation and discussion will question the predictive value of a negative stress testing in patients with moderate probability for coronary artery disease...|$|R
40|$|Due to <b>its</b> <b>low</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to {{blackbody}} radiation, neutral {{mercury is}} {{a good candidate for}} the most accurate optical lattice clock. Here we report the observation of cold mercury atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). Because of the high vapor pressure at room temperature, the mercury source and the cold pump were cooled down to - 40 degrees C and - 70 degrees C, respectively, to keep the science chamber in an ultra-high vacuum of 6 x 10 (- 9) Pa. Limited by the power of the UV cooling laser, the one beam folded MOT configuration was adopted, and 1. 5 x 10 (5) Hg- 202 atoms were observed by fluorescence detection...|$|R
