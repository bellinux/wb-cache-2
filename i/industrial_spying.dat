While at AMD, he provided the Cuban government with technical information from the semiconductor industry which the Cubans passed on to the Soviet bloc, primarily to the Soviet Union and East Germany. In 1992, Gaede turned himself over to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which placed him in contact with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI began working with Gaede in a counter-espionage operation intended to penetrate Cuban intelligence using his contacts on the island. During this time Gaede obtained work at Intel Corp. in Chandler, Arizona. Intel Security discovered the nature of his activities at AMD and terminated him, but not before Gaede filmed Intel's state-of-the-art Pentium process from home.|$|E
40|$|International audienceXIXth Century French Mining {{engineers}} {{reports and}} drawings on Swansea industry: <b>industrial</b> <b>spying</b> or technological exchanges? The history of mining and metallurgical techniques {{during the nineteenth}} century is often hampered by the lack of documentation: we know today the chronology of inventions or statistics of overall production, much less the technical reality, operation, tooling, processes as administrative archives are often silent on the matter. The Paris National School of Mines (Ecole des Mines de Paris) preserves a unique collection of manuscripts of mining and metallurgical travels range from 1825 to 1909. Hundred folio collections remained inaccessible and completely untapped while school students traveled with their notebook, all around a great part of Europe and sometimes in America, specifically to get all this documentation. A few part of these precious documents have been published in the well-known "Journal des Mines" then becoming the "Annales des Mines". Most of them are nowadays an exceptional unpublished source of information about mining, ore dressing and metal processes and machineries. Was it spying or was it the dissemination of ideas and technological concepts as required by invention and innovation ? The raise of a competitive intelligence ? Some of these exceptional detailed manuscripts concerns Wales mining and metallurgy and of course Swansea copper and steel industries and trade. As the world of industrial international relationships was marked by all forms of spying, the study of some XIXth century Swansea and Welsch reports and drawings raises again the question of technological exchanges and the origin of European industrial take off set up by these global enterprise...|$|E

40|$|A common {{technique}} for hiding information in executable files is the embedding {{a limited amount}} of information in program binaries. The hiding technique is commonly achieved by using special software tools as e. g. the tools presented by Hydan and Stilo in (Rakan, 2004, Bertrand, 2005). These tools can be used to commit crimes as e. g. <b>industrial</b> <b>spy</b> activities or other forms of illegal data access. In this paper, we propose new methods for hiding information in Portable Executable (PE) files. PE is a file format for executables used in the 32 -bit and 64 -bit versions of the Windows operating system. In addition, we discuss the analysis techniques which can be applied to detect and recover data hidden using each of these methods. The existing techniques for hiding information in an executable file determine the total number of bytes to be hidden on the foundation {{of the size of the}} executable code. Our novel methods proposed here do not limit the amount of hidden code...|$|R

At the time, thirty percent of Pinkerton's business resulted from its industrial services. Between 1936 and 1941, the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee of the U.S. Congress held hearings and published reports on the phenomenon of labor spying, and other aspects of industrial relations. The committee established that in some cases, a company was able to lock out its workers three days prior to a strike, based upon information that Pinkerton services provided. An example report from an informant was introduced into evidence, demonstrating that such reports singled out individual workers. The Senate, with the House of Representatives concurring, passed a resolution that,...the so-called <b>industrial</b> <b>spy</b> system breeds fear, suspicion and animosity, tends to cause strikes and industrial warfare and is contrary to sound public policy.|$|R
