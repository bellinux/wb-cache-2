50|$|Stamford School {{has four}} senior (Y10-Y13) houses. These are called Brazenose, Radcliffe, Ancaster and Exeter, {{there are also}} four junior house systems, each the same colour as their senior {{counterparts}} and are named St Peter's, St Paul's, Willoughby and Cecil respectively. There are also two boarding houses called Byard, for boys aged 11 to 14, and Browne, which houses boys aged 14 to 18. The four junior (Y7-Y9) houses are Cecil (<b>feeder</b> <b>house</b> to Exeter), Willoughby (<b>feeder</b> <b>house</b> to Ancaster), St Paul's (<b>feeder</b> <b>house</b> to Radcliffe) and St Peter’s (<b>feeder</b> <b>house</b> to Brazenose). Brazenose and Radcliffe traditionally housed town boys, while Ancaster and Exeter accommodated boys who lived north and south respectively of the River Welland.|$|E
50|$|This series {{consisted}} of the 7120, 8120 and 9120 models and {{were based on a}} 5.4m2 (7120) and 6.5m2 (8120/9120) cleaning area. Significant improvements were made to the design including replacing many chains and belts with hydraulic control, including the main rotor drive belt. This hydraulic drive also allowed the fitting of an in cabin rotor reversing mechanism, allowing operators to reverse the entire rotor and <b>feeder</b> <b>house</b> {{in the event of a}} blockage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station is}} {{situated}} outside Sölvesborg, far {{out on the}} peninsula Listerlandet, right on its outer point Björkenabben at the seaboard of the Baltic Sea. The station takes advantage of a phenomenon called [...] "sea gain", {{which means that the}} signal is amplified by the surrounding sea, to improve coverage. Two 135 m high steel lattice towers work as antennas and are fed halfway up by eight feeders from a <b>feeder</b> <b>house</b> beneath each of the two antennas, where the feeders from the transmitter are connected.|$|E
50|$|Attach a {{compatible}} hopper to {{the marker}} {{by placing the}} mouth-end (male) of the hopper into the Cyclone-Feed housing (female) and turning hopper until tab on mouth locks into corresponding hole in <b>feeder</b> <b>housing.</b> Hopper should be parallel with marker.|$|R
40|$|A corn {{shelling}} mechanism comprising {{an elongated}} concave means having one end thereof positioned below a rotatable cylinder. A continuous belt sheller is positioned above the concave in a spaced relationship with respect thereto. The corn ears are fed to the rotating cylinder by a <b>feeder</b> <b>housing</b> means with the ear receiving {{one or more}} impacts by the rasp bar of the cylinder before it travels {{out of range of}} the cylinder. The partially shelled ear passes between the belt sheller and the concave with the belt sheller urging the ears into engagement with the concave to complete the shelling operation...|$|R
50|$|Level winders can be {{hydraulically}} or electrically driven {{and computer}} controlled, {{or they can}} be simple mechanical devices. A mechanical level winder comprises a main shaft (the lead screw) with helical screw grooving along which the rope feeder travels. The rope <b>feeder</b> <b>housing</b> includes two vertical roller bars and one horizontal roller, or alternatively a wire rope sheave. The lateral movement of the housing is generated by a chain drive sprocket ratio between drum and lead screw, {{as shown in the}} image. The automatic level winder fitted is designed and engineered to be compatible with the grooving on the drum.Alternatively, a sheave can be integrated and installed within the housing frame. In this case, the system can be set up anywhere around the drum. Oceanographic installations that spool rope up to 46 layers have demonstrated that level winders give synchronized and controlled spooling in the harshest, most testing conditions.|$|R
50|$|House finches forage on {{the ground}} or in {{vegetation}} normally. They primarily eat grains, seeds and berries, being voracious consumers of weed seeds such as nettle and dandelion; included are incidental small insects such as aphids. They are frequent visitors to bird feeders throughout the year, particularly if stocked with sunflower or nyjer seed, and will congregate at hanging nyjer sock <b>feeders.</b> The <b>house</b> finch is known to damage orchard fruit and consume commercially grown grain but is generally not considered a significant pest but rather an annoyance.|$|R
50|$|The power {{infrastructure}} of Pakistan {{also took a}} severe blow from the floods, which damaged about 10,000 transmission lines and transformers, <b>feeders</b> and power <b>houses</b> in different flood-hit areas. Flood water inundated Jinnah Hydro power and 150 power houses in Gilgit. The damage caused a power shortfall of 3.135 gigawatts.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{dynamically}} reduce voltage unbalance along a low voltage distribution feeder, a smart residential load transfer system is discussed. In this scheme, residential loads {{can be transferred}} from one phase to another to minimize the voltage unbalance along the <b>feeder.</b> Each <b>house</b> is supplied through a static transfer switch and a controller. The master controller, installed at the transformer, observes the power consumption in each house and will determine which house(s) should be transferred from an initially connected phase to another {{in order to keep}} the voltage unbalance minimum. The performance of the smart load transfer scheme is demonstrated by simulations. ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{there is}} {{a vast array of}} bird feeders, feeders are {{typically}} placed into three categories: tube, hopper, and platform. [...] Tube feeders are long and slender and are typically constructed of plastic. Hopper <b>feeders</b> resemble small <b>houses,</b> and are made of a combination of metal, wood, and plastic. Platform feeders are large trays that are often covered and are typically made of wood or plastic.|$|R
6000|$|But mark {{my words}} for it, that in the {{religious}} world (I have once or twice, by mistake no doubt, had the honor of dining in [...] "serious" [...] houses, and can vouch {{for the fact that}} the dinners there are of excellent quality)--in the serious world, in the great mercantile world, among the legal community (notorious <b>feeders),</b> in every <b>house</b> in town (except some half-dozen which can afford to do without such aid), the man I propose might speedily render himself indispensable.|$|R
40|$|Low voltage {{distribution}} feeders {{with large}} numbers of single phase residential loads experience severe current unbalance that often causes voltage unbalance problems. The addition of intermittent generation and new loads in the form of roof top photovoltaic generation and electric vehicles makes these problems even more acute. In this paper, an intelligent dynamic residential load transfer scheme is proposed. Residential loads can be transferred from one phase to another phase to minimize the voltage unbalance along the <b>feeder.</b> Each <b>house</b> is supplied through a static transfer switch with three-phase input and single-phase output connection. The main controller, installed at the transformer will observe the power consumption in each load and determine which house(s) should be transferred from one phase to another {{in order to keep the}} voltage unbalance in the feeder at a minimum. The efficacy of the proposed load transfer scheme is verified through MATLAB and PSCAD/EMTDC simulations...|$|R
50|$|The Parker-Hickman Farm {{includes}} the oldest standing log structure in Buffalo National River. The farm was homesteaded in the 1840s by settlers from Tennessee. It embodies an agricultural landscape with farmstead, extant fields (bench and bottomland), fencerows, roads, cattle gates, garden and orchard plots, wooded slopes and springs. Unlike most {{farms in the}} Ozarks the landscape is remarkably intact and provides insights and evidence spanning portions of two centuries of Ozark history; not randomly chosen, it conveys a feeling of enclosure and exemplifies adaptive use of topography. Among farms {{of its kind in}} Missouri and Arkansas it was once typical but now survives as a rare baseline example for Ozark yeomanry farms of mixed economies. Parker-Hickman was an agricultural enterprise that continuously operated until 1982 from a farmstead which exemplifies the entire period, and a rare one for the Ozarks since it survives. Clustered around the farmstead are several structures: barns, sheds smokehouse, privy, fences, stock <b>feeders</b> and <b>house</b> that represent a cross-section of rural vernacular architecture still in their original location.|$|R
40|$|On Thursday, 01 February 2007, Scott Raasch {{of rural}} Madison County {{called to say}} he had what he {{believed}} to be a Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) coming to a <b>feeder</b> at his <b>house</b> just east of Enola. The bird had been present for about a week, although he had just identified the species upon purchasing a new field guide. He reported that the bird was very wary and only stayed for a short time at the feeder. The bird was most often observed in the early morning or just before dusk. Dave Heidt and I arrived the following evening and were told we had just missed the bird by a few minutes. We saw a photo that Scott had taken of the bird earlier in the day and it was clearly an adult Eurasian Tree Sparrow. We waited until dusk without seeing the bird. Ellen Brogie, Dave Heidt, and I arrived before sunrise on 03 February, and after a wait of about an hour the bird appeared. Ellen was able to get several photographs of the bird during the few minutes it spent at the feeder. We waited for another hour or more without the bird reappearing. The bird was in the company of several House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) and had the general body structure and appearance of a male House Sparrow, but with very distinct differences. The most notable feature that stood out was the black auricular spot surrounded by white. The bird was noticeably smaller than a House Sparrow and nearby House Finches (Carpodacus mexicanus). The bird had a brown crown rather than gray of a male House Sparrow. The bird did not possess as much black on the throat as a House Sparrow and the white neck collar was also very distinctive. From the back, the bird appeared to be a small House Sparrow. Although Eurasian Tree Sparrow is known to hybridize with the House Sparrow (Leckie, 2001) the bird appeared phenotypically pure and showed no characteristics of hybridization discussed by Leckie...|$|R
5000|$|In {{keeping with}} Bauhaus philosophy, {{every aspect of}} the house and its {{surrounding}} landscape was planned for maximum efficiency and simplicity. Gropius carefully sited the house to complement its New England habitat on a grassy rise surrounded by stone retaining walls, amidst wetlands and an orchard of 90 apple trees which the Gropiuses allowed to grow naturally other than a few rounds of mowing during the growing season. Gropius wanted the outdoor space around the home to be an equally [...] "civilized area" [...] and created a lawn that extended twenty feet around the entire house, with a perennial garden expanding in the south by the porch. Although the house sits on a rather flat plot of land, by keeping the woodlands well maintained, the Gropiuses were able to retain a broad view of the south, east, and west. His screened porch was placed {{in such a way that}} it helps to divide the land around the house into multiple zones, comparable to rooms inside a house. The house was conceived as part of an organic landscape, where Gropius utilized indoor/outdoor spaces to accentuate a relationship between the structure and the site. Before the home's design was even complete, Walter Gropius was hard at work creating the ideal landscape. He selected mature trees from the neighboring forest and helped to transplant them in what would later become his yard. Ise was the predominate landscaper in the family, and she and Walter selected Scotch pine, white pine, elm, oak, and American Beech trees to complement their surroundings. The Gropiuses also added [...] "rescued" [...] boulders and wooden trellises adorned with pink climbing roses and Concord grapevines to flatter the New England landscape. Bittersweet vines and trumpet vines also connected the home to nature. Ise spent many hours each week planting, weeding, and trimming. She also filled and maintained more than a dozen bird <b>feeders</b> and bird <b>houses</b> on the property and claimed to have known more than ninety birds personally. After a trip to Japan in the 1950s, Mrs. Gropius removed the perennials and covered the ground in a layer of gray gravel, where she then planted azaleas, candytuft, cotoneaster, and one large red-leafed Japanese Maple.|$|R
