Later in the half he pushed me aside to score a try, but I could at least claim to have cut him down once." [...] Following the Test Campese and Lomu met in the changing rooms and exchanged their jerseys. Lomu gave Campese his number 11 jersey while Campese gave Lomu his number 16 jersey. Campese's 92nd Test marked the last Test he would play in the amateur era.|$|E
60|$|The {{next moment}} Uncle Willoughby {{had opened the}} drawer. <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes.|$|E
60|$|And then {{footsteps}} sounded outside, and {{the hope}} died away. <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes.|$|E
60|$|Haven't I? I suppose <b>I</b> must <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> {{eyes and}} say nothing. You're {{in love with}} her. D'you think I've not seen it in these months? That's {{why you want to}} leave me.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had to eat}} two meals, though," [...] said Felicity with a shiver. [...] "And I don't {{know when}} those dishes of hers were washed. <b>I</b> just <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes and took gulps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{in spite}} of that {{discomfort}} I found something reassuring by insensible degrees in the rationality of this business of question and answer. <b>I</b> could <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes, think of my answer, and almost forget that the the Grand Lunar has no face....|$|R
6000|$|... "And why, alas?" [...] {{said the}} gentleman, angrily; [...] "is it because <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> door against a score {{or two of}} these blood-thirsty hypocrites?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Master, I saw and heard, not everything, {{because there}} came {{a point at which}} <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes and stopped my ears, but still much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> {{eyes and}} hold your head?" [...] quavered devoted Betty, {{as they went}} up the stairs so many {{reluctant}} feet had mounted before them.|$|E
6000|$|LADY WINDERMERE. [Sits on sofa.] Because <b>I,</b> who had <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes to life, {{came to the}} brink. And one who had {{separated}} us - ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, Dale, I think I can. I'm {{pretty sure}} of it. That ball comes easily, {{only a little}} longer swing and more snap, and honestly, Dale, I hardly ever think about the plate. I know where it is, and <b>I</b> could <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes and throw strikes." ...|$|R
6000|$|The wind fanned my cheek, {{the sails}} slept, {{the world was}} silent. The strain of {{watching}} the dark loom of the land grow bigger and denser {{was too much for}} me. <b>I</b> had <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes--because the ship must go closer. She must! The stillness was intolerable. Were we standing still? ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes,--it matters not-- [...] Still {{still the}} same I see,-- [...] And when I lie me down at night [...] 'Tis always day with me.|$|E
60|$|Then I saw the {{man with}} the weapon {{straighten}} himself for the effort. I saw the cold steel gleam on high, and once more <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "How unfeeling you are, Fan! Do you {{remember}} what you said the other night, that if <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> door against you you would come {{and sit on the}} doorstep?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{named the}} Lily now: once I had another name. Nada, {{daughter}} of Mopo, I was once; but name and all else are dead, and I go to join them. Kill me {{and make an}} end. <b>I</b> will <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes, that <b>I</b> may not see the great axe flash." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, poy; not at all. It is goot to t'e poty {{to lighten}} t'e soul of its opligations. Ast I see, howsefer, t'at Dus ist trouplet, <b>I</b> wilt <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes, {{and look into}} my own t'oughts a little, for I may not tie for some hours yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! go on! I adore it," [...] {{cried the}} lady of 'Mes Larmes.' [...] "Heavenly night! heavenly, heavenly moon! but <b>I</b> must <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> window, and not talk to you on account of les moeurs. How droll they are, les moeurs! Adieu." [...] And Pen began to sing the Goodnight to Don Basilio.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> {{eyes and}} thought. Again the flashes seemed {{to stand out}} clear and distinct. But no detail supervened--no face came back to me. I felt it was useless.|$|E
6000|$|At night I go {{on board}} and say [...] Good-night to all my friends on shore; [...] <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes and sail away [...] And see and hear no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I go {{to sleep}} I'll have to shut my eyes," [...] he explained; [...] "and if <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes they may grow together, and then I'd be blind for life!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I sees it all afore {{me every}} time <b>I</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>my</b> eyes. Lordy, sir, you wouldn't hardly believe how clear it is to me. There's our line from the {{paregoric}} bottle right along to the snuff box. D'ye see? Well, then, the pill box is for Hougoumont on the right--where we was--and Norah's thimble for La Haye Sainte. There it is, all right, sir; and here were our guns, and here behind the reserves and the Belgians. Ach, them Belgians!" [...] He spat furiously into the fire. [...] "Then here's the French, where my pipe lies; and over here, where I put my baccy pouch, was the Proosians a-comin' up on our left flank. Jimini, {{but it was a}} glad sight to see the smoke of their guns!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A salute, madam," [...] said <b>I,</b> and so <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> {{glass and}} went into my cabin, where Mr. Langely {{presently}} joined me at my request, and where we talked over this very ugly piece of business at our leisure.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>shut</b> up <b>my</b> shop, {{paid him}} every attention, {{taking him to}} the bath, giving him my most {{beautiful}} robes. I examined my accounts, and found that I had doubled my capital--that is, that I now possessed two thousand sequins. I gave my brother half, saying: [...] "Now, brother, you can forget your losses." [...] He accepted them with joy, and we lived together as we had before.|$|R
60|$|So {{that great}} black dog rushed forward and caught my poor father in its big mouth, {{although}} {{he tried to}} drag himself away on his front paws, and after that <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "He was {{the life}} of the old school," [...] Jimmy said, {{referring}} to me, [...] "and when <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes I can hear his merry laugh as if we were both in knickerbockers still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I know Aunt Lily does now; but, oh! if you {{had seen}} Uncle Alfred's face, and heard Uncle Regie,' and Dolly began to sob again as they {{returned}} on her. 'I see them whenever <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't know," [...] {{answered}} Corny. [...] "I {{was leaning}} far over, when my hand must have slipped, {{and the first}} thing I knew I was into it. It's good <b>I</b> didn't <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes. If you get into water, with your eyes shut, you can't open them again." [...] She still puffed a little. [...] "Coming up was the best. It's the first time I ever saw the bottom of a boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I move {{safely in}} the matter, {{with such a}} pitfall as I see here open under my feet? How can I tell? Where can I find an {{experienced}} person to inform me? <b>I</b> must <b>shut</b> up <b>my</b> diary and think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Naughty Primrose," [...] cried Cowslip, a {{child of}} six years old; [...] "I did not fall asleep, and <b>I</b> only <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes, so as to see {{a picture of what}} Cousin Eustace was telling about. His stories are good to hear at night, because we can dream about them asleep; and good in the morning, too, because then we can dream about them awake. So I hope he will tell us one this very minute." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes once {{or twice}} and tried to persuade myself {{that the whole thing}} was a delusion, but every time that I opened them there was the man still {{regarding}} me with the same stony, menacing stare.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes, for I {{saw the man}} {{coming with}} a spear, and myself, I could not stir to Leo's help, for I was growing weak, {{and the two men}} on me were not yet dead, and a deadly {{sickness}} overcame me.|$|E
60|$|Impossible to {{mistake the}} sound of billiard balls! Impossible to mistake the whir of a ball over the slate! But I was to be excused. Even when <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> enlightened eyes the sound was marvelously {{like that of a}} fast game.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not when I am near,' {{said the}} Dog. 'If {{you had not}} said that last <b>I</b> would have <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> mouth for always and always and always; but now I am going to hunt you up a tree {{whenever}} I meet you. And so shall all proper Dogs do after me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{ought to}} be a law to protect unfortunate authors,' said Mrs Jo one morning soon after Emil's arrival, when the mail brought her an unusually large and varied {{assortment}} of letters. 'To me it is a more vital subject than international copyright; for time is money, peace is health, and I lose both with no return but less respect for my fellow creatures and a wild desire to fly into the wilderness, since <b>I</b> cannot <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> doors even in free America.' ...|$|R
60|$|Without {{seeing any}} reason to believe that women are, on the average, so strong physically, intellectually, or morally, as men, <b>I</b> cannot <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes to the fact that many women are much better endowed in all these respects than many men, and I am at a loss to {{understand}} on what grounds of justice or public policy a career which is open to the weakest and most foolish of the male sex should be forcibly closed to women of vigour and capacity.|$|R
