5|$|With {{the failure}} of his attempt to conquer Naxos, Aristagoras found himself in dire straits; {{he was unable to}} repay Artaphernes, and had, moreover, alienated himself from the Persian royal family. He fully {{expected}} to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt.|$|E

5|$|Antony's fleet {{sailed through}} {{the bay of}} Actium on the western coast of Greece <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to break free of the naval blockade. It was there that Antony's fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller, more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and Gaius Sosius {{in the battle of}} Actium on 2 September 31BC. Antony and his {{remaining}} forces were spared only due to a last-ditch effort by Cleopatra's fleet that had been waiting nearby.|$|E
5|$|At 16:29, the Japanese dive bombers {{began their}} attacks. Although several {{attempted}} {{to set up}} to attack the Saratoga, they quickly shifted back to the nearer carrier, Enterprise. Thus, Enterprise {{was the target of}} almost the entire Japanese air attack. Several Wildcats followed the Vals into their attack dives, despite the intense anti-aircraft artillery fire from Enterprise and her screening warships, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to disrupt their attacks. As many as four Wildcats were shot down by U.S. anti-aircraft fire, as well as several Vals.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, {{the balance}} of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945, its fleet was much {{depleted}} and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to slow the Allied advance, Yamato was dispatched on a one-way mission to Okinawa in April 1945, with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of Kyushu by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers {{with the loss of}} most of her crew.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> {{attempt to}} improve the {{situation}} and hamper British operations, a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking airborne radar sets and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it was felt they may do so again.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> {{attempt to}} prevent armed battle and to avert the {{resulting}} political crisis, U.S. President Andrew Jackson consulted his Attorney General, Benjamin Butler, for his legal {{opinion on the}} border dispute. At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen U.S. representatives and two senators. In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, had only a single non-voting delegate. Ohio was a crucial swing state in presidential elections, {{and it would have}} been devastating to the fledgling Democratic Party to lose Ohio's electoral votes. Therefore, Jackson calculated that his party's best interest would be served by keeping the Toledo Strip a part of Ohio.|$|E

Kingsbury's battalion made landfall at Adelaide and continued to Melbourne by rail. The battalion arrived on 16 March, and was given a week's leave. After this, the battalion underwent training in Glen Innes, before camping in Yandina, Queensland. On 5 August, the battalion moved north to Brisbane, boarding a ship to Port Moresby to join the fighting in New Guinea, where a force of mostly Militia personnel were engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> defensive action.|$|E

5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{wrote of}} another {{tradition}} which {{stated that the}} flag was waved at a battle in Waternish, in about 1580; and of another which told of how it was waved {{during a time when}} a cattle plague was raging, and that it stopped the murrain. R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been waved twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on the losing side! R.C. MacLeod also wondered if it had been waved in 1600, when the clan was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.|$|E
5|$|In the oil platform, Chris and Piers head underground, {{managing}} to free Jake and Sherry from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon called Haos from the location. Heavily wounded, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to save Chris, Piers injects {{himself with a}} sample of the C-virus to help turn the tide of the battle, temporarily defeating Haos before evacuating. Aware that the mutation would worsen, Piers sacrifices himself by pushing Chris to an escape pod. After Chris' pod is launched, Haos makes one last attempt to kill Chris but is killed himself by a powerful lightning charge from Piers, which ensures Chris' escape and the destruction of the Neo-Umbrella base. At the same time, Jake and Sherry escape the facility pursued relentlessly by Ustanak, eventually {{managing to}} kill him as they ride a rocket-powered lift back to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Inexplicably, Generals Floyd and Pillow were upbeat {{about the}} day's {{performance}} and wired General Johnston at Nashville {{that they had}} won a great victory. Buckner, however, argued that they were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> position that was getting worse {{with the arrival of}} Union reinforcements. At their final council of war in the Dover Hotel at 1:30a.m. on February 16, Buckner stated that if C.F. Smith attacked again, he could only hold for thirty minutes, and he estimated that the cost of defending the fort would be as high as a seventy-five percent casualty rate. Buckner's position finally carried the meeting. Any large-scale escape would be difficult. Most of the river transports were currently transporting wounded men to Nashville and would not return in time to evacuate the command.|$|E

5|$|On 21 May 1809, Napoleon {{crossed the}} Danube {{not far from}} Vienna and {{attacked}} Archduke Charles's Austrian army, situated on the northern bank of the river, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The French were nonetheless critically outnumbered and it soon became obvious that they would have a hard time just holding out. Nansouty could only get one of his brigades, Saint-Germain's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers, across the Danube for the action on 21 May. He found the heroic cuirassiers of General Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne charging, as they had done all day long, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to stop Austrian attacks on the thin French battle line. Espagne had just been killed in action and his exhausted and depleted squadrons needed to be relieved. Nansouty at once brought forward Saint-Germain's squadrons and charged the enemy infantry, allowing the army to maintain itself on the position.|$|E
5|$|Pedro Moreno, {{sent from}} the Audiencia of Santo Domingo in Hispaniola, arrived in Honduras {{shortly after the}} {{founding}} of Trujillo. He found forty colonists <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> state, lacking weapons and provisions. A few more Spaniards were still at Nito, the remnants of González Dávila's men, where their plight was even worse. The residents of Trujillo pleaded with Moreno for assistance, which he granted on condition that they renounced Cortés, accepted {{the jurisdiction of the}} Audiencia of Santo Domingo, and agreed to take Juan Ruano, one of Olid's former officers, as Chief Magistrate. Moreno renamed Trujillo as Ascensión, and he sent messages to Hernández de Córdoba, who was in Nicaragua, asking him to renounce his loyalty to Pedrarias and pledge allegiance to Santo Domingo. Moreno then returned to Hispaniola, promising to send aid. As soon as he was gone, the residents restored the name of Trujillo, pledged their allegiance once more to Cortés, and expelled Juan Ruano.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} sailed in {{the spring}} of 499 BC but quickly descended into a debacle The force laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually the Persians and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force therefore sailed despondently back to the mainland. Aristagoras found himself in dire straits and fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt. Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway, the primary grievance being the tyrants installed by the Persians. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia (and Aeolis and Doris), and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E

Padilla received 57 shallow slashes from a dagger which did not put his life in danger, but he could have died from blood loss. Padilla blamed Flores for the stabbing and for an earlier attack {{in which he was}} allegedly beaten by men who warned him against criticizing the church leader. A church spokesman denied that the church or Flores had any involvement in the attack and suggested that Padilla may have orchestrated the attack <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to authenticate his previous charges against the church.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{in the village of}} Etene, {{focusing}} on the protagonist, an orphan living with their sibling. The peace is shattered when Nelgel, the Lord of Hell, attacks the village. The protagonist's soul is transported to a shrine and placed within the body of a member of the five non-human tribes, while their sister is transported to the past to protect her from Nelgel. Under the guidance of a sage, the protagonist travels Astoltia searching for sacred emblems with which to reach Nelgel's lair. After collecting six out of ten emblems, the sage attempts to form a bridge to Nelgel's laier. This fails, and he decides to separate the protagonist's soul from their body <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to try another method. This proves to be successful, as the protagonist then meets the body's original owner.|$|E
