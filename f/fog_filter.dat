5000|$|The {{original}} Industar-10 lens manufactured between 1934-46 {{was a more}} or less exact copy of the Leitz Elmar 4-element lens {{that first}} appeared in 1924. This was based on the earlier 5-element Leitz Elmax which had been patented by 1920. The Industar-10, Elmar & Tessar had completely different focal lengths. The Industar-10s made between 1934 and 1948-49 were 50 mm. Those manufactured after 1948-49 based on the Zeiss Tessar were 52.4 mm. The later KMZ Industar-22 was 52.4 mm. The Carl Zeiss standard is 52.4, the same as the Sonnar (Jupiter 3 & 8) and later the Industar 26M, Industar-50, Industar-61 - all used the standard CZ focal length. The last KMZ Industar made in quantity was the Type 50-2 for the Zenith, a small, flat unit in black with M42 thread, often sold as [...] "Pancake Lens" [...] to recent DSLR owners. This has two serious defects: The aperture ring sits inside the focus ring so cannot be stopped down after focussing, as is normal practice with manual lenses. The anti-reflection [...] "economy"-coating is visibly poor inasmuch existent. Maybe only on a single surface. Although the images are sharp, they are typically overlaid by a <b>fog</b> <b>filter.</b> In contrast to the earlier 52.4 mm white-metal Industars with heavy blue coating, that are rarer, more expensive and often in heavily used condition.|$|E
2500|$|Altman's {{distinctive}} {{style of}} directing {{carried over into}} his preferences for camerawork. Among them was his use of widescreen compositions, intended to capture the many people or activities taking place on screen at the same time. For some films, such as McCabe and Mrs. Miller, he created a powerful visual atmosphere with cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, such as scenes using fluid camerawork, zoom lenses, and a smoky effect using special <b>fog</b> <b>filters.</b> Director Stanley Kubrick told Altman that [...] "the camerawork was wonderful," [...] and asked, [...] "How did you do it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The fourth edition Monster Manual {{describes}} Thanatos as [...] "a dark {{landscape of}} death shrouded by gray clouds and often obscured by <b>fog.</b> Light <b>filters</b> weakly {{through the clouds}} and mists, illuminating the realm like a moonlit night. Dead forests filled with twisted black trees and barren moors dominate. Bleak mountains rise feebly into the black sky, and cities and villages in ruins crouch in hidden places as though fearful. Strewn all over the realm are tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi." ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} incremental increases in intraocular straylight on threshold measurements made by three modern forms of perimetry: Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP) using Octopus (Dynamic, G-Pattern), Pulsar Perimetry (PP) (TOP, 66 points) and the Moorfields Motion Displacement Test (MDT) (WEBS, 32 points). Methods: Four healthy young observers were recruited (mean age 26 yrs [25 yrs, 28 yrs]), refractive correction [+ 2 D, - 4. 25 D]). Five white opacity filters (WOF), each scattering light by different amounts were used to create incremental increases in intraocular straylight (IS). Resultant IS values were measured with each WOF and at baseline (no WOF) for each subject using a C-Quant Straylight Meter (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany). A 25 yr old has an IS value of ~ 0. 85 log(s). An increase of 40 % in IS to 1. 2 log(s) corresponds to the physiological value of a 70 yr old. Each WOFs created an increase in IS between 10 - 150 % from baseline, ranging from effects similar to normal aging to those found with considerable cataract. Each subject underwent 6 test sessions over a 2 -week period; each session consisted of the 3 perimetric tests {{using one of the}} five WOFs and baseline (both instrument and filter were randomised). Results: The reduction in sensitivity from baseline was calculated. A two-way ANOVA on mean change in threshold (where subjects were treated as rows in the block and each increment in <b>fog</b> <b>filters</b> was treated as column) was used to examine the effect of incremental increases in straylight. Both SAP (p< 0. 001) and Pulsar (p< 0. 001) were significantly affected by increases in straylight. The MDT (p= 0. 35) remained comparatively robust to increases in straylight. Conclusions: The Moorfields MDT measurement of threshold is robust to effects of additional straylight as compared to SAP and PP...|$|R
40|$|A rate {{feed forward}} control-based sensor fusion is {{proposed}} to improve the closed-loop performance for a charge couple device (CCD) tracking loop. The target trajectory is recovered by combining line of sight (LOS) errors from the CCD and the angular rate from a fiber-optic gyroscope (<b>FOG).</b> A Kalman <b>filter</b> based on the Singer acceleration model utilizes the reconstructive target trajectory to estimate the target velocity. Different from classical feed forward control, additive feedback loops are inevitably added to the original control loops {{due to the fact}} some closed-loop information is used. The transfer function of the Kalman filter in the frequency domain is built for analyzing the closed loop stability. The bandwidth of the Kalman filter is the major factor affecting the control stability and close-loop performance. Both simulations and experiments are provided to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm...|$|R
