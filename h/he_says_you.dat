500|$|Side Two {{opens with}} the young man's dying {{thoughts}} turning to his recent breakup with the unnamed lover ("Two Out of Three Ain't Bad"); the song was written quite late in the album's production, shortly before the album was released. The song documents the breakup of a relationship where {{despite the fact that}} the man wants and needs the woman, he will never love her; he tries to be positive and supportive, however, in emphasizing that wanting her and needing her are very positive things—i.e., [...] "ain't bad"—which gives the song an ironic twist. A further twist is that the reason the man will never love the woman is because he already loves another woman, who broke up with him because she already loved another man. Rundgren identifies how the song was influenced by the Eagles, who were successful at the time. The producer also highlights the [...] "underlying humor in the lyrics", citing the line [...] "There ain't no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box." [...] <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>you</b> could only [...] "get away" [...] with that lyric [...] "in a Meat Loaf song".|$|E

[...] And <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>you</b> must write your name below, because {{he is going to}} write a letter in some days to you. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>you</b> are a good man. He says the other man is a fool. He is going away.' ...|$|E
