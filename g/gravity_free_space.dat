40|$|The present work is {{an attempt}} to {{construct}} a unified field theory in a space with curvature and anticurvature, the PAP-space. The theory is derived from an action principle and a Lagrangian density using a symmetric linear parameterized connection. Three different methods are used to explore physical contents of the theory obtained. Poisson’s equations for both material and charge distributions are obtained, as special cases, from the field equations of the theory. The theory is a pure geometric one in the sense that material distribution, charge distribution, gravitational and electromagnetic potentials, and other physical quantities are defined in terms of pure geometric objects of the structure used. In the case of pure <b>gravity</b> in <b>free</b> <b>space,</b> the spherical symmetric solution of the field equations gives the Schwarzschild exterior field.

40|$|For most marine benthic {{communities}} unoccupied primary substrata, or <b>free</b> <b>space,</b> {{is considered}} the principle limiting resource. Substratum temperatures, desiccation rates and hydrodynamic characteristics of <b>free</b> <b>space,</b> however, may vary depending on patch size and isolation and therefore potentially influence biotic processes. This paper investigates the relationship between small-scale changes in the availability and configuration of <b>free</b> <b>space,</b> heat stress and abundance of the small rocky intertidal gastropod Patelloida latistrigata within southeastern Australia. Using infrared thermography I show that heat stress of rocky intertidal communities increased linearly with increasing amounts of <b>free</b> <b>space</b> on three neighbouring shores during four separate sampling intervals from October 2009 to January 2010. Abundances of P. latistrigata generally declined with increasing availability of <b>free</b> <b>space</b> and the associated increases in heat stress. An experimental manipulation that altered the configuration but not the availability of <b>free</b> <b>space</b> demonstrated that both heat stress and P. latistrigata abundance are not affected by small-scale changes in the configuration of <b>free</b> <b>space.</b> The small-scale distribution of P. latistrigata, however, was significantly influenced by differences in the configuration of <b>free</b> <b>space</b> with limpets displaying bimodal distributions within areas characterised by unevenly distributed <b>free</b> <b>space.</b> Since the distribution of Patelloida varies depending on the configuration of <b>free</b> <b>space</b> but thermal properties at the scale of individual limpets do not then we might expect Patelloida to be responding to changes in other abiotic factors, such as hydrodynamic forces and desiccation rates, which may change with the configuration of <b>free</b> <b>space.</b> This study highlights the dynamic and usually unexamined relationship between abiotic stress and the availability and acquisition of resources by marine benthic invertebrates...|$|R
