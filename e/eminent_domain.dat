5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the June 8 agreement, D.C. United was {{required}} to submit a concept design for the stadium to the city by September 1, 2015. The District of Columbia faced a deadline for September 30, 2015, to use <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> to acquire the Akridge land, which forces the club to commit to building a stadium before the city finished purchasing land. On September 30, the District of Columbia filed for <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> for the Akridge parcel.|$|E
5|$|Some {{complaints}} {{were raised by}} others during {{the construction of the}} freeway south of SR 94. A proposed drainage basin raised concerns about a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes being located near homes. Caltrans was later ordered by local courts to pay settlements in the millions of dollars to local business owners for undervaluing property taken by <b>eminent</b> <b>domain.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Amendment {{protects against}} double {{jeopardy}} and self-incrimination and guarantees {{the rights to}} due process, grand jury screening of criminal indictments, and compensation for the seizure of private property under <b>eminent</b> <b>domain.</b> The amendment {{was the basis for}} the court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona (1966), which established that defendants must be informed of their rights to an attorney and against self-incrimination prior to interrogation by police.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District, an area {{inhabited}} predominantly {{by people of}} African descent, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using <b>eminent</b> <b>domain,</b> forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), {{to make room for}} a cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961. Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built.|$|E
5|$|OTA began filing {{condemnation}} {{suits for}} homes within the Creek Turnpike's proposed right-of-way on June 30, 1989. Condemnation, {{the process by}} which a government exercises its powers of <b>eminent</b> <b>domain,</b> was required for OTA to seize properties necessary for the project when owners refused OTA buyout offers. Bids were opened for Creek Turnpike construction projects that November. Contracts for utility relocation, grading, and drainage work were awarded at OTA's November 16 meeting. Meanwhile, work began on the condemned properties, with contractors moving or demolishing houses on the affected lots from December 1989 to January 1990.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislature}} {{established the}} Albany Pine Bush Preserve Commission in 1988. Its members consist of {{representatives of the}} New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, The Nature Conservancy, the towns of Colonie and Guilderland, {{and the city of}} Albany, Albany County; and four private citizens appointed by the governor. In 2001, the State Employees Federal Credit Union (SEFCU) bank branch on New Karner Road was taken under <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> by the state to be adapted for use as the Albany Pine Bush Discovery Center.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbeek was {{a strong}} proponent of the {{proposed}} arena in Newark, which first received funding from the city council during Puck Holdings' ownership in 2002. After legal battles over both <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> and the city's financial participation in the arena project, the final deal was approved by council in October 2004, during {{the early months of}} the lockout, and the groundbreaking occurred almost exactly a year later. Nonetheless, in January 2006, financial issues threatened to halt the deal, as the Devils did not provide the city with a required letter of credit until the last possible day.|$|E
5|$|Between 2006 and 2007, Texas spent $7,275 {{per pupil}} ranking it below the {{national}} average of $9,389. The pupil/teacher ratio was 14.9, {{below the national}} average of 15.3. Texas paid instructors $41,744, {{below the national average}} of $46,593. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) administers the state's public school systems. Texas has over 1,000 school districts- all districts except the Stafford Municipal School District are independent from municipal government and many cross city boundaries. School districts have the power to tax their residents and to assert <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> over privately owned property. Due to court-mandated equitable school financing for school districts, the state has a controversial tax redistribution system called the"Robin Hood plan". This plan transfers property tax revenue from wealthy school districts to poor ones. The TEA has no authority over private or home school activities.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Chicago Fire, the block {{was home to}} one of Chicago's largest theaters. During the late 19th century, tall office {{buildings}} proliferated on the block. By 1970, the block was densely developed with 11 buildings, housing theaters, offices, a YMCA, and retailers like Stop & Shop, a grocer. On June 14, 1973, Mayor Richard J. Daley announced a broad urban renewal initiative centered on the North Loop theater district. Over the ensuing 16 years, numerous private developers, notably the Rubloff Company and JMB Realty, planned large mixed-use developments on the site, with a mall along State Street and hotels and office towers above. Property assembly was facilitated by Mayor Harold Washington's creation of the North Loop tax increment financing district in 1983, which gave the urban renewal effort a steady revenue stream and <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> authority.|$|E
5|$|In Brody v. Village of Port Chester (2003 and 2005), a takings case, Sotomayor first {{ruled in}} 2003 for a {{unanimous}} panel that a property owner in Port Chester, New York {{was permitted to}} challenge the state's <b>Eminent</b> <b>Domain</b> Procedure Law. A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land {{should be used for}} a redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.|$|E
5|$|In {{seeking the}} 51st House {{district}} state house seat, representing Loveland, Marostica first faced a challenge from Kevan McNaught in the Republican primary. McNaught {{was endorsed by}} the Colorado Club for Growth, who criticized Marostica for his support of higher taxes and his use of <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> {{when he was a}} member the Loveland city council. Marostica edged out McNaught in the Republican primary by about 250 votes, or 5% of voters. In contrast with McNaught's conservative credentials, Marostica was considered by observers on both {{the left and the right}} to be a moderate Republican; he supported Colorado's 2005 Referendum C, a loosening of state spending restrictions under the state's Taxpayer Bill of Rights.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Wolgin began {{development}} of a two-tower high-rise complex in the West Market Street neighborhood of Philadelphia. Existing structures at the site were demolished in 1969 after the city condemned the structures using <b>eminent</b> <b>domain.</b> With the project over budget, Centre Square was redesigned just before construction was scheduled to begin. Originally intended to be two steel high rises, the redesign used concrete instead. Unlike similar projects in the city, the entire complex was constructed all at once. The US$80-million Centre Square opened in 1973 with First Pennsylvania Bank as the lead tenant. Centre Square is credited with shifting Philadelphia's downtown office district from South Broad Street to West Market Street.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 1961, to {{meet the}} burgeoning {{educational}} demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing {{the establishment of a}} new university in the City of Boca Raton. Florida Atlantic University was built on Boca Raton Army Airfield, a 1940s-era army airbase. During World War II, the airfield served as the Army Air Corps' sole radar training facility. The base was built on the existing Boca Raton Airport and on 5,860acres (23.7km²) of adjacent land. A majority of the land was acquired from Japanese-American farmers from the failing Yamato Colony. The land was seized through <b>eminent</b> <b>domain,</b> leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse {{in the early days of}} World War II.|$|E
5|$|On July 25, 2013, a {{tentative}} deal was announced which {{will see a}} 20,000-25,000 seat stadium built at Buzzard Point costing $300 million. Following votes by the D.C. Council to approve the plan, it {{was signed into law}} on December 30, 2014. Under the July 2013 deal, the District of Columbia was to have obtained a portion of the necessary Buzzard Point property from the developer that owned it, in exchange for cash and a government building. D.C. United would kick the $150 million needed to construct the stadium on the city-owned land, which it would rent for 20 to 35 years. Under the deal as revised by D.C. City Council in December 2014, the city would instead pay fair market value for the developer's land, and use <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> if a deal could not be reached.|$|E
5|$|Sampson {{also made}} enemies when he backed Samuel Insull's plan to dam the Cumberland Falls to {{generate}} hydroelectric power. An {{ally of the}} traditional southern power groups—the utility companies and textbook manufacturers—Sampson cited the jobs {{to be gained from}} the plan. The plan was opposed conservationists in the state and by most of the state's newspapers. An alternate plan was proposed by Louisville-born millionaire and Delaware senator T. Coleman du Pont, who offered to purchase the falls for $230,000 {{and turn it into a}} state park. The General Assembly passed legislation giving the state park commission the right of <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> over the falls, then voted to accept the du Pont's offer. Sampson vetoed the Assembly's action, but his veto was overridden.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} {{area was}} originally home to Victorian housing but in 1977, the city used <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> {{to purchase the}} area southwest of Mount Vernon Square itself, {{and over the next}} few years, the homes and businesses on these blocks were razed. In the 1980s, Golub Realty and Willco Construction purchased the site and proposed an 11-floor office block. They sold it to Peterson Co., who sold it to Monument Realty in May 1999. Monument Realty had envisaged building either an office and retail complex, or a 1,000-room hotel. They finally sold it to Boston Properties for $43.2 million in October 2000. Boston Properties closed the parking lot on the site in late August 2002, and began construction of the building the following month.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E
5|$|However, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board {{withheld}} its {{permit approval}} in December 2000, over {{concerns that the}} Sweetwater Reservoir could be polluted in the process. Such an approval was necessary under the Clean Water Act {{in order to get}} the necessary approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The suit by Preserve South Bay was dismissed in March 2001, on the grounds that the legislature did not need to review the annexation of state parkland for the highway because it was done under <b>eminent</b> <b>domain.</b> In April, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the project on several conditions, including monitoring the water quality to ensure that the Sweetwater Reservoir would remain a clean water source for local residents. An appeal to the state Water Resources Control Board to overturn the approval was unsuccessful. In July, the USACE approved the wetlands permit for the southern portion of SR 125.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{boom of the}} 1970s and early 1980s {{that took place in}} Texas (because of the escalation in oil prices) benefited the Bay Area communities significantly. Industrial operations were expanded including the opening of the U.S. Steel plant in Baytown in 1970, and the Barbours Cut shipping terminal at Morgan's Point in 1977. The Port of Texas City became the third leading port in Texas by tonnage and ninth in the nation. The Barbours Cut terminal, operated by the Port of Houston, became the seventh leading port in the nation. Not all of this development was without controversy, however. In building Barbours Cut, the Port of Houston used its power of <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> to evict residents from nearly one third of the homes in Morgan's Point. Still, when the Texas economy declined in the later 1980s, the economic diversity of the area and substantial annual federal investments related to JSC helped the region fare better than most of Greater Houston.|$|E
5|$|The route {{remained}} intact until {{the construction of}} the Southern Tier Expressway (STE) through Red House in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Unwanted tourism in Jimerson Town, a newly built settlement northeast of Red House, prompted Seneca leaders to seek ways to reduce through traffic in the settlement; to do so, the state built a trumpet interchange off the expressway where NY382 used to be, which, coupled with the flooding of the roadway of old Route 17 to the west, effectively cut Jimerson Town off from the highway system. The construction of the highway also allowed the state to claim <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> over most of the hamlet of Red House, leading to the hamlet's destruction; the few remaining private residences in the town as of 2015 are located southwest of what was Route 382. When the interchange at exit19 of the STE was constructed , NY382 was disconnected from Allegany State Park Route2, which was realigned to meet the new exit (as was Bay State Road, much of which was moved to a route south of and parallel to the expressway). The NY382 designation was removed around this time as a result. The roadway still runs from the former NY17 (now NY951T, which terminates near the former NY382's end at a dilapidated bridge) to the Exit 19 on/off ramp, but due to safety concerns, the road was blocked off at its eastern terminus.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{many states}} changed their <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> laws. Prior to the Kelo decision, only seven states {{specifically}} prohibited {{the use of}} <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> for economic development except to eliminate blight. Since the decision, forty-four states have amended their <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> laws, although some of these changes are cosmetic.|$|E
25|$|Arizona's {{initiative}} {{combined the}} land use/regulatory taking issue central to Oregon Ballot Measure 37 with a restriction on <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> (similar to Oregon Ballot Measure 39 (2006)). The Arizona initiative's proponents focused their arguments {{almost exclusively on}} the less controversial <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> portion of the initiative.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{countries}} such as the People's Republic of China that practice <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> whenever it is convenient to make space for new communities and government structures. Singapore practices <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> under the Land Acquisitions Act, which allows it {{to carry out its}} Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme for urban renewal. The Amendments to the Land Titles Act allowed property to be purchased for purposes of urban renewal against an owner sharing a collective title if the majority of the other owners wish to sell and the minority did not. Thus, <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> often invokes concerns of majoritarianism.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Kelo, {{eight states}} {{specifically}} prohibited {{the use of}} <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> for economic development except to eliminate blight: Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Washington. , 42 states had enacted some type of reform legislation {{in response to the}} Kelo decision. Of those states, 22 enacted laws that severely inhibited the takings allowed by the Kelo decision, while the rest enacted laws that place some limits on the power of municipalities to invoke <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> for economic development. The remaining eight states have not passed laws to limit the power of <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> for economic development.|$|E
25|$|Voted no on prohibiting <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> {{for use as}} parks or {{grazing land}} in December 2007.|$|E
25|$|Acquiring, possessing, and {{disposing}} of real property, including through {{the exercise of}} the power of <b>eminent</b> <b>domain.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to Carolyn Feibel and Bradley Olson of the Houston Chronicle, the Houston Chronicle {{obtained}} {{documents that}} show that the city <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> helped Ed Wulfe, the developer of the BLVD Place complex adjacent to the park, complete a $12.5 million land sale related to the development. Wulfe was a major donor to White. As of December 2008 the city had not created any plans for the Post Oak Lane Park. Houston Parks and Recreation Director Joe Turner said in a sworn disposition in November 2008 that his department did not create {{the idea of the}} park and that he opposed the usage of <b>eminent</b> <b>domain.</b> The Collins brothers said that the city government had used <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> to seize land only for the purposes of private development, which is not legal in Texas.|$|E
25|$|Many {{countries}} recognize <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> {{to a much}} {{lesser extent}} than the English-speaking world or do not recognize it at all. Japan, for instance, has very weak <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> powers, {{as evidenced by the}} high-profile opposition to the expansion of Narita International Airport, and the disproportionately large amounts of financial inducement given to residents on sites slated for redevelopment in return for their agreement to leave, one well-known recent case being that of Roppongi Hills.|$|E
25|$|The city of Daytona Beach made {{national}} headlines when it {{designated the}} several mile radius around Main Street on the barrier island {{portion of the}} city as a blighted area and has targeted it for redevelopment by private developers. This follows the Supreme Court decision of the <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> case in Kelo v. City of New London, which upheld the right of municipalities the right to use <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> to take private property for redevelopment by private entities.|$|E
25|$|Most states use {{the term}} <b>eminent</b> <b>domain,</b> but some U.S. states {{use the term}} {{appropriation}} (New York) or expropriation (Louisiana) as synonyms for the exercise of <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> powers. The term condemnation is {{used to describe the}} formal act of exercising this power to transfer title or some lesser interest in the subject property. Where this happens, such as when an easement or a leasehold is taken, the condemner must pay just compensation, the same as in total takings.|$|E
25|$|The {{city had}} trouble obtaining title to {{other pieces of}} the hotel site as well. Two small parcels on 9th and L Streets NW still {{remained}} in their owners' hands in early 2007. Although the city could have used its <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> powers (approved in June 2006), it instead engaged in negotiations over {{the price of the}} land. These negotiations took nearly two years. It was not until December 2006 that the city used its <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> powers to secure the land.|$|E
25|$|Donated {{funds were}} used to {{purchase}} some farmsteads in the region, while other tracts within the proposed national park boundary were acquired by right of <b>eminent</b> <b>domain.</b> In contrast {{to the formation of}} other national parks in the sparsely populated American West, thousands of people would be forcibly relocated in the process of forming Mammoth Cave National Park. Often <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> proceedings were bitter, with landowners paid what were considered to be inadequate sums. The resulting acrimony still resonates within the region.|$|E
25|$|Devco, the hospitals, and {{the city}} {{government}} have drawn ire from both historic preservationists, those opposing gentrification and those concerned with <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> abuses and tax abatements for developers.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Asbury Park's Board of Education was {{affected}} by the city's decision to redevelop waterfront property with <b>eminent</b> <b>domain.</b> In the case Asbury Park Board of Education v. City of Asbury Park and Asbury Partners, LLC, the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division affirmed a ruling in favor of <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> of the Board of Education building on Lake Avenue. The Board of Education moved to {{the third and fourth}} floors of 603 Mattison Avenue, the former Asbury Park Press building, where it paid $189,327 in rent per year.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} scene of Discovery Channel's Harley and the Davidsons mini-series, C.M.P. forces a land {{purchase}} from future Harley-Davidson's Founder, Walter Davidson, under the pretense of <b>Eminent</b> <b>Domain.</b>|$|E
