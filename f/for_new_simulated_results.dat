40|$|Departing from a {{discussion}} of transformations in the premises of managerial ra-tionality and “managementality ” as a pacemaker of the (post) modern social order, as it is steeped in economic crisis, the paper critiques and extends Baudrillard’s constructs of “simulation ” and “hyperreality ” to illuminate significant develop-ments in the global culture complex of neoliberalization. With empirical illustra-tions of superfinancialization, transparency and surveillance, the paper explores converging patterns of how models of “neo-management ” are created by and con-structs <b>new</b> post-political and <b>simulated</b> social worlds. The paper concludes that a key feature of the contemporary “managementalities ” that orchestrate and give rise to major models of the neoliberal culture complex, is their capacity <b>for</b> con-structing <b>new</b> <b>simulated,</b> yet ontologically distinct, spaces that lie beyond the power of representation.

Here global DDE models were used to analyze short segments of simulated time series from a known dynamical system, the R&# 246;ssler system, in high noise regimes. In a companion paper, we apply the DDE model developed here to classify short segments of encephalographic (EEG) data recorded from patients with Parkinson&# 39;s disease and healthy subjects. Nine simulated subjects in each of two distinct classes were generated by varying the bifurcation parameter b and keeping the other two parameters (a and c) of the R&# 246;ssler system fixed. All choices of b were in the chaotic parameter range. We diluted the simulated data using white noise ranging from 10 dB to - 30 dB signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Structure selection was supervised by selecting the number of terms, delays, and order of nonlinearity of the model DDE model that best linearly separated the two classes of data. The distances d from the linear dividing hyperplane was then used to assess the classification performance by computing the area A&# 39; under the ROC curve. The selected model was tested on untrained data using repeated random sub-sampling validation. DDEs were able to accurately distinguish the two dynamical conditions, and moreover, to quantify the changes in the dynamics. There was a significant correlation between the dynamical bifurcation parameter b of the simulated data and the classification parameter d from our analysis. This correlation still held <b>for</b> <b>new</b> <b>simulated</b> subjects with <b>new</b> dynamical parameters selected from each of the two dynamical regimes. Furthermore, the correlation was robust to added noise, being significant even when the noise was greater than the signal. We conclude that DDE models may be used as a generalizable and reliable classification tool for even small segments of noisy data...|$|R

The IDARA architecture exhibits the guided stochastic search characteristics similar to those found in the human immune system. This characteristic was exploited to develop a series of methods for performing terrain search of dynamic environments. These methods were then evaluated in a variety of domains via computer simulations with robot colonies consisting of up to 1, 500 robots. These experiments show that the IDARA architecture and framework provides a simple and robust method that is computationally efficient and does not degrade when coordinating and distributing large colonies of robots in either the terrain exploration and mapping or search and rescue problem domains. By providing new levels of scalability in noisy environments IDARA enables the full potential of micro-scale robotic for intelligent exploration, mapping, and search and rescue operations in a manner not afforded by traditional methods. ...|$|R

30|$|To {{assess how}} {{transect}} length and population characteristics influence sampling variability, we employed a model-based approach using simulation {{based on a}} zero-inflated, autoregressive copula. To motivate this approach, let us first consider a naive approach that would be simple to implement, and would have some desirable features, but could lead to inaccurate results. Given the line intersect data from a site, with the positions of all the intersections recorded, one could subdivide transects into shorter segments (e.g., 5 [*]m) that would allow simulation of the sampling variance for different transect lengths, with a resolution on length that would be meaningful for operational inventory design. Then, to simulate transects of different total length, one would draw segments at random with replacement from the data for that site, concatenating them to form transects of the desired length. For example, to form a 20 -m transect, one would choose four segments of 5 [*]m each with replacement, and compute any desired values (such as DWD volume) <b>for</b> the <b>new,</b> <b>simulated</b> transect. By repeating this process many times, and varying the transect length, one would develop a Monte Carlo estimate of the sampling distribution of DWD volume estimates for LIS at that site and its dependence on transect length, with a richer potential inference beyond second-order statistics such as variance (which, under the assumptions implicit in this approach, could also be calculated using the usual formulae for simple random sampling; e.g., Thompson 2012). Essentially, this approach uses the same rationale as the bootstrap (Efron and Tibshirani 1993), substituting the empirical distribution of DWD volume on short segments for the unknown population distribution of possible segments, {{to arrive at the}} sample distribution through resampling.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2007. Transport {{costs can}} account for a {{significant}} portion of the total production costs in an agricultural system. In order to ensure maximum efficiency of a transport operation, the transport manager is required to select a suitable vehicle and choose the best route. This is a complex process as vehicles should not be selected based solely on lowest capital cost, but with several variables taken into account. In order to determine an optimal haulage system and to aid the decision making process, a computer model called SimTrans has been developed. SimTrans simulates a haulage vehicle travelling on any given route under normal vehicle operating conditions. The model produces a set of <b>simulated</b> vehicle performance <b>results</b> and a summary of trip details. The vehicle input parameters and route details can be modified to enable the user to simulate different vehicle configurations on alternate routes. The SimTrans model was used in this research project as it provides a comprehensive output of <b>simulated</b> <b>results.</b> However, under certain conditions there is variance between actual and the simulated vehicle performance in SimTrans, particularly with the gear selection routines. The primary objective of this research was to refine, calibrate and validate the current SimTrans model. An initial investigation focused on diesel engine management systems for heavy-duty commercial vehicles and how these systems affect a vehicle's performance. This investigation was aimed at gaining an understanding of how performance data could be gathered directly from the onboard vehicle electronics of a haulage vehicle. A data logging system was developed to measure and record certain operating parameters of a haulage vehicle during operation. The system was installed on a Mercedes Benz 2637 and the vehicle was driven on two alternative routes between the Eston Sugar Mill and a loading zone near Mid-Illovo. The Mercedes Benz 2637 used for the vehicle tests was simulated in SimTrans using identical operating conditions of route and speed limits. By comparing the observed and simulated data sets, errors particularly with gear selection routines were identified. The SimTrans model was modified such that these errors were corrected and a new gear skipping routine was added. The modified SimTrans model was validated through a comparison of a <b>new</b> set of <b>simulated</b> <b>results</b> with the observed data. The modified model showed significant improvement in simulation accuracy over the previous version of SimTrans...|$|R
