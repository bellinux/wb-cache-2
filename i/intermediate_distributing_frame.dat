This paper describes an implementation {{of such a}} <b>distributed</b> <b>frame</b> buffer for the Intel Paragon routing network, and reports its performance results.

This architectural approach can also effectively support image composition for sort-last.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{is to create a}} {{platform}} that simplifies the intercommunication of distributed heterogeneous devices (composed of hardware and software). So, the main contribution of this work is the development of a platform to integrate heterogeneous computing devices (independent of architecture) in a loosely coupled way. As already being introduced, initially this work started from the idea of building a middleware to <b>intermediate</b> <b>distributed</b> devices to perform functional verification of components developed in the laboratory. Then, we decided to build a more general purpose software to abstract the underlying distributed architecture, instead of doing a specific solution. For this, the HLA standard for inter-operation among those systems was used, and a library was developed to unify the way of programming communication and synchronization. In previous work, HLA has been used to integrate circuit simulation tools for functional verification and power consumption estimation. In that case, different hardware architectures were simulated, but no physical devices were integrated [4, 5].|$|R

40|$|Accordion {{patterns}} {{are widely used}} for deployable shelters, due to their simple construction, elegant deployment mechanism, and folded plate form with an inherent structural efficiency. This paper proposes two new accordion-type shelters that use modified geometries to improve on the structural stability and stiffness of the typical accordion form. The first shelter is termed a <b>distributed</b> <b>frame</b> accordion shelter and is generated by separating fully folded accordion frames between spacer plates aligned with the transverse direction. A transverse stiffness and increased flexural rigidity can therefore be achieved while maintaining a nonzero floor area. The second shelter is termed a diamond wall accordion shelter and is generated by inserting secondary wall elements that increase wall sectional depth and counteract the coupled rotational-transverse displacements at accordion roof–wall junctions. For both shelter types, a geometric parameterization and a full-scale prototype are presented. Good correlation is seen between the designed and constructed surfaces. A numerical investigation also shows that the new forms have substantially increased flexural rigidities compared to the typical accordion for...|$|R
