50|$|In addition, {{land-based}} ICBM silos can be <b>hardened.</b> No <b>missile</b> {{launch facility}} can really defend against a direct nuclear hit, but a sufficiently hardened silo could defend against a near miss, {{especially if the}} detonation is not from a multimegaton thermonuclear weapon. In addition, ICBMs can be placed on road or rail-mobile launchers (RT-23 Molodets, RT-2PM2 Topol-M, DF-31, , , MGM-134 Midgetman), which can then be moved around; as an enemy has nothing fixed to aim at, this increases their survivability.|$|R
5000|$|The United States, began {{providing}} {{technical assistance}} to the French program in the early 1970s through the 1980s. The aid was secret, unlike {{the relationship with the}} British nuclear program. The Nixon administration, unlike previous presidencies, did not oppose its allies' possession of atomic weapons and believed that the Soviets would find having multiple nuclear-armed Western opponents more difficult. Because the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 prohibited sharing information on nuclear weapon design, a method known as [...] "negative guidance" [...] or [...] "Twenty Questions" [...] was used; French scientists described to their American counterparts their research, and were told whether they were correct. Areas in which the French received help included MIRV, radiation <b>hardening,</b> <b>missile</b> design, intelligence on Soviet anti-missile defences, and advanced computer technology. Because the French program attracted [...] "the best brains" [...] of the nation, the Americans benefited from French research as well. The relationship also improved the two nations' military ties; despite its departure from NATO's command structure in 1966, France developed two separate nuclear targeting plans, one [...] "national" [...] for the Force de Frappe's role as a solely French deterrent, and one coordinated with NATO.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and 1950s as the Cold War developed, the United States and Soviet Union pursued {{multiple}} delivery methods and platforms to deliver nuclear weapons. Three types of platforms proved most successful and are collectively called a [...] "nuclear triad". These are air-delivered weapons (bombs or missiles), ballistic missile submarines (usually nuclear-powered and called SSBNs), and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), usually deployed in land-based <b>hardened</b> <b>missile</b> silos or on vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Different {{forms of}} nuclear weapons {{delivery}} (see above) allow for different types of nuclear strategies. The goals of any strategy are generally to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to launch a pre-emptive strike against the weapon system and difficult to defend against the delivery of the weapon during a potential conflict. This can mean keeping weapon locations hidden, such as deploying them on submarines or land mobile transporter erector launchers whose locations are difficult to track, or it can mean protecting weapons by burying them in <b>hardened</b> <b>missile</b> silo bunkers. Other components of nuclear strategies included using missile defenses to destroy the missiles before they land, or implementing civil defense measures using early-warning systems to evacuate citizens to safe areas before an attack.|$|E
5000|$|Team B {{concluded}} that the Soviet Union did not adhere to the doctrine of mutual assured destruction, but rather believed it could win a nuclear war outright. Pipes—in his Commentary article—argued that CIA suffered from [...] "mirror-imaging" [...] (i.e., from assuming {{that the other side}} had to—and did—think and evaluate exactly the same way); Pipes further wrote that Team B showed Soviet thinking to be based on winning a nuclear war (i.e., not avoiding such war due to MAD, because, he wrote, the Soviets were building MIRV'd nuclear missiles of high yield and high accuracy—appropriate for attacking <b>hardened</b> <b>missile</b> silos, but not needed for such large and vulnerable 'hostage' sites as cities). This was shocking to many at the time, but Pipes argues that later, {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, it was proven to be true.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in August 1960 the Site Activation Task Force at Schilling {{constructed}} {{and turned over}} to the Strategic Air Command the first operational HGM-16 Atlas-F <b>hardened</b> silo <b>missile</b> squadron. Planning for Atlas missile deployment at Schilling had begun in 1958, and were originally slated to receive horizontal Atlas-E launchers. Site selection for three complexes of three missiles each (3 x 3) was completed in the fall of 1958. In early 1959, a decision to deploy Atlas-F missiles to nine separate sites as a defensive measure against an enemy first-strike attack required additional site surveys.|$|R
50|$|China's nuclear forces, in {{combination}} with the PLA's conventional forces, served to deter both nuclear and conventional attacks on the Chinese lands. Chinese leaders pledged to not use nuclear weapons first (no first use), but pledged to absolutely counter-attack with nuclear weapons if nuclear weapons are used against China. China envisioned retaliation against strategic and tactical attacks and would probably strike countervalue rather than counterforce targets. The combination of China's few nuclear weapons and technological factors such as range, accuracy, and response time limited the effectiveness of nuclear strikes against counterforce targets. China has been seeking to increase the credibility of its nuclear retaliatory capability by dispersing and concealing its nuclear forces in difficult terrain, improving their mobility, and <b>hardening</b> its <b>missile</b> silos.|$|R

The 280mm M65 Atomic Cannon nicknamed [...] "Atomic Annie" [...] and the projectiles it fired were also based here. Okinawa at one point hosted as many as 1,200 nuclear warheads. At the time, nuclear storage locations existed at Kadena AFB in Chibana and the <b>hardened</b> MGM-13 MACE <b>missile</b> launch sites; Naha AFB, Henoko Henoko (Ordnance Ammunition Depot) at Camp Schwab, and the Nike Hercules units on Okinawa.|$|R
50|$|SS-18 Satan Mod I/II 25 megaton variant. Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that USSR never had a first-strike strategy (due to its conventional arms superiority in Europe), some experts believed that the single-warhead 25 megaton version of R36-M (SS-18, CEP 250 m.) was a first-strike weapon, targeted against Minuteman III silos. However, a much more logical explanation comes from retired Soviet military officers who report that the 25 megaton SS-18 was targeted against heavily fortified command and control facilities. The {{reason for this is}} that a single 25 megaton warhead could take out only one <b>hardened</b> <b>missile</b> silo if the silos are sufficiently separated - probably by only 2-4 km, depending on the amount of hardening. This is due to the inverse square law, which predicts that the amount of energy dispersed from a single point release of energy (such as a thermonuclear blast) dissipates by the inverse of the square of distance from the single point of release. The result is that the power of a nuclear explosion to rupture hardened structures is greatly decreased by the distance from the impact point of the nuclear weapon. So a near-direct hit is generally necessary, as only diminishing returns are gained by increasing bomb power. The only purpose for gigantic nuclear weapons, like the SS-18 25 megaton variant, is to take out extremely hardened targets, like command and control facilities, such as NORAD, located at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex; Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), located at Mount Weather; or Site R, located at Raven Rock. (It should be noted that the amount of energy needed to rupture missile silos is orders of magnitude greater than the amount necessary to destroy cities, making the SS-18 25 megaton variant effective for the destruction of large urban centers, as well.) This could be a useful weapon for a decapitation strike - however, a decapitation strike is a very risky move, and both the U.S. and Russia have extensive countermeasures against such methods.|$|E
50|$|Deployment of the Minuteman ICBM {{began in}} 1962, during the Cold War, and {{proceeded}} rapidly. Limited accuracy with a {{circular error probable}} (CEP) of about 0.6 to 0.8 nautical miles and a small warhead of less than 1 megaton meant the system was unable to attack <b>hardened</b> targets like <b>missile</b> silos. This limited these early models to attacks on strategic targets like cities and ports, and the system {{had little or no}} capability as a counterforce weapon. The Air Force relied on its manned bombers as the primary weapon for attacking hardened targets and saw the ICBM as a survivable deterrent that would guard against an attack on its bomber fleet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of nuclear-tipped ICBMs required new strategies because unlike bombers, ICBMs cannot be recalled after launch. There were two primary options. One option, [...] "retaliation after ride-out", required the second-strike nation {{to wait until}} after it was attacked to launch their missiles. Some portion of the nuclear arsenal would inevitably be destroyed in such an attack, which led to both superpowers investing heavily in survivable basing modes for their nuclear forces, including <b>hardened</b> underground <b>missile</b> silos for ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The other choice was [...] "launch on warning", launching nuclear missiles before the other side's missiles could destroy them. That became possible primarily because of improvements in missile technology that allowed for faster launches, along with invention of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System in the early 1960s, which {{made it possible for}} the US to detect the launch of Soviet missiles. The capability was further enhanced in the 1970s with the deployment of space-based launch detection technology on both sides, the American geosynchronous Defense Support Program and Soviet Oko satellites. Evidence found in declassified documents suggests that launch on warning was at least in part the policy of the United States from the late 1950s through to at least the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThermo mechanical {{modeling and simulation}} of a satellite and intercontinental ballistic missile assumes importance due to the increased interest in assessing the potential of such attacks. Effective and innovative methods are sought in assessing the structural integrity of such structural components. In this study, we present modeling and simulation aspects of two generic models loaded by high energy laser beam. We present an application of MSC software in modeling thermo-mechanical behavior, both steady state and transient behavior of satellite and missile structures. Thermal energies used for simulation correspond to high energy laser flux available at low earth orbits as reported in literature. A brief review of the concepts involved is outlined. The analysis is performed under several scenarios that include thermal failures due to steady state as well as transient thermal exposures. The thermal exposure times and locations are varied to assess typical failure modes of the structure. Analysis is done in order to define suitable material thicknesses {{that will make a}} satellite or a ballistic <b>missile</b> <b>hardened</b> enough to withstand these specific amounts of energy. Other parameters of interest pertaining to this study are the pulse width, and resulting transient phenomena affecting the behavior. Temperature gradients as well as resulting thermal stresses and thermal deformations are reported in this study. Outstanding Thesi...|$|R
