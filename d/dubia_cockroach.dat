50|$|The <b>Dubia</b> <b>cockroach</b> {{is found}} in Central and South America, {{beginning}} in Costa Rica. It is common from French Guyana and Brazil to Argentina.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Dubia</b> <b>cockroach</b> is a frugivore that prefers {{fruits and}} grains, shunning such high protein sources as meat or waste {{droppings}} from other animals. They particularly like semisweet vegetable matter. Appropriate feed for raising Dubia roaches includes: carrots, {{all manner of}} tropical fruits (mangos and papayas), apples, avocados, banana, cherries, pears, oranges, strawberries, fresh corn, tomatoes (some individuals show no interest in tomatoes while others eat readily), and lettuce (not iceberg or romaine)â€”many other leafy greens will be accepted. All grain-based dry cat/dog food, fish food, crested gecko meal and bearded dragon food {{can also be used}} to supplement their diet. They will also eat wheat bran and germ-based food products like assorted breads, non-sweetened breakfast cereals (such as Cheerios or Special K), and even softened pasta, although such diets must be augmented with edible vegetation and fruit of some sort to provide sufficient water.|$|E
40|$|Cockroaches {{are major}} pests, vectors of {{pathogenic}} bacteria and induce allergies. Current control methods use chemical pesticides, {{but they can}} be ineffective and costly and there are reports of resistance in the field; hence new control methods are needed. There are conflicting reports about the susceptibility of cockroaches to entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs); so we investigated if EPNs could kill several diverse cockroach species, including the Madagascan hissing roach (Gromphadorhina portentosa), the Lobster roach (Nauphoeta cinerea) and Blaptica <b>dubia.</b> Female adult <b>cockroaches</b> were exposed to either commercial products containing Steinernema kraussei or a combination of Heterorhabditis spp. and Steinernema spp. at 50 and 150 nematodes per cm 2 for 21 days. We also monitored feeding and the numbers of infective juveniles that were produced from each cockroach corpse. We found that S. kraussei were harmless to all cockroach species (at both doses) but when exposed to a mixture of Heterorhabditis spp. and Steinernema spp. B. dubia died after 6 days and its feeding was strongly inhibited. We also found that the mixture of Heterorhabditis spp. and Steinernema spp. could proliferate in the cadavers of B. dubia whilst S. kraussei could only reproduce in G. portentosa and B. dubia but not N. cinerea. In conclusion, S. kraussei was harmless to all three cockroach species but B. dubia was killed when exposed to Heterorhabditis spp. and Steinernema spp., highlighting the differences in the host range of EPNs...|$|R
