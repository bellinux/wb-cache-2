The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.|$|E

50|$|As {{the city}} of Johannesburg grew from the gold fields, Cape Town lost its {{position}} as the single dominant city in the region, but, as the primary port, it nonetheless benefitted from the increased trade to the region.

50|$|The 19th {{century was}} a period of great change {{throughout}} Europe, and Sweden was no exception. Its rural way of life was rapidly giving way to an <b>industrialised</b> <b>society</b> and many feared that the country's many traditional customs and occupations might be lost to history. Artur Hazelius, who had previously founded the Nordic Museum on the island of Djurgården near the centre of Stockholm, was inspired by the open-air museum, founded by King Oscar II in Kristiania in 1881, when he created his open-air museum on the hill that dominates the island.

[...] In the age of incipient tourism the organisation succeeded in making nature accessible to broader population strata by providing requisite recreational and travel facilities. Even then, the organisation's activities were aimed at getting people to beautiful natural settings, at awakening their love of nature and at imparting to them knowledge about nature and culture. Parallel {{with the rise of}} the modern <b>industrialised</b> <b>society</b> and of commercial tourism the Friends of Nature developed a professional commitment to nature and environment protection and had a major share in advancing the theory and practice of alternative forms of ecological tourism.|$|E

50|$|During {{the switch}} to a modern urban and <b>{{industrial}}ised</b> <b>society,</b> bread types changed when large industrial bakeries introduced new soft bread, which from the early 1920s was often sweetened (sötlimpa, sweet thick bread). From then on, bread was bought from stores and bakeries, rather than baked at home, as had previously been the case. Regional variations decreased due to the transportation and marketing of bread as a national product. The consumption of bread products of various kinds has increased since the 1990s and wholegrain bread and wheat bread are the most popular. All older bread types still exist alongside the new ones, indicating the much greater variety open to individuals today than {{has been the case}} in the past. Soft bread consumption has increased by more than 60% since the 1990s, from 30 kg to 50 kg per person and year today (2007). The older types of bread are still eaten in Sweden, but today they are usually professionally baked. New international types such as naan bread, ciabatta, focaccia, pita and bagels have been popular since the 1990s. 20% of Swedes are first- or second-generation immigrants and use bread both as they did in their home countries and as it is used today in contemporary Swedish normative food culture.|$|E
50|$|The World State {{operates}} a command economy, in which prices, production, and trade are all {{regulated by the}} state. Furthermore, the economy {{is based on the}} principles of mass production and mass consumerism. Citizens of the World State have access to a vast array of very high-quality foods, goods, and services, whilst the manufacture and provision of these goods and services creates jobs for all members of society. In order to enhance consumerism and so keep the economy strong, people are encouraged to throw away old or damaged possessions and buy new ones. In this way, every citizen of the World State is kept happy, with a plentiful supply of creature comforts and a permanent job. Later in the novel, World Controller Mustapha Mond explains that approximately one third of the global population is employed permanently in agricultural occupations, a surprisingly high proportion for such a high-tech, <b>industrialised</b> <b>society,</b> although this {{may have something to do}} with the fact that Huxley's world is limited in its mechanization and automation. This limitation is deliberately put in place in order to keep the populace busy working to produce new goods, with fears that increased free time and further technological advancements would lead to civil unrest and social instability. This was proven in an experiment in Ireland where all workers were placed on a 4-hour day, which led to unrest and increased consumption of soma.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1968 article {{published}} in Disadvantaged Child, Jensen questioned the effectiveness of child development and antipoverty programs, writing [...] "As a social policy, avoidance of the issue could be harmful {{to everyone in the}} long run, especially to future generations of Negroes, who could suffer the most from well-meaning but misguided and ineffective attempts to improve their lot." [...] In 1969 Jensen wrote a long article in the Harvard Educational Review, [...] "How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?"In his article, 123 pages long, Jensen insisted on the accuracy and lack of bias in intelligence tests, stating that the absolute quantity g that they measured, the general intelligence factor, first introduced by the English psychologist Charles Spearman in 1904, [...] "stood like a Rock of Gibraltar in psychometrics". He stressed the importance of biological considerations in intelligence, commenting that [...] "the belief in the almost infinite plasticity of intellect, the ostrich-like denial of biological factors in individual differences, and the slighting of the role of genetics in the study of intelligence can only hinder investigation and understanding of the conditions, processes, and limits through which the social environment influences human behavior." [...] He argued at length that, contrary to environmentalist orthodoxy, intelligence was partly dependent on the same genetic factors that influence other physical attributes. More controversially, he briefly speculated that the difference in performance at school between blacks and whites might have a partly genetic explanation, commenting that there were [...] "various lines of evidence, no one of which is definitive alone, but which, viewed all together, make it a not unreasonable hypothesis that genetic factors are strongly implicated in the average Negro-whiteintelligence difference. The preponderance of the evidence is, in my opinion, less consistent with a strictly environmental hypothesis than with a genetic hypothesis, which, of course, does not exclude the influence of environment or its interaction with genetic factors." [...] He advocated the allocation of educational resources according to merit and insisted on the close correlation between intelligence and occupational status, arguing that [...] "in a society that values and rewards individual talent and merit, genetic factors inevitably take on considerable importance." [...] Concerned that the average IQ in the USA was inadequate to answer the increasing needs of an <b>industrialised</b> <b>society,</b> he predicted that people with lower IQs would become unemployable {{while at the same time}} there would be an insufficient number with higher IQs to fill professional posts. He felt that eugenic reform would prevent this more effectively than compensatory education, surmising that [...] "the technique for raising intelligence per se in the sense of g, probably lie more in the province of biological science than in psychology or education". He pointed out that intelligence and family size were inversely correlated, particularly amongst the black population, so that the current trend in average national intelligence was dysgenic rather than eugenic. As he wrote, [...] "Is there a danger that current welfare policies, unaided by eugenic foresight, could lead to the genetic enslavement of a substantial segment of our population? The fuller consequences of our failure seriously to study these questions may well be judged by future generations as our society's greatest injustice to Negro Americans." [...] He concluded by emphasizing the importance of child-centered education. Although a tradition had developed for the exclusive use of cognitive learning in schools, Jensen argued that it was not suited to [...] "these children's genetic and cultural heritage": although capable of associative learning and memorization ("Level I" [...] ability), they had difficulties with abstract conceptual reasoning ("Level II" [...] ability). He felt that in these circumstances the success of education depended on exploiting [...] "the actual potential learning that is latent in these children's patterns of abilities". He suggested that, in order to ensure equality of opportunity, [...] "schools and society must provide a range and diversity of educational methods, programs and goals, and of occupational opportunities, just as wide as the range of human abilities." ...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} facing engineering faculties {{is the matter of}} embedding creativity and innovation into undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Creativity is perceived to be the domain of the arts, and the general understanding of innovation is any change. In <b>industrialised</b> <b>society</b> people expect originality, ingenuity and novelty from new or improved products processes and systems, and these factors are the basis of creativity. It follows that since most of products, processes and systems in <b>industrialised</b> <b>society</b> are based on engineering and associated technology, it is imperative that these values {{are an integral part of}} engineering education, and that innovation, which is the commercialisation of creative design, is also taught as a fundamental element in the education of an engineer.
