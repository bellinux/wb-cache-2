In present study, atomic simulations are conducted to analyze the compression of bcc nanoparticles, and orientation-dependent features are addressed. It is revealed that surface morphology under indenter predominantly governs the initial elastic response. The loading curve follows the flat punch contact model <b>in</b> [110] <b>compression,</b> while it obeys the Hertzian contact model in [111] and [001] <b>compressions.</b> <b>In</b> plastic deformation regime, full dislocation gliding is dominated <b>in</b> [110] <b>compression,</b> while deformation twinning is prominent <b>in</b> [111] <b>compression,</b> and these two mechanisms coexist <b>in</b> [001] <b>compression.</b> Such deformation mechanisms are distinct from those in bulk crystals under nanoindentation and nanopillars under compression, and the major differences are also illuminated.

These risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at-risk buildings, (e.g. school buildings in Istanbul, Turkey).|$|E
25|$|A truss can {{be thought}} of as a beam where the web {{consists}} of a series of separate members instead of a continuous plate. In the truss, the lower horizontal member (the bottom chord) and the upper horizontal member (the top chord) carry tension and compression, fulfilling the same function as the flanges of an I-beam. Which chord carries tension and which carries compression depends on the overall direction of bending. In the truss pictured above right, the bottom chord is in tension, and the top chord <b>in</b> <b>compression.</b>|$|E
