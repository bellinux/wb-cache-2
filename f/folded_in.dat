40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effect of an unfortified extract, of Ascophyllum nodosum on yield and nutritional quality of two broccoli cultivars (‘Ironman’ and ‘Red Admiral’). Total phenolic, total flavonoid, and total isothiocyanates content were higher in all seaweed treatments compared to the untreated control. In ‘Ironman’ there was a 2. 2 <b>fold</b> increase <b>in</b> total phenolic, 1. 5 <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> total flavonoid and 2. 6 <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> total isothiocyanates content, in the higher application rate compared to the control. Similarly in ‘Red Admiral’, there was a 2. 3 <b>fold</b> increase <b>in</b> total phenolic, 2. 6 <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> total flavonoid and, 2. 2 <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> total isothiocyanates content. There was a consistent effect on the increase of total phenolic, total flavonoid and total isothiocyanates content, while there was no yield increase recorded at the lower seaweed application rate. Results suggest that application of seaweed extracts can significantly {{increase the amount of}} phytochemicals and improve the nutritional quality of broccoli...|$|R

40|$|AIMS—To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} and fluorescein angiographic features of choroidal <b>folds</b> seen <b>in</b> association with papilloedema.  METHODS—In a retrospective study, the clinical {{data from a}} database on patients with choroidal folds (1963 - 97), including fundus photography and fluorescein angiography, from 32  patients (64  eyes) with choroidal <b>folds</b> <b>in</b> association with papilloedema were reviewed. The clinical and fluorescein angiographic features and the clinical course of choroidal <b>folds</b> <b>in</b> these patients are described.  RESULTS— 32 patients had choroidal folds associated with papilloedema. Folds of two distinct categories were observed, either coarse folds or wrinkles. The <b>folds</b> persisted <b>in</b> all cases, even after resolution of papilloedema. Follow up ranged from 1  month to 20  years. Only one patient suffered permanent visual impairment {{as a result of}} a choroidal fold.  CONCLUSIONS—Choroidal <b>folds</b> exist <b>in</b> two forms, coarse folds and wrinkles. They persist even after papilloedema has resolved. Final visual acuity did not appear to be affected by the presence of choroidal <b>folds</b> <b>in</b> the majority of patients. ...|$|R

5|$|Although lesbian-feminism was a {{significant}} shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in New Left and radical causes, but they had not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues. Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a homophobic world was more appropriate. The Daughters of Bilitis <b>folded</b> <b>in</b> 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly <b>folded</b> <b>in</b> the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Before {{arriving}} in the WWF, Jeff and Matt formed their own wrestling promotion, the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA) with Thomas Simpson.

In OMEGA, each of the brothers portrayed several different characters; Hardy portrayed such characters as Willow the Wisp, Iceman, Mean Jimmy Jack Tomkins, and The Masked Mountain. While there, Hardy held the New Frontier Championship as a singles competitor and the Tag Team Championship with Matt. The promotion <b>folded</b> <b>in</b> April 1998 when they signed contracts with the WWF.|$|E
