500|$|Bergkamp and Wright {{scored a}} goal apiece in Arsenal's 2–0 win against Everton {{on the first}} day of March. The team won by an {{identical}} scoreline at home to Nottingham Forest a week later and kept a third consecutive cleansheet against Southampton; midfielders Stephen Hughes and Paul Shaw both got themselves on the scoresheet. Defeat at home to Liverpool on 24 March 1997 was marred by a dubious penalty awarded to striker Robbie Fowler. The player himself [...] "stood and mouthed: 'No penalty!'" [...] given Seaman made no contact in the penalty box, but the referee unaltered his decision. Although Fowler's spotkick was later saved, the ball rebounded to Jason McAteer, who scored. Wenger ruled the team out of the title race again, by saying after the match, [...] "Everybody knows now that it was not a penalty, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a referee took a wrong decision. That's football and it eliminates our chance of the championship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gaudio and Coria were at {{the centre}} of another dispute at the World Team Cup where Gaudio said, [...] "Let's be truthful, this isn't a team, because there's someone who makes {{decisions}} choosing the best for himself. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a player gets tired and decides to rest before Paris. I also did so on Tuesday against the Czechs {{but not in the}} most important match of all. Coria and I were the best team and if we were a real team this wouldn't have happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{omission}} of commonly played {{songs such as}} [...] "Run to the Hills" [...] and [...] "The Trooper" [...] from the 2010 setlist led to some criticism, with the Calgary Herald suggesting that [...] "...striking a more even balance between that new material and the unsinkable, ironclad battleships of yesteryear, would have made an incredibly satisfying show that much greater". Speaking in defence of the band's choice of setlist, Mike Portnoy (then of Dream Theater) said: [...] "I can understand that fans {{want to hear the}} hits, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> Maiden don't want to be stuck playing the same songs {{for the rest of their}} lives. They put out new music so they want to play the new music." [...] Interviewed for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on 14 July, Janick Gers responded to criticism of the setlist: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly I do;--but this {{friendship}} is so unequal. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{it should have}} grown from personal liking on your side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah yes; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> well <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> your {{indifference}} should {{enable you}} to forget it. Lady Eustace, I did venture to tell you--that--I loved you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} signify. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> your husband should wish {{to reflect a}} little before he speaks to me. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> forgive that." ...|$|R
2500|$|At the 1982 US Open, Evert had {{an easier}} time in {{dispatching}} her opponent Mandlíková in the final, than she had two years prior. [...] It was due to a high propensity of double faults and errant shot making, which allowed Evert even though some suspect serving of her own was able to preserve games on her racket. [...] In the fourth game of the match, Evert had a break point against her serve, but would not give it up. [...] After the match was knotted at 3-games all, Mandlíková was serving in the seventh game of the match, which she was incapable of holding serve. [...] In the next subsequent game, Evert was faced with three break points on serve. [...] Yet, unlike the Czechoslovakian, was able {{to fend off the}} points, which was a game consisting of five deuce points. [...] In the ninth game of the set, Evert broke Mandlíková again, which came off of a backhand volley in the net, and the set was won at six games to three in just 33 minutes. [...] The second set lasted only 31 minutes, and Evert won it in a romp at six games to one in a total match time of 64 minutes. [...] This win gave her the sixth US Open title for her career, which was over an eight-year timespan, which Evert said [...] "the first time you win Wimbledon or the US Open is really a thrill, but I appreciate and maybe have a place in history by winning a sixth, so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a little better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, aunt, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that.</b> But if the Spaniards come, {{how many}} of your family may be alive here a week afterwards?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that.</b> You {{could not}} tell him at once that you would take him; but you won't mind telling me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never knew}} anybody yet that {{was proud of}} his friends. I like him well enough, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the {{governor}} should object." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> you {{had hardly}} {{experience}} {{enough to know}} that it might be wiser not to encourage what was not quite open." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The risk {{of being}} seen is too great. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a man like Nokes should have been such a fool as he was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> feeling, Mrs. Doolan. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{there might}} be a {{satisfaction}} in being envied for being the happiest woman, or the most tastefully dressed woman, or even the prettiest woman, though that after all is a mere accident, but not for having the greatest number of bright stones, however valuable. I don't think the most lovely set of diamonds ever seen would give me as much satisfaction as a few choice flowers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, he does!' said Mac-Morlan.' Yes, yes, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> better. And pray, Mr. Sampson, {{are these}} three hours entirely spent inconstruing and translating?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} sad," [...] said Mrs. Chudleigh. [...] "You have my {{thanks for the}} story. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> it was painful to tell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't marry any one but a squatter? <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> <b>that.</b> The squatters {{here are}} what the lords {{and the country}} gentlemen are at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Especially,' pursued Martin, 'as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> already <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> it {{may have}} {{required}} great courage, even in his time, to write freely on any question which was not a party one in this very free country.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He does. I myself {{think that}} Gurth's counsel was good, {{and that it}} were best for England that he {{remained}} at Westminster; and yet <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> well <b>that</b> he himself would feel it a shame did he remain behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} will say so. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> very well. And {{it is natural}} that you should wish to be with her. Pray go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must forgive my ignorant praise," [...] he said, and smiled. [...] "I {{have always}} thought it beautiful: But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> an artist is never satisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{stage of}} it," [...] said the manager. [...] "By-the-way, {{are you still}} {{connected}} with the Abstract? I noticed the name on your card." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{that matter}} you must {{allow me to}} judge for myself. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a young woman like her, {{especially}} with her sister to back her, should induce such a one as you to take her part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not intend,--not {{to you at}} any rate. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> better <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{she should}} receive the admiration of a gentleman than the affectionate {{friendship}} of a lady. That the old Duke should have been infatuated was intelligible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So they do, Sir Griffin," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Carbuncle. [...] "They {{say such}} queer things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{they should be}} allowed to say them. I am told that the police absolutely suggest that Lord George stole the diamonds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Snub a man, you mean. Well, I wouldn't even snub Sir Orlando very much, if I were you; though <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{it might}} be both {{pleasant}} and easy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Phew!" [...] said Kemp. [...] "That's odd! But still I don't see quite ... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> thereby {{you could}} spoil a {{valuable}} stone, but personal invisibility {{is a far}} cry." ...|$|E
6000|$|As the omnibus {{went away}} Dr. Nupper joined Mr. Runciman under the archway. [...] "I'm blessed if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> man," [...] said Runciman. [...] "What is it he's after?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{police have}} watched this Lascar," [...] said Inspector Bradstreet, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> he {{might find it}} {{difficult}} to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis terrible!" [...] she said, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> well <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> Edgar was so maddened at {{the sight}} that when one of those half-drunken wretches insulted Aline he could contain himself no longer. But it was a rash act thus to engage seven men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not Lady Adela. Poor lady, {{she had her}} own {{relations}} with her. She had not by any means recovered the loss of her little boy, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> it must have been too trying for her to see me in his place. I understand from Hailes--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, my dear, {{people must}} be called by their names. If it is her proper name she ought not to hate it. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> people should hate an assumed name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I think {{depends on}} the rank in life which the young men occupy;--and also the young women. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a Bank clerk should do it to an attorney's daughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know why. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> you {{specially}} {{should not}} like the picture; but I think that most women in London in your place would at any rate say that they did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What say you, Egbert? There {{is reason}} in the {{arguments}} that they use. You and I have neither wives nor children, and we risk only our own lives; but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> well <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> those who {{have so much to}} lose are chary of further effort. What say you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{but things}} do come by resolving and struggling. I {{have no doubt}} but that you will live yet to do {{something}} and to be somebody. I have that faith in you. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> well <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a wife may be a great impediment in your way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course; of course. He is an American; that accounts. Still, {{it was the}} Induna; but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{the customs}} of our cousins across the water differ in these {{particulars}} from ours. And do you always stop trains in this way in the States, Mr. Sargent?" ...|$|R
