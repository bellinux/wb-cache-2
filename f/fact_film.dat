2500|$|Although Weiss had {{stated that}} Jon Snow is indeed dead, photos of Kit Harington, the actor playing Jon Snow, {{arriving}} in Belfast surfaced in July 2015. Since the season 6 script read-throughs {{were being held}} in Belfast, these photos fueled speculation that his character might not be dead after all. However, Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair pointed out that Charles Dance was seen at Belfast the previous year, and his character Tywin Lannister only appeared in the first episode of the subsequent season and only as a corpse, although Dance himself confirmed {{the nature of his}} role shortly after the announcement. Another photo, showing Harington on set in Belfast in a costume that varied from the Night's Watch outfit, was published on September 25, 2015. There has been considerable fan speculation regarding how Jon might have survived, including spiritually possessing his direwolf's body and being brought back to life by Melisandre. In February 2016, actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau revealed that the opening scene of the sixth season will [...] "kind of reveal that Jon Snow is ...dead."

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of oxidized ferulic acid on some physicochemical features of bit- ter vetch protein concentrate-based films. Our results indicate that moisture content, total soluble matter, water vapor permeability, and mechanical resistance values of the films prepared in the presence of oxidized ferulic acid were significantly modified in compari- son with the ones detected with films obtained in its absence. In <b>fact,</b> <b>film</b> moisture content, total soluble matter, and water vapor permeability significantly decreased when oxidized ferulic acid was added to the film forming solutions, whereas both film tensile strength and elongation at break resulted markedly higher. Moreover, atomic force and scanning electron microscopy analyses showed that film morphology was also markedly affected by the presence of oxidized ferulic acid, film surface roughness, and compactness resulting higher than the ones observed in control samples. Therefore, these findings show a marked improvement in obtaining edible films derived from cheap starting biopolymers, such as bitter vetch proteins, potentially useful for different food and pharmaceutical applications...|$|E

40|$|Thin carbon {{films have}} been {{deposited}} in vacuum (∼ 10 − 4 Pa) on Si substrates by pulsed laser ablation of a graphite target using a Nd:YAG laser {{operating in the}} near infrared region (λ = 1064 nm). The samples have been deposited at different substrate temperatures (T sub) ranging from room temperature (RT) to 800 °C. X-ray diffraction analysis established the progressive formation of nanosized graphene structures as T sub increased. In <b>fact,</b> <b>film</b> structure evolves from almost amorphous to nanostructured phase characterized by graphene layers oriented perpendicularly to the film plane. The film density, evaluated by X-ray reflectivity measurements, is strongly affected by T sub. At RT the film density {{is similar to the}} graphite one, while it decreases at higher T sub. The electrical properties of the samples have been characterized by field emission measurements. The parameters describing the emitter properties (threshold field Eth and field enhancement factor β) have been evaluated using variable anode-to-cathode distance method. Samples deposited at low T sub have shown the best emission properties, presenting lower Eth and larger β values than those deposited at higher T sub. This is mainly attributed to thesensible density variation, which is in competition with the slighter augment of mean nanoparticle size...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] This {{presentation}} {{explores the}} relationship and mutual influences integration between the high art (especially paintings) in the popular art territory, in the film «Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain». This film is a hybrid phenomenon, allowing for {{a new kind of}} intervisual dialogue between the arts, how these fields interact and how they may expand beyond their existing limits? Film has the ability to engulf and ingest other genres and disciplines together. I would borrow Michael Backtin’s term of super-genre. In <b>fact,</b> <b>film</b> is a medium, which seeks to shape its form to different languages, text, and disciplines, constantly changeable, the film as a genre of all genres. The new technology brings new possibilities in film image towards a new kind of a museum. The «new museum» in this sense is not a museum of pictures alone, it is also a museum of objects, shapes, compositions, attitudes, gestures, pictorial fragments, colors, forms, all made existential, real. This collaboration creates a new kind of film closer to the Carnival concept. The focus is on translation, re-vision, interpretation and transformation of the arts into the filmic elastic image, through the use of codes, colors, form, composition, set design, pictorial fragments, camera and other aesthetic elements of film, providing a new semiotic experience. This film manifests the challenge of using masterpieces of the past in the film image, being in constant flux, evolving and change, creating a new kind of a Museum integrating in the multiple visual vision of our time The aim is to show the contribution of this hybrid phenomenon to the field of visual culture and to present new possibilities of expansion for the cinematic dialogue between the disciplines...|$|E
40|$|Film {{tourism is}} a recent {{socio-cultural}} phenomenon: spontaneous and growing, it has {{captured the attention of}} the media and of tour operators. It is stimulated and led by a vision of territorial location that affects the viewer's gaze. The decision to film a work of cinema or television in a specific area generates a series of effects on tourism and other economic and social activities. Nevertheless, the effects on a place can be of various kinds, the attention of local actors and scholars is focused on the impact in terms of tourist flows. Numerous studies have shown an increase of tourists in locations where films were successfully shot. It is often daunting, if not impossible, to quantify the impact of film or television in terms of growth of tourist flows, because the variation in the number of admissions is affected by various factors. The relationship between film and television, and tourist flows, however, cannot be limited to a quantitative evaluation, but should focus primarily on the motivational aspect that drives tourists to go to that place. Cinematic space has therefore today become tourist space. In <b>fact,</b> <b>film</b> locations are transformed into new destinations of modern tourism. Which place identities are formed through the big and small screens? How can local actors use the screen as a tool for promoting tourism in a given territory? What are the threats and opportunities that arise from the transformation of a place in a particular location? We are looking especially for projects that take a comparative approach that highlight the potential of film to foster economic and local development, particularly that based upon tourism. Themes and approaches can include {{but are not limited to}} public-private partnerships, consumer-visitor experience, and social, economic and cultural aspects. We will favour studies that are place-based and which aim to provide an inclusive and integrated investigation of the territorial aspect of film tourism as it exists at multiple scales...|$|E
