2500|$|The {{fact that}} {{personal}} property is annexed to realty after its conversion usually {{does not prevent}} the maintenance of an action for the conversion, although opinion on this subject remains mixed (in part due to conflits of laws between movables and <b>immovables</b> on the same lot). [...] Actions for conversion of a building, machinery attached to a building or a grain elevator have been allowed. [...] Severance of property from real estate can be converted. Buildings can be converted. Manure can be converted.. [...] There is no simple general rule dividing personal vs. real property.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinction}} between [...] "movables" [...] (not associated {{in any way}} with real estate as such nor necessary to its enjoyment) and [...] "immovables" [...] (such as buildings and often including spare parts or even potentially but not usually mobile tools or devices or systems) arises from the principle of lex situs, by which the governing law for <b>immovables</b> is that where the land is located, regardless of where a will is probated or contract made or executed. [...] There are distinctions made between monetary claim on land and land itself, often with different limitations. [...] However, these distinctions determine jurisdiction, rather than define how to resolve the conversion or possession issue.|$|E
6000|$|Then, again, {{in regard}} to {{proprietary}} rights over <b>immovables</b> (the principal kind of property in a rude age) these rights were of very varying extent and duration. By the Jewish law property in <b>immovables</b> was only a temporary concession; on the Sabbatical year it returned to the common stock to be redistributed; though we may surmise that in the historical times of the Jewish state this rule may have been successfully evaded. In many countries of Asia, before European ideas intervened, nothing existed to which the expression property in land, as we understand the phrase, is strictly applicable. The ownership was broken up among several distinct parties, whose rights were determined rather by custom than by law. The government was part owner, having {{the right to a}} heavy rent. Ancient ideas and even ancient laws limited the government share to some particular fraction of the gross produce, but practically there was no fixed limit. The government might make over its share to an individual, who then became possessed of the right of collection and all the other rights of the state, but not those of any private person connected with the soil. These private rights were of various kinds. The actual cultivators or such of them as had been long settled on the land, had a right to retain possession; it was held unlawful to evict them while they paid the rent--a rent not in general fixed by agreement, but by the custom of the neighborhood. Between the actual cultivators and the state, or the substitute to whom the state had transferred its rights, there were intermediate persons with rights of various extent. There were officers of government who collected the state's share of the produce, sometimes for large districts, who, though bound to pay over to government all they collected, after deducting a percentage, were often hereditary officers. There were also, in many cases village communities, consisting of the reputed descendants of the first settlers of a village, who shared among themselves either the land or its produce according to rules established by custom, either cultivating it themselves or employing others to cultivate it for them, and whose rights in the land approached nearer to those of a landed proprietor, as understood in England, than those of any other party concerned. But the proprietary right of the village was not individual, but collective; inalienable (the rights of individual sharers could only be sold or mortgaged with the consent of the community) and governed by fixed rules. In mediæval Europe almost all land was held from the sovereign on tenure of service, either military or agricultural; and in Great Britain even now, when the services as well as all the reserved rights of the sovereign have long since fallen into disuse or been commuted for taxation, the theory of the law does not acknowledge an absolute right of property in land in any individual; the fullest landed proprietor known to the law, the freeholder, is but a [...] "tenant" [...] of the Crown. In Russia, even when the cultivators of the soil were serfs of the landed proprietor, his proprietary right in the land was limited by rights of theirs belonging to them as a collective body managing its own affairs, and with which he could not interfere. And in most of the countries of continental Europe when serfage was abolished or went out of use, those who had cultivated the land as serfs remained in possession of rights as well as subject to obligations. The great land reforms of Stein and his successors in Prussia consisted in abolishing both the rights and the obligations, and dividing the land bodily between the proprietor and the peasant, instead of leaving each of them with a limited right over the whole. In other cases, as in Tuscany, the metayer farmer is virtually co-proprietor with the landlord, since custom, though not law, guarantees to him a permanent possession and half the gross produce, so long as he fulfils the customary conditions of his tenure.|$|E

An improvement {{in the management of}} government’s <b>immovable</b> assets is required in South Africa to ensure that assets are optimally utilised for service delivery. The entire research attests to the importance of excellent management of government <b>immovable</b> assets throughout its life cycle within a framework of cost effectiveness, efficiency and reduced risk. The study discusses three technical challenges which comprise the incompleteness of the asset register, <b>immovable</b> asset life cycle management, a lack of implementation of the <b>immovable</b> {{asset management}} plan, the asset performance measures and standards for the <b>immovable</b> assets. The National Department of Public Works was targeted as a potential candidate to participate in this research. Primary data was collected through questionnaires and interviews to reveal the strengths and weaknesses and to develop the current theories and models. Secondary data was collected from books, journals, internet and conference papers. The asset management branch in the department was formed recently. The results of the research indicated that the asset management frameworks and the <b>immovable</b> asset management plans are not implemented as designed and there is no integration between the asset’s life cycle processes. The corrosion of information in the asset register was {{because of a lack of}} asset-computerized systems, competent personnel and adequate skills. In conclusion, <b>immovable</b> assets should be managed through integrated life cycle processes, policies and procedural documents should be developed and planning is important to the management of <b>immovable</b> assets.

Some claim {{that the only way}} out of this paradox is if the irresistible force and <b>immovable</b> object never meet.

50|$|The {{distinction}} between {{these types of}} property is significant {{for a variety of}} reasons. Usually one's rights on movables are more attenuated than one's rights on <b>immovables</b> (or real property). The statutes of limitations or prescriptive periods are usually shorter when dealing with personal or movable property. Real property rights are usually enforceable for a much longer period of time and in most jurisdictions real estate and <b>immovables</b> are registered in government-sanctioned land registers. In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a lien or other security interest) can be registered against personal or movable property.|$|E

In addition, the effect of any applicable double tax agreement ('DTA') to such disposals was considered. In certain countries - such as Angola and Nigeria - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident will not be subject to capital gains tax in the respective country where the property is situated regardless {{of the value of the}} shares that is attributable to <b>immovable</b> property. In certain countries - such as Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident may be subject to capital gains tax upon the disposal of an interest in <b>immovable</b> property in the respective country in which the <b>immovable</b> property is held regardless of the value of the shares that is attributable to <b>immovable</b> property, unless a DTA provides otherwise.
