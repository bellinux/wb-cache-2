The Vishnu Purana deems this hell fit for a false witness or one who lies.|$|E

5|$|On {{one of her}} adventures, Riefenstahl met Luis Trenker, who was {{an actor}} from Der Berg des Schicksals. At a meeting {{arranged}} by her friend Gunther Rahn, she met Arnold Fanck, the director of Der Berg des Schicksals and a pioneer of the mountain film genre. Fanck {{was working on a}} film in Berlin. After Riefenstahl told him how much she admired his work, she also convinced him of her acting skill. She persuaded him to feature her in one of his movies. Riefenstahl later received a package from Fanck containing the script of the 1926 film Der Heilige Berg ("The Holy Mountain"). She made a series of films for Fanck, where she learned from him acting and film editing techniques. One of Fanck's films that brought Riefenstahl into the limelight was Die Weisse Hölle vom Piz Palü ("The White <b>Hell</b> <b>of</b> Piz Palü") of 1929, co-directed by G. W. Pabst. Her fame spread to countries outside Germany.|$|E
