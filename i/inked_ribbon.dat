500|$|In the machine's {{original}} 1868 design, {{paper was}} placed horizontally {{on the top}} of the machine, held in place by a movable square frame (to provide line and letter spacing). Above the paper and centered on the device, an arm held an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> which crossed over a small metal plate. Depressing a key caused a typebar to rise from underneath the paper, pressing the paper upwards against the ribbon and thus printing an inked character. This method of imprinting required use of very thin, nonstandard paper (such as tissue paper). Two variants were produced with alternative methods of actuating the typebars: one in which the keys and typebars were connected by a series of wires and one in which the keys directly [...] "kicked" [...] the typebars upwards.|$|E
2500|$|Dry {{correction}} products (such as correction paper) under {{brand names}} such as [...] "Ko-Rec-Type" [...] were introduced in the 1970s and functioned like white carbon paper. A strip of the product was placed over the letters needing correction, and the incorrect letters were retyped, causing the black character to be overstruck with a white overcoat. Similar material was soon incorporated in carbon-film electric typewriter ribbons; like the traditional two-color black-and-red <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> common on manual typewriters, {{a black and white}} correcting ribbon became commonplace on electric typewriters. But the black or white coating could be partly rubbed off with handling, so such corrections were generally not acceptable in legal documents.|$|E
2500|$|The Charga-Plate, {{developed}} in 1928, {{was an early}} predecessor of the credit card and {{was used in the}} U.S. from the 1930s to the late 1950s. It was a 2½" [...] × 1¼" [...] rectangle of sheet metal related to Addressograph and military dog tag systems. It was embossed with the customer's name, city, and state. It held a small paper card on its back for a signature. In recording a purchase, the plate was laid into a recess in the imprinter, with a paper [...] "charge slip" [...] positioned on top of it. The record of the transaction included an impression of the embossed information, made by the imprinter pressing an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> against the charge slip. Charga-Plate was a trademark of Farrington Manufacturing Co. Charga-Plates were issued by large-scale merchants to their regular customers, much like department store credit cards of today. In some cases, the plates were kept in the issuing store rather than held by customers. When an authorized user made a purchase, a clerk retrieved the plate from the store's files and then processed the purchase. Charga-Plates speeded back-office bookkeeping and reduced copying errors that were done manually in paper ledgers in each store.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the [...] "typeball" [...] technology, Selectrics were associated with several innovations in <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> design.|$|R
25|$|The early Resident Evil {{video games}} used a {{typewriter}} as the save feature, and used one <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> per save.|$|R
50|$|Programs {{and data}} could be stored on a {{cassette}} tape through an optional external tape interface unit. A printer/cassette interface was available, which used an <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> on plain paper.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, SCM {{introduced}} a cartridge ribbon which eliminated the long-standing problem of getting ink-stained fingers from hand-threading a replacement spool of <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{letter-quality printer}} {{operates}} {{in much the}} same fashion as a typewriter. A metal or plastic printwheel embossed with letters, numbers, or symbols strikes an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon,</b> depositing the ink (or carbon, if an expensive single-strike ribbon was installed) on the page and thus printing a character.|$|E
50|$|The Lettera 22 is {{an oblique}} frontstroke typebar typewriter. The typebars strike a red/black <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon,</b> which is {{positioned}} between the typebar {{and the paper}} by a lever whenever a key is pressed; a small switch located near the upper {{right side of the}} keyboard can be used to control the strike position of the ribbon, in order to print with black, red, or no ink (for mimeograph stencils).|$|E

5000|$|Impact {{printers}} {{rely on a}} forcible {{impact to}} transfer ink to the media. The impact printer uses a print head that either hits {{the surface of the}} <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon,</b> pressing the <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> against the paper (similar to the action of a typewriter), or, less commonly, hits the back of the paper, pressing the paper against the <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> (the IBM 1403 for example). All but the dot matrix printer rely on the use of fully formed characters, letterforms that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing. In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome, or sometimes two-color, printing in a single typeface at one time, although bolding and underlining of text could be done by [...] "overstriking", that is, printing two or more impressions either in the same character position or slightly offset. Impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, daisywheel printers, dot matrix printers and line printers. Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed. An overview of impact printing contains a detailed description of many of the technologies used.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> {{was a long}} {{roll the}} width of the print area that was {{positioned}} between the print chain and the paper. The roll came in two parts, the feeder roll and take-up roll. The roll was constantly wound and rewound during printing.|$|R
50|$|The {{line printer}} could print 600 lines of 120 {{characters}} per minute. It used a print barrel {{made up of}} 120 print wheels each with 50 characters around its edge. Each of the 120 print positions had a print hammer which when fired squeezed the paper and an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> between itself and the rotating print barrel {{for a fraction of}} a second. It is reputed to be the first commercially produced barrel printer.|$|E
50|$|A ‘card shield’ would {{grab the}} punched card {{to hold it}} in place and lower it a {{position}} almost touching the inked print ribbon and print wheel. At the correct time 60 ‘hammers’, under spring tension and controlled by a cam, would ‘fire’ pressing the card / <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> onto the print wheel and leaving an inked impression of the character {{on the surface of the}} punched card. There is a blank space on the print wheel for non-printing columns.|$|E
50|$|This {{advancement}} {{was possible}} because many university computer terminals had switched by the mid-1970s to CRT screens, {{which could be}} refreshed with text {{in a few seconds}} instead of a minute or more. Earlier games printed game status for the player on Teletype machines or a line printer, at speeds ranging from 10 to 30 characters per second with a rat-a-tat-tat sound as a metal ball or belt with characters was pressed against paper through an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> by a hammer.|$|E
5000|$|The drum sat above an 18 in <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon.</b> Below {{the ribbon}} the [...] green-bar {{continuous}} form paper was moved {{into and out}} of the printer head on four tractor assemblies. Below the paper path were a set of 120 or 132 “hammers” that were triggered by electric solenoids.|$|R
5|$|The game {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find <b>ink</b> <b>ribbons</b> and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of <b>ink</b> <b>ribbons,</b> so players cannot save their progress as many times as they want. The story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.|$|R
50|$|A {{typewriter}} <b>ribbon</b> or <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> is an expendable module {{serving the}} function of transferring pigment to paper in various devices for impact printing. Such ribbons were part of standard designs for hand- or motor-driven typewriters, teleprinters, stenotype machines, computer-driven printers and many mechanical calculators, before electronic alternatives replaced most of them.|$|R
5000|$|An early {{drum printer}} was the [...] "Potter Flying Typewriter", in 1952. [...] "Instead of working laboriously, one {{character}} at a time, it prints whole lines at once, 300 lines per minute, {{on a paper}} band. ... Heart of the machine is a continuously spinning disk with the necessary letters and numbers on its rim. ... As the disk revolves, 80 electrically operated hammers tap {{the back of the}} paper against an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> in contact with the disk, thus printing the proper characters in the proper places on the line." ...|$|E
5000|$|Both line matrix and serial {{dot matrix}} printers, use pins to strike against the <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon,</b> making dots {{on the paper}} and forming the desired [...] characters. The {{differences}} are that line matrix printers use a hammer bank (or print-shuttle) instead of print head, this print-shuttle has hammers instead of print wires, and these hammers are arranged in a horizontal row instead in vertical column. The hammer bank uses the same technology as the permanent magnet print head with the small difference that instead of print wires the print-shuttle has hammers.|$|E

50|$|It {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{low-cost}} color printers available to consumers and became a popular printer for printing computer art drawn with software packages such as KoalaPad, Deluxe Paint, Doodle! and NEOchrome but was criticized for its slowness and high cost of operation, as the wax-coated ribbon only lasted for one pass, unlike an <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon.</b> The Okimate 10 was succeeded by the Okimate 20.|$|R
50|$|Some games employ {{limits to}} saving {{in order to}} prevent players from using them as a primary means of {{succeeding}} in the game. In Tomb Raider save points are consumed upon use, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest charges two banana coins to use a save point more than once, and in Resident Evil the player must find and expend an <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> for each save.|$|R
5000|$|To {{fulfill the}} game's objective, the player uncovers various {{documents}} that provide exposition about the game's narrative, {{as well as}} clues that help them solve various puzzles within the mansion. Key items are also available that give the player access to other items or new areas. The player can arm their character with weapons to defend themselves from enemies, although the ammunition available for each firearm is limited and the player must learn to conserve the ammunition they have for situations where they will really need it. To restore the character's health, the player uses first-aid sprays or three types of healing herbs that can be mixed together in different combinations for different healing effects. The carrying capacity of the player is limited depending on the character and items that the player {{does not wish to}} carry at the moment can be stored into an item box to be retrieved for later use. To save their progress, the player must pick up an <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> and use it on any of the typewriters scattered through key locations in the game. However, the supply of <b>ink</b> <b>ribbons</b> the player can acquire is limited much like the player's ammo and healing supplies. Players will encounter and fight various infected creatures as flesh-eating zombies, undead dogs, giant spiders, and other monsters.|$|R
5000|$|The console {{typewriter}} is {{the product}} of a company named Soroban Engineering. It uses an IBM Model B Electric typewriter mechanism, modified by the addition of switches to detect keypresses, and solenoids to activate the typebars. It uses a traditional typebar mechanism, not the [...] "golfball" [...] IBM Selectric typewriter mechanism, which was not introduced until the next year. Lettercase is selected by raising and lowering the massive type basket. The Soroban is equipped with a two-color <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> (red and black), and the interface allows color selection. Programs commonly use color-coding to distinguish user input from machine responses. The Soroban mechanism is unreliable and prone to jamming, particularly when shifting case or changing ribbon color.|$|E
50|$|An Addressograph {{system of}} the 1960s was {{essentially}} a Graphotype debossing machine for preparing address plates, a cassette-style plate feeder, a heavy-duty, rapidly moving <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon,</b> a platten for hand-feeding the mail piece, and a foot pedal for stamping the address. The individual steel address plates were inserted into card-sized frames which {{had a series of}} slots along the top where colored metal flags could also be inserted for sorting purposes. The plate assemblies were placed in steel cassettes resembling library card catalogue drawers, which were manually inserted into the machine. At the press of the foot pedal the plate assemblies were swapped in sequence in a similar fashion to a slide projector, placing an impression of the raised type onto the mail piece.|$|E
5000|$|In the machine's {{original}} 1868 design, {{paper was}} placed horizontally {{on the top}} of the machine, held in place by a movable square frame (to provide line and letter spacing).

50|$|The Caps Lock key {{originated}} as a Shift {{lock key}} on mechanical typewriters. An early innovation in typewriters was {{the introduction of}} a second character on each typebar, thereby doubling the number of characters that could be typed, using the same number of keys. The second character was positioned above the first on the face of each typebar, and the shift key caused the entire type apparatus to move, physically shifting the positioning of the typebars relative to the <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon.</b> Just as in modern computer keyboards, the shifted position was used to produce capitals and secondary characters.|$|R
50|$|MicroDry is a {{computer}} printing system developed by the ALPS corporation of Japan. It is a wax/resin-transfer system using individual colored thermal ribbon cartridges, and can print in process color using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black cartridges, as well as such spot-color cartridges as white, metallic silver, and metallic gold, {{on a wide variety}} of paper and transparency stock. Certain MicroDry printers can also operate in dye sublimation mode, using special cartridges and paper. ALPS licensed the technology to Citizen (Printiva series) and to Okidata (Oki DP series). Alps also produced the actual printer hardware and <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> cartridges for those companies.|$|R
50|$|The printer had an {{expansion}} socket under {{the front cover}} which could accommodate either Apple's AppleTalk network card or 32K memory buffer card, but not {{both at the same}} time. Sequential Systems produced a 2-in-1 solution card that combined both features into one card, as well as larger memory buffer cards up to 1 MB. With an optional AppleTalk networking card installed, it was a low-cost alternative to the vastly more expensive LaserWriter. Another third-party innovation was an add-on peripheral called the ThunderScan, which allowed the printer to work as a low-cost optical scanner (the scanner mechanism temporarily replaced the <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> cartridge).|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} drum printer design, a fixed font {{character}} set is engraved onto {{the periphery of}} a number of print wheels, the number matching the number of columns (letters in a line) the printer could print. The wheels, joined to form a large drum (cylinder), spin at high speed and paper and an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> is stepped (moved) past the print position. As the desired character for each column passes the print position, a hammer strikes the paper from the rear and presses the paper against the ribbon and the drum, causing the desired character to be recorded on the continuous paper. Because the drum carrying the letterforms (characters) remains in constant motion, the strike-and-retreat action of the hammers had to be very fast. Typically, they were driven by voice coils mounted on the moving part of the hammer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{line printer}} ran at 600 lines per minute, using a {{continuously}} rotating print drum technology, with letters, figures and punctuation marks distributed around the drum at each column. 132 solenoid-operated flat-faced print hammers comprised a print line, with ten characters to the inch. When a desired character {{arrived at the}} printing position, as indicated by timing marks {{on the end of}} the drum, a thyratron would fire and energize a print column solenoid, propelling its hammer to the back face of the printing paper. The paper would be bounced against a wide <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> and against the drum, printing the desired character. The hammer would then rebound with a spring to await the next thyraton firing and the process would repeat on the next line down the sheet. Drum printers, when not adjusted properly, or due to component wear would mis-register the character vertically.|$|E
5000|$|The Charga-Plate, {{developed}} in 1928, {{was an early}} predecessor of the credit card and {{was used in the}} U.S. from the 1930s to the late 1950s. It was a 2½" [...] × 1¼" [...] rectangle of sheet metal related to Addressograph and military dog tag systems. It was embossed with the customer's name, city, and state. It held a small paper card on its back for a signature. In recording a purchase, the plate was laid into a recess in the imprinter, with a paper [...] "charge slip" [...] positioned on top of it. The record of the transaction included an impression of the embossed information, made by the imprinter pressing an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> against the charge slip. Charga-Plate was a trademark of Farrington Manufacturing Co. Charga-Plates were issued by large-scale merchants to their regular customers, much like department store credit cards of today.

50|$|PVB resins (provided by the {{manufacturer}} in powdered or granulated form) are also utilized {{in a range of}} applications including technical ceramic (temporary) binders, <b>inks,</b> dye transfer <b>ribbon</b> <b>inks,</b> paints & coatings (including wash primers), binders for reflective sheet and binders for magnetic media. PVB resin is particularly useful at bonding to metals, ceramics and other inorganics.|$|R
2500|$|The Centralograph {{was used}} for {{production}} monitoring and registration of {{the running of the}} spinning machines in workshop and offices. The Centralograph is a recording instrument equipped with a number of printing units which record data on a moving chart. The record appears in the form of dashes and numerical digits in a series of columns. The printing units have electromagnet coil which are actuated by external impulses. The chart and the <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> are driven either by a synchronous motor or by an impulse motor. Synchronous motors are commonly used in analog electric clocks, timers and other devices where correct time is required.|$|R
