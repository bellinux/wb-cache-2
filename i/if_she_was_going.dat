25|$|In 1844 {{their mother}} took {{the girls to}} Paris to {{continue}} their studies, first with Francesco Piermarini, {{and then with the}} distinguished tenor Marco Bordogni. Bordogni thought highly of Sophie: it is said that he allowed her to sing only scales and solfeggi which he composed for her, for two whole years. After that time mother Crüwell wanted to remove her, saying that she had learnt scales enough and that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do nothing else she might as well get married and give it up. Bordogni persuaded mother that she would have a wonderful career, and that she should go on to complete her studies in Milan. A first public appearance in January 1846 was reported in the musical journal Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris.|$|E
2500|$|Cedarbaum ordered Stewart {{to report}} to her prison {{sentence}} before 2:00p.m. on October 8, 2004. By September 27, 2004, Stewart received the BOP ID 55170-054. At about 6:15a.m. on October 8, 2004, she reported to FPC Alderson. Stewart said that her prison nickname was [...] "M. Diddy". While in confinement, she took a job and became an informal liaison between the administration and her fellow inmates. The People special, Scandals! That Rocked America, stated [...] "Some expected America's goddess of domestic perfection to fall into terminal despair. Instead, with the drive {{that would make her}} a billionaire, Stewart took her lemon of a sentence and made lemonade. Heck, she made a lemon soufflé." [...] Stewart was released from FPC Alderson at 12:30a.m. on March 4, 2005. She was then placed in a two-year term of supervised release; during five of those months, she was placed in home confinement with electronic monitoring. Stewart served her home confinement at her residence in Bedford, New York. She was allowed to leave her house for 48 hours per week for work-related visits. After her home confinement ended, but while her supervised release continued, she was required to remain employed and not to associate with people with criminal records. In addition, during the supervised release, she was required to receive permission from federal officials <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to leave the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.|$|E
60|$|My Aunt Martha gasped, {{and looked}} as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to sit down}} on the floor.|$|R
60|$|She made no answer; {{she looked}} before her as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{out of her}} mind.|$|R
60|$|She {{took her}} hands {{away from a}} face that looked just as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to cry.|$|R
60|$|A single thought usurped {{her whole}} soul. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> mad--if {{this was really}} mania--she could never, never, never--marry Cyril Waring.|$|E
6000|$|... "What shall I do?" [...] she cried. [...] "I can't {{walk home}} without that basket. It's {{perfectly}} dreadful!" [...] And {{she looked as}} <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to cry.|$|E
6000|$|... "A close call!" [...] he remarked. [...] "It {{looked as}} <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> slap over us. I couldn't see her sooner {{because of the}} sail. She's running into Bannington's." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Hernshaw {{caught her}} breath, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to speak, {{but she did}} not say anything.|$|R
60|$|Dorothea parted {{her lips}} again as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to say more, but {{changed her mind}} and paused.|$|R
60|$|She {{sank into}} a chair before which <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> standing, and <b>she</b> looked as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to swoon.|$|R
6000|$|... "I asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{without her}} wages and a character, {{and she said}} as you had paid her her wages, \and she didn't want a character, because she didn't {{consider}} the house was respectable." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{mistress}} {{lifted her}} head suddenly from her book as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to say something--checked herself by a great effort--and, looking back again at the open page, dismissed us with a sign of her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Phebe, it's such {{a lovely}} day, I do wish your fine secret {{was going to}} happen right away! I feel just like having a good time; don't you?" [...] said Rose, waving her arms as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to fly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} see any thing so {{perfectly}} characteristic?" [...] said Mrs. Follingsbee, looking around her as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to faint.|$|R
60|$|Her eyes lighted on the table, and a faint ruefulness {{came into}} them, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to ask Gyp {{to eat the}} oysters.|$|R
60|$|The house {{whirled around}} {{two or three}} times and rose slowly through the air. Dorothy felt as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> up in a balloon.|$|R
60|$|Katie was {{standing}} {{looking out of}} the window. She turned as the door opened, and then she saw Andy. Her lips parted, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to say something, but she didn't say nothing. And Andy, he didn't say nothing, neither. He just looked, and she just looked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{told her}} {{that there was no}} use in her getting dressed before dinner <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to wait three hours," [...] responded Daisy's mamma. [...] "I didn't see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with Mr. Giovanelli." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{little girl}} daintily brought a box covered with net, {{in which a}} huge apple-green caterpillar, with dashes of bright colour on his sides, and a horny spike on his tail, was feasting upon {{tamarisk}} leaves. Grace asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to keep it. [...] "Yes, till it buries itself," [...] said the child. [...] "Aunt Ermine thinks it is the elephant sphynx." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Twenty men, sir, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> {{a simple}} trader; I should say from thirty-five to forty would be none too much <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to fight her guns." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Burton sprang {{forward and}} caught the girl, who <b>was</b> reeling as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to fall. [...] "Katy! Katy! Bring some water here, quick!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{particular}} reason! Why, the Antelope is a privateer; and <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> {{to cruise}} about, {{that means that}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to fight, and he may get shot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The tone {{is quite}} perfect!" [...] Carmina {{answered}} with enthusiasm. [...] "Did you choose it?" [...] Mrs. Gallilee looked as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to say [...] "Good Heavens!" [...] again, {{and perhaps to}} endure it no longer. Carmina was too simple to interpret these signs in the right way. Why should her aunt not choose a piano? [...] "Don't you like music?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{made up my}} mind <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to keep up {{this sort}} of thing Jone and me would change {{carriages}} when we stopped at the next station, for comparisons are very different from poetry, and if you try to mix them with scenery you make a mess that is not fit for a Christian. But I thought first I would give her a word back: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke with}} his eye {{fixed on the}} ground, and did not become aware of Aissa's {{presence}} till {{he lifted his head}} when he ceased speaking. She had approached so quietly that even Omar did not hear her footsteps, and she stood now looking at them with troubled eyes and parted lips, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to speak; but at Babalatchi's entreating gesture she remained silent. Omar sat absorbed in thought.|$|E
60|$|Again James {{looked at}} her; {{he could not}} make out the {{expression}} on her face. She looked almost as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to cry, and yet....|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not just at present,' said Ethel. 'I {{will see}} how <b>she</b> <b>is</b> when <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in bed, but <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to sleep, {{we had better}} not disturb her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> like you. But {{looks as}} <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to have more}} sense. Forgive me, I knew your father my dear," [...] laughed Clodd; [...] "when he was younger." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bartley ventured {{upon this}} bold move, {{because he had}} {{found that it was}} always best to have things out with Marcia at once, and, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to take his {{hospitality}} to Kinney in bad part, he wanted to get through the trouble. [...] "That was very nice of you, Marcia," [...] he said, when they were in their own room. [...] "My invitation rather slipped out, and I didn't know how you would like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Miss, I {{was told}} to show the governess into the library. She went down with her bonnet on, ready dressed to go out. Before she had been five minutes with my {{mistress}} she came out again, and rang the hall-bell, and spoke to Joseph. 'My boxes are packed and directed,' she says; 'I will send for them in an hour's time. Good day, Joseph.' And {{she stepped into the}} street, as quietly as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> out shopping round the corner." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} the papers on the table; stopped as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to ask a question, but thought better of it, {{and going to the}} cupboard, {{selected}} an eligible piece of bread wherewith she might operate on the satin slippers: and afterwards coming back to the table, seated herself there commodiously with the shoes, and then asked her father, in her honest, Irish brogue, [...] "What have ye got them letthers, and pothry, and stuff, of Master Arthur's out for, Pa? Sure ye don't want to be reading over that nonsense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would ye slay her too?" [...] shrieked the {{old woman}} at that moment, coming forward with the pole with which <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> raking in the ashes, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to attack them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes--the best song <b>she</b> {{has written}} <b>is</b> to be sung {{in the best}} manner to the best air that has been {{composed}} for it. I should not wonder <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to sing it herself.' ...|$|R
60|$|Topsy {{had never}} been spoken to so kindly and gently in all her life. For a minute <b>she</b> looked as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to cry. The next <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{grinning}} as usual in her ugly way.|$|R
