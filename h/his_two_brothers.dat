5|$|King Stephen's {{only son}} who survived infancy, Emeric, died on 2 September 1031. Thereafter, Vazul had the strongest claim to succeed the King. However, the monarch, suspecting that Vazul {{inclined}} towards paganism, favored his own sister's son, Peter Orseolo. In {{order to ensure}} his nephew's succession, Stephen had Vazul blinded.

5|$|Peter Elfelt (1866–1931), {{who served}} his {{photography}} apprenticeship in 1893 in Hillerød with Carl Rathsack, soon opened a studio {{of his own}} together with <b>his</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers.</b> His work was widely recognized with the result that, in 1900, {{he was given the}} title of Photographer to the Royal Danish Court. He took not only a large number of portraits but also landscapes across Denmark. He later became a major name in cinematography too.|$|E
5|$|Born in Hamilton, Victoria, Lerew {{was the son}} of William Margrave Lerew, {{a chemist}} and {{veterinary}} surgeon who had emigrated from England with <b>his</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers.</b> The family was of French Huguenot extraction, the original name being LeRoux. John Lerew was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne, where {{he was a member of}} the cadets. He studied part-time for a bachelor's degree in civil engineering at the University of Melbourne, concurrently serving approximately two years in the militia with various units including the 39thBattalion, 3rdDivision Artillery Survey Unit, and Melbourne University Regiment.

5|$|George Frederic Watts {{was born}} in 1817, {{the son of a}} London musical {{instrument}} manufacturer. <b>His</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers</b> died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E
5|$|Paranhos {{was born}} on 16 March 1819 in Salvador, Bahia, {{at a time when}} Brazil was a kingdom united with Portugal. His parents were Agostinho da Silva Paranhos and Josefa Emerenciana de Barreiros. Agostinho Paranhos, along with <b>his</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers,</b> {{migrated}} to Brazil during {{the first decade of the}} 19th century. He became a wealthy merchant and married Josefa, the Brazilian-born daughter of one of Bahia's long-established families. Her family had roots in Porto, where Agostinho's own family had originated. Agostinho remained loyal to Portugal at the time of Brazil's Independence in 1822, which resulted in his ostracism and the collapse of his business.|$|E
5|$|The {{final scene}} {{is the story}} of Noah's drunkenness. After the Flood, Noah tills the soil and grows vines. He is shown doing so, in the {{background}} of the picture. He becomes drunk and inadvertently exposes himself. His youngest son, Ham, brings <b>his</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers</b> Shem and Japheth to see the sight but they discreetly cover their father with a cloak. Ham is later cursed by Noah and told that the descendants of Ham's son Canaan will serve Shem and Japheth's descendants forever. Taken together, these three pictures serve to show that Humankind had moved a long way from God's perfect creation. However, it is through Shem and his descendants, the Israelites, that Salvation will come to the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{operations}} became sizeable {{during the}} last quarter of the nineteenth century. Smith died in 1879, leaving an estate valued at under £45,000 (around £4.1 million in 2016 adjusted for inflation), and his assets were jointly inherited by <b>his</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers,</b> William and Samuel Smith (a tanner). William purchased Samuel's share of his brother's personal estate, and built a modern brewery in 1883–4 at the cost of £130,000 (£9.7 million in 2013). By this time the company had a staff of over 100. William Smith died in 1886, and the firm was inherited in partnership by his two nephews, Henry Herbert (1863–1911) and Frank Riley, henceforth known as Riley-Smith under the terms of his will.|$|E
5|$|Walter Nowotny {{was born}} in Gmünd, {{a small town in}} Lower Austria. His father, Rudolf Nowotny, was a railway official; <b>his</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers,</b> Rudolf and Hubert, became {{officers}} in the Wehrmacht. Hubert Nowotny was killed in action in the Battle of Stalingrad. From 1925to 1935, his family lived in Schwarzenau until his father was relocated to Mistelbach, north of Vienna. Walter attended the primary school (Volksschule) in Schwarzenau before graduating to the Bundesoberrealschule in Waidhofen an der Thaya. During these years, he also sang in the Cistercian convent choir in the Zwettl Abbey.|$|E
5|$|When many oil strikes {{occurred}} {{elsewhere in}} Venango County in 1867, people left Pithole, often taking {{their houses and}} places of business with them or abandoning their property. By December 1866, the population had dropped to 2,000. The newspaper was relocated to Petroleum Center in July1868, becoming the Petroleum Center Daily Record. Both the Chase House and Murphy's Theater were sold in August 1868 and moved to Pleasantville. Prather and Duncan sold their interests in Pithole before the downturn; Prather split an estimated $3 million with <b>his</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers</b> and moved to Meadville, while Duncan returned to Scotland with his fortune.|$|E

5|$|According {{to local}} newspapers, Barrett left {{approximately}} £1.7million to <b>his</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers</b> and two sisters. This sum was apparently largely acquired from royalties from Pink Floyd compilations and live recordings featuring songs {{he had written}} while with the band. A tribute concert called Games for May {{was held at the}} Barbican Centre, London on 10 May 2007 with Robyn Hitchcock, Captain Sensible, Damon Albarn, Chrissie Hynde, Kevin Ayers and his Pink Floyd bandmates performing. A series of events called The City Wakes was held in Cambridge in October 2008 to celebrate Barrett's life, art and music. Barrett's sister, Rosemary Breen, supported this, the first-ever series of official events in memory of her brother. After the festival's success, arts charity Escape Artists announced plans to create a centre in Cambridge, using art to help people suffering from mental health problems. A memorial bench has been placed in the Botanic Gardens in Cambridge and a more prominent tribute is planned in the city.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the early}} Jurchens had no written records, {{the story of}} Hanpu was first {{transmitted}} orally. According to the History of Jin (compiled in the 1340s), Hanpu arrived from Goryeo {{at the age of}} sixty and settled among the Jurchen Wanyan clan. Other sources claim that Hanpu was from Silla, the state that had ruled the Korean peninsula but was annexed by Goryeo in 935. The same story recounts that when Hanpu left Goryeo, <b>his</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers</b> remained behind, one in Goryeo and one in the Balhae area. Because the Jurchens considered Hanpu to be the sixth-generation ancestor of Wanyan Wugunai (1021–1074), historians postulate that Hanpu lived in the early tenth century, when the Jurchens still consisted of independent tribes, or sometime between the founding of Goryeo in 918 and its destruction of Silla in 935.|$|E
5|$|George Frederic Watts {{was born}} in London in 1817, {{the son of a}} musical {{instrument}} manufacturer. <b>His</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers</b> died in 1823 and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict evangelical Christianity led to both a deep knowledge of the Bible and a strong dislike of organised religion. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and six years later was proficient enough as an artist to earn a living as a portrait painter and cricket illustrator. Aged 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate Alexander Constantine Ionides to copy a portrait of his father by Samuel Lane; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E

5|$|In August 1591, Maximilian of Habsburg, {{who still}} claimed Poland and Lithuania, sent his envoy to Andrew seeking Transylvanian support against Sigismund III. Andrew {{emphasized}} that being under Ottoman suzerainty, Transylvania could not openly support Maximilian, {{but he also}} promised that Sigismund Báthory would not prevent the mustering of Transylvanian soldiers to fight in Poland. In the same month, Sigismund Báthory's plan to enable the Jesuits to return to Transylvania {{gave rise to a}} serious family conflict, because both Andrew and Balthasar refused to support the prince at the Diet. According to contemporaneous gossips, Andrew and <b>his</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers</b> decided to dethrone Sigismund, replacing him with Balthasar. Pope Clement VIII sent a papal nuncio, Attilio Amalteo, to Transylvania to mediate a reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|In {{dividing}} his lands, William {{appears to}} have followed the Norman tradition, distinguishing between Normandy, which he had inherited, and England, which he had acquired through war. William's second son, Richard, {{had died in a}} hunting accident, leaving Henry and <b>his</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers</b> to inherit William's estate. Robert, the eldest, despite being in armed rebellion against his father {{at the time of his}} death, received Normandy. England was given to William Rufus, who was in favour with the dying king. Henry was given a large sum of money, usually reported as £5,000, with the expectation that he would also be given his mother's modest set of lands in Buckinghamshire and Gloucestershire. William's funeral at Caen was marred by angry complaints from a local man, and Henry may have been responsible for resolving the dispute by buying off the protester with silver.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September, Maurice {{gave the}} command of the ambush to his {{favourite}} commander, his cousin Philip of Nassau. Maurice instructed him to cross the Lippe river the following day at dawn, hide in a wood next to which the Spanish convoy was expected to pass, and fall on its guard. Maurice's goal was to seize the foraging convoy, separate it from the escort and lead it to the Dutch camp, thus forcing Mondragón to intervene with a larger force. Then, after the appearance of Mondragón with the main army, Nassau was to retreat to the Dutch camp, thus luring the Spanish army into an ambush. For his task, Nassau received {{the command of}} some 500 or 700 Dutch and English horsemen and was accompanied by <b>his</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers,</b> Ernst Casimir and Ludwig Gunther, {{as well as several}} other Dutch officers, Count Ernst of Solms, Paul and Marcellus Bacx, and the English captains Nicholas Parker, Cutler and Robert Vere.|$|E
