5|$|Manufacturers and {{academics}} have conducted studies and experiments {{in an effort}} to improve the stretchiness, melting characteristics, browning, fat content and water retention of pizza cheese. Several patents exist for specialized varieties of pizza cheese and for its processing. A study by Rudan and Barbano found that the addition of a thin layer of vegetable oil atop low- and reduced-fat pizza cheese increased meltability and reduced browning and dehydration when the product was cooked, but the texture remained overly chewy and tough. A study by Perry et al. found various methods to heighten the melt of low-fat pizza cheese by increasing its moisture, including the use of pre-acidification, fat-replacers, and <b>exopolysaccharide</b> starter cultures as well as higher pasteurization temperatures.|$|E

Some examples are the K5 capsule and O75 O antigen {{found on the}} surface of Escherichia coli, and the <b>exopolysaccharide</b> capsules of Staphylococcus epidermidis. [...] Streptococcus pneumoniae produces several types of capsule that provide different levels of protection, and group A streptococci produce proteins such as M protein and fimbrial proteins to block engulfment. Some proteins hinder opsonin-related ingestion; Staphylococcus aureus produces Protein A to block antibody receptors, which decreases the effectiveness of opsonins.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{differences in the}} gel matrix of aerobic granular sludge and normal aerobic flocculent sludge. From both types of sludge that fed with the same municipal sewage, the functional gel-forming <b>exopolysaccharides,</b> alginate-like <b>exopolysaccharides,</b> were isolated. These two <b>exopolysaccharides</b> were chemically fractionated, and investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. The isolated polymers were made into a gel by calcium addition and the mechanical properties of these reconstituted gels were measured by a low load compression tester. The viscoelastic behavior of the gels was described by a generalized Maxwell model. The alginate-like <b>exopolysaccharides</b> derived from aerobic granules had significantly higher amount of poly(guluronic acid) blocks but lower amount of poly(guluronic acid-manuronic acid) blocks in the chemical structure, while the alginate-like <b>exopolysaccharides</b> derived from aerobic flocculent sludge had equal amount of poly(guluronic acid) blocks and poly(guluronic acid-manuronic acid) blocks. These differences result in a perfect gel-forming capability of alginate-like <b>exopolysaccharides</b> derived from aerobic granules and bestowed this <b>exopolysaccharides</b> gel a stronger mechanical property as compared to alginate-like <b>exopolysaccharides</b> derived from aerobic flocculent sludge. The different chemical and mechanical properties of these two <b>exopolysaccharides</b> contributed to the distinguished characteristics between aerobic granular sludge and aerobic flocculent sludge.

The effects of the biological activities of three orthologous cathelicidins from Homo sapiens sapiens, Pongo pygmaeus (orangutan) and Presbitys obscurus (dusky leaf monkey) were examined.

The {{endophytic}} bacterium, MD-b 1, {{was isolated}} from the medicinal plant Ophiopogon japonicas and identified as the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens sp. with 99 % similarity based on the partial sequence analysis of 16 S rDNA. <b>Exopolysaccharides</b> were extracted from the endophyte {{for the evaluation of}} its antitumor activity against gastric carcinoma cell lines (MC- 4 and SGC- 7901). 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays and microscopy were performed to estimate the cell viability and morphological changes of the MC- 4 and SGC- 7901 cells following treatment with the <b>exopolysaccharides</b> at 14, 22 and 30 µg/µl.
