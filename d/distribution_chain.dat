25|$|Value-added tax (VAT) in Vietnam is {{a broadly}} based {{consumption}} tax assessed {{on the value}} added to goods and services arising {{through the process of}} production, circulation, and consumption. It's an indirect tax in Vietnam on domestic consumption applied nationwide rather than at different levels such as state, provincial or local taxes. It is a multi-stage tax which is collected at every stage of the production and <b>distribution</b> <b>chain</b> and passed on to the final customer. It is applicable to the majority of goods and services bought and sold for use in the country. Goods that are sold for export and services that are sold to customers abroad are normally not subject to VAT.|$|E
25|$|When Steve Jobs {{returned}} to Apple in 1997, he stopped all Macintosh clone efforts, which {{shut down the}} Apple Pippin concept. Once Apple stopped all development of the Pippin platform, it affected all parties. Bandai stopped production of all models of Pippin by mid-1997. Katz Media, who was receiving its systems from Bandai, vowed to continue supporting Pippin in a PR notice released June 25, 1997. Katz Media reportedly had some 100,000 units committed because of written agreements with companies spanning twenty countries. The company would eventually file for bankruptcy {{by the end of}} 1998. On February 27, 1998, DayStar Digital purchased all remaining inventory of hardware from Bandai, and sold the inventory to anyone who would buy them.

This system is designed to scale correctly in a wide area network, using weak consistency replication mechanisms. It is formed by two independent virtual networks on top of Internet, one for replicating objects {{and the other one}} to build <b>distribution</b> <b>chains</b> to be used by the first network. As in Internet some sites often become inaccessible due to latency, partitions and flashcrowd, objects in our system are accessed locally and updated off-line. It also provides methods for the classification of objects.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{development}} of the Romanian retail market, the recent evolutions on this market and the impact of the recent conflict between the retailers and the Romanian producers, starting from current questions not only in Romania but also at European level. The beginning of this conflict producers-retailers emphasized the accent placed on the retailers’ ethical behaviour {{in the context of the}} buying process of products from suppliers, namely the numerous slotting fees imposed on the suppliers so that their products reach the store’s shelves, covering the supply chain’s path whose efficacy depends on the collaboration relationships between participants, who also confront with a series of legal and ethical constraints, the legal ones resulting, in general, from the competition legislation and the one concerning consumers protection. Romania has confirmed its positioning as an important market for the large <b>distribution</b> <b>chains.</b> The promoter of {{the development of}} retail networks has been the consumer behaviour, within the challenging framework of the relation between marketing’s impact on consumer and consumer’ impact on marketing strategies. At the moment, numerous well-known <b>distribution</b> <b>chains</b> are actively participating on the Romanian market. The necessity of building an ecosystem of conversation, based on interpersonal communication, is being emphasized, creating a shared experience, building trust and strengthening the relationships between the participants in the supply chain. This involves evaluating the relationship between Romanian producers and the large <b>distribution</b> <b>chains</b> and the impact of this relationship on the social welfare. retail market, producer-distributor-consumer partnership, large <b>distribution</b> <b>chains,</b> slotting fees, consumer welfare...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} robust {{inventory}} control for multiechelon <b>distribution</b> <b>chains</b> is addressed by using predictive control.

The resulting optimal decisions concern the delivery of goods in such a way to reduce the overall costs as to holding, transportation, and backlogs. As compared with previous works, the proposed approach allows one to deal with <b>distribution</b> <b>chains</b> of much larger dimension because of its intrinsic scalability. Of course, such an appreciable feature is paid in terms of loss of optimality. However, a convenient tradeoff can be achieved, as shown by means of simulations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose In {{order to}} improve the safety of seafood in the {{domestic}} seafood <b>distribution</b> <b>chains</b> (DSDCs) in Vietnam, {{a better understanding of}} current hygiene and practices compliance with government regulations is needed. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach Infrastructure conditions and documents related to hygiene procedures of 50 trading places were evaluated using checklists. The hygiene handling practices of 135 fish distributors were also observed by using notational analysis methods. This notational analysis method focused on actions related to microbiological contamination in terms of hand washing or glove changing and the cleaning and sanitising of tools and equipment. Additionally, microbiological quality of 135 samples of raw finfish at points along <b>distribution</b> <b>chains</b> was compared with national standards. Findings The results indicated that all trading places could be classified as non-compliant or seriously non-compliant with the regulations. The practices of fish distributors were also assessed to be at high risk for contamination of raw fish. The findings showed that approximately 42 and 39 percent of samples from fishing ports and fish markets, respectively were classified as unacceptable according to the microbiological standards of Vietnam. Research limitations/implications The present study is limited to research only from fish landing at fishing ports to the distribution to consumers at retail markets. Originality/value Recommendations for improving food safety in the DSDCs in Vietnam have been developed from {{the findings of this study}} and are provided. However, due to similarities with fish <b>distribution</b> <b>chains</b> in other countries, these recommendations may have broader application...|$|R
