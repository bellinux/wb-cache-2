5|$|On 10 September 2007, Licciardello rang a {{talkback}} {{radio station}} {{pretending to be}} someone else, and complained about the stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including Kerry O'Brien, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> made the call {{on the evening of}} the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E

Boelcke was not only a well-established ace, but was pioneering the tactics and strategy of fighter aviation. He had carte blanche to recruit such pilots as <b>he</b> <b>wished.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> asked for, among others, both Manfred von Richthofen and Böhme. Boelcke and Böhme became best friends.|$|E
25|$|Perceiving a {{means of}} revenge, Republican congressmen {{defeated}} Bush's proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and {{gave way to a}} sharp decrease in popularity. Bush would later say that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never signed the bill. Near the end of the 101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the capital gains tax, Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be {{a turning point in the}} Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.|$|E

25|$|In 1968, White wrote The Vivisector, {{a searing}} {{character}} portrait of an artist. Many people drew {{links to the}} Sydney painter John Passmore (1904–84) and White's friend, the painter Sidney Nolan, but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends Roy De Maistre and Francis Bacon, and later said <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been an artist. White's elaborate, idiosyncratic prose was a writer's attempt to emulate painting. By the mid-1960s, he had also become interested in encouraging dozens of young and less established artists, such as James Clifford, Erica McGilchrist, and Lawrence Daws. White was later friends with Brett Whiteley, the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was deceitful and pushy about selling his paintings. A portrait of White by Louis Kahan won the 1962 Archibald Prize.|$|E

That's because at least one resident—Abby Ewing—knows how to dish nasty with the best of them." [...] When asked which character <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> created, Mike Kelly, the creator of ABC's popular primetime-soap opera Revenge, said: [...] "Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world." [...] John Mapes of The Biography Channel said, [...] "Any great soap opera needs a great villain. While viewers may identify more with the protagonist, the villains in a serial drama always spice things up, cause trouble, and make it more fun to watch." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Dreams Old Men Dream" [...] was {{inspired}} by the Ingmar Bergman film Wild Strawberries and Fyodor Dostoyevskys short story The Dream of a Ridiculous Man. It tells the story of an elderly man reflecting back on the life he had and what <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done before. [...] "On the Night My Love Broke Through" [...] was the last song made for the album that was recorded live. It {{was inspired}} by the works of German-American poet Charles Bukowski. [...] "Relief" [...] is written {{from the perspective of a}} person that questions God's way of controlling the Earth and handling its inhabitants. God himself answers the person's question when Willett sings, [...] "Flash flood, you got too comfortable, so I showed you, who's really in control." [...] The overall sound of the track is described as electronica in the vein of [...] "mid-era Radiohead." [...] The album closer, [...] "Cryptomnesia", {{was inspired by}} a case involving Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov being accused of plagiarism involving his 1955 novel Lolita. Willett said that it is [...] "an apt word for the way history seeps into his songwriting today." ...|$|E
500|$|Abby {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Carolyn McGuire of The Chicago Tribune commented, [...] "Whoever shows {{up as the}} next villain, chances are {{his or her work}} won't be easy. That's because at least one resident—Abby Ewing—knows how to dish nasty with the best of them. Only Alexis Carrington Colby Dexter, played by Joan Collins on Dynasty, and Angela Channing, portrayed by Jane Wyman on [...] Falcon Crest, rival Abby Ewing, played by Donna Mills, for best prime-time female villain." [...] When asked which character <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> created, Mike Kelly, the creator of ABC's popular primetime-soap Revenge, said: [...] "Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world." [...] Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said, [...] "While I readily admit Alexis will go down in soap history as the most famous of the 80's primetime soap vixens, she was never truly my cup of detergent. I much preferred the more subdued, methodical villainy of characters like Abby Fairgate (Donna Mills), who slept her way through Seaview Circle, and to the top of Corporate California on Knots Landing. God I miss that damn Cul-de-Sac!" ...|$|E
500|$|Recurring {{characters}} who appear in [...] "Laryngitis" [...] are Kurt's father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), glee club members Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Brittany (Heather Morris), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton), school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) and AV club president Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink). Rizwan Manji plays Dr. Gidwani. Zack Weinstein guest stars as Sean Fretthold, {{a football player}} who was paralyzed below the upper chest after injuring his spinal cord at C4 in an accident, similar to the actor's injury in real life. Sean is the second wheelchair-using character to appear on Glee. In November 2009, the episode [...] "Wheels" [...] attracted criticism from disability advocates, who {{called attention to the}} fact that disabled character Artie Abrams is played by able-bodied actor Kevin McHale. Weinstein defended McHale's casting, opining that if he was the best auditioning actor for the role, then his ability to walk should be irrelevant. However, Weinstein also stated he [...] "would like to see wheelchair users given the chance to audition and be seriously considered for roles that aren't specifically written for someone with a disability." [...] Weinstein revealed that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> auditioned for the role of Artie, and that Glee was his favorite show. Around February 2010, Weinstein's agent got him an audition to play Sean, and within a week and a half, he learned he had got the part. Glee was Weinstein's first professional acting job. He called the twelve hours he spent filming his scenes [...] "twelve of the most important hours of [...] life".|$|E

While there {{he managed to get}} an acting job and an Equity card, but when he told the principal of RADA he needed a term off, the request was denied and he was expelled from the Academy after just a year. Fortunately, Owen landed a job with Cheek by Jowl and followed the theatre company on tour around the world performing Shakespeare plays.

5000|$|Hiaasen's novels often {{feature a}} {{recurring}} joke that radiology is a [...] "soft" [...] medical discipline, {{and those that}} practice it are not [...] "real" [...] doctors.

2500|$|Gordon {{often said}} that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been born a eunuch, which would suggest {{that he wanted to}} annihilate all of his sexual desires, indeed his {{sexuality}} altogether.

Faught argued that no-one at the time suspected Gordon of having sexual relations with the legions of teenage boys living with him at the Fort House, and the claim he was secretly having sex with the boys of the Fort House was first made by Lytton Strachey in his book Eminent Victorians, which Faught commented may have said more about Strachey than it did about Gordon.|$|E
2500|$|Moby-Dick; or, The Whale is a {{novel by}} American writer Herman Melville, {{published}} in 1851 {{during the period of}} the American Renaissance. Sailor Ishmael {{tells the story of the}} obsessive quest of Ahab, captain of the whaler Pequod, for revenge on Moby Dick, the white whale that on the previous whaling voyage bit off Ahab's leg at the knee. The novel was a commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, but during the 20th century, its reputation as a Great American Novel was established. William Faulkner confessed <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> written it himself, and D. H. Lawrence called it [...] "one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world", and [...] "the greatest book of the sea ever written". [...] "Call me Ishmael" [...] is among world literature's most famous opening sentences.|$|E
2500|$|RZA's {{production}} technique, {{specifically the}} manner of chopping up and/or speeding or slowing soul samples to fit his beats, has been picked up by currently popular producers, most notably Kanye West and Just Blaze, the two main producers behind Roc-A-Fella Records. West's own take on RZA's style briefly flooded the rap market with what was dubbed [...] "chipmunk soul", the pitch bending of a vocal sample to where it sounded as though the singer had inhaled helium. Several producers at the time copied the style, creating other offshoots. West has admitted that his style was distinctly influenced by RZA's production, and RZA has acknowledged his influence in an issue of Scratch magazine, saying <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> produced [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] and [...] "Breathe", two 2004 hits produced by Kanye West and Just Blaze, respectively.
