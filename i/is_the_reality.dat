Thought, he held, is that activity of mind which aims at truth, and the ultimate object of thought is full understanding of the Absolute. Such understanding comes about, in his view, through a grasp of necessity: to understand (or explain) something is to see it as necessitated within a system of which it is a part.|$|E
25|$|According to Ibn Arabi, Islam is {{the best}} {{religion}} because of Muhammad. Ibn Arabi regards that the first entity that was brought into existence <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> or essence of Muhammad (al-ḥaqīqa al-Muhammadiyya). Ibn Arabi regards Muhammad as the supreme human being and master of all creatures. Muhammad is therefore the primary role-model for human beings to aspire to emulate. Ibn Arabi believes that God's attributes and names are manifested {{in this world and}} that the most complete and perfect display of these divine attributes and names are seen in Muhammad. Ibn Arabi believes that one may see God in the mirror of Muhammad, meaning that the divine attributes of God are manifested through Muhammad. Ibn Arabi maintains that Muhammad {{is the best}} proof of God and by knowing Muhammad one knows God. Ibn Arabi also maintains that Muhammad is the master of all of humanity in both this world and the afterlife. In this view, Islam is the best religion, because Muhammad is Islam.|$|E

60|$|And {{this being}} the quality of Sir Isaac's mind, it {{followed}} that his interpretations {{of the relationship of}} marriage were simple and strict. A woman, he knew, had to be wooed to be won, but when she was won, she was won. He did not understand wooing after that was settled. There was the bargain and her surrender. He on his side had to keep her, dress her, be kind to her, give her the appearances of pride and authority, and in return he had his rights and his privileges and undefined powers of control. That you know, by the existing rules, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of marriage where there are no settlements and no private property of the wife's. That is to say, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of marriage in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred. And it would have shocked Sir Isaac extremely, {{and as a matter of}} fact it did shock him, for any one to suggest the slightest revision of so entirely advantageous an arrangement.

The conventional term “worry” which is also used as translation of kukkucca may not be clear either. When we say that we worry, it may not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of kukkucca but it may be thinking with aversion about an unpleasant object without there being kukkucca.

A sweated wage, long hours, industrial conscription, prohibition of strikes, prison for slackers, diminution of the already insufficient rations in factories where the production falls below what the authorities expect, an army of spies ready to report any tendency to political disaffection and to procure imprisonment for its promoters--this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of a system which still professes to govern {{in the name of the}} proletariat.|$|E
