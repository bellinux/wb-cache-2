40|$|We {{present a}} useful {{analytical}} method for designing grating-compensated dispersion-managed (DM) soliton systems for any desired input pulse widths and energies. The pulse-width and chirp evolution equations {{derived from the}} variational method are solved exactly to obtain the explicit analytical expressions {{for the length of}} the dispersion map and the grating dispersion. We also extend our analytical method to design grating-compensated DM soliton systems with loss and gain. We show that our analytically designed DM soliton systems also apply even if the chirped fiber gratings have group-delay ripples. The results obtained from our analytical method are in good agreement with those obtained from full numerical simulations. Finally a 160 -Gbits/s transmission system is simulated with all the important higher-order effects to show the effectiveness of our analytical design.

The final version is available from National Academy of Sciences via [URL] how dynamic molecular networks affect whole-organism physiology, analogous to mapping genotype to phenotype, remains a key challenge in biology. Quantitative models that represent processes at multiple scales and link understanding from several research domains can help to tackle this problem. Such integrated models are more common in crop science and ecophysiology than in the research communities that elucidate molecular networks. Several laboratories have modeled particular aspects of growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, but it was unclear whether these existing models could productively be combined. We test this approach by constructing a multiscale model of Arabidopsis rosette growth. Four existing models were integrated with minimal parameter modification (leaf water content and one flowering parameter used measured data). The resulting framework model links genetic regulation and biochemical dynamics to events at the organ and whole-plant levels, helping to understand the combined effects of endogenous and environmental regulators on Arabidopsis growth. The framework model was validated and tested with metabolic, physiological, and biomass data from two laboratories, for five photoperiods, three accessions, and a transgenic line, highlighting the plasticity of plant growth strategies. The model was extended to include stochastic development. Model simulations gave insight into the developmental control of leaf production and provided a quantitative explanation for the pleiotropic developmental phenotype caused by overexpression of miR 156, which was an open question. Modular, multiscale models, assembling knowledge from systems biology to ecophysiology, will help to understand and to engineer plant behavior from the genome to the field. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

We perform traditional scientific computing tasks (integration, steady state and closed orbit computation, and stability analysis) on such a drift component using a SSA simulation of the Cyclic Lotka-Volterra system as our illustrative example. The results of short bursts of appropriately initialized SSA simulations are used to fit local diffusion models using Ait-Sahalia's transition density expansions ait 2,aitECO,aitVEC in a maximum likelihood framework. These estimates are then coupled with standard numerical algorithms (such as Newton-Raphson or numerical integration routines) to help design subsequent SSA experiments.

Variants {{in the genes}} encoding complement factor H (CFH), complement component 3 (C 3) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS 2) have repeatedly been shown to confer significant risks for AMD; however, their role in disease progression and thus their potential relevance for interventional therapeutic approaches remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we analyzed association between variants in CFH, C 3 and ARMS 2 and disease progression of geographic atrophy (GA) due to AMD.

We replicated the association of I 62 V with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR; P= 0. 017) and creatinine clearance (CRCL; P= 0. 015). The minor allele of I 62 V (G) was deleterious: adding one copy of the G allele decreased GFR/CRCL by ~ 0. 98 ml min⁻¹ per 1. 73 m² (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 97, 0. 99).
