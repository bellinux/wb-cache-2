This leads to a discussion of the ordering of the <b>entries</b> <b>in</b> the perron vector, and so yields some insight into the Kendall Wei method for ranking players in a round robin competition. Finally, we characterize all matrices from this class such that the ordering of the <b>entries</b> <b>in</b> the perron vector coincides with the ordering of the <b>entries</b> <b>in</b> the score vector...|$|R
