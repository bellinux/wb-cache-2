5|$|While {{breaking}} {{was developing}} in New York, other styles of dance were developing in California. Unlike breaking, the funk styles—which {{originated in the}} 1970s in California—were not originally hip-hop dance styles: they were <b>danced</b> <b>to</b> funk music rather than hip-hop music, {{and they were not}} associated with the other cultural pillars of hip-hop (DJing, graffiti writing, and MCing). The funk styles are actually slightly older than breaking due to fact that boogaloo and locking were developed in the late 1960s.|$|E

The Locarno International Film Festival {{authorities}} published {{the rules of}} cricket before the film was screened to a crowd which reportedly <b>danced</b> <b>to</b> its soundtrack in the aisles. Lagaan was shown four times due to public demand as against the usual norm of showcasing films once at the festival. It subsequently won the Prix du Public award at the festival. After the film's publicity in Locarno, the director, Ashutosh Gowarikar said that distributors from Switzerland, Italy, France, Netherlands, North Africa, Finland and Germany were wanting to purchase the distribution rights. Special screenings were held in Russia, where people were keen to watch the film after its Oscar nomination.|$|E

Yuri was the next Girls' Generation member to become an S.M. trainee after coming second in the 2001 S.M. Youth Best Dancer competition. Yoona was cast the following year through the 2002 S.M. Saturday Open Casting Audition, where she sang and <b>danced</b> <b>to</b> her favorite singers, BoA and Britney Spears. Seohyun, the group's youngest member, was scouted in the subway by an S.M. scout; she then auditioned in 2003, singing children's songs.|$|E
5|$|Wild men or savages—usually {{depicted}} carrying staves or clubs, living {{beyond the}} bounds of civilization without shelter or fire, lacking feelings and souls—were then a metaphor for man without God. Common superstition held that long-haired wild men, known as lutins, who <b>danced</b> <b>to</b> firelight either to conjure demons or as part of fertility rituals, lived in mountainous areas such as the Pyrenees. In some village charivaris at harvest or planting time dancers dressed as wild men, to represent demons, were ceremonially captured and then an effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease evil spirits. The church, however, considered these rituals pagan and demonic.|$|E

25|$|Since bebop {{was meant}} to be listened to, not <b>danced</b> <b>to,</b> it could use faster tempos. Drumming shifted to a more elusive and {{explosive}} style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This led to a highly syncopated music with a linear rhythmic complexity.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{proposal}} of Mayor Yiannis Karousos, then President of the Ayia Napa Tourism Committee, on September 16, 2007, the world's longest chain of syrtaki dancers (a famous Greek dance) <b>danced</b> <b>to</b> Zorba the Greek in a successful attempt {{to enter the}} Guinness Book of World Records. The chain had a total of 268 members of eight groups dancing in step to Zorbas. Then Ayia Napa Mayor Antonis Tsokkos said {{the aim of the}} event was to send the message that the village was interested in Greek culture and to promote the tourist resort abroad. Head of the cultural services of the Municipality Maria Tofini said that according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the dancers had to perform in synchronised step for the attempt to qualify. The event drew the attention of tourists and locals, many of whom <b>danced</b> <b>to</b> Zorbas on the beach and in the sea.|$|E
