40|$|Recent {{advances}} in sensor technology provide {{new opportunities for}} applications that utilize the user's movement as an input source. This thesis focuses on movement analysis, which is a sub-area of a larger field concerned with the interpretation of sensor signals of human movement. Movement analysis {{can be used to}} provide feedback for training motor tasks, which is of interest for application areas such as rehabilitation, sports, and ergonomics. Consciously controllable, goal-directed movements, which we call primary movements, lead to slight movements {{in other parts of the}} body that are beyond conscious control (<b>secondary</b> <b>movements).</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>movements</b> are generated due to the mechanical interaction with the environment and physiological dependencies of the body. This thesis contributes methods to distinguish between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>movements.</b> This is necessary in order to provide high-quality feedback for motor tasks that show a significant amount of <b>secondary</b> <b>movement.</b> This can be the case when the <b>secondary</b> <b>movements</b> are large because of large reaction forces (e. g., when shooting a ball) or when the primary movements to execute the task are small (e. g., in various forms of handcraft or musical instrument performance). Furthermore, a precise distinction between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> can be necessary to check whether the user keeps a part of the body still (e. g., as required by a gymnastic exercise). Apart from sensor-based feedback, our results can also be used to improve current gesture recognition methods by ignoring <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> in the sensor signal to avoid that a <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> is misinterpreted as an execution of a gesture. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is shown in the context of pianist arm movements, which are particularly challenging to analyze. The distinction between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> in one joint of the arm is based on the measured movement in that particular joint, an estimation of key reaction force from MIDI data, and the movement in the other joints of the arm. In order to know on which arm the estimated key reaction force acts, it is necessary to determine which hand has played a note. For that purpose two methods are introduced: One method is based on MIDI; the other one uses data from inertial sensors in combination to MIDI. A third method based on Computer Vision, which was originally developed for sign language recognition, is evaluated here for tracking pianist hands. Based on the analysis methods, two pedagogical applications were developed: One application supports an existing piano pedagogical movement notation and checks whether the player's movement conforms to the indicated movement. A user study with piano students of a music university shows that potential users judge that the system is useful for the training of technique. The second application visualizes the sensor data and allows synchronizing different performances of the same piece, making it easy to spot differences where a closer examination may be beneficial...|$|R

The discrete movements’ initiation and termination were defined as the moment its (absolute) velocity exceeded versus fell below 0.1  cm/s, respectively.

50|$|Uninflected lexical {{signs in}} German Sign Language have at most two syllables. Syllables consist of two syllabic positions, {{described}} as Hold (H) and Movement (M). Holds consist of the handshape {{together with the}} hand orientation (together {{referred to as the}} hand configuration) at a specific location in signing space. Holds do not contain any change of location (movement from one location to another). Movements, on the other hand, involve a change of location and may involve <b>secondary</b> <b>movements</b> such as wiggling of the fingers. Syllables may then be grouped into the following types: M (the minimal syllable), HM, MH, HMH (the maximal syllable). In the case of HM syllables, for example, the hand configuration of the Movement moves away from the location of the Hold. A syllable of type M can consist of the following specifications: a path movement (from one location to another), a path <b>movement</b> with <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> (such as wiggling or twisting), or a <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> without path movement. The syllable type H (a segment without a Movement) is not allowed for phonotactical reasons.|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground: Measurement {{of changes}} in human information-processing {{capacities}} underlying slowing of sensorimotor processes is an important challenge for aging research. Methods exist to estimate the magnitude of slowing and variability coefficients, but attempts to apply them in motor tasks have been scarce. In the present experiment we combined movement kinematic analysis, efficiency functions and Brinley plot to assess age-related slowing and variability of sensorimotor processes in a discrete Fitts' aiming task. Objectives: (1) Quantifying slowing and variability for the different sensorimotor processes involved in aiming movements, and (2) determining whether changes occurred continuously over time by comparing different age groups. Methods: 29 participants (24 - 90 years) divided into four age groups were tested. Target size manipulation resulted in three levels of difficulty. Total movement time, durations {{of the first and}} <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> phases and related variability were analyzed. Fitts and Brinley regression functions were calculated {{on the basis of the}} different movement variables. Results: Only older participants were slower than the three younger age groups. For this group, age-difficulty effect was observed for total movement times, but analyses showed that only the <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> phase slowed multiplicatively. Additive and proportional increases in variability were also observed in older participants for the first and <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> phases, respectively. For the <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> phase, estimated slowing coefficients were comparable to those reported in cognitive literature. In addition, Brinley analyses showed that variability increased more than movement time in the <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> phase. Discussion: Combination of the different methods of analysis allowed a precise assessment of the locus of slowing and variability of sensorimotor processes in the different movement phases. Results showed that significant changes in both slowing and variability of the different processes occurred late in life. Our findings also suggest that slowing could result from age-induced increase in noise produced by the neural system. Finally, the present results raise the question of whether age-related slowing and increase in variability observed in both cognitive and sensorimotor domains share common causes in the central nervous system.

40|$|Theories of A′-movement can be {{classified}} {{on the basis of}} how they relate primary movement (movement to the final scope position) to <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> (intermediate movement). The standard view maintains that primary <b>movement</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> are motivated and triggered by different grammatical factors. For instance, it can be assumed that primary movement is what ultimately drives syntactic operations while secondary operations have a supporting auxiliary role and serve as a partial implementation of primary movement. Some recent hypotheses, such as Chomsky’s edge feature (EF) hypothesis, have opened up the possibility of narrowing the gap between these two operations. Here we argue on the basis of Finnish wh-movement that there is no difference between primary and secondary A′-movement; they have exactly the same triggers and constraints, in addition to having other properties in common.

40|$|Abstract Three {{individuals}} {{lacking a}} corpus callosum, two due to callosotomy and one agenesis, and three age-matched healthy controls were tested on a bimanual task {{in which a}} discrete or rhythmic arm movement was ini-tiated following a visual signal while the other arm produced continuous, rhythmic movements. The control participants initiated the secondary, rhythmic move-ment in phase with the ongoing rhythmic base move-ment and the two limbs were coupled in an inphase mode across {{the duration of the}} trial. In contrast, the acallosal individuals failed to show phase entrainment at the ini-tiation of the <b>secondary,</b> rhythmic <b>movements.</b> More-over, the callosotomy patients exhibited weak coupling between the rhythmically moving limbs while the indi-vidual with callosal agenesis consistently synchronized in an antiphase mode. The control participants exhibited increased perturbation of the ongoing base movement when initiating a discrete movement; for the acallosal participants, the base movement was similarly perturbed in both <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> conditions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that intermanual interactions observed during bimanual movements arise from various levels of control, and that these are distinct for discrete and rhythmic movements. Temporal cou-pling during rhythmic movements arises in large part from transcallosal interactions between the two hemi-spheres. The imposition of a <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> may transiently disrupt an ongoing rhythmic movement {{even in the absence of}} the corpus callosum. This may reflect subcortical interactions associated with response initia-tion, or, due to dual task demands, a transient shift in attentional resources...|$|R

The residues situated in reentrant regions are significantly smaller on average compared to other regions and reentrant regions can be detected in the inter-transmembrane loops with an accuracy of ∼ 70 % based on their amino acid composition.
