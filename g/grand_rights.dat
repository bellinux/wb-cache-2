50|$|<b>Grand</b> <b>rights</b> are the permissions {{necessary}} to stage an opera, play with music, or {{a work of}} musical theater. Performance rights organizations such as BMI and ASCAP do not license <b>grand</b> <b>rights</b> in the United States. <b>Grand</b> <b>rights</b> must be negotiated between the producer of a production and the publishers and owners of the copyright of the work. Typically a royalty will {{be paid to the}} publishers and owners of a work in exchange for the permission and right to stage the work.|$|E
50|$|Pulse Entertainment and Distribution, {{under the}} {{direction}} of CEO Ron Layton, bought the <b>grand</b> <b>rights</b> to The Magic 7 in 1995 with the intention of fully producing the animation. Songwriter Robert J. Sherman was hired to write additional songs for the film. Sherman also wrote a treatment using the already recorded voices in a revised script. However, insufficient funds were raised and the project was eventually shelved until the early 2000s, when interest was reignited in it.|$|E

50|$|If a book {{involved}} is a play, {{it might be}} dramatized. The right to dramatize is a separate right - known as a grand right. This income is shared by the many personalities and organizations who come together to offer the play: the playwright, composer of the music played, producer, director of the play and so forth. There is no convention to the royalties paid for <b>grand</b> <b>rights</b> and it is freely negotiated between the publisher and the mentioned participants.|$|E
50|$|After {{obtaining a}} law degree and working as an unpaid intern, Heinsheimer was hired at age 23 by the <b>grand</b> <b>rights</b> (staged works) {{division}} of Viennese music publisher Universal Edition, eventually becoming head of the opera department. There he supported composers Alban Berg and Leoš Janáček and wrote many articles for the music periodical Anbruch ("Dawn") about issues {{in the music industry}} and the sociology of music. He was the force behind Universal's hugely popular successes in the 1920s: Jaromír Weinberger's opera Schwanda the Bagpiper and Ernst Krenek's Jonny spielt auf. He also dabbled as a stage director, including productions of Kurt Weill's Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2016, Dweezil Zappa {{announced}} that he would be changing the name of the band to Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa, in response to a cease-and-desist order by the Zappa Family Trust, which represents Zappa's estate. Following the October 2015 death of Gail Zappa, control of the trust was taken over by his siblings Ahmet and Diva Zappa, with Ahmet handling day-to-day operations. The trust holds a trademark on the name [...] "Zappa Plays Zappa", which Dweezil had already licensed from Gail for an [...] "exorbitant" [...] fee; despite this, the Trust ordered Dweezil to cease using the trademark. The Trust also argued that his shows were a [...] "dramatic work", thus ineligible for the blanket compulsory license for live performance venues as specified in section 115 of United States copyright law, and requiring Dweezil to negotiate [...] "grand rights" [...] directly from the trust or be liable for copyright infringement. Ahmet argued that he was not trying to inhibit his ability to tour under his father's name, but wanted to ensure that Zappa Plays Zappa would be [...] "in accordance with the family trust". A lawyer interviewed by The New York Times disagreed with this theory, arguing that the concept of <b>grand</b> <b>rights</b> is intended primarily for works such as stage musicals, and that a concert by a cover band was not a [...] "dramatic work".|$|E

5000|$|Paul Jones is {{the name}} used {{for a number of}} mixer dances that were popular {{in the first quarter of}} the 20th century but {{continue}} to be used in traditional dance settings to the present day. One common variation is as follows. At the signal of the caller (who may also be called by other names, such as [...] "prompter", [...] "cuer", or [...] "Master of Ceremonies"), all dancers join their hands to form a circle (or several concentric ones, if crowded), with women being to the right of their partners. At the second signal of the caller, the dancers repeatedly do the <b>Grand</b> <b>Right</b> and Left move, well known in square dancing. As a result, the women move to the left (clockwise) along the circle, while gentlemen move to the right. At the third signal, dancers dance with the partner whose hand they are holding at the moment. This [...] "third signal" [...] is traditionally the shouted words [...] "Paul Jones", but a whistle or other device can be substituted. This procedure may be repeated [...] "as the master deems it advisable".|$|R
