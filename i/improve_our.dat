25|$|Facilitation is a {{significant}} ecological process that produces community-level effects through individual interactions. By improving dispersal, increasing access to resources, and providing protection from stress, predation, and competition, facilitation can impact community structure, diversity, and invasibility. Incorporation of facilitation into such classic theories as natural selection and niche separation should be a goal of current and future ecologists. This will require further research into the mechanisms of facilitation {{at the level of}} individuals, and the impacts of facilitation at the level of population, community, and ecosystem. Continued study of positive species interactions will serve to <b>improve</b> <b>our</b> understanding of processes and application of theories.|$|E
25|$|It is thus an {{extremely}} early {{witness to the}} reception of al-Tabari's text-indeed much earlier than the sources that are customarily pressed into service to <b>improve</b> <b>our</b> understanding of the Ta'rikh al-rusul wa-l-muluk, e.g., Miskawayh, Ibn 'Asakir, Ibn al-Athir, and Ibn Khallikan. Second, since al-Azdi was writing in the decades following al-Tabari, his Ta'rikh can {{say something about the}} reception of al-Tabari's Ta'rikh among those who immediately followed the great master. That al-Tabari's history was immensely significant we can all agree; but as to precisely how he became so significant there is no clear consensus.8 Third-and returning to Forand's insight-al-Azdi frequently drew on the same authorities tapped by al-Tabari, but whose works are for the most part now lost, such as Abu Ma'shar (170/786), Abu Mikhnaf (157/774), al-Haytham ibn 'Adi (207/822), al-Mada'ini (around 228/843), and 'Umar ibn Shabba (262/878).|$|E

The objectives for the proposed academy was to raise the profile of Australian film and television in Australia and abroad, and to change the way it rewards talent by mimicking the methods used in foreign film organisations, such as Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) and British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). The voting system would change through {{the establishment of an}} [...] "Honorary Council", which will govern fifteen chapters composed of professionals from industry guilds and organisations including actors, directors, producers and screenwriters.

On 23 January 2009 during an event at Speakers' Corner, the National Solidarity Party gave its views on the national budget one day after it was announced, criticizing the Government for not doing enough to assist unemployed breadwinners during the recession. The Party's secretary-general, Ken Sunn, said the event was to let Singaporeans [...] "participate, speak and hear various views and opinions on the Singapore Government's 2009 Budget statement, and discuss ways to <b>improve</b> <b>our</b> Singapore Economy".

500|$|The Economist welcomed The Great Stagnation as [...] "an {{important}} [...] {{that will}} have a profound impact on the way people think about the last thirty years". It praised [...] "the trains of thought it suggests" [...] and [...] said the book merited [...] "a rigorous debate" [...] which should encourage different policy choices across the political spectrum. Matthew Yglesias described the book as a [...] "bravua performance from {{one of the most interesting}} thinkers out there". Though he said it was remarkably silent on intellectual property law and the implications for society of a world in which most of the increase in output comes from catch-up growth from poor countries. The Wall Street Journal described the book as Cowen's most impactful book due to the direction in which he leads the debate. [...] "What is exciting is to imagine students, economists, and scientists across the country reading the book, coming to terms with the depth of our challenge and pursuing new ways of trying to 'fix' things or generally <b>improve</b> <b>our</b> lot." [...] "A small book but a big, worthwhile question", concluded The Economist. In the New York Times, David Brooks praised The Great Stagnation as [...] "the most debated non-fiction book so far this year", which Timothy Noah described as a great favor to the book's marketing though an exaggeration considering the discussion surrounding Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua.|$|E
