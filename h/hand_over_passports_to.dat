5000|$|In 1903, {{a charter}} {{regarding}} passports specified that foreigners arriving in Russia would receive their entry passport {{for a period}} of one year with the place of residence specified. Foreigners living in large cities were required <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> their <b>passports</b> <b>to</b> a police office. From there passports, after being checked, were sent to special boards as before.|$|R
5000|$|... Britains Foreign Office {{believes}} that the passports used were fraudulent; one report {{indicated that they had}} issued the passports in January, 2010, the only difference between the actual identities being the photographs. The Telegraph reported on 20 February that diplomatic sources say that the passport fraud was carried out by Israeli immigration officials. It is claimed that the dual Israeli-British citizens had their passports taken from them as they passed through the airport in Tel Aviv - the details on the documents were recorded (and they were most likely photocopied), and then used to create new documents. These new documents sported the pictures of the suspects, but used the names and numbers of those whose identities were stolen. As a result of an investigation by the British Serious Organised Crime Agency, the government concluded that there were [...] "compelling evidence to believe that Israel was responsible for the misuse of the British passports." [...] The British Foreign Secretary David Miliband expelled a senior Israeli diplomat, who was thought to be the Mossads station commander in the country. Britain also issued a warning <b>to</b> UK <b>passport</b> holders traveling <b>to</b> Israel to [...] "only <b>hand</b> your <b>passport</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> third parties including Israeli officials when absolutely necessary". Israel had already used fake British <b>passports</b> <b>to</b> conduct an operation in 1987.|$|R
25|$|The {{recruitment}} {{process of}} a migrant domestic worker into Lebanon is conducted by sponsorship. The worker has {{to receive an}} invitation before being granted a working permit to enter the country. The invitation comes through a recruiting agency either by use of the services of {{their counterparts in the}} worker’s country of origin or directly from the agency itself and sometimes at the request of an individual employer. First, the Ministry of Labour issues preliminary work authorization to migrant domestic workers. In 2010, the Ministry of Labour issued and approximate 118,000 work permits to migrant domestic Workers. Next, the Ministry of Interior issues entry visas through the General Directorate for General Security. Then the General Directorate of General Security authorizes the legal entry of migrant domestic workers and arranges work permission and residence when they arrived in the country. Lastly, the sponsor’s name is located on the migrant domestic worker's entry visa, residence and work permit. The visa is for a three-month period {{and the name of the}} sponsor is included in the passport. When the migrant domestic worker arrives at the airport they are subjected to an immigration routine which includes the <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> of their <b>passports</b> <b>to</b> the Lebanese General Security in order to process the papers, while the migrant domestic worker waits to be collected by their sponsor. After this, the sponsor brings the migrant domestic worker to a local agency for a basic medical checkup.|$|R

5000|$|In Jun 1940, Germany ordered {{changes in}} the Slovak {{government}} which strengthen position of radicals and accelerated solution of the [...] "Jewish issue". On September 3, 1940 Esterházy voted for the constitutional act which entitled the government to [...] "take every measures necessary for {{the exclusion of the}} Jews from the Slovak economic and social life and to transfer the property of the Jews into the ownership of the Christians". [...] Shortly after adoption of this law, several antisemitic regulations were issued during the same month. Jews lost right to drive motor vehicles, they had <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> <b>passports</b> (lost last chance to emigrate) and the government created central organization for all Jews (Ústredňa Židov). Until September 16, Jews had to deliver inventory of their property. Also in this situation, Esterázy publicly agreed with government antisemitic policy and attacked Jews in the assembly. In his speech from October 8, 1940, he welcomed special categorization of Jews during incoming cenzus and declared that [...] "Hungarian salesmen over decades and centuries were suffering as much from Jews and Jewish frauds as the Slovak were". On the other hand, he protested against harming Hungarians under the cover of [...] "the legitimate fight against Jews". He also positively evaluated [...] "real and fast measures" [...] against Jews to retire them from the economic life.|$|R

When he reaches the front, he <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> his <b>passport</b> for inspection. The man inspecting it finds something wrong with the papers and calls the guards on Patton, who tries to get away and is pinned to the floor at gunpoint and arrested. The video then shows still images set earlier in the day, highlighting previously unseen details that point to Patton being a criminal.|$|R
5000|$|The World Service Authority {{promotes}} the World Passport {{not just as}} a document for international travel, but a [...] "neutral, apolitical document of identity". Investor Doug Casey, himself a World Passport customer, has suggested that a World Passport is useful at hotels and other non-governmental institutions where security is uncertain; if one is asked <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> one's real <b>passport</b> in such situations, one can provide the World Passport instead of a national passport. Governmental authorities do not share this assessment.|$|R

District Attorney Jose Ayu Prado announced in October 2010 that there was sufficient evidence to charge Pérez Balladares with money laundering. A preliminary hearing on the case was held on April 11, 2011, and the case was dismissed by the judge two weeks later. In December 2012, Ayu Prado was nominated to the Supreme Court. Perez Balladares stated via Twitter that the appointment was a trade for having persecuted him.|$|R
50|$|On March 9, Cisneros was {{released}} from jail on a US$300,000 bond. The court decided {{to side with the}} defense after they concluded that Cisneros would not attempt to flee before the trial. The defense stated that she never failed to appear in court in the 1994 trial even when she was facing a possible death penalty. In addition, they stated that she was a long-time resident of Brownsville and had no previous criminal history. They stated that Cisneros was aware of an FBI investigation and possibly a new indictment against her, but she decided not to flee, thus justifying her bond. Court officials imposed certain restrictions on her freedom, however. They asked her <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> her U.S. <b>passport</b> and <b>to</b> limit her travel to the Brownsville and McAllen, Texas judicial districts.

500|$|On March 2, {{the defense}} argued {{in court that}} Cisneros should be set free on bond during the trial {{because she did not}} pose a flight risk as {{demonstrated}} by her actions during the first trial.

5000|$|An IAAF taskforce {{chaired by}} Rune Andersen {{published}} an interim report in April 2017. President Sebastian Coe stated, [...] "There is testing {{but it is}} still far too limited. The Russian investigative committee is still refusing <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> athlete biological <b>passport</b> samples for independent testing from labs, we still have got athletes in closed cities that are difficult or impossible to get to, the ongoing employment of coaches from a tainted system, and we have got the head coach of RUSAF effectively refusing to sign their own pledge to clean athletics." [...] The report also noted the case of whistleblower Andrei Dmitriev, who had fled Russia after being threatened with imprisonment. Coe said, [...] "Anyone with information about a system which has failed to protect the goals and aspirations of clean athletes must feel it is safe to speak out." [...] Andersen questioned the selection of Yelena Isinbayeva, who had called for whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova to be [...] "banned for life", as the chair of RUSADA's supervisory board. Andersen stated, [...] "It is difficult to see how this helps to achieve the desired change in culture in track and field, or how it helps to promote an open environment for Russian whistleblowers", noting that Isinbayeva had called a WADA report [...] "groundless" [...] without reading it, publicly criticised whistleblowers (Dmitriev and the Stepanovs), and had not signed a pledge for clean sport or endorsed a Russian anti-doping group.|$|R
