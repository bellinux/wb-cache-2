50|$|One {{capability}} of the Mini Nimbus is its powerful trailing-edge integrated air brake/flap system with a 70 kn terminal <b>dive</b> <b>velocity</b> which gives the aircraft strong short field and steep landing approach capabilities.|$|R
50|$|The 1-34 has the {{originally}} specified terminal <b>velocity</b> <b>dive</b> brakes, {{that limit}} the glider to below redline speeds in a vertical dive. Developing and testing these proved expensive and time-consuming and this also extended the aircraft's development time.|$|R
50|$|The Standard Libelle (H-201) is {{of similar}} glassfibre {{construction}} to the H-301 Libelle. The changes required consisted of removing the flaps and tail braking parachute, fitting a fixed, instead of retractable, monowheel {{and raising the}} height of the canopy. A new Wortmann wing section was featured and terminal <b>velocity</b> <b>dive</b> brakes were fitted.|$|R
25|$|The F-11 Tiger {{is noted}} {{for being the}} first jet {{aircraft}} to shoot itself down. On 21 September 1956, during a test-firing of its 20mm (.79in) cannons, pilot Tom Attridge fired two bursts midway through a shallow <b>dive.</b> As the <b>velocity</b> and trajectory of the cannon rounds decayed, they ultimately crossed paths with the Tiger as it continued its descent, disabling it and forcing Attridge to crash-land the aircraft; he survived.|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} charts are given showing the {{relation}} between time, velocities, and altitude for airplanes having various terminal <b>velocities</b> <b>diving</b> in a standard atmosphere. The range of starting altitudes is from 8, 000 to 32, 000 feet, and the terminal velocities vary from 150 to 550 miles per hour. A comparison is made between an experimental case and the results obtained from the charts. Examples pointing out {{the use of the}} charts are included...|$|R

50|$|The 1-34 was {{designed}} {{over several years}} to spread out the development costs. At the time the design work on the aircraft was started the Standard Class was new and described a very simple aircraft with terminal <b>velocity</b> <b>dive</b> brakes, fixed landing gear and no water ballast. By the time the 1-34 had flown in 1969 the Standard Class rules had changed to allow essentially unrestricted sailplanes with a 15-metre (49.2 feet) wingspan.|$|R
2500|$|The {{separation}} of the empennage from the Constellation resulted in immediate loss of control, causing the aircraft to enter a near-vertical, terminal <b>velocity</b> <b>dive.</b> Plunging into the Grand Canyon at an estimated speed of more than 477mph (...) , the Constellation slammed into the north slope of a ravine located on the northeast slope of Temple Butte and disintegrated on impact, instantly killing all aboard. An intense fire, fueled by aviation gasoline, ensued. The severed empennage, badly battered but still somewhat recognizable, came to rest nearby.|$|R
50|$|The PF-1 is {{of mixed}} construction. The {{fuselage}} is {{a glass and}} foam sandwich, while the wings are from a Schleicher Ka 8 and thus have spruce spars covered in birch plywood and doped aircraft fabric covering. The wing employs a NACA 64-415 airfoil and has terminal <b>velocity</b> <b>dive</b> brakes {{on the top and}} bottom surfaces. The tow hook is mounted on the aircraft's center of gravity. The landing gear is a fixed and faired monowheel. The cockpit features a reclined pilot position and a side-stick.|$|R
50|$|The {{separation}} of the empennage from the Constellation resulted in immediate loss of control and the aircraft went into a nearly vertical, terminal <b>velocity</b> <b>dive.</b> Plunging into the Grand Canyon at an estimated speed of more than 477 mph (700 ft/s), the Constellation slammed into the north slope of a ravine located on the northeast slope of Temple Butte and disintegrated on impact, instantly killing Captain Gandy, {{and all of the}} passengers and crew. An intense fire, fueled by aviation gasoline, ensued. The severed empennage, badly battered but still somewhat recognizable, came to rest nearby.|$|R
50|$|The Phoenix {{has several}} {{guidance}} modes and achieves its longest range by using mid-course updates from the F-14A/B AWG-9 radar (APG-71 radar in the F-14D) as it climbs to cruise between 80000 ft and 100000 ft {{at close to}} Mach 5. Phoenix uses this high altitude to gain gravitational potential energy, which is later converted into kinetic energy as the missile <b>dives</b> at high <b>velocity</b> towards its target. At around 11 mi from the target, the missile activates its own radar to provide terminal guidance. Minimum engagement range for the Phoenix is around 2 nmi km and active homing would initiate upon launch.|$|R
50|$|Air brakes: Air brakes, {{also known}} as dive brakes, are devices whose primary purpose is to {{increase}} drag. On gliders, the spoilers act as air brakes. They are positioned {{on top of the}} wing and below the wing also. When slightly opened the upper brakes will spoil the lift, but when fully opened will present a large surface and so can provide significant drag. Some gliders have terminal <b>velocity</b> <b>dive</b> brakes, which provide enough drag to keep its speed below maximum permitted speed, even if the glider were pointing straight down. This capability is considered a safer way to descend without instruments through cloud than the only alternative which is an intentional spin.|$|R
50|$|Summers {{experienced}} {{a number of}} accidents and crashes during his career. During a test flight on the first dual Gloster Grebe, the aircraft spun flat to within 150 ft of the ground, coming out completely stalled with full engine. In a terminal <b>velocity</b> <b>dive</b> in the Hawker Hawfinch, a fuselage bay collapsed at about t.v. speed; the anchorage for the Sutton harness was in the tail and this pulled him back and nearly broke his neck. While testing the first Bulldog Summers spun down from 10000 to 2000 ft, having tried to abandon the machine at 4000 ft. He had released his harness {{and was on the}} centre section when the machine stopped rotating and went into a dive, enabling him to regain control by pushing the stick with his foot. Thereupon he climbed back into the cockpit and landed.|$|R
2500|$|After {{its first}} flight, the Curlew {{successfully}} completed its initial trials, {{which include a}} terminal <b>velocity</b> <b>dive</b> at 305mph (491km/h) and a maximum loaded weight producing a wing loading of 14lb/sq ft (68kg/m2). [...] Landing speed with flaps down was 38mph (61km/h). [...] The machine was advertised as suitable for other engines up to powers of 130hp (97kW) and the de Havilland Gipsy Major was specifically mentioned. [...] Though Cole had by this time withdrawn his financial support, things {{for a short while}} looked bright for CLW, with talk of an Australian order for 50 Curlews, but they were over extended and went bankrupt. [...] The sole Curlew, registered G-ADYU and built at a cost of £10,000 went to Essex Aero Ltd, also of Gravesend, in the asset sale. [...] It then went to Martlesham Heath and gained its Certificate of Airworthiness on 19 November 1936. It seems to have done little flying after that. [...] Stored during the war, it was broken up in 1948.|$|R
40|$|The {{complications}} in anisotropic multi-parameter inversion lie in {{the trade-off}} between the different anisotropy parameters. We compute the tomographic waveform sensitivity kernels for a VTI acoustic medium perturbation {{as a tool to}} investigate this ambiguity between the different parameters. We use dynamic ray tracing to efficiently handle the expensive computational cost for 3 -D anisotropic models. Ray tracing provides also the ray direction information necessary for conditioning the sensitivity kernels to handle anisotropy. The NMO velocity and η parameter kernels showed a maximum sensitivity for diving waves which results in a relevant choice of those parameters in wave equation tomography. The δ parameter kernel showed zero sensitivity; therefore it can serve as a secondary parameter to fit the amplitude in the acoustic anisotropic inversion. Considering the limited penetration depth of <b>diving</b> waves, migration <b>velocity</b> analysis based kernels are introduced to fix the depth ambiguity with reflections and compute sensitivity maps in the deeper parts of the model...|$|R
40|$|A {{questionnaire}} survey was distributed to 2, 135 Costal Fisheries Cooperative Associations (CFCA) in 1986 - 87 to obtain updated informations on diving fishers in Japan. Out of 2, 135 CFCAs, 764 were conducting diving fishery. The number of male diving fishers was 12, 264 {{and that of}} female was 3, 037. The breath-hold divers made 63. 6 % of all diving-fishing divers. The fishers in their forties occupied 30. 1 %, indicating that the average age was getting higher {{and they were in}} want of successors. The energetics of diving-fishers were measured using two types of diving data loggers, one developed by Henderson et al, and the other by Vine Bionic Systems. Both loggers have the same operational characteristics. The subjects were 4 unassisted divers (Cachido-Ama) who wore wet suits and swim fins, and 9 assisted divers (Funado-Ama). The depth and R-R intervals were recorded every second, and total time in water, total diving time, total surface time, total number of dives per day, average depth of single dive, average deepest dive, average single dive time, average longest <b>dive,</b> descent <b>velocity,</b> ascent velocity, descent time, ascent time and bottom time per dive were calculated. The average diving duration time and depth in Cachido-Ama were 37. 0 ± 0. 4 sec and 6. 9 ± 0. 1 m and in Funado-Ama 68. 5 ± 4. 3 sec and 9. 7 ± 0. 5 m, respectively. Total diving time was 63 ± 12 min in Cachido-Ama and 26 ± 2 min in Funado-Ama. But total bottom time in Funado-Ama was 45. 0 sec much longer than in Cachido-Ama. Funado-Ama was thought to be more profitable for underwater fishing...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} a dry-land resistance training program in Paralympic swimmers to increase swimming power and strength measures, and how these changes affect swimming performance. Seven elite-level Paralympic swimmers (1 male and 6 female; age 19. 4 +/- 6. 5 y; body mass 57 +/- 12 kg; height: 1. 66 +/- 0. 21 m) performed a 6 -week coach-prescribed strength training intervention program designed to improve power, flexibility and postural control. Exercises targeted the main swimming movements: the start and turn, postural control in the water, and the pull and kick focusing on the gluteals, upper body and trunk. Swimming-specific tests, involving a 50 -m time trial, and timed dive starts were conducted at baseline and after the 6 -week program. A bilateral swim-bench ergometer and jump tests were conducted to quantify arm and leg strength and power. Following the 6 -week intervention, 50 -m time trials improved by 1. 2 %, +/- 1. 5 % (mean, +/- 90 % confidence limits). Increases in both mean power (6. 1 %, +/- 5. 9 %) and acceleration (3. 7 %, +/- 3. 7 %) generated during the dive start enabled swimmers to substantially improve start times to the 5 -m (5. 5 %, +/- 3. 2) and 15 -m (1. 8 %, +/- 1. 1 %) marks. The resistance training intervention resulted in a very large (r= 0. 78, +/- 0. 37) correlation between <b>dive</b> start <b>velocity</b> and the counter movement jump mean velocity. The 6 -week resistance training program for Paralympic swimmers yielded substantial improvements in dry-land measures that corresponded with improvements in both timed dive starts and 50 -m time trial performance, thus highlighting the usefulness of dry-land training for enhancing swimming performance in Paralympic swimming...|$|R
