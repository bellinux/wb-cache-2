5|$|Fruit is rich {{in sugar}} but {{deficient}} in other nutrients, {{so it must be}} eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> problem.|$|E
5|$|In {{the board}} (and card) game domain, 4X <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{distinct}} genre, {{in part because}} of the practical constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non-player entities, it tends to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games.|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{behavior}} <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concern when bupropion is {{prescribed for}} smoking cessation. According to a 2014 Cochrane review, {{while there is}} an association with suicide it is unclear if bupropion was the cause. In 2016 the FDA removed the black box warning about psychiatric problems when used for stopping smoking.|$|E

5|$|In 1883 Blackburn Olympic, a team {{composed}} {{mainly of}} factory workers, {{became the first}} Northern team to win the FA Cup, {{and the next year}} Preston North End won an FA Cup match against London-based Upton Park. Upton Park protested that Preston had broken FA rules by paying their players. In response, Preston withdrew from the competition and fellow Lancashire clubs Burnley and Great Lever followed suit. The protest gathered momentum to the point where more than 30 clubs, predominantly from the North, announced that they would set up a rival British Football Association if the FA did not permit professionalism. A schism was avoided in July 1885 when professionalism was formally legalised in English football. The Football League was founded in 1888, and marked its independence from the London-based Football Association by establishing headquarters in Preston – the League retained a Northern identity even after it accepted several Southern teams into its ranks. Intense local derbies between neighbouring teams mean that there <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> North–South rivalry than in some other sports.|$|E
5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing {{the rate at which}} fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E

25|$|BT {{tends to}} be more relaxed and {{spontaneous}} than American morning shows. Unlike American morning shows, it does not have pre-taped segments that are focused on current events or socio-political issues.

25|$|C. vicina plays a {{major role}} in corpse {{colonization}} during the winter months, with less of a presence during the warmer months when temperature <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> constraint. This fly has a lower threshold temperature for flight activity than other blow-flies, allowing for greater prevalence during colder periods. This period of activity must be considered when evaluating the presence or absence of this fly.|$|E

25|$|Cold brewing {{has some}} {{disadvantages}} compared to hot steeping. Firstly, if the leaves or source water contain unwanted bacteria, they may flourish, whereas using hot water has {{the benefit of}} killing most bacteria. This <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concern in modern times and developed regions. Secondly, cold brewing may allow for less caffeine to be extracted, {{which may or may}} not be desired.|$|E
25|$|The Pearson {{correlation}} is +1 in {{the case}} of a perfect direct (increasing) linear relationship (correlation), −1 {{in the case}} of a perfect decreasing (inverse) linear relationship (anticorrelation), and some value in the open interval (−1, 1) in all other cases, indicating the degree of linear dependence between the variables. As it approaches zero there <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relationship (closer to uncorrelated). The closer the coefficient is to either −1 or 1, the stronger the correlation between the variables.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} {{insufficient}} evidence to classify nicotine as a carcinogen, {{there is an}} ongoing debate about whether it functions as a tumor promoter. In vitro studies have associated it with cancer, but carcinogenicity has not been demonstrated in vivo. There is inadequate research to demonstrate that nicotine is associated with cancer in humans, but there is evidence indicating possible oral, esophageal, or pancreatic cancer risks. Nicotine {{in the form of}} nicotine replacement products <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cancer risk than smoking. Nicotine replacement products have not been shown to be associated with cancer in the real world.|$|E

25|$|As a {{tactical}} weapon for military use, {{a significant problem}} with a BW attack {{is that it would}} take days to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force. Some biological agents (smallpox, pneumonic plague) have the capability of person-to-person transmission via aerosolized respiratory droplets. This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces. While containment of BW <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concern for certain criminal or terrorist organizations, it remains a significant concern for the military and civilian populations of virtually all nations.|$|E
25|$|Beyond addiction, both {{short and}} {{long-term}} nicotine exposure have not been established as dangerous to adults, except among certain vulnerable groups. At high-enough doses, nicotine is associated with poisonings and is potentially lethal. Nicotine {{as a tool for}} quitting smoking has a good safety history. There is inadequate research to show that nicotine itself is associated with cancer in humans. Nicotine in the form of nicotine replacement products <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cancer risk than smoking. Nicotine is linked to possible birth defects. During pregnancy, there are risks to the child later in life for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility. The use of electronic cigarettes, which are designed to be refilled with nicotine-containing e-liquid, has raised concerns over nicotine overdoses, especially with regard to the possibility of young children ingesting the liquids.|$|E
25|$|Diving helmet squeeze: Helmet squeeze {{will occur}} if the gas supply hose is severed above the diver and the {{non-return}} valve at the helmet gas inlet fails {{or is not}} fitted. Severity {{will depend on the}} hydrostatic pressure difference. A very rapid descent, usually by accident, may exceed {{the rate at which the}} breathing gas supply can equalise the pressure causing a temporary squeeze. The introduction of the non-return valve and high maximum gas supply flow rates have all but eliminated both these risks. In helmets fitted with a neck dam, the dam will admit water into the helmet if the internal pressure gets too low; this <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> problem than helmet squeeze but the diver may drown if the gas supply is not reinstated quickly. This form of barotrauma is avoidable by controlled descent rate, which is standard practice for commercial divers, who will use shotlines, diving stages and wet bells to control descent and ascent rates.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the nose}} high {{attitude}} on the ground, propeller powered taildraggers are more {{adversely affected by}} P-factor – asymmetrical thrust caused by the propeller's disk being angled to the direction of travel, which causes the blades to produce more lift when going down than when going up due to the difference in angle the blade experiences when passing through the air. The aircraft will then pull {{to the side of}} the upward blade. Some aircraft lack sufficient rudder authority in some flight regimes (particularly at higher power settings on takeoff) and the pilot must compensate before the aircraft starts to yaw. Some aircraft, particularly older, higher powered aircraft such as the P-51 Mustang, cannot use full power on takeoff and still safely control their direction of travel. On landing this <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> factor, however opening the throttle to abort a landing can induce severe uncontrollable yaw unless the pilot is prepared for it.|$|E

500|$|In a brief dissent, Evans {{argued that}} Oppenheimer's {{security}} clearance should be reinstated. He {{pointed out that}} most of the AEC charges had been {{in the hands of the}} AEC when it cleared Oppenheimer in 1947, and that [...] "to deny him clearance now for what he was cleared for in 1947, when we must know he <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> security risk now than he was then, seems to be hardly the procedure to be adopted in a free country." [...] Evans said that his association with Chevalier did not indicate disloyalty, and that he did not hinder development of the H-bomb. Evans said he personally thought that [...] "our failure to clear Dr. Oppenheimer will be a black mark on the escutcheon of our country," [...] and expressed concern about the effect an improper decision might have on the country's scientific development.|$|E
