25|$|Anaerobic digesters can be {{designed}} and engineered to operate using {{a number of different}} configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, mesophilic vs. thermophilic temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester. Higher heat energy is demanded in a thermophilic system compared to a mesophilic system and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content. For solids content, low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as <b>dry</b> <b>digestion.</b> In a single stage process, one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases.|$|E

The aim of the {{feasibility study}} is to provide facts and figures for decision makers in Finland to support {{the development of the}} economically and environmentally most promising biogas technology on-farm. The results may encourage on-farm biogas plant manufacturers to develop and market dry anaerobic digestion technology as a complementary technology. This technology may be a competitive alternative for farms using a dry manure chain or even for stockless farms. Results Up to now farm scale <b>dry</b> <b>digestion</b> technology does not offer competitive advantages in biogas production compared to slurry based technology as far as only energy production is concerned. However, the results give an over-view of existing technical solutions of farm-scale <b>dry</b> <b>digestion</b> plants. The results also show that the ideal technical solution is not invented yet. This may be a challenge for farmers and entrepreneurs interested in planning and developing future <b>dry</b> <b>digestion</b> biogas plants on-farm. Development of new <b>dry</b> <b>digestion</b> prototype plants requires appropriate compensation for environmental benefits like closed energy and nutrient circles to improve the economy of biogas production.

Economic and social {{interest}} in tea is clear from the fact that about 18 - 20 billion tea cups are being consumed daily in the world. Consequently, chemical components in tea leaves have received great interest because they are related to health and disease. Various reports have discussed the potential health implications of some chemical factors such as heavy metals in tea, particularly since tea bush is known to accumulate trace metals. Metallic constituents of tea leaves depend on the type of tea and geological origin. In the present study four tea samples (two black and two green) and four herbal tea samples (two Mentha piperita and two Matricaria chammomilla) were collected from the local market in Belgrade, Serbia, in May 2008. The sample preparation has been performed using wet and <b>dry</b> <b>digestion</b> procedures. The metal content (Cu, Zn, Mn, Cd, Ni and Pb) in the digested samples has been analyzed by using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The comparison of wet and <b>dry</b> <b>digestion</b> has shown significant differences in results, indicating that <b>dry</b> <b>digestion</b> is more appropriate method. The levels of the examined metals obtained by <b>dry</b> <b>digestion</b> in this study compared well with those reported for tea samples from some other parts of the world.

40|$|Abstract—In {{anaerobic}} digestion systems which are operated {{with a high}} content of total solids (so-called <b>dry</b> <b>digestion)</b> and without mixing the reactor content during digestion, the start-up phase is decisive to the overall success of the process.

Highest possible intensities both of mixing biomass fractions prior to digestion and of leachate recirculation are not advisable, as they bear the risk of spreading acidification instead of encouraging methanisation.

40|$|Abstract. Batch {{anaerobic}} <b>dry</b> <b>digestion</b> promises {{further application}} in agriculture and {{for treatment of}} municipal solid waste, especially with smaller substrate throughputs. As in other anaerobic systems, bacteriological activity is inhibited by lack of moisture and in batch <b>dry</b> <b>digestion</b> liquid is sprinkled over the substrate to encourage biomass degradation and biogas production throughout the process. Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out to investigate individual methane generation from the recirculated liquid phase and from the stacked solid material. Results clearly indicate that methane formation within the recirculated liquid significantly adds to the total methane production of the process. Up to 21 % of the total methane generation originated from the recirculated liquid. This suggests that methane generation from the liquid phase {{is not to be}} neglected and needs to be recuperated. The process water tank should be equipped with gas collection facilities. Experimental results further indicate that higher ratios of easily hydrolysable substrates increase the proportion of methane from the liquid phase while slowly hydrolysable material encourages biogas generation in the decomposing biomass bed itself. While the amount of easily hydrolysable biomass in the system and the ratio of methane produced in the liquid phase could be positively correlated, no correlation was possible between the volume of liquid in the process water tank and the methane proportion originating from the liquid phase...|$|E
30|$|Recently, <b>dry</b> {{anaerobic}} <b>digestion</b> (DAD) {{has gained}} more interest. The advantages of DAD {{have been demonstrated}} at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions for the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (15  % TS) (Challen Urbanic et al. 2011; Li et al. 2011 b; Ramasamy and Abbasi 2000) and for agricultural wastes and livestock manure (15 – 20  % TS) (Ahn et al. 2010; Kusch et al. 2008; Di Maria et al. 2012). However, in cold-climate regions psychrophilic operation is desired. Obviously, heating the bioreactor to maintain mesophilic and thermophilic conditions is an energy drain. Kashyap et al.

40|$|Blue mussels and reeds were {{explored}} {{as a new}} biomass type in the Kalmar County of Sweden to improve renewable transport fuel production {{in the form of}} biogas. Anaerobic digestion of blue mussels and reeds was performed at a laboratory-scale to evaluate biogas production in a two-stage <b>dry</b> <b>digestion</b> system. The two-stage system consisted of a leach bed reactor and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. The two-stage system was efficient for the digestion of blue mussels, including shells, and a methane yield of 0. 33 m(3) /kg volatile solids (VS) was obtained. The meat fraction of blue mussels was easily solubilised in the leach bed reactor and the soluble organic materials were rapidly converted in the UASB reactor from which 68 % of the methane was produced. However, the digestion of mussels including shells gave low production capacity, which may result in a less economically viable biogas process. A low methane potential, 0. 22 m(3) /kg VS, was obtained in the anaerobic two-stage digestion of reeds after 107 days: however, it was comparable to similar types of biomass, such as straw. About 80 % of the methane was produced in the leach bed reactor. Hence, only a leach bed reactor (<b>dry</b> <b>digestion)</b> may be needed to digest reed. The two-stage anaerobic digestion of blue mussels and reeds resulted in an energy potential of 16. 6 and 10. 7 GWh/year, respectively, from the estimated harvest amounts. Two-stage anaerobic digestion of new organic materials such as blue mussels and reeds can be a promising biomass resource as land-based biomass start to be limited and conflict with food resources can be avoided.

However, for feedstock with low moisture content, such as crop straw and municipal sludge, <b>dry</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> (D-AD) is a better choice because of low consumption of water, small reactor requirement and high volumetric methane production (Guendouz et al. 2010; Brown and Li 2013).

The net GHG mitigation is estimated to be 718 tCO 2 e/year. CDM implementation is not feasible because its expected financial gain is lower than its investment cost.

30|$|Mature T 3 {{transgenic}} and non-transgenic seeds (grown {{in similar}} greenhouse conditions) were milled in rice miller (Satake, Japan) for 30  seconds. In this milling procedure, the outer {{portions of the}} rice grain including both germ and aleurone tissues were removed (degree of milling; DOM was 6 %). 300  mg of milled seeds were then digested using a modified protocol of <b>dry</b> ashing <b>digestion</b> (Jiang et al. 2007). The metal content (viz. Ca, Fe, Zn, Mg) of the sample extract was analyzed through Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS, Aanalyst 200, Perkin Elmer, USA) using respective hollow cathode lamps (HCL, Perkin Elmer).|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} in vitro {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{determine the influence of}} sucrose levels on protein synthesis, cellulose and <b>dry</b> matter <b>digestion</b> in substrates which contained starch and cellulose in the ratios of 1 : 2 or 2 : 1 and urea at the level of 4 %. Sucrose was added at levels of 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 % of total substrate. Protein synthesis was determined according to the method of Lowry et al. (1951), but dry matter and cellulose digestion were determined according to the method of Crampton and Maynard (1938) as modified by Hershberger et al. (1955). Advisor: Foster G. Owe...|$|R
40|$|Green mussel (Perna viridis) can playing role as bio-indicator or {{biomonitoring}} {{agent for}} heavy-metalcontaminations in the sea. In this research, {{the concentrations of}} four elements Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd in P. viridis and in the serum of rat which orally feed by P. viridis were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) following <b>dry</b> acid <b>digestion.</b> Parameter analysis was evaluated by determining confidence limit for the obtained results. The result showed {{that there was a}} sequence of heavy-metal content in green mussels sample and laboratory rats serum, such as Ni < Cd < Cu < Zn.
