25|$|William Volday/Wilhelm Waldi, a Swiss German mineral prospector, {{was also}} {{among those who}} arrived in 1608. His mission was seeking a silver {{reservoir}} that {{was believed to be}} within the proximity of Jamestown. Some of the settlers were artisans who built a <b>glass</b> <b>furnace</b> which became the first proto-factory in British North America. Additional craftsmen produced soap, pitch, and wood building supplies. Among all of these were the first made-in-America products to be exported to Europe. However, despite all these efforts, profits from exports were not sufficient to meet the expenses and expectations of the investors back in England, and no silver or gold had been discovered, as earlier hoped.|$|E
25|$|Glass {{container}} manufacture in {{the developed}} world is a mature market business. World demand for flat glass was approximately 52 million tonnes in 2009. The United States, Europe and China account for 75% of demand, with China's consumption having increased from 20% in the early 1990s to 50%. Glass container manufacture is also a geographical business; the product is heavy and large in volume, and the major raw materials (sand, soda ash and limestone) are generally readily available, therefore production facilities need to be located close to their markets. A typical <b>glass</b> <b>furnace</b> holds hundreds of tonnes of molten glass, and so it is simply not practical to shut it down every night, or in fact in any period short of a month. Factories therefore run 24 hours a day 7 days a week. This means that there is little opportunity to either increase or decrease production rates by more than a few percent. New furnaces and forming machines cost {{tens of millions of dollars}} and require at least 18 months of planning. Given this fact, and the fact that there are usually more products than machine lines means that products are sold from stock. The marketing/production challenge is therefore to be able to predict demand both in the short 4- to 12-week term and over the 24- to 48-month-long term. Factories are generally sized to service the requirements of a city; in developed countries there is usually a factory per 1–2 million people. A typical factory will produce 1–3 million containers a day.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to the University and his Verona, Wisconsin studio Littleton began melting small batches of glass in his {{ceramics}} kiln, using hand-thrown stoneware bowls as crucibles. [...] He built his first <b>glass</b> <b>furnace</b> in the summer of 1959. [...] As a result of these ongoing experiments, the ACC asked him to chair a panel on glass at its Third National Conference, at Lake George, New York, in 1958. The panelists were glass artists and designers Michael and Frances Higgins and Earl McCutchen, who worked in laminated glass at the University of Georgia. Paul Perrot, director of the Corning Museum of Glass, was the fifth panelist. At this conference, Littleton suggested that glass should be a medium for the individual artist. By the time the ACC convened its fourth conference in 1961, Littleton not only presented a paper on his own work in glass but also exhibited a sculpture made of three faceted pieces of cullet that he had melted, formed and carved in the previous year. By this time, Littleton was applying for grants to get his vision of a hot glass studio program at the University off the ground.|$|E

60|$|But yet, {{if after}} all this any one will be so sceptical as to {{distrust}} his senses, and to affirm that all we see and hear, feel and taste, think and do, during our whole being, is but the series and deluding appearances of a long dream, whereof there is no reality; and therefore will question the existence of all things, or our knowledge of anything: I must desire him to consider, that, if all be a dream, then he doth but dream that he makes the question, {{and so it is}} not much matter that a waking man should answer him. But yet, if he pleases, he may dream that I make him this answer, That the certainty of things existing in RERUM NATURA when we have the testimony of our senses for it is not only as great as our frame can attain to, but as our condition needs. For, our faculties being suited not to the full extent of being, nor to a perfect, clear, comprehensive knowledge of things free from all doubt and scruple; but to the preservation of us, in whom they are; and accommodated to the use of life: they serve to our purpose well enough, if they will but give us certain notice of those things, which are convenient or inconvenient to us. For he that sees a candle burning, and hath experimented the force of its flame by putting his finger in it, will little doubt that this is something existing without him, which does him harm, and puts him to great pain: which is assurance enough, when no man requires greater certainty to govern his actions by than what is as certain as his actions themselves. And if our dreamer pleases to try whether the glowing heat of a <b>glass</b> <b>furnace</b> be barely a wandering imagination in a drowsy man's fancy, by putting his hand into it, he may perhaps be wakened into a certainty greater than he could wish, that it is something more than bare imagination. So that this evidence is as great as we can desire, being as certain to us as our pleasure or pain, i.e. happiness or misery; beyond which we have no concernment, either of knowing or being. Such an assurance of the existence of things without us is sufficient to direct us in the attaining the good and avoiding the evil which is caused by them, which is the important concernment we have of being made acquainted with them.|$|E
6000|$|This {{brings us}} to what {{is perhaps the most}} {{striking}} of all the guiding sentiments of the book. Virgil's Georgics have been described as a glorification of labour. The Encyclopædia seems inspired by the same motive, the same earnest enthusiasm for all the purposes, interests, and details of productive industry. Diderot, as has been justly said, himself the son of a cutler, might well bring handiwork into honour; assuredly he had inherited from his good father's workshop sympathy and regard for skill and labour.[167] The illustrative plates to which Diderot gave the most laborious attention for a period of almost thirty years, are not only remarkable for their copiousness, their clearness, their finish--and in all these respects they are truly admirable--but they strike us even more by the semi-poetic feeling that transforms the mere representation of a process into an animated scene of human life, stirring the sympathy and touching the imagination of the onlooker as by something dramatic. The bustle, the dexterity, the alert force of the iron foundry, the <b>glass</b> <b>furnace,</b> the gunpowder mill, the silk calendry are as skilfully reproduced as the more tranquil toil of the dairywoman, the embroiderer, the confectioner, the setter of types, the compounder of drugs, the chaser of metals. The drawings recall that eager and personal interest in his work, that nimble complacency, which is so charming a trait in the best French craftsman. The animation of these great folios of plates is prodigious. They affect one like looking down on the world of Paris from the heights of Montmartre. To turn over volume after volume is like watching a splendid panorama of all the busy life of the time. Minute care is as striking in them as their comprehensiveness. The smallest tool, the knot in a thread, the ply in a cord, the curve of wrist or finger, each has special and proper delineation. The reader smiles at a complete and elaborate set of tailor's patterns. He shudders as he comes upon the knives, the probes, the bandages, the posture, of the wretch about to undergo the most dangerous operation in surgery. In all the chief departments of industry there are plates good enough to serve for practical specifications and working drawings. It has often been told how Diderot himself used to visit the workshops, to watch the men at work, to put a thousand questions, to sit down at the loom, to have the machine pulled to pieces and set together again before his eyes, to slave like any apprentice, and to do bad work, in order, as he says, to be able to instruct others how to do good work. That was no movement of empty rhetoric which made him cry out for the Encyclopædia to become a sanctuary in which human knowledge might find shelter against time and revolutions. He actually took the pains to make it a complete storehouse of the arts, so perfect in detail that they could be at once reconstructed after a deluge in which everything had perished save a single copy of the Encyclopædia. Such details, said D'Alembert, will perhaps seem extremely out of place to certain scholars, for whom a long dissertation on the cookery or the hair-dressing of the ancients, or on the site of a ruined hamlet, or on the baptismal name of some obscure writer of the tenth century, would be vastly interesting and precious. He suggests that details of economy, and of arts and trades, have as good a right to a place as the scholastic philosophy, or some system of rhetoric still in use, or the mysteries of heraldry. Yet none even of these had been passed over.[168] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of nitrogen oxide (NOx) formation in combustion chambers of <b>glass</b> <b>furnaces</b> is briefly described. The most important parameters governing the NOx emissions of <b>glass</b> <b>furnaces</b> are discussed. Elimination or minimisation of conditions {{that cause the}} formation of nitrogen oxides in regenerative furnaces have been tested in industrial regenerative furnaces. They include: reduction of false air, low air excess in the combustion process, delayed mixing or stepwise mixing of fuel with (preheated) air and enhanced flame cooling by promoting soot formation. Results of the industrial tests are presented as well as data from literature. Primary measures for minimising NOx formation in combustion chambers of <b>glass</b> <b>furnaces</b> show their limitations with respect to glass quality (fining, early sulphate decomposition), refractory attack by reducing flue gases and deposition of more aggressive condensation products in the regenerator and beyond a certain point, other emissions (particulate, SO 2, CO) may increase on further reductions in NOx emissions. The potential of primary measures in reducing NOx emissions from <b>glass</b> <b>furnaces</b> is still not known, since some possibilities have not been completely investigated, such as major combustion and burner port design changes and flameless oxidation combustion. In this paper results of such primary measures to achieve NOx emission reduction are reviewed and new observations are reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{chain of}} {{production}} of {{glass in the}} Roman to Byzantine period appears to have consisted of two phases. First, raw glass was made from a silica component fluxed by an alkali component in huge <b>glass</b> <b>furnaces,</b> called tank furnaces. These centres of primary glass production were located close to the sources of alkali and/or silica. For the silica component quartz sand was used, while natron {{was used for the}} alkali component. Next, the freshly made primary glass was broken up into chunks and distributed to secondary glass workshops where it was again melted to shape and/or blow it into artefacts. This paper presents an interdisciplinary study based on a combination of archaeological and archaeometrical research. Excavated primary <b>glass</b> <b>furnaces</b> are used to build a 3 D CFD model of the ancient furnaces. Based on CFD calculations we provided further technical insights into the ancient production process such as the duration of the melting process, the amount of energy needed, the evolution of the temperature in the furnaces, etc. We also illustrate that the huge size of the ancient primary <b>glass</b> <b>furnaces</b> could be explained by the existence of economies of scale. status: publishe...|$|R
