500|$|The Apology was {{a popular}} work and gave Cibber a good return. Its self-complacency, however, infuriated some of his contemporaries, notably Pope, but even the usually {{critical}} Samuel Johnson {{had to admit that}} it was [...] "very entertaining and very well done". It went through four editions in his lifetime, and more after his death, and generations of readers have found it an amusing and engaging read, projecting an author always [...] "happy in his own good opinion, the best of all others; teeming with animal spirits, and uniting the self-sufficiency of youth with the <b>garrulity</b> of age." ...|$|E
500|$|The Monthly Review, the Critical Review, the English Review, and the European Magazine {{contained}} reviews that, in {{the words}} of Bertram Davis, characterised the biography as [...] "a malevolent and spiteful account of Johnson's life, grossly inaccurate, and rendered utterly ridiculous by its pompous legalisms and its digressions on every conceivable subject. The book, if they were to be believed, was less a biography than a polemic, less a work of art than a collection of senile gossip." [...] In particular, the Critical Review said, [...] "we often lose Dr. Johnson... The knight sinks under the weight of his subject, and is glad to escape to scenes more congenial to his disposition, and more suitable to his talents, the <b>garrulity</b> of a literary old man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bourke writes that:Murray's {{strength}} is the dramatization of general {{ideas and the}} description of animals, machines, or landscape. At times his immense self-confidence produces <b>garrulity</b> and sweeping, dismissive prescriptions. The most attractive poems show enormous powers of invention, lively play with language, and command of rhythm and idiom. In these poems Murray invariably explores social questions through a celebration of common objects from the natural world, as in [...] "The Broad Bean Sermon", or machines, as in [...] "Machine Portraits with Pendant Spaceman". Always concerned with a [...] "common reader", Murray's later poetry (for example, Dog Fox Field, 1990, Translations from the Natural World, 1992) recovers [...] "populist" [...] conventions of newspaper verse, singsong rhyme, and doggerel.|$|E

6000|$|Remains {{only that}} the Court, to whom his manners and <b>garrulities</b> were always agreeable, shall make his fall soft. The {{grasping}} old man has already got his Archbishopship of Toulouse exchanged for the richer one of Sens: and now, in this hour of pity, he shall have the Coadjutorship for his nephew (hardly yet of due age); a Dameship of the Palace for his niece; a Regiment for her husband; for himself a red Cardinal's-hat, a Coupe de Bois (cutting from the royal forests), and on the whole 'from five to six hundred thousand livres of revenue:' (Weber, i. 341.) finally, his Brother, the Comte de Brienne, shall still continue War-minister. Buckled-round with such bolsters and huge featherbeds of Promotion, let him now fall as soft as he can! ...|$|R
6000|$|People talk, in novels, {{about the}} delights {{of a first}} love. One may venture to doubt whether {{everybody}} exactly knows which was his, or her, first love, of men or women, but about our first loves in books {{there can be no}} mistake. They were, and remain, the dearest of all; after boyhood the bloom is off the literary rye. The first parcel of these <b>garrulities</b> ended when the author left school, at about the age of seventeen. One's literary equipment seems to have been then almost as complete as it ever will be, one's tastes definitely formed, one's favourites already chosen. As long as we live we hope to read, but we never can [...] "recapture the first fine careless rapture." [...] Besides, one begins to write, and that is fatal. My own first essays were composed at school--for other boys. Not long ago the gentleman who was then our English master wrote to me, informing me he was my earliest public, and that he had never credited my younger brother with the essays which that unscrupulous lad ("I speak of him but brotherly") was accustomed to present for his consideration.|$|R

60|$|The {{light was}} out, and the small, brave voice bidding them {{good night from}} the dark room. They groped downstairs, and tore away from the <b>garrulity</b> of Mother Geehan.|$|E
6000|$|... "His," [...] {{said the}} Sage, [...] "is the only case of golfing <b>garrulity</b> I {{have ever known}} where a {{permanent}} cure was affected. If you would care to hear about it----?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “To gam,” {{among the}} sealing-schooners, is a {{substitute}} for the verbs “to visit,” “to gossip.” It expresses the <b>garrulity</b> of the sea, and is a pleasant break in the monotony of the life.|$|E
6000|$|They found M. Peyron {{very much}} excited, partly by Ula's news of Tu-Kila-Kila's attitude, but more still by Methuselah's {{agitated}} condition. [...] "The whole night through, my dear friends," [...] he cried, seizing their hands, [...] "that bird has been chattering, chattering, chattering. Oh, mon Dieu, quel oiseau! It {{seems as though}} the words heard yesterday from mademoiselle had struck some lost chord in the creature's memory. But he is also very feeble. I can see that well. His <b>garrulity</b> is the <b>garrulity</b> of old age in its last flickering moments. He mumbles and mutters. He chuckles to himself. If you don't hear his message now and at once, it's my solemn conviction you will never hear it." ...|$|E
60|$|His <b>garrulity</b> was {{an instant}} arrested; for lifting his eyes, he saw what no one else saw--the black figure of Dr Oman {{standing}} on the sunlit lawn and looking steadily into the room. Before he could quite recover himself Cray had cloven in.|$|E
60|$|In sum, Borabolla loved Jarl; and Jarl, {{pleased with}} this sociable monarch, {{for all his}} <b>garrulity,</b> esteemed him the most {{sensible}} old gentleman and king he had as yet seen in Mardi. For this reason, perhaps; that his talkativeness favored that silence in listeners, which was my Viking's delight in himself.|$|E
60|$|Let me not, however, {{lose the}} {{historian}} in the man, nor suffer the doting recollections of age to overcome me, while dwelling with fond <b>garrulity</b> on the virtuous {{days of the}} patriarchs--on those sweet days of simplicity and ease, which never more will dawn on the lovely island of Manna-hata.|$|E
60|$|Crooked Jack spat on {{his hand}} and resumed his work, but his tongue went faster than his spade, and the Old Lady listened greedily. For {{the first time she}} enjoyed and blessed Crooked Jack's <b>garrulity</b> and gossip. Every word he uttered was as an apple of gold in a picture of silver to her.|$|E
60|$|He {{was willing}} enough to wait, perhaps, but time was inexorable. Save for one hurried interview, I {{did not see}} him again for a week, {{and then it was}} before the altar. His <b>garrulity</b> had fallen from him like a garment. He was preoccupied and a trifle bashful. He fumbled with the ring. I felt almost as though he was my younger brother.|$|E
60|$|Travellers {{come along}} the pass; the unconcern of their every-day {{existence}} is strikingly {{contrasted with the}} dark and fateful purposes of Tell. The shallow innocent <b>garrulity</b> of Stüssi the Forester, the maternal vehemence of Armgart's Wife, the hard-hearted haughtiness of Gessler, successively presented to us, give an air of truth to the delineation, and deepen the impressiveness of the result.|$|E
60|$|At {{one hour}} after noon, the turnkey, true to his word, {{supplied}} the prisoners {{with a very}} tolerable dinner and a flask of well-flavoured though light claret; which the old man, who {{was something of a}} bon-vivant, regretted to observe, was nearly as diminutive as himself. The evening also passed away, but not without continued symptoms of <b>garrulity</b> on the part of Geoffrey Hudson.|$|E
60|$|As for the warriors, they {{maintained}} a tranquil dignity of demeanour, journeying occasionally {{from house to}} house, where they were always sure to be received with the attention bestowed upon distinguished guests. The old men, of whom there were many in the vale, seldom stirred from their mats, where they would recline for hours and hours, smoking and talking to one another with all the <b>garrulity</b> of age.|$|E
60|$|Half turning, the {{old woman}} {{looked up at the}} {{standing}} man, her worn face lighting with a proud and wonderful smile. She reached out one veined and calloused hand and took one of her son's. Then smiling cheerily down at the prostrate man, she continued to dip the handkerchief, in the waiting-room tin washbasin and gently apply it to his temple. She had the benevolent <b>garrulity</b> of old age.|$|E
6000|$|The old gentleman's <b>garrulity,</b> {{and wish}} to conduct Arthur to the Cape, perhaps arose from {{a desire to}} avoid the subject which was nearest his nephew's heart; but Arthur broke out, {{interrupting}} him--"If you had told me this tale sooner, I believe you would have spared me and yourself {{a great deal of}} pain and disappointment; and I should not have found myself tied to an engagement from which I can't, in honour, recede." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friendship," [...] said Bonaparte, {{in one of}} his lightning-flashes of candid <b>garrulity,</b> [...] "Friendship is but a name. I love no one--not even my brothers; Joseph {{perhaps a}} little. Still, if I do love him, it is from habit, because he is the eldest of us. Duroc? Ay, him, if any one, I love in a sort--but why? He suits me; he is cool, undemonstrative, unfeeling--has no weak affections--never embraces any one--never weeps." ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{it adds to}} the zest of {{life the}} fact that many of its {{incidents}} are of such a nature that we find it difficult to say whether they are drawbacks or advantages. For instance, the jovial <b>garrulity</b> of Quashy was a drawback at times. At other times it was a decided advantage, and his friends and companions held such interchangeable opinions on the point that they could not readily have expressed them if called on to do so at a moment's notice.|$|E
60|$|Seeing me pausing {{before the}} door, {{he rose and}} invited me to enter. I obeyed with {{singular}} hardihood, for how did I know whether {{a wave of his}} wand might not metamorphose me into some strange monster or conjure me into one of the bottles on his mantelpiece? He proved, however, to be anything but a conjurer, and his simple <b>garrulity</b> soon dispelled all the magic and mystery with which I had enveloped this antiquated pile and its no less antiquated inhabitants.|$|E
6000|$|I soon {{fell into}} {{conversation}} with the old angler, and was so much entertained that, under pretext of receiving instructions in his art, I kept company with him almost the whole day, wandering {{along the banks of}} the stream and listening to his talk. He was very communicative, having all the easy <b>garrulity</b> of cheerful old age, and I fancy was a little flattered by having an opportunity of displaying his piscatory lore, for who does not like now and then to play the sage? ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{enough of}} Christmas and its gambols; {{it is time}} for me to pause in this <b>garrulity.</b> Methinks I hear the {{questions}} asked by my graver readers, [...] "To what purpose is all this? how is the world to be made wiser by this talk?" [...] Alas! is there not wisdom enough extant for the instruction of the world? And if not, are there not thousands of abler pens laboring for its improvement? It is so much pleasanter to please than to instruct--to play the companion rather than the preceptor.|$|E
6000|$|So {{much have}} I now rattled off (old age's <b>garrulity,)</b> {{that there is}} not space for {{explaining}} the most important and pregnant principle of all, viz., that Art is one, is not partial, but includes all times and forms and sorts--is not exclusively aristocratic or democratic, or oriental or occidental. My favorite symbol would be a good font of type, where the impeccable long-primer rejects nothing. Or the old Dutch flour-miller who said, [...] "I never bother myself what road the folks come--I only want good wheat and rye." ...|$|E
60|$|Pardon, my Lord, the feeble <b>garrulity</b> of age, which {{loves to}} diffuse itself in {{discourse}} of the departed great. At my years we live in retrospect alone; and, wholly unfitted for the society of vigorous life, we enjoy, the best balm to all wounds, the consolation of friendship, in those only whom we have lost forever. Feeling the loss of Lord Keppel at all times, {{at no time did}} I feel it so much as on the first day when I was attacked in the House of Lords.|$|E
60|$|Recollect, {{that while}} {{dwelling}} with the fond <b>garrulity</b> of age over these fairy scenes, endeared to thee by the recollections of thy youth, and {{the charms of}} a thousand legendary tales, which beguiled the simple ear of thy childhood--recollect that thou art trifling with those fleeting moments which should be devoted to loftier themes. Is not Time, relentless Time! shaking, with palsied hand, his almost exhausted hour-glass before thee?--hasten then to pursue thy weary task, lest the last sands be run ere thou hast finished thy history of the Manhattoes.|$|E
6000|$|... "One moment," [...] {{he broke}} in {{somewhat}} more sternly, as the woman's <b>garrulity</b> was getting on his nerves. [...] "As you say, I know the Leridans' house. I have had cause to send children there myself. Children of aristos or of fat bourgeois, {{whom it was}} our duty to turn into good citizens. They are not pampered there, I imagine," [...] he went on drily; [...] "and if citizen Marat sent his--er--adopted son there, it was not {{with a view to}} having him brought up as an aristo, what?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} afternoon I went. I {{found the}} place to be a pawnbroker's shop, and from all appearances he must have been doing a very brisk business. He was out himself attending a temperance committee, but his old father was behind the counter, and asked me inside. Though it was a chilly day there was no fire in the parlour, and the two old folks sat one each side of the empty hearth, silent and sad. They seemed little more pleased to see me than their son, but after a while Mrs. Burridge's natural <b>garrulity</b> asserted itself, and we fell into chat.|$|E
60|$|She {{stood before}} {{him in the}} narrow doorway, {{blocking}} his exit, {{and looked at him}} with keen, deep-set dark eyes. In spite of her withered aspect and wrinkled face, she was not an uncomely old woman and there was about her a dignity of carriage and manner that pleased Alan. It did not occur to him to wonder why it should please him. If he had hunted that feeling down he might have been surprised to discover that it had its origin in a curious gratification over the thought that the woman who lived with Lynde had a certain refinement about her. He preferred her unsmiling dourness to vulgar <b>garrulity.</b>|$|E
60|$|Later on, it is true, she did mean to ask Mrs. Parsons {{whether she}} had {{forwarded}} the letter. But as it chanced, before she did so, that good woman burst into a flood of conversation about Godfrey, saying how happy {{he seemed to be}} in his new home with such nice ladies around, who it was plain, thought so much of him, and so forth. This <b>garrulity</b> Isobel took as an intended hint and ceased from her contemplated queries. When some months later Mr. Knight brought her Godfrey's epistle which announced his inheritance, needless to say, everything became plain as a pikestaff to her experienced intelligence.|$|E
60|$|If the Countess was {{overwhelmed}} with the <b>garrulity</b> of this good dame, Wayland Smith, on his part, {{had enough to}} do to sustain and parry the constant attacks made upon him by the indefatigable curiosity of his old acquaintance Richard Sludge. Nature had given that arch youngster a prying cast of disposition, which matched admirably with his sharp wit; the former inducing him to plant himself as a spy on other people's affairs, and the latter quality leading him perpetually to interfere, after he had made himself master of that which concerned him not. He spent the livelong day in attempting to peer under the Countess's muffler, and apparently what he could there discern greatly sharpened his curiosity.|$|E
60|$|Presently he {{discovered}} that the deity was speaking and that all listened in silence to his words. Tarzan was sure that none other than God could inspire such awe {{in the hearts of}} the Gomangani, or stop their mouths so effectually without recourse to arrows or spears. Tarzan had come to look with contempt upon the blacks, principally because of their <b>garrulity.</b> The small apes talked a great deal and ran away from an enemy. The big, old bulls of Kerchak talked but little and fought upon the slightest provocation. Numa, the lion, was not given to loquacity, yet of all the jungle folk there were few who fought more often than he.|$|E
6000|$|Sam: Spare that proposal, Father, {{spare the}} trouble [...] Of that sollicitation; let me here, [...] As I deserve, pay on my punishment; [...] And expiate, if possible, my crime, [...] 490 [...] Shameful <b>garrulity.</b> To have reveal'd [...] Secrets of men, {{the secrets of}} a friend, [...] How hainous had the fact been, how deserving [...] Contempt, and scorn of all, to be {{excluded}} [...] All friendship, and avoided as a blab, [...] The mark of fool set on his front? [...] But I Gods counsel have not kept, his holy secret [...] Presumptuously have publish'd, impiously, [...] Weakly at least, and shamefully: A sin [...] That Gentiles in thir Parables condemn [...] 500 [...] To thir abyss and horrid pains confin'd.|$|E
