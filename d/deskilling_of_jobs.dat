25|$|Scientific {{management}} {{may have}} exacerbated grievances among workers about oppressive or greedy management. It certainly strengthened developments that put workers at a disadvantage: {{the erosion of}} employment in developed economies via both offshoring and automation. Both were {{made possible by the}} <b>deskilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs,</b> which was made possible by the knowledge transfer that scientific management achieved. Knowledge was transferred both to cheaper workers and from workers into tools. Jobs that once would have required craft work first transformed to semiskilled work, then unskilled. At this point the labor had been commoditized, and thus the competition between workers (and worker populations) moved closer to pure than it had been, depressing wages and job security. Jobs could be offshored (giving one human's tasks to others—which could be good for the new worker population but was bad for the old) or they could be rendered nonexistent through automation (giving a human's tasks to machines). Either way, the net result from the perspective of developed-economy workers was that jobs started to pay less, then disappear. The power of labor unions in the mid-twentieth century only led to a push on the part of management to accelerate the process of automation, hastening the onset of the later stages just described.|$|E
5000|$|On Sunday, June 27, 1993, A.E Staley {{officials}} {{decided to}} lock out A.E Staley employees who {{were members of}} the Allied Industrial Workers of America Union. [...] The lockout incident was the result of nearly a decade of labor disputes between management and Staley’s unionized workers. The decline in pay and wages began in 1985 when A.E. Staley merged with Continental Foods, forming Staley Continental. During the next three years, the union was forced to make concessions as management was concerned about the plant remaining viable. Base pay was frozen at $10.80 per hour and workers complained of long overtime hours and declining safety conditions. After London based Tate & Lyle bought A.E. Staley in 1988, conditions got worse for the factory workers. In 1989, contract negotiations began for a new three-year contract. While the bargaining committee was hoping to end the salary freeze and improving safety standards, the company was ushering in new practices, such as rotating shifts and <b>deskilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> as well as elimination of many safety procedures. In 1991, the company hired a new labor relations director who was known for promoting union busting practices. Workers with years and decades of experience at the plant were fired and new supervisors forced workers to ignore OSHA regulations. A new attendance policy was also instituted and workers were shocked to find out that anyone with over seven absences per year would be fired and the number of allowed absences would decrease every year. A few months later, company management announced a new set of offences that were grounds for immediate termination. This list included “smoking outside of designated areas; loafing; dishonesty; sleeping on duty; insubordination; refusal to work overtime as directed; unauthorized possession of a camera; and use of abusive or threatening language.” This was a gross violation of the union contract, which states that employers cannot fire employees without having the “just cause” to do so. Due to this new regulation, more workers were fired during the next year than had been fired in the previous twenty years combined.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the creation of informal workplace hierarchies {{in the context of}} recent changes in the UK labour market. Previous studies have identified that <b>deskilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> has removed formal hierarchies among many production workers, and that informal hierarchies based upon factors such as contractual status have formed in their place. The aim {{of this article is to}} examine how changes in the labour force mean that new informal hierarchies have developed among migrant and immigrant workers who take these jobs through an agency. Research consisted of 50 semi-structured interviews, coupled with lengthy observation of both work and social settings, at three food manufacturers. The article finds that language and cultural issues create a complex informal hierarchy not only between directly employed and agency workers, but also among and within different groups of migrant and immigrant agency workers. The accession of the A 8 nations of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) to the European Union (EU) in May 2004 (see, e. g. Anderson et al., 2006; Drinkwater et al., 2006; McDowell et al., 2008), coupled with immigration from outside of the EU (Pillai et al., 2007; Vertovec, 2006), has seen a rapid change in the makeup of the UK labour force taking lower skilled jobs, particularly among those who seek roles through employment agencies. This article aims to examine how these changes have affected directly employed managers and workers, as well as examining the experiences of the mainly migrant and immigrant workforces who take these low-skilled jobs through an employment agency. The article investigates how, although the low-skilled nature of jobs in industries such as food manufacturing has removed many official hierarchies, recent changes in the labour market have created informal hierarchies based upon workers' contractual status and ethnicities. It investigates the intersectionality of people's status as an agency worker and also as a migrant or immigrant worker, and how complex inter- and intragroup relations are constructed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examined {{three main}} research questions: (1) To what extent are there skill {{problems in the}} Thai banking industry and what explains these problems?; (2) How do banks solve these skill problems?; (3) Why is there variation in firm-level human resources (HR) strategies among banks in Thailand? The paper applied a qualitative research design consisting of two sequential phases. Phase I involved 77 interviews with key informants to explore {{the changing nature of}} the Thai banking industry and examine skill problems that may inhibit the development of this industry. Phase II examined four case studies of banks to analyze their HR strategies and practices (an internal versus external labor market strategy) in a variety <b>of</b> dimensions including <b>job</b> definition, recruitment and selection, training, mobility patterns, pay, and job security among three main occupational groups: relationship managers, branch managers, and product managers. This aided in establishing a foundation to understand the key independent variables that might {{play a role in the}} variation in HR strategies and practices among these banks. This phase consisted of 47 interviews with these three groups of managers. 	This dissertation has three main findings. First, the transformation in the Thai banking industry brought about by the Asian financial crisis has led to important and contradictory changes in the skill requirements of managerial and professional jobs. On the one hand, a change in business strategy – shift of focus from loans and deposits to fee income – has led to a <b>deskilling</b> <b>of</b> entry level <b>jobs</b> in relationship and branch management. Jobs previously designed to develop client relationships are increasingly focused on high-pressure sales and located in call centers with intensive monitoring and performance management systems. On the other hand, changes in regulations following the crisis and advances in information technology have led to an upskilling <b>of</b> product management <b>job</b> requirements, with greater demand for technical and specialty skills. This <b>deskilling</b> and upskilling <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> has exacerbated the problem of skill shortages among the three groups of managers. Second, given the two types of skill problems, banks should in theory rely on an internal labor market strategy to solve these problems. In reality, however, there is variation among banks in their firm-level HR strategies. Some banks have retained their internal labor market systems, whereas other banks have adopted an external labor market strategy or a mixed ‘hybrid’ approach. Third, institutional legacies and ownership structures of banks play a role in explaining this variation. 	Findings contribute to an institutional perspective on strategic human resource management (HRM) by demonstrating how the national skill formation system and firm-level antecedents, particularly institutional legacies, shape firm-level HR strategies and practices. In particular, this research focuses on demonstrating why firms, located in the same industry and country contexts, do not converge towards similar models of employment practices. 2019 - 02 - 0...|$|R

40|$|American {{public sector}} unions and {{collective}} bargaining {{have been subjected}} to a vicious attack under the auspices of balancing government budgets, promoting 2 ̆ 2 equity 2 ̆ 2 between private and public employees and limiting the impact of 2 ̆ 2 special interests 2 ̆ 2 on government policy. The American and world financial crisis of 2007 resulted in the Great Recession of 2008 and substantial budget shortfalls for local and national governments world-wide. This financial crisis and the resulting disintegration of aggregate demand and employment are eerily similar to the financial crisis and collapse that led to the Great Depression of the 1930 ’s. However, unlike the calamity of the 1930 ’s, in the present emergency American conservatives, funded by the moneyed class, are attempting to use the predicament as an opportunity to attack collective bargaining and other institutions of support and power for the American middle class. This grasp for power represents and assertion of power and control by the American upper class not experienced since rise of scientific management and the <b>deskilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> and the destruction of the trade union system of collective bargaining in the 1890 ’s. In this paper I will outline the recent attack on public sector unions’ power in the American economy and the accompanying changes, and proposed changes, in American law. I will briefly describe the impact of the recent financial crisis on the American economy and the balance sheets of American state and national governments and the opportunism of the American plutocracy in using this crisis to propose and enact legislation to undermine the institution of collective bargaining and political proponents for the Middle and Lower classes. In particular I will discuss the recent efforts in Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Michigan to severely limit or prohibit public sector collective bargaining and the political influence American public sector workers.

Many of these attempts have been successful, resulting in a drastic shift towards non-cooking across the world, including Canada. Deskilling occurs in both the world of the labourer and the consumer and this paper will focus initially on examples <b>of</b> <b>deskilling</b> within our food system and then move towards the argument for reskilling in an effort to obtain food sovereignty. The paper will commence with a history <b>of</b> <b>deskilling,</b> and the gendered dimension of the consumption movement.

Evidence from industry level case studies indicate that this restructuring is likely to have important consequences for the level and composition of skills required in the U.

40|$|Autonomous systems, {{including}} unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), anti-munitions systems, armed robots, cyber {{attack and}} cyber defense systems, {{are projected to}} become the centerpiece of 21 st century military and counter-terrorism operations. This trend has challenged legal experts, policymakers and military ethicists {{to make sense of}} these developments within existing normative frameworks of international law and just war theory. This paper highlights a different yet equally profound ethical challenge: understanding how this trend may lead to a moral <b>deskilling</b> <b>of</b> the military profession, potentially destabilizing traditional norms of military virtue and their power to motivate ethical restraint in the conduct of war. Employing the normative framework of virtue ethics, I argue that professional ideals of military virtue such as courage, integrity, honor and compassion help to distinguish legitimate uses of military force from amoral, criminal or mercenary violence, while also preserving the conception of moral community needed to secure a meaningful peace in war’s aftermath. The cultivation of these virtues in a human being, however, presupposes repeated practice and development of skills of moral analysis, deliberation and action, especially in the ethical use of force. As in the historical <b>deskilling</b> <b>of</b> other professions, human practices critical to cultivating these skills can be made redundant by autonomous or semi-autonomous machines, with a resulting devaluation and/or loss of these skills and the virtues they facilitate. This paper explores the circumstances under which automated methods of warfare, including automated weapons and cyber systems, could lead to a dangerous ‘moral deskilling’ of the military profession. I point out that this deskilling remains a significant risk even with a commitment to ‘human on the loop’ protocols. I conclude by summarizing the potentially deleterious consequences of such an outcome, and reflecting on possible strategies for its prevention...|$|R

However, the skill-biased demand for older workers is mainly reflected in the skill-biased changes in employment shares rather than relative wages.

We find that labour market institutions such as the national minimum wage, social pacts on wage issues and union density mostly benefit skilled older workers, while coordination of wage setting, extension of collective agreements, social pacts on pensions and centralisation of wage bargaining can alleviate the adverse effects of skill-biased technological change...|$|R

Adopting an ethnographic approach, we build a grounded theory for interpreting CAD usage in terms of the interplay between variables such as management orientation, training, actors' specialisation and <b>deskilling,</b> availability <b>of</b> shared archives, technological discontinuities between organisational areas...|$|R
