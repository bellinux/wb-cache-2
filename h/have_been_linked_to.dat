5|$|A few ASD cases <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) {{during the first}} eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|Residential school {{deaths were}} common and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the {{persistence}} of poorly constructed and maintained facilities. The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting by school officials {{and the destruction of}} medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies for government records. Research by the TRC revealed that at least 6,000 students had died, mostly from disease.|$|E

5|$|Among {{other events}} in the United States that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the {{conspiracy}} is the Black Tom explosion when, {{on the night of}} 30 July 1916, saboteurs blew up nearly 2 million tons of arms and ammunition at the Black Tom terminal at New York harbour awaiting shipment in support of the British war effort. Although blamed solely on German agents at the time, later investigations by the Directorate of Naval Intelligence {{in the aftermath of the}} Annie Larsen incident unearthed links between the Black Tom explosion and Franz von Papen, the Irish movement, the Indian movement as well as Communist elements active in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Due to misunderstandings {{caused by}} the 2009 {{publication}} of the star's 15% contraction, apparently of its outer atmosphere, Betelgeuse has frequently {{been the subject of}} scare stories and rumors suggesting that it will explode within a year, leading to exaggerated claims about the consequences of such an event. The timing and prevalence of these rumors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> broader misconceptions of astronomy, particularly to doomsday predictions relating to the Mayan calendar. Betelgeuse is not likely to produce a gamma-ray burst and is not close enough for its x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or ejected material to cause significant effects on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal activity, such as {{occurs during}} menstrual cycles and puberty, may {{contribute}} to the formation of acne. During puberty, an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. Several hormones <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> acne, including the androgens testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA); high levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have also been associated with worsened acne. Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (insensitivity to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels).|$|E

5|$|Lead affects {{every one}} of the body's organ systems, {{especially}} the nervous system, but also the bones and teeth, the kidneys, and the cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems. Hearing loss and tooth decay <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> lead exposure, as have cataracts. Intrauterine and neonatal lead exposure promote tooth decay. Aside from the developmental effects unique to young children, the health effects experienced by adults are similar to those in children, although the thresholds are generally higher.|$|E
5|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. Modi's efforts at centralisation <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{an increase in the}} number of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E
5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
50|$|Criminal {{offenders}} {{have substantial}} impairment in {{elements of the}} neuromoral circuit. Dysfunction {{in the area of}} the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the antisocial features of impulsivity and lack of social inhibition. Dysfunction to the anterior cingulate <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> low emotional processing and increased aggressiveness. As in the case of Michael below, damage to the orbitofrontal cortex <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> antisocial and criminal behavior. Damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> antisocial behavior, poor and amoral decision making, and reduced autonomic response to emotionally arousing stimuli. Evidence relating to the function of the neuromoral circuit <b>has</b> <b>been</b> proposed to be a new avenue towards the justice of criminal offenders. Such an application includes the ability to detect lying through fMRI.|$|R

5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|Health effects {{extended}} to residents, students, and office workers of Lower Manhattan and nearby Chinatown. Several deaths <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the toxic dust, and the victims' names {{were included in}} the World Trade Center memorial. Approximately 18,000 people have been estimated to have developed illnesses {{as a result of the}} toxic dust. There is also scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products in the air may have negative effects on fetal development. A notable children's environmental health center is currently analyzing the children whose mothers were pregnant during the WTC collapse, and were living or working nearby. A study of rescue workers released in April 2010 found that all those studied had impaired lung functions, and that 30–40% were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, and {{ingestion}} {{may lead}} to acute lead poisoning, as is applicable for all soluble lead compounds. All inorganic lead compounds are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as probably carcinogenic to humans (Category2A). They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> renal cancer and glioma in experimental animals and to renal cancer, brain cancer and lung cancer in humans, although studies of workers exposed to lead are often complicated by concurrent exposure to arsenic. Lead is known to substitute for zinc {{in a number of}} enzymes, including δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (porphobilinogen synthase) in the haem biosynthetic pathway and pyrimidine-5′-nucleotidase, important for the correct metabolism of DNA and can therefore cause fetal damage.|$|E

5|$|Mutations in the PRKACA {{gene that}} promote {{abnormal}} enzyme activity <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{disease of the}} adrenal gland. Several mutations in PRKACA {{have been found in}} patients with Cushing’s syndrome that result in an increase in the ability of PKA to broadly phosphorylate other proteins. One mutation in the PRKACA gene that causes an amino acid substitution of leucine to arginine in position 206, was found in over 60% of patients with adrenocortical tumors. Other mutations and genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene have been identified in adrenocortical adenomas that also disrupt PKA signaling, leading to aberrant PKA phosphorylation. The Cα gene has also been incriminated in a variety of cancers, including colon, renal, rectal, prostate, lung, breast, adrenal carcinomas and lymphomas.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 2011, former Alice in Chains bassist Mike Starr {{was found}} dead {{at his home in}} Salt Lake City. Police told Reuters they were called to Starr's home at 1:42pm and found his body; Starr was 44. Reports later {{surfaced}} that Starr's roommate had seen him mixing methadone and anxiety medication hours before he {{was found dead}}. Later reports indicated Starr's death may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> two different types of antidepressants prescribed to him by his doctor. A public memorial was held for Starr at the Seattle Center's International Fountain on March 20, 2011. A private memorial was also held, which Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney attended according to Mike Inez.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of the burh walls is recorded in a charter witnessed by King Alfred, which lays out {{the responsibilities of the}} various churchmen and nobles involved, and notes that the upkeep of the walls would be paid for out of a share of taxes on a new market and on the new streets. The local lords took responsibility for building the burh wall, which unusually for the period was not built on royal lands. During the 10th century, the documents on the burh suggest that the aristocratic thegns living around Worcester also owned and maintained buildings within the walls; Creighton and Higham suggest that these may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> their responsibilities for defending the settlement.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{survival}} horror game {{can be traced back}} to earlier horror fiction. Archetypes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the books of H. P. Lovecraft, which include investigative narratives, or journeys through the depths. Comparisons have been made between Lovecraft's Cthulhoid Old Ones and the boss encounters seen in many survival horror games. Themes of survival have also been traced to the slasher film subgenre, where the protagonist endures a confrontation with the ultimate antagonist. Another major influence on the genre is Japanese horror, including classical Noh theatre, the books of Edogawa Rampo, and Japanese cinema. The survival horror genre largely draws from both Western (mainly American) and Asian (mainly Japanese) traditions, with the Western approach to horror generally favouring action-oriented visceral horror while the Japanese approach tends to favour psychological horror.|$|E
5|$|Although William's main rivals were gone, {{he still}} faced rebellions over the {{following}} years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072. The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated; some of the elite fled into exile. To control his new kingdom, William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land. Other effects of the conquest included the court and government, {{the introduction of the}} Norman language as the language of the elites, and changes in the composition of the upper classes, as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king. More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life: the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery, {{which may or may not}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the invasion. There was little alteration in the structure of government, as the new Norman administrators took over many of the forms of Anglo-Saxon government.|$|E
5|$|Between 1974 and 1977, Boycott {{elected to}} make himself {{unavailable}} for England. He claimed in 2006 that he had simply lost his appetite for Test cricket and the stress became too much for him. Boycott's biographer, McKinstry, speculates that the self-imposed exile may also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the appointments of Mike Denness and then Tony Greig to the England captaincy, in preference to Boycott. Boycott was very critical of Denness's captaincy and his standard of batting in his autobiography in 1987, citing it {{as a factor in}} his decision, along with the pressures at Yorkshire. His weak immune system was a recurring motivation for not touring the Indian subcontinent. This period of exile coincided with the peaks of several fast bowlers' careers, including Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Andy Roberts, and Michael Holding. However, he later came back to face the West Indies pace battery at its most fearsome in the late 70s and early 80s.|$|E
