40|$|Abstract. Non-existence of {{a global}} {{overview}} or integration awareness leads to large and generalized heterogeneity of applications and technological approaches. Development of isolated systems has a serious and disruptive impact on daily practice and on clinical economic management. In this paper we describe a multi-agent system for the integration of heterogeneous clinical data sources and present the latest results originating from its use during the last year. The system aims to address several issues concerning the Portuguese healthcare information systems reality where {{it is common to}} find the lack of global strategy and planning related to the storage and management of patient’s data. 814. 000 reports were integrated from nine <b>departmental</b> <b>applications</b> during 2005. Around 500 doctors use the system per month. Our multi-agent approach has an independent and collaborative profile. It is designed to tackle, in a secure way, problems originating from existing systems heterogeneity and dynamic data productio...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Medicine at Loyola University Medical Center (LUMC) of Chicago has {{implemented}} a {{local area network}} (LAN) based Patient Information Management System (PIMS) {{as part of its}} integrated departmental database management system. PIMS consists of related database applications encompassing demographic information, current medications, problem lists, clinical data, prior events, and on-line procedure results. Integration into the existing departmental database system permits PIMS to capture and manipulate data in other <b>departmental</b> <b>applications.</b> Standardization of clinical data is accomplished through three data tables that verify diagnosis codes, procedures codes and a standardized set of clinical data elements. The modularity of the system, coupled with standardized data formats, allowed the development of a Patient Information Protocol System (PIPS). PIPS, a userdefinable protocol processor, provides physicians with individualized data entry or review screens customized for their specific research protocols or practice habits. Physician feedback indicates that the PIMS/PIPS combination enhances their ability to collect and review specific patient information by filtering large amount of clinical data...|$|R
40|$|The Clinical Event Monitor (CEM) {{described}} {{here is a}} prototype system designed to explore the issues involved in building an institutional CEM that permits rapid, automated evaluation of clinical transactions and notification to clinicians of exceptional events in a multi-vendor computing environment. The CEM uses expert systems, database, and systems integration techniques. Ancillary (<b>departmental)</b> <b>applications,</b> including as Patient Registration, Laboratories, and Pharmacy have been licensed from commercial vendors. Application-to-application and application-to-database interfaces were built to mirror subsets of the ancillary patient databases into an institutional relational database (Oracle). The CEM receives registration updates via an HL 7 message and evaluates data dependencies in rules via an interface to the relational database. The CEM engine was built using Nexpert, a commercially available expert system shell. Our short term goals were to: (1) build and maintain a patient census within the expert system environment via net based HL 7 update broadcasts; (2) explore the data-driven features of Nexpert, (3) deliver prototype exception reports. This paper describes in general terms the design features of the CEM and in detail the features of a patient registry to NEXPERT bridge (from Oracle via HL 7 structured transactions to NEXPERT) and the delivery of exception reports...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{specific}} information systems is nowadays a great advantage {{in health care}} practice. Our work focuses on an Obstetric Information System named VCObsCare. This system is used by all health care professionals of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of São João Hospital Center, Oporto, Portugal. This system's users consider it essential for performing their functions and also consider that it brings great advantage as it gathers in a single record, all the pregnancy's information. Nevertheless, São João Hospital Center has {{a wide variety of}} applications. In addition to the <b>departmental</b> <b>applications,</b> such as VCObsCare, there are various transversal applications that are common to all services of the hospital and with which VCObsCare does not fully interoperate. Because of this, professionals are often forced to replicate information, increasing the time spent on outpatient encounters. Our aim is to describe the tasks performed by the healthcare professionals on the software applications at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of São João Hospital Center and identify the time spent on information register activities in order to overcome system's limitations and consequently identify improvement opportunities. Our investigation was divided in two distinct phases: i) Analyze the archived records of a hospitalization episode in order to produce a sequence diagram, showing all the actors and all the systems involved in this process and showing evidence of interoperability between applications; ii) Make a real-time observation of its use by physicians through face contact in the doctor's office. This observation was done during approximately 4 hours. All interactions with the software applications were timed, indicating the duration of each task, as well as all interactions made with the transversal information systems. We have been able to identify that 24 % of the time on outpatient encounters is spent on data replication and 55 % of the time is spent on data registration on the multiple applications. Due to these results, we conclude that this time could be reduced by creating interoperability between VCObscare and the other systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} authoring {{paradigm is}} fraught with difficulties and limitations, foremost {{of which is the}} compile-time binding of form and content of a document. By contrast, the intent-based authoring paradigm allows the form and content of a document to be determined at run-time, which is achieved through the decoupling of content and intent. A prototypical distributed multimedia platform (Valhalla) is introduced. Agents inhabiting the Valhalla framework are members of one of three classes: client applications, media servers, and other service providers (such as an artificial intelligence based reasoning engine to support intent-based authoring). Implementations of members of these classes are introduced through the description of a <b>departmental</b> hyperbrochure <b>application.</b> 1 Introduction A traditional video author is faced with a number of well-identified but seemingly unavoidable obstacles.

40|$|The {{operational}} {{performance of a}} new MDASS (Melanoma Diagnosis Active Support System) prototype, able to distil optimal knowledge from acquired DELM (Digital EpiLuminescence Microscopy) data to automatically capture and reliably discriminate and quantify the stage of skin Malignant Melanoma (MM) disease evolution, is presented. The past decade has seen DELM techniques introduced in modern Dermatological <b>departmental</b> <b>applications</b> for general operational support. In a few cases DELM introduction was matched with the joint development of a Computer Assisted Digital Dermatology (CADD) computational environment. CADD systems may allow for rapid evaluation of initial reference and feature guidelines for dermatological lesion computer-automated classification feasibility and design projects, in particular for MM supported diagnosis, like MDASS (Melanoma Diagnosis Active Support System). In fact, Skin MM tumour is particularly dangerous for humans. Its malignant evolution lasts about 5 or 6 years and usually ends with subject death. Early diagnosis is a powerful mean of preventing this adverse evolution allowing sudden intervention, increasing the probability of subject recovery and survival. Unfortunately, a reduced number of well-trained dermatologic early diagnosis experts is available only. MDASS could be a key component for economic and reliable mass screening clinical plan and telediagnosis applications for a first discrimination level between malignant or benign skin melanocytic lesions. MDASS prototype is based on GEOGINE© (GEOmetrical enGINE) OMG (Ontological Model Generator) [14] computational kernel for geometric and colour geometry discrimination and classification to achieve robust, high reliable performance. As a reference feature selection, the work by Stanganelli and Kenet was taken into account. A careful Biomedical Engineering analysis supplied initial structured parameter template architecture, enabling to extract maximal information content from experimental dermatological data quickly. Automated classification dermatoscopical parameters {{can be divided into}} two main classes: Size Descriptor (point size, local, and global) and Intrinsic Descriptor (morphological, geometrical, chromatic, others). They offer the best structured operative synthetic description compromise, when compared to traditional specialistic ones. At present time, Structured Parameter Descriptors seem to represent the most suitable tool to elicit knowledge discovery for the effective development of reliable Active Support Systems in dermatoscopical diagnostic applications. MDASS prototype main results show disease classification procedure with distillation of minimal reference grids for pathological cases and ultimately achieve effective early diagnosis of melanocytic lesion and its follow-up. Furthermore, MDASS computational complexity and error analysis are discussed. Finally, system results are validated by carefully designed experiments with certified clinical reference database...|$|R
