500|$|Marble {{has a more}} {{coarse-grained}} texture than limestone, {{but both}} are made of calcite (CaCO3). Caves often develop when slightly acidic groundwater dissolves calcite along natural fractures in the rock. A reversal of the dissolving process can create flowstone and <b>dripstone</b> such as stalactites, which hang from cave ceilings like icicles, and stalagmites, cone-shaped masses that form on cave floors, usually directly below stalactites. These structures form when acidic groundwater with {{a high concentration of}} dissolved calcite drips slowly from the ceiling of an air-filled cave, becomes less acidic, and leaves some of its calcite behind as a solid precipitate. Oregon Caves includes a variety of cave formations created through precipitation of calcite. Although many of the speleothems in the public sections of the cave have been broken, discolored by human skin oils, or otherwise damaged, the narrow twisting passages of the [...] "show cave" [...] have been largely preserved.|$|E
2500|$|The towers rise {{four and}} a half stories to their spires. At the base they are {{supported}} by double-angled buttresses on their corners topped with crocketed pinnacles three stories above. The first two stories have paired windows topped by a small quatrefoil under a pointed <b>dripstone.</b> At the third story this pattern changes to double windows under cusped arches topped by a crocketed ogee arch, above which is a line of plain corbels. The fourth story windows, surrounding the , consist of three narrow louvered arches with a cusped <b>dripstone</b> and gable. On the north tower the top half-story is faced on all sides with a clock while a [...] window occupies that position to the south. From a castellated base rise the spires, pierced by small narrow gabled dormers just above the base. Rows of vertical crocketing decorate the section lines.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with other}} {{limestone}} or [...] "solution" [...] caves, formations at Luray Caverns {{result from a}} solution of calcium carbonate giving up some of its carbon dioxide, thus allowing a precipitation of lime to form. This precipitation begins as a thin deposit ring of crystallized calcite, but continues to collect, creating stalactites {{and other types of}} <b>dripstone</b> and flowstone. Formations at Luray Caverns are white in color if the calcium carbonate is in its pure form. Other colors reflect impurities in the calcite resulting from elements absorbed from the soil or rock layers: Reds and yellows due to iron and iron-stained clays; black from manganese dioxide; blues and greens from solutions of copper compounds. Luray Caverns remains an active cave where new formation deposits accumulate at the rate of about [...] every 120 years.|$|E
5000|$|The cave {{features}} {{a wealth of}} stalagmites, stalactites, as well as [...] "pillar, wall and drapery <b>dripstones,</b> leakage stones and cave needles" [...] which divide the interior into many chambers. At {{the rear of the}} cave lies a 140 m long, 18 - 30 m wide, and 5 - 47 m deep lake surrounded by <b>dripstones</b> and pillars. The cave is called Aynalıgöl (literally: Mirror Lake) in common parlance, in reference to the presence of the lake.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the eastern}} arch: Margaret Tyrell (née Darcy, d. 1449), wife of William Tyrell of Gipping Hall. Box tomb removed in 1865. Shields above with 12 figures along sides and base. The arch terminates with <b>dripstones</b> carved as dragons and lions.|$|R
50|$|Once grown {{together}} the water ceases dripping and runs down outside and the stalagnate begins {{to lose its}} conical shape. After some time an optical separation of the <b>dripstones</b> is not yet possible as the stalagnate has changed its form to a cylinder.|$|R
2500|$|The {{church is}} built in hammer-dressed stone, with ashlar {{to the porch}} and a slate roof. [...] Its plan {{consists}} of a west tower, a nave with a north aisle, a chancel, and a south porch. [...] At {{the east end of}} the aisle is a Lady Chapel and to the east of this is the vicar's vestry. [...] The choir vestry is at the west end of the aisle. [...] The tower is in two stages with a string course between. [...] In the second stage is a clock face with mullioned belfry windows above it. [...] The summit is embattled. [...] On the south and north front of the church are four windows with elliptical heads. [...] At the east end is a Venetian window with a keystone. [...] On the south front is blocked priest's door. [...] On the southwest corner of the nave roof is a sundial dated 1718. [...] On the west face of the tower is a carving which resembles a filled-in window above which is a <b>dripstone.</b> [...] This is said to resemble the all-seeing [...] "Eye of God".|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, in the {{northern}} climates, the <b>dripstone</b> gathered together forms a peculiar northern capital, commonly called the Early English,[47] owing to its especial use in that style.|$|E
60|$|There {{would have}} been no absurdity in this if shafts were always to be exposed to the weather; but in Gothic constructions the most {{important}} shafts are in the inside of the building. The <b>dripstone</b> sections of their capitals are therefore unnecessary and ridiculous.|$|E
5000|$|The show cave {{is rich in}} {{formations}} such as stalactites, stalagmites, columns, walls, curtain <b>dripstones</b> and calcite crystals and {{has nine}} lakes inside. Major lakes are the 512 m2 large [...] "Büyük Göl" [...] ("Great Lake") as well as [...] "Dilek Gölü" [...] ("Desire Lake") and [...] "Gazlı Göl" [...] ("Gas Lake").|$|R
5|$|White <b>dripstones</b> {{are pure}} calcite without defilement, the red color {{is given by}} iron oxide (rust) in small amounts. In Lebanon iron oxide has a red color instead of the brown beige color which is common in {{northern}} countries. The reason is a different chemical reaction caused by the high temperature which produces {{a different kind of}} iron oxide.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{stream in}} Karaca, water {{percolating}} through fissures {{in the roof}} of the cave being responsible for the formation of the <b>dripstones.</b> Such water as persists within the cave {{is in the form of}} various ponds and pools. The ponds at the entrance of the third and fourth caverns contain a considerable volume of water.|$|R
60|$|If we cut the {{projection}} gradually down, {{we arrive at}} the common Gothic gable <b>dripstone</b> carried on small brackets, carved into bosses, heads, or some other ornamental form; the sub-arch in such case being useless, is removed or coincides with the arch head of the aperture.|$|E
6000|$|The {{depth of}} the cutting {{in some of the}} early English capitals is, indeed, part of a general system of {{attempts}} at exaggerated force of effect, like the [...] "black touches" [...] of second-rate draughtsmen, which I have noticed as characteristic of nearly all northern work, associated with the love of the grotesque: but the main section of the capital is indeed a <b>dripstone</b> rolled round, as above described; and <b>dripstone</b> sections are continually found in northern work, where not only they cannot increase force of effect, but are entirely invisible except on close examination; as, for instance, under the uppermost range of stones of the foundation of Whitehall, or under the slope of the restored base of All Souls College, Oxford, under the level of the eye. I much doubt if any of the Fellows be aware of its existence.|$|E
6000|$|... § IX. We have {{hitherto}} proceeded {{entirely on}} the assumption that the form of cornice which was gathered together to produce the capital was the root of cornices, a of Fig. V. But this, it will be remembered, was said in § VI. of Chap. VI. to be especially characteristic of southern work, and that in northern and wet climates it took the form of a <b>dripstone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Yenisu Cave {{consists}} of two caves formed in two different geological ages, which are found at two levels. The main gallery, which follows a collapsed hall right at the entrance, is the most active part. Here, there are several ponds and lakes of 0.5 - 1.5 m depth with <b>dripstones,</b> stalactites, stalagmites and draperies. The cave's overall length is 1620 m.|$|R
50|$|The main gallery ends at {{a narrow}} and wet siphon, which is 10 m {{higher than the}} entrance. There are large {{chambers}} formed by collapse of the roof where auxiliary galleries branch off. The section of the main gallery between the entrance and the large collapse chamber varies from 2 to 15 m wide, and has a height of 1 - 18 m. By contrast, the following gallery section is only 1 to 5 m wide, and its height varies between 0.5 and 8 m. The southern gallery is older than the northwards directed one. The northern gallery is much narrower than the other gallery. Underground water running in the cave joins Erçek Creek. The cave section in the vadose zone, the main gallery and the great collapse chamber, are rich with colorful speleothems such as stalactites, stalagmites, draperies, sinterfahne and <b>dripstones.</b> The sections beyond the great collapse chamber of the main gallery and the northern gallery contain only wall <b>dripstones</b> and patterns formed by underground water.|$|R
50|$|Built of rusticated {{concrete}} blocks, it is {{two stories}} high, {{with a flat}} roof and a recessed central entrance on the Queen Street side. The arched windows have keystones {{on the ground floor}} and <b>dripstones</b> on the upper level, and the roofline is decorated with a cornice and balustrade. In 1930, a new wing and entry corridor were added and the interior was renovated. The interior is currently undergoing further renovations.|$|R
60|$|The {{edge of the}} <b>dripstone,</b> being undercut, has {{no bearing}} power, and the capital fails, therefore, in its own {{principal}} function; and besides this, the undercut contour admits of no distinctly visible decoration; it is, therefore, left utterly barren, and the capital {{looks as if it}} had been turned in a lathe. The Early English capital has, therefore, the three greatest faults that any design can have: (1) it fails in its own proper purpose, that of support; (2) it is adapted to a purpose to which it can never be put, that of keeping off rain; (3) it cannot be decorated.|$|E
60|$|Fig. VII. {{representing}} a moulding with an outer and inner curve, the latter undercut. Take the outer line, and this moulding is one constant in Venice, in architecture traceable to Arabian types, and chiefly {{to the early}} mosques of Cairo. But take the inner line; it is a <b>dripstone</b> at Salisbury. In that narrow interval between the curves there is, when we read it rightly, an expression of another and mightier curve,--the orbed sweep {{of the earth and}} sea, between the desert of the Pyramids, and the green and level fields through which the clear streams of Sarum wind so slowly.|$|E
6000|$|... § VII. Before passing to the <b>dripstone,</b> however, let us {{examine a}} little farther {{into the nature of}} the true cornice. We cannot, indeed, render either of the forms b or c, Fig. V., {{perfectly}} protective from rain, but we can help them a little in their duty by a slight advance of their upper ledge. This, with the form b, we can best manage by cutting off the sharp upper point of its curve, which is evidently weak and useless; and we shall have the form f. By a slight advance of the upper stone c, we shall have the parallel form g.|$|E
5000|$|The Christmas Tree and the Silver Frost {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{distinctive}} Speleothem inside Abukuma-do. The Christmas Tree is a stalagmite and The Silver Frost meets <b>dripstones</b> {{on the roof of the}} cave resulting in an impressive column. Both represent a featured stop along the 600 meter course inside the cave. According to the Abukuma Caves Management Office, The Christmas Tree, at over two metres high, [...] is said to be the largest stalagmite in the East.|$|R
50|$|The {{national}} park is very {{famous for the}} long subterranean geomorphological limestone caves and is a major tourist attraction in the region. All lime stone caves are present north of Kanger River between Madarkonta and Kodri Bahar. These are Kotamsar cave, Kailash Cave, Dandak Cave, Devgiri Cave. Many other caves were also discovered in the {{national park}}. These caves have very fine structures of <b>dripstones</b> i.e. stalactites and stalagmites. Chemically these formations are recrystallized calcium carbonate. These structures have taken million of years to form.|$|R
50|$|The first {{chamber of}} the show cave is the largest room with a width of about 50 m and a height of 36 m. The cathedral-like room {{has been turned into}} a chapel by the local people. A rock {{formation}} serves as the altar of the chapel lit by a stream of light coming from a rooftop opening. The conditions inside the caves have caused the formation of stalactites and stalagmites, more so in the deeper chambers. Several spectacular speleothems or formations are found inside the cave like flowstones, glittering <b>dripstones,</b> cave curtains, crystal helictites, columns, etc.|$|R
6000|$|... § V. The cornice of the Greek Doric is a {{condition}} of the same kind, in which, however, there are no brackets, but useless appendages hung {{to the bottom of}} the gutter (giving, however, some impression of support as seen from a distance), and decorated with stone symbolisms of raindrops. The brackets are not allowed, because they would interfere with the sculpture, which in this architecture is put beneath the cornice; and the overhanging form of the gutter is nothing more than a vast <b>dripstone</b> moulding, to keep the rain from such sculpture: its decoration of guttæ, seen in silver points against the shadow, is pretty in feeling, with a kind of continual refreshment and remembrance of rain in it; but the whole arrangement is awkward and meagre, and is only endurable when the eye is quickly drawn away from it to sculpture.|$|E
60|$|And so {{delicate}} is the test, {{that though}} pure cornices are {{often found in}} the north,--borrowed from classical models,--so surely as we find a true <b>dripstone</b> moulding in the South, the influence of Northern builders has been at work; {{and this will be}} one of the principal evidences which I shall use in detecting Lombard influence on Arab work; for the true Byzantine and Arab mouldings are all open to the sky and light, but the Lombards brought with them from the North the fear of rain, and in all the Lombardic Gothic we instantly recognize the shadowy dripstone: a, Fig. VIII., is from a noble fragment at Milan, in the Piazza dei Mercanti; b, from the Broletto of Como. Compare them with c and d; both from Salisbury; e and f from Lisieux, Normandy; g and h from Wenlock Abbey, Shropshire.|$|E
60|$|My lack of {{strength}} {{did not allow}} me to inspect the volcanic craters said to exist in these strips, or to visit any of the 'devil-houses.' Mr. G. Neville, agent of the steamers at Lagos, gave me an account of his trip. Landing near the French factory, he walked across the island in fifteen minutes, followed the western coast-line, turned to the south-west, descended a hollow, and found the place of sacrifice. Large boulders, {{that looked as if}} shaken down by an earthquake, stood near one another. There were neither idols nor signs of paganism, except that the floor, which resembled the <b>dripstone</b> of Tenerife, was smoothed by the feet of the old worshippers. When steaming round the south-western point we saw--at least so it was said--the famous 'devil-house' which gave the islands their Portuguese name.|$|E
50|$|The nave {{walls were}} {{heightened}} {{on both sides}} and the above the arcades six clerestory windows were constructed. The south windows are much taller than those on the north. Porches were added to the north and south aisles. The south porch, the grander of the two, has external flushwork decoration, three niches around the entrance, internal blank arcading and a holy water stoup. Above the central niche is a sundial. The north porch is built up against the <b>dripstones</b> of an earlier 14th-century doorway and externally has a niche over the entrance and a holy water stoup to the right.|$|R
50|$|Built to symbolise the {{political}} and military alliance between the British Crown and the Mohawk Peoples, and to house a number of gifts given to the Mohawks by the Royal Family over three centuries, it was built by the Mohawks themselves in a simplified Gothic Revival style in 1843. The new church replaced a wooden structure which had been built near the site when the Mohawks arrived in 1784. The style, popular in the mid 19th century, is demonstrated in the narrow lancet windows and <b>dripstones,</b> stepped piers on the tower and flanks of the nave, and crenellations and pinnacles on the spire, all contributing to an overall sense of verticality common to gothic architecture.|$|R
50|$|The dry part of {{the cave}} has a length of 210 m and a width of 30 m. Its central part serves as a canal in heavy downpours. At {{the end of the}} dry part, there is a 30 m-long sump lake {{continuing}} into a system of underground tunnels. The total explored tunnel length is 490 m. The cave decoration is rather scarce; much of it has been destroyed due to earthquakes and vandalism. For this reason, the cave has since 1995 been locked and is accessible only {{in the presence of a}} guide. <b>Dripstones</b> are rare; the ceiling is formed by rock layers and remains of flowstones. Numerous pareidolias can be seen.|$|R
6000|$|... § VI. But to proceed. It will doubtless {{appear to}} the reader, that, even {{allowing}} {{for some of}} these permissible variations in the curve or slope of X, neither the form at b, nor any approximation to that form, would be sufficiently undercut to keep the rain from running back upon it. This is true; but we have to consider that the cornice, as the close of the wall's life, is of all its features that which is best fitted for honor and ornament. It has been esteemed so by almost all builders, and has been lavishly decorated in modes hereafter to be considered. But it is evident that, as it is high above the eye, the fittest place to receive the decoration is the slope of X, which is inclined towards the spectator; and if we cut away or hollow out this slope more than we have done at b, all decoration will be hid in the shadow. If, therefore, the climate be fine, and rain of long continuance not to be dreaded, we shall not hollow the stone X further, adopting the curve at b merely as the most protective in our power. But if the climate be one in which rain is frequent and dangerous, as in alternations with frost, we may be compelled to consider the cornice in a character distinctly protective, and to hollow out X farther, so as to enable it thoroughly to accomplish its purpose. A cornice thus treated loses its character as the crown or honor of the wall, takes the office of its protector, and is called a <b>DRIPSTONE.</b> The <b>dripstone</b> is naturally the attribute of Northern buildings, and therefore especially of Gothic architecture; the true cornice is the attribute of Southern buildings, and therefore of Greek and Italian architecture; and it is one of their peculiar beauties, and eminent features of superiority.|$|E
60|$|XIV. One of {{the worst}} enemies of modern Gothic architecture, though {{seemingly}} an unimportant feature, is an excrescence, as offensive by its poverty as the garland by its profusion, the <b>dripstone</b> {{in the shape of}} the handle of a chest of drawers, which is used over the square-headed windows of what we call Elizabethan buildings. In the last Chapter, it will be remembered that the square form was shown to be that of pre-eminent Power, and to be properly adapted and limited to the exhibition of space or surface. Hence, when the window is to be an exponent of power, as for instance in those by M. Angelo in the lower story of the Palazzo Ricardi at Florence, the square head is the most noble form they can assume; but then either their space must be unbroken, and their associated mouldings the most severe, or else the square must be used as a finial outline, and is chiefly to be associated with forms of tracery, in which the relative form of power, the circle, is predominant, as in Venetian, and Florentine, and Pisan Gothic. But if you break upon your terminal square, or if you cut its lines off at the top and turn them outwards, you have lost its unity and space. It is an including form no longer, but an added, isolated line, and the ugliest possible. Look abroad into the landscape and see if you can discover any one so bent and fragmentary as that of this strange windlass-looking <b>dripstone.</b> You cannot. It is a monster. It unites every element of ugliness, its line is harshly broken in itself, and unconnected with every other; it has no harmony either with structure or decoration, it has no architectural support, it looks glued to the wall, and the only pleasant property it has, is the appearance of some likelihood of its dropping off.|$|E
6000|$|... § II. The {{first and}} {{simplest}} mode of obtaining {{this is by}} channelling the jambs and arch head; {{and this is the}} chief practical service of aperture mouldings, which are otherwise entirely decorative. But as this very decorative character renders them unfit to be made channels for rain water, it is well to add some external roofing to the aperture, which may protect it from the run of all the rain, except that which necessarily beats into its own area. This protection, in its most usual form, is a mere <b>dripstone</b> moulding carried over or round the head of the aperture. But this is, in reality, only a contracted form of a true roof, projecting from the wall over the aperture; and all protections of apertures whatsoever are to be conceived as portions of small roofs, attached to the wall behind; and supported by it, so long as their scale admits of their being so with safety, and afterwards in such manner as may be most expedient. The proper forms of these, and modes of their support, are to be the subject of our final enquiry.|$|E
50|$|The {{national}} park {{is well known}} for the presence of subterranean limestone caves with <b>dripstones</b> and flowstones Annexure-9. The formations of stalactites and stalagmites are still growing. The caves in the {{national park}} provide shelter for various species of wildlife. The caves in the national park are inhabited by leopards, porcupines, hyenas, bears, bats, fishes, snakes, frogs, crickets etc.The overhangs are mostly found in the western part (Tirathgarh) and eastern portion (Near Kolab River) of the national park which provide a good habitat for honeybees especially the rock bees. Dens are found on the rocky portions of the National park where wild dogs (dholes), jackals, wolves, foxes, mongoose, etc. occupy them for shelter and breeding.|$|R

A significant method development was the stable hydrogen isotope analysis of water containing inclusions. We recognized climate change events with high resolution from samples of small mass formerly unavailable (< 0, 2 gr). We identified the changes of the past thousand years on a stalactite originating from a cave of the Bükk Mts. On a sample from the Mecsek we indicated the environmental changes occurred about 3500 years ago and presence of volcanic dust and its inwash into the cave, and also described the environmental effect of the uranium mining. A number of <b>dripstones</b> and carbonate precipitations were investigated in caves, the results of which – being more ten thousand years old – we couldn’t directly use in our research topic but they provided valuable data for other researches and publications. (E. g. geochemical investigation of the formations of the Baradla Cave demonstrates the climate reconstruction of the last glacial age and of the Holocene periods; {{from the age of}} the calcite laminates of the caves of Rózsadomb we could draw inferences for the rate of emergence of the mountains, etc. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Speleothems (cave <b>dripstones)</b> {{are formed}} {{as a part of}} the {{meteoric}} water cycle and therefore vari-ations in their growth rate and composition reflect environmental changes on the land surface above the cave. Since they are continental deposits, and possess a remarkably accurate dating potential, using TIMS U-series techniques, speleothems are important palaeoclimatic archives for the terrestrial environment, complementing the marine and ice-core records. The climatic proxies that can be deciphered from speleothems are growth rate, stable isotope composition (d 18 O, d 13 C), organic (humic) matter and trace element composition, as well as luminescent laminae, which may display annual rhythms. The nine papers in this special issue of The Holocene present the latest results in palaeoclimatic analysis from speleothems...|$|R
