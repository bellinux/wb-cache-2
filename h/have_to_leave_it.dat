500|$|The {{music for}} Countdown to Extinction {{was written in}} two {{different}} sessions. The first session was done following the conclusion of Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session took place after a one-month break, {{in the fall of}} 1991. The album was recorded {{in the first half of}} 1992, when the Rodney King Riots took place. These events negatively affected the recording process, as the band was forced to leave the studio every night at six o'clock because of the enacted curfew. Dave Mustaine shared his experience: [...] "There’s nothing worse than getting a creative moment and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> <b>It</b> was like a school bell ringing." [...] The record was produced by Mustaine and Max Norman at The Enterprise in Burbank, California, while the mixing was handed by Norman with the help of Fred Kelly. Referring to the recording process, Mustaine said that Countdown to Extinction [...] "was one of those records where everything was firing on all 12 cylinders and you just know it". He also said that it didn't take the band a long time to record the album because [...] "records were a lot easier to make back then because the pressure wasn't quite as hard".|$|E

Both were subsequently suspended by Predators management for Game 3. Said Predators General Manager David Poile of the incident, [...] "What they did was unacceptable and the coaches and myself {{had to come to}} the plate and do the right thing for the team.
