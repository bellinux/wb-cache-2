25|$|The total bird {{list for}} the Chagos Archipelago, {{including}} Diego Garcia, consists of 91 species, with large breeding populations of 16 species. Although no birds are endemic, internationally important seabird colonies exist. Diego Garcia's seabird community includes thriving populations of species which are rapidly declining {{in other parts of}} the Indian Ocean. Large nesting colonies of brown noddies (Anous stolidous), bridled terns (Sterna anaethetus), the lesser noddy (Anous tenuirostris), red-footed booby (Sula sula) and lesser <b>frigate</b> <b>birds</b> (Fregata ariel), exist on Diego Garcia.|$|E
60|$|Of {{food they}} had little. Nothing grew on the Rock, and its sides, covered with {{shellfish}} {{at sea level}} where the surf thundered in, were too precipitous for access. Here and there, where crevices permitted, a few rank shellfish and sea urchins were gleaned. Sometimes <b>frigate</b> <b>birds</b> and other sea birds were snared. Once, {{with a piece of}} frigate bird, they succeeded in hooking a shark. After that, with jealously guarded shark-meat for bait, they managed on occasion to catch more sharks.|$|E

Noddies also were there, and, on the ground, lizards and spiders and innumerable ants engaged in all the varied activities connected with their several domestic arrangements.|$|E

50|$|<b>Frigate</b> <b>birds</b> {{are built}} for flying; they rarely swim and cannot walk but can manage to climb around {{the trees and}} bushes in which they nest. They have a very light {{skeleton}} and long narrow wings and are masters of the air. Their name probably derives {{from the fact that}} they harass other sea birds such as boobies and tropicbirds as they return to their nests from feeding, forcing them to disgorge their catch, which is then swooped upon and caught by the <b>frigate</b> <b>birds</b> before it reaches the water below. This practice seems to be more common among female <b>frigate</b> <b>birds,</b> but probably only accounts for a fairly small proportion of the diet, which mainly consists of squid and flying fish scooped up {{from the surface of the}} sea.|$|E

5000|$|North Seymour Island - Its {{name was}} given after an English nobleman, Lord Hugh Seymour. It has {{an area of}} 1.9 km2 (0.7 sq mi) and a maximum {{altitude}} of 28 m (92 ft).

50|$|The {{island of}} Landaa Giraavaru {{is covered with}} dense {{tropical}} vegetation, including in particular takamakas, coconut palm trees and screwpines. This vegetation shelters many animal species such as geckos, <b>frigate</b> <b>birds,</b> crabs, hermit crabs, dragon lizards, butterflies and dragonflies. It is also inhabited by a big ground bird, the white-breasted waterhen (Amaurornis phoenicurus), {{as well as by}} numerous giant Indian flying foxes (Pteropus giganteus).

50|$|Great Tobago {{contains}} the Caribbean's third largest population of nesting seabirds, including Magnificent <b>Frigate</b> <b>Birds,</b> Long-tailed Tropic Birds, Terns, Pelicans, and other species. Though it's legal to snorkel and dive around the island, {{it is illegal}} to anchor because all potential anchoring locations are coral reefs that would be destroyed by an anchor. Large fines can occur if you violate this no-anchor zone, which is frequently patrolled by the BVI Marine Police.|$|E

Red-footed boobies and greater and lesser <b>frigate</b> <b>birds</b> {{nest in the}} buka trees. Black noddies and white terns nest {{in the middle and}} lower branches. The root system is used by reef herons and red-tailed tropic birds. Other birds {{can be found in the}} Pisonia forest, the only one left in Samoa.|$|E
50|$|Another {{alternative}} is “Isla Pájaros” (Bird Island), {{a small island}} covered in mangrove swamps and cacti, located on the Yalahau lagoon, {{where there is a}} large diversity of birds. As some of them are endangered species, two observation points and walkways are provided to minimize the direct contact with the birds. Flamingos, cormorants, herons, <b>frigate</b> <b>birds,</b> pelicans, wild ducks and seagulls among other species can be observed here in their natural environment.|$|E
50|$|Four {{species of}} turtle find {{a safe haven}} for nesting on the beaches of the island, namely the loggerhead turtle, Green turtle, Hawksbill turtle, and the {{leatherback}} turtle.
