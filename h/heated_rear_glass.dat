5000|$|... === Safety === Contemporary {{convertible}} design {{may include}} such features as electrically <b>heated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>rear</b> window (for improved visibility), seat belt tensioners, boron steel-reinforced A-pillars, front and side airbags, safety cage construction - a horseshoe like structure around the passenger compartment - and rollover protection structures (ROPS) with pyrotechnically charged roll hoops {{hidden behind the}} rear seats that deploy under rollover conditions whether the roof is retracted or not.|$|R
5000|$|The {{convertible}} version, {{named the}} Golf Cabriolet (or Typ 155) in Europe and Canada ("Rabbit Convertible" [...] in America originally and renamed in 1985 to [...] "Cabriolet"), was sold from 1980 to 1993. It had a reinforced body, transverse roll bar, {{and a high}} level of trim, and kept the pre-1980 style of rear lamp clusters. The Mk1 Cabriolet is of unibody construction built entirely at the factory of Karmann, from stamping to final assembly; Volkswagen supplied the engine, suspension, interior, etc. for Karmann to install. The vinyl or cloth tops were heavily insulated and manually - or beginning in 1991, electrically - operated, with a <b>heated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>rear</b> window.|$|R
2500|$|The new more {{aerodynamic}} body {{looked a}} bit more plain than its sharp predecessor, but the fastback shape echoed Giugiaro's original design. The headlights were square, there was more glass than on the SS20 (but with a broad B-pillar) and the larger <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> hatch (still not a proper hatch) now offered better access to a much more usable luggage space. The rear seat folded; some versions even offered a remote opening mechanism and <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> window. The SS40 {{was also the first}} Cervo to offer automatic transmission, a two-speed. This all reflected a steady move away from the original [...] "mini Gran Turismo" [...] concept towards a much softer [...] "Personal Car".|$|R

25|$|Powertrains were {{verbatim}} of the Camry, {{with the}} 3S-FC for the entry-level SL, and higher-end SLX and SLE models graced with the 3S-FE engine. An SLX option pack, {{known as the}} Executive was also available. The SL opened up the Apollo range with remote exterior mirrors, intermittent windscreen wipers, <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> screen demister, remote trunk release for sedans and fuel filler door, a two-speaker radio cassette player and tinted side and <b>rear</b> <b>glass.</b> SLX variants were distinguished by their full wheel covers, {{as opposed to the}} SL model's steel wheels with centre caps. The Executive variant was not a stand-alone model, but an option pack for the SLX, adding power steering and automatic transmission. SLE equipment included the four-wheel disc brakes, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, body-coloured bumpers, dual odometers, automatic headlamp cut-off system, velour seat upholstery, centre back-seat armrest, power antenna, central locking with illuminated driver's door lock and front map lamps.

40|$|An innovated {{design for}} the {{automotive}} subwoofer system is proposed where the <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> functions as the dynamic driver of the subwoofer system. The <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> is mechanically excited using two piezoelectric actuators located along the bottom edge. The glass is fixed along the top and is free to move along the other three sides. The actuators exert a force perpendicular to the glass surface which {{is proportional to the}} low frequency input signal taken from the audio system. A study was undertaken to evaluate and compare the acoustic performance and characteristics of the <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> subwoofer system relative to a conventional subwoofer system. Acoustical properties including frequency response, total harmonic distortion, and loudness are characterized and compared for both subwoofer designs. A subjective evaluation was conducted to correlate with objective measurements. An evaluation procedure suitable for evaluating the glass subwoofer system performance is recommended for future implementation...|$|R
