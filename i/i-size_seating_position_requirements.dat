40|$|Period Covered: October 2012 -July 2013 This paper {{explores the}} {{geometric}} feasibility of installing dedicated lower anchors {{in the center}} rear <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> of vehicles. Analysis {{was based on a}} previous research study in which the lateral spacing of seat belt and LATCH lower anchorages were measured in 85 model year 2010 - 2011 vehicles. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine how many vehicles would have the physical space to incorporate a third set of dedicated lower anchors in the center <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> for child restraint installation. Usability of all of the lower anchors, as well as the seat belts, was also considered. To begin, nine vehicles that currently have dedicated lower anchors in the center position were reviewed. The distances between all seat belt anchors and lower anchors across the vehicle sample were also analyzed to identify spacings that are currently feasible in production. The arrangement of seat belt and lower anchor hardware across the rear seat was also reviewed with respect to usability. Based on these analyses, a lateral distance between the outboard webbing and outboard lower anchor of 75 to 100 mm is common. The suggested minimum distance between lower anchors and seat belt hardware is 25 mm. Based on these dimensions, vehicles with 710 mm or more between the outboard lower anchor centerlines (OBLACL) should have sufficient space to provide three sets of usable, dedicated lower anchors in the right, center, and left <b>seating</b> <b>positions.</b> Providing the highest level of usability with regard to use of seat belt or LATCH hardware in adjacent <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> would be achieved by placing each pair of lower anchors between the webbing and buckle hardware for the <b>seating</b> <b>position.</b> If the OBLACL is less than 710 mm, an improvised center LATCH position (permitting use of the inboard lower anchors from the outboard <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> to secure a child restraint in the center <b>seating</b> <b>position)</b> may be feasible. The maximum spacing of this improvised center LATCH position would be 480 mm. If a vehicle allowed an improvised center LATCH position, placing the inboard lower anchor between the outboard buckle and nearest center seat belt hardware would maximize usability of the seat belt in the outboard <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> and lower anchors in the center <b>seating</b> <b>position...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pre-oxygenation in the <b>seated</b> (sitting) <b>position</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with better oxygenation. This randomised, cross over study compared oxygenation in the supine position with that in the 45 ° <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> in 40 young, healthy volunteers. Oxygen was administered through a circle system and tight fitting facemask. Transcutaneous Po(2) levels were recorded at 10 -s intervals from two measurement points during 4  min of oxygenation in the two positions. The mean (SD) values of 12 measurements taken between the third and fourth minute were recorded. There was no difference in the increase in tissue oxygenation when comparing the supine and <b>seated</b> <b>positions</b> (32. 7 (7. 3) vs 32. 6 (6. 7) kPa, respectively).

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} recovery protocols on heart rate recovery (HRR) trend through fitted heart rate (HR) decay curves were assessed. Twenty one trained male athletes and 19 sedentary male students performed a submaximal cycle exercise test on four occasions followed by 5 min: 1) inactive {{recovery in the}} upright <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> 2) active (cycling) recovery in the upright <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> 3) supine position, and 4) supine position with elevated legs. The HRR was assessed as {{the difference between the}} peak exercise HR and the HR recorded following 60 seconds of recovery (HRR 60). Additionally the time constant decay was obtained by fitting the 5 minute post-exercise HRR into a first-order exponential curve. Within- subject differences of HRR 60 for all recovery protocols in both groups were significant (p 0. 05). Values of HRR 60 were larger in the group of athletes for all conditions (p 0. 05). Between group difference was found for active recovery in the <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> and the supine position with elevated legs (p < 0. 05). We conclude that the supine position with or without elevated legs accelerated HRR compared with the two <b>seated</b> <b>positions.</b> Active recovery in the <b>seated</b> upright <b>position</b> was associated with slower HRR compared with inactive recovery in the same position. The HRR in athletes was accelerated in the supine position with elevated legs and with active recovery in the <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> compared with non-athlete...|$|R

40|$|Objective. This study {{investigated}} the effect of cycling position (upright vs. recumbent) and <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> on the oxygen cost of cycling. Experimental design. A two-factor ANOVA with repeated measures {{was used to examine}} the effect of cycling position (Monark 814 E, Lifecycle 9100 R, and Lifecycle 9500 RHR ergometers) and <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> (optimum and +/- 1 setting) on VO 2 and HR. Participants. Subjects were 10 male physical education students (age = 24 +/- 2. 1 years, height = 178. 8 +/- 4. 8 cm, weight = 76. 2 +/- 7. 8 kg). Interventions. Each subject was tested at three 5 -minute workloads (55, 137, and 186 Watts) in a random order on the three ergometers. These workloads corresponded with manual settings of 1, 3, and 5 on the Lifecycle ergometers. The cycling protocols for the Lifecycle ergometers were performed with the seat set at 107 % of the symphysis pubis measurement and at <b>seat</b> <b>positions</b> of +/- 1 setting from the so-called "optimum" setting. Measures. Physiological response was assessed by continuously monitoring VO 2 and HR. Results. At the optimum seat setting, the VO 2 was significantly higher at the three workloads on the Monark compared to both Lifecycle ergometers. <b>Seat</b> <b>positions</b> of +/- 1 setting from the recommended setting did not affect VO 2. The HR response was non-significant for cycling <b>position</b> and <b>seat</b> <b>position.</b> Conclusions. The results indicate that the Lifecycle ergometers (9100 R and 9500 RHR) underestimate oxygen consumption and indirectly underestimate energy expenditure. <b>Seat</b> <b>positions</b> of +/- 1 setting from the recommended setting on the Lifecycle ergometers did not affect the VO 2...|$|R

The application of restraint holds in the <b>seated,</b> leant forward <b>position</b> resulted in a non-significant further reduction in lung function. Reductions in lung function were greater in those participants with higher body mass index (BMI).
