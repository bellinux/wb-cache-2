25|$|At 20:05 local time, a {{thin white}} plume of smoke seemed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> {{indicate}} {{the election was}} over, and the 40,000 people who had spent the afternoon watching the ceremonies on large screens in St. Peter's Square broke into applause and song. But the smoke quickly grew stronger and clearly dark. The crowd quieted and cleared {{in a matter of}} minutes.|$|E
25|$|Qigong {{involves}} coordinated movement, breath, {{and awareness}} used for health, meditation, and martial arts training. While many scholars and practitioners consider tàijíquán to be {{a type of}} qigong, the two are commonly distinguished as separate but closely related practices, with qigong playing {{an important role in}} training for tàijíquán, and with many tàijíquán movements performed as part of qigong practice. The focus of qigong is typically more on health or meditation than martial applications. Internally the main difference is the flow of qi. In qigong, the flow of qi is held at a gate point <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> aid the opening and cleansing of the channels. In tàijíquán, the flow of qi is continuous, thus allowing the development of power for the use by the practitioner.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Rolling Stone Indonesia listed {{two songs}} that Goeslaw {{performed}} while with Potret in {{its list of}} the 150 Best Indonesian Songs of All Time, {{both of which were}} from the album Potret II. [...] "Salah" [...] ("Wrong") was ranked 74th, being noted as the best example of Goeslaw's [...] "fresh, direct, and often provocative nuances" [...] when writing songs and writing that her [...] "sweet" [...] vocals challenged the paradigm that a singer singing about an affair should be either a victim or full of revenge. The other song, [...] "Bunda" [...] ("Mother") was ranked at 110; it was noted being capable of making anyone, [...] "even the most cruel man", pause <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> think of their mother. Rolling Stone Indonesia noted a decrease in the quality of Goeslaw's songs since Ada Apa Dengan Cinta?.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Madonna pleads the {{listener}} to stop <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>to</b> {{get away from}} the world through music, with the lines going as: [...] "I don't know how I got to this stage / Let me out of my cage cause I'm dying / Turn up the radio, turn up the radio / Don't ask me where I wanna go, we gotta turn up the radio." [...] During the intermediate verses, Madonna sings about making speakers blow, which is accompanied by a subtle sound of an actual speaker blowing up. It also talks about the need to relax as well as the need to have fun. According to NMEs Priya Elan, [...] "the song continues [...] career-spanning themes of getting into the groove, of uniting the bourgeoisie and rebelling." [...] O'Mancey gave a detailed analysis of the lyrics: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{show had}} an expandable, five-platform stage which {{displayed}} the album's cover art. Madonna, wearing a skintight black {{suit and a}} lace top, appeared on the stage while sitting on a throne with a golden walking stick, as the music of [...] "Candy Shop" [...] started. Images of confectionery flashed on the television screens flanking {{the back of the}} stage. Madonna, along with her six dancers, gyrated in choreographed dance moves. Next, Madonna strapped on an acoustic guitar, took a swig from a champagne bottle and started singing [...] "Miles Away", as images of planes taking off and landing, airports and various locations around the globe were projected across the screens behind her. After that [...] "4 Minutes" [...] was performed, which mimicked its video with a flashing countdown clock. Then Madonna paused <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> thank her collaborators, including Timberlake, West, Timbaland and others. [...] "I feel like the luckiest girl in the world", she said, before dedicating the next song, [...] "Hung Up" [...] from 2005's Confessions on a Dance Floor, to her fans. The song was mixed with The Rolling Stones track [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". It was followed by [...] "Give It 2 Me", during which pink and green disco beams pulsated across the crowd. The show ended with a performance of [...] "Music" [...] (2000), during which her dancers emerged from a false, silver subway car door. Madonna danced across the stage, touching the hands of the audience and ended the show by racing up the stage to the subway doors, behind which she disappeared.|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Dappy {{described}} the song as being [...] "up-tempo, fast, party music" [...] {{as well as}} being [...] "Up-to-date and about Facebook and stuff." [...] The song lyrics follow a theme of infatuation and disappointment with each member describing their own personal experience of how they met someone they thought was 'The one' and how the person left before {{they were able to get}} the phone number. References by Dappy include how he searched on Facebook for the woman he never got a phone number from. Tulisa's story includes how she wore a [...] "LBD" [...] and [...] "Bang bang shoes" [...] when leaving her date <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> go to the ladies bathroom at a club and on return discovering he left her without his phone number. Despite the lyric in the song referring to searching for someone you are in love with on Facebook, in an interview with Hollyoaks, Dappy said that that is not something he does: If I want to get in touch with someone, I'll just ring them, man. A lot of girls might be trying to find me on Facebook, but they won't. They'll find a fake one.|$|E
