People don't relate to it, or just don't want to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But Mama told me to keep it alive, so I keep telling it...

After several failed scripted insults, Homer manages to get Ned to open up about some of his repressed dislikes, finally admitting he hates his parents, after which he immediately feels better. Dr. Foster declares Flanders cured and he is immediately released. Outside the hospital, Ned is greeted by the townsfolk of Springfield. Ned promises that from now on, if anyone does something he does not like, they will <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> which Dr. Foster tells him is very healthy.|$|E
5|$|At the palace, Charming {{struggles with}} his {{feelings}} for Snow. The King (Alan Dale) commands him to forget her because the marriage to Abigail is worth great wealth to the kingdom. Charming sends a letter by carrier pigeon to Snow begging {{her to come}} and see him so they can be together. The letter reaches her just before she can take the potion. Snow makes it to the palace but she is seized by the guards and thrown into the dungeon. There she meets a dwarf named Grumpy (Lee Arenberg), who was falsely imprisoned for stealing a diamond that he wanted to give to his girlfriend. Another dwarf, Stealthy (Geoff Gustafson), shows up to rescue Grumpy, who asks Stealthy to free Snow as well. The guards kill Stealthy as they try to escape and try to recapture Grumpy. Snow threatens to burn down the palace unless they let Grumpy go and take her in his place. The King tells Snow he will not let her interfere with the wedding. She must tell Charming she does not love him, or the King will kill him. Snow obeys because she loves Charming too much to let him die, but both are left heartbroken. Snow leaves and is soon joined by Grumpy and six other dwarfs, who offer her a place to stay. She considers the potion but Grumpy warns her that those feelings however painful, are part of her. Charming calls off the wedding to look for Snow and the dwarves <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> from Red Riding Hood. Grumpy joyfully tells Snow the good news, but she has forgotten about Charming. The pain was too great to bear and she drank the potion.|$|E

25|$|Individuals will readily used {{displaced}} dissent {{regardless of}} the focus or triggering event. External audiences provide individuals with a low-risk alternative to express dissent. The downfall for organizations, however, {{is the loss of}} employee feedback. If an employee expresses their dissent to outsiders, the organization will not <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and will assume that less dissent exists within the organization. When an organization fails to address potential issues, employees may then view the organization as discouraging dissent and will resort to using either latent or displaced dissent in the future.|$|E

500|$|The {{resolution}} to this isolation and ineffectiveness is speaking out: restoring {{the voices of}} the people of Sunnydale. Shade states that this facet of the episode gives it a political overtone. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club writes that the silence imposed by The Gentlemen is a metaphor for how evil spreads: [...] "When dissent is stifled, or people fail to tell the truth, or when we’re just distracted by other concerns, things can get out of hand." [...] Authority figures in the series, such as the school principal, the mayor's office, and the Sunnydale Police Department, repeatedly either abet the town's endemic evil or choose not to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> During [...] "Hush", at Giles' apartment the Scoobies listen to a newscaster reporting that authorities in the town attribute the silence to a flu vaccine gone awry, causing mass laryngitis. Wilcox writes, [...] "ow many times will we see those in power maintain such a silence while evil proceeds? It is not surprising that [...] attendants wear straitjackets; their garb suggests the insanity of such behavior—the pretense of civilized politeness while killing is accepted is a matter of course." ...|$|E

2500|$|Palin {{answered}} a 2006 gubernatorial questionnaire by choosing support for funding of abstinence-before-marriage programs over support for [...] "explicit sex-education programs, school-based clinics {{and the distribution}} of contraceptives in schools". In a subsequent radio interview with KTOO (FM) in Juneau, Alaska, she clarified her position by saying she was against explicit sex education, but was in favor of contraceptive education. She characterized in-school discussion of condoms as [...] "relatively benign" [...] and not something that would define an [...] "explicit" [...] program. Palin said of contraception that [...] "kids who may not <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at home should <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in other avenues." [...] Rebecca Traister of Salon.com analyzed Palin's political record as one that demonstrated her lack of enthusiasm about the Bush era promotion of abstinence-before-marriage education, and one that showed she did not work against existing sex education laws in Alaska.|$|E

2500|$|Like a lot {{of other}} people, I first became aware that a {{promising}} young player named David Campese had arrived on the scene when he appeared in a curtain-raiser to a Test against [...] at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1982. Campese was playing for the Australian under 21s against the New Zealand under 21s. I was a reserve that day for the Test, so I was in the dressing-room and did not watch the curtain-raiser myself, but I soon came to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Although [...] won the Test against [...] handsomely, all the talk after the match was about the performance in the curtain-raiser by the fullback from Canberra.

However, the band discovered that another group (which would later become the Velvet Underground) was performing under their newly selected name, prompting another name change. Garcia came up with [...] "Grateful Dead" [...] by opening a Funk & Wagnalls dictionary to an entry for [...] "Grateful dead". The definition for [...] "Grateful Dead" [...] was [...] "a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial". The band's first reaction was disapproval. Garcia later explained the group's reaction: [...] "I didn't like it really, I just found it to be really powerful. [...] Weir didn't like it, [...] Kreutzmann didn't like it and nobody really wanted to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] " [...] Despite their dislike of the name, it quickly spread by word of mouth, and soon became their official title.|$|E
2500|$|All that Puyi knew of {{the outside}} world was what was told to him by General Yoshioka in daily briefings.

At the time, it made no real impact." [...] On 4 February 1938, the strongly pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese Joachim von Ribbentrop became the German foreign minister, and under his influence German foreign policy swung in an anti-Chinese and pro-Japanese direction. On 20 February 1938, Adolf Hitler in a speech before the Reichstag announced that Germany was recognizing Manchukuo. Herbert von Dirksen, the out-going German ambassador to Japan, in one of his last acts, visited Puyi in the Salt Tax Palace to tell him that a German embassy would be established in Hsinking later that year, to join the embassies maintained by Japan, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Italy and Nationalist Spain, which the only other countries in the world that had recognized Manchukuo. In 1934, Puyi had been excited when he learned that El Salvador had recognized Manchukuo, which was the first other than Japan to recognize Manchukuo, but by 1938, he did not care much about the news of German recognition of Manchukuo.|$|E

2500|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 316. Busch {{controlled the}} race for the next 32 laps before losing the lead to Harvick on lap 348. Busch radioed to his team that a part on his car had failed. His car got loose going into turn 1, slid down the track, turned back up the track and came to a stop backwards. Justin Allgaier, driving in place of Michael Annett, clipped the left-front of Busch's car. He went up the track and collected Larson and Martin Truex Jr., which brought out the sixth caution. Busch said afterwards that the part failure was [...] "a shame. The last few times we’ve been here, we’ve had really fast M Toyota Camrys and we haven’t been able to finish. We’ve been having parts failures here, so something we’ve got to address and fix.

2500|$|The goal is {{to report}} the results within {{a short period of}} time. If screens are normal, a paper report is sent to the {{submitting}} hospital and parents rarely <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] If an abnormality is detected, employees of the agency, usually nurses, begin to try to reach the physician, hospital, and/or nursery by telephone. They are persistent until they can arrange an evaluation of the infant by an appropriate specialist physician (depending on the disease). The specialist will attempt to confirm the diagnosis by repeating the tests by a different method or laboratory, or by performing other corroboratory or disproving tests. The confirmatory test varies depending on the positive results on the initial screen. Confirmatory testing can include analyte specific assays to confirm any elevations detected, functional studies to determine enzyme activity, and genetic testing to identify disease-causing mutations. [...] In some cases, a positive newborn screen can also trigger testing on other family members, such as siblings who did not undergo newborn screening for the same condition or the baby's mother, as some maternal conditions can be identified through results on the baby's newborn screen. [...] Depending on the likelihood of the diagnosis and the risk of delay, the specialist will initiate treatment and provide information to the family. Performance of the program is reviewed regularly and strenuous efforts are made to maintain a system that catches every infant with these diagnoses. [...] Guidelines for newborn screening and follow up have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Medical Genetics.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, at Jiangdu, it {{was said}} that Emperor Yang's {{lifestyle}} grew increasingly decadent. [...] His palace contained over 100 chambers, each exceedingly luxurious and full of beautiful women. [...] The women of each chamber would serve as hostesses for a feast each day, and Emperor Yang, Empress Xiao, and Emperor Yang's favored concubines would be their guests. [...] Emperor Yang began to come to the realization that his fall was near, but still commented as if he did not care. [...] It was said that on one occasion, he told Empress Xiao, [...] "There must be many people who want to hurt me. [...] However, I will at least be the Duke of Changcheng , and you will at least be like Empress Shen [...] [...] Do not worry. [...] Let us drink and be merry." [...] It was also said that on another occasion, when he was looking in the mirror, he told Empress Xiao, [...] "I have a good neck, and I'm waiting for someone to sever it." [...] Empress Xiao, surprised and distressed by his comment, asked him why he was saying so, and he responded and smiled, [...] "Honor and wealth and poverty and dishonor, as well as pain and pleasure, all come in cycles. [...] Why be distressed?" [...] Meanwhile, not wanting to return to the turbulent north, he discussed with his officials about moving the capital to Danyang (丹楊, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu). [...] His elite Xiaoguo Army guards, missing their families in the north and realizing that Emperor Yang did not intend to return north, began to desert. [...] Their commanders Sima Dekan (司馬德勘), Yuan Li (元禮), and Pei Qiantong (裴虔通), worried that Emperor Yang would punish them, began considering rebelling and taking the Xiaoguo Army north themselves instead. [...] They associated with a number of other officers and officials, discussing so publicly that even the ladies in waiting began to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] When one reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao had her report to Emperor Yang—but Emperor Yang, not wishing to hear about the bad news, beheaded her. [...] When another reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao no longer permitted her to report to Emperor Yang, figuring that it was too late.|$|E
