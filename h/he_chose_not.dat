5|$|After the disappointing {{end to the}} season, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that front-office changes were coming. In the end, GM Marshall Johnston retired, but Martin and Mlakar were re-signed. John Muckler was hired on June 12, 2002, the Senators' sixth GM, and the first with previous experience as a general manager (with Buffalo). He had been interested in the Ottawa job in 1991, but <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> {{to wait for the}} Senators to make him an offer, and he joined the Sabres organization.|$|E

5|$|Musicians {{and critics}} {{vary in their}} {{appraisal}} of Tristano as a musician. Some describe his playing as cold and suggest that his innovations had little impact; others state {{that he was a}} bridge between bebop and later, freer forms of jazz, and assert that he is less appreciated than he should be because commentators found him hard to categorize and because <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> to commercialize.|$|E

However, <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> to sign with the Athletics, opting to attend college. He began his college baseball career at Los Angeles Harbor College (LAHC) of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) in 1997. At LAHC, Weber was a NJCAA All-America selection.|$|E
5|$|While these Irish bulls {{have led}} many writers to portray Roche as a buffoon, other biographers have {{interpreted}} them not as blunders, but as calculated attempts to disarm opposition to ministerial policies through humour. Roche ended {{his political career}} {{with the passage of}} the Act of Union 1800, which he supported. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> to attempt to enter the British House of Commons and retired on a government pension until his death, married but childless, in 1807.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Eiland-Hall, a 34-year-old {{computer}} science student in Panama City, Florida, saw the discussion on Fark using the Gottfried joke on Beck {{and created a}} website, GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com, intending it as a parody of Beck's style of political commentary. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> {{to identify with the}} WHOIS service and decided to remain anonymous. Eiland-Hall used the domain name registrar Namecheap for his site. It was launched on September 1, 2009, and received over 120,000 page views during its first 24 hours. The website asserted that it did not believe the charges were true. Eiland-Hall wrote on the site that those furthering the meme were asserting Beck used a similar strategy to promote his opinions and increase his viewership.|$|E
5|$|Power, the {{defending}} champion of the Honda Indy Edmonton, won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying. In the race, Power maintained the first position {{throughout most of the}} event but was passed by teammate Hélio Castroneves with eighteen laps remaining. On the race's final restart on lap 92, Power attempted to reclaim the lead from Castroneves but the latter defended his position and was issued with a drive-through penalty. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> to take it and was demoted to tenth and the victory was awarded to Dixon.|$|E
5|$|The Tories {{finished}} with 112seats to the Liberals' 105, while both the CCF and Social Credit gained seats in Western Canada and {{finished with}} 25 and 19seats respectively. Nine cabinet ministers, including Howe, Marler, Garson, Campney and Harris were defeated. Though the Liberals outpolled the Tories by over 100,000votes, most of those votes were wasted running up huge margins in Quebec. St. Laurent could have constitutionally hung onto power until defeated in the House, but <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> to, and John Diefenbaker took office as Prime Minister of Canada on June 21, 1957.|$|E

5|$|After {{six months}} of development, Slither.io was {{released}} for browsers and iOS on March 25, 2016, with servers supporting up to 500 players. Two days after the iOS/browser versions' release, an Android version was made available by Lowtech Studios. The only way Howse could make revenue was to display advertising in the app after the player's snake died; this option could be removed for US$3.99. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> to sell virtual currency or power-ups so that those who paid would not have an advantage over players who didn't. As {{there was no money}} to advertise for the game, the only way to advertise was the various let's plays by players on YouTube, including PewDiePie, who had more than 47 million subscribers at the time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his success with United, Bruce was {{contacted}} by Jack Charlton, manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, who had discovered that, due to his mother's place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland. Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a friendly match was not an issue, his appearances for the England Youth team in a UEFA-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country. He has subsequently claimed that <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> to play for Ireland as it would have caused problems for his club at a time when UEFA restricted the number of foreign players that a club could have in their squad in its competitions.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the failure}} of Adlertag and {{considerable}} loss rates on 15, 16 and 17 August, Kesselring convinced Göring that the only sound strategy was to continue to send heavily escorted bombers to destroy British airfields. Kesselring also advocated the use of Jagdgeschwader (fighter wings) in free-chase tactics. Messerschmitt Bf 109 single-engine fighters were to be sent out {{in advance of the}} main raids to force the British fighters into large-scale air battles which, in theory, would destroy RAF aircraft in combat and deplete the British defences. However, this time, Kesselring changed his operational methods. In consultation with Hugo Sperrle, commanding Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3), <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> to scatter his effort against a large number of targets. Instead, he narrowed down the targets to a short list in order to concentrate his strength and striking power. Sector stations RAF Kenley, North Weald, Hornchurch and Biggin Hill were chosen as the prime targets.|$|E

50|$|Unlike Twain's Yankee—who {{ultimately}} {{failed and}} saw all his efforts come to nought—Conrad Stargard is eminently successful {{in creating a}} new timeline in which a technologically advanced Poland becomes the dominant power in thirteenth-century Europe and Stargard himself {{is the most powerful}} man in Poland (though <b>he</b> <b>chooses</b> <b>not</b> to dethrone the King).|$|R
5|$|During a {{brilliant}} student {{career at the}} Conservatoire de Paris, Bizet won many prizes, including the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1857. He was recognised as an outstanding pianist, though <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> to capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public. Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy, {{he found that the}} main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works of newcomers. His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored; as a result, his career stalled, and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others. Restless for success, he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s, most of which were abandoned. Neither of his two operas that reached the stage in this time—Les pêcheurs de perles and La jolie fille de Perth—were immediately successful.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Bako {{was drafted}} out of Lafayette High School—who later retired his number 6—with the ninth {{pick of the}} sixth round by the Cleveland Indians. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> to sign, and {{attended}} the University of Southwest Louisiana. In his college career, Bako caught for the Ragin' Cajuns during two consecutive conference championship seasons: 1991 in the American South Conference, when they finished with a 49–20 record, 14th-best among Division I squads; and 1992 in the Sun Belt Conference, when Southwestern Louisiana's pitching staff amassed a 3.50 earned run average, 29th-best in Division I. In 1993, he {{was named to the}} second team of the all-Sun Belt Conference baseball team, and was selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the fifth round of the 1993 June draft.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 2002, {{while at}} Speakers' Corner, Singapore Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan {{attacked}} the Government's decision to suspend four Muslim girls for wearing the tudung (Islamic headscarf) to public schools. Contrary to police advice, <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> {{to apply for}} a public entertainment licence, arguing he did not need one. Chee's speech sparked heated exchanges involving the Sikh practice of wearing turbans. In July, Chee was convicted and fined S$3,000 for speaking without the required licence. In his judgment, District Judge Kow Keng Siong emphasized the twin considerations of public order and national security in multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore, finding that Chee's speech had bred social unrest. Under the Constitution of Singapore, a person who has been fined at least $2,000 cannot stand for election to Parliament for five years. As a result of the incident, Chee was barred from contesting the 2006 general elections.|$|E

5|$|Rossi {{struggled}} with severe tyre degradation and increasingly locked and flat-spotted his tyres. Vandoorne had reduced Rossi's lead by the penultimate lap. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> {{to rush to}} avoid damaging his car. He moved into the lead after leaving the back straight when Rossi ran wide at the first hairpin. Haryanto made a similar strategy call as Vandoorne and passed King and Rossi to move into second position. Vandoorne maintained the lead {{for the remainder of}} the race and crossed the start/finish line after 32 laps to win the race. Haryanto finished second, with Rossi in third. King took fourth, ahead of Visoiu and Evans. Berthon, Leal, Negrão, and Matsushita rounded out the top-ten finishers. Eleventh-place finisher Stöckinger became the first driver from the Philippines to complete a GP2 Series race. He was ahead of Sirotkin, Markelov, Canamasas, and Stanaway. Amberg, Binder, de Jong and Lynn were the last of the classified finishers.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} argued {{before the court}} on March 28, 2006.

Chief Justice Roberts recused himself because he had {{previously}} ruled on this case as part of the three judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Critics called for Justice Antonin Scalia to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing oral arguments ("I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy") but <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> to do so.|$|E
5|$|Torres {{was born}} in Paterson, New Jersey, and moved to Aguada, Puerto Rico with his family when he was one year old.

He attended Dr. Carlos Gonzalez High School and Miami-Dade Community College. At Miami-Dade, he was a track and field star, running the 100 meters in 10.37 seconds. In 1997, the Florida Marlins drafted him in the 23rd round of the Major League Baseball Draft, but <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> to sign.
