5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, {{it still has}} a good {{machinability}} rating on mild steels and free machining steels. When broaching, the machinability rating {{is closely related to}} the <b>hardness</b> of the material. For steels the ideal <b>hardness</b> range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a <b>hardness</b> greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E
5|$|Diamond <b>hardness</b> {{depends on}} its purity, {{crystalline}} perfection and orientation: <b>hardness</b> is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the <111> direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice). Therefore, whereas {{it might be possible}} to scratch some diamonds with other materials, such as boron nitride, the hardest diamonds can only be scratched by other diamonds and nanocrystalline diamond aggregates.|$|E
5|$|Other {{materials}} are often {{added to the}} iron/carbon mixture to produce steel with desired properties. Nickel and manganese in steel add to its tensile strength and make the austenite form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, chromium increases <b>hardness</b> and melting temperature, and vanadium also increases <b>hardness</b> while making it less prone to metal fatigue.|$|E

5|$|The hardest natural {{diamonds}} mostly {{originate from}} the Copeton and Bingara fields {{located in the}} New England area in New South Wales, Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their <b>hardness</b> {{is associated with the}} crystal growth form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which affect their <b>hardness.</b> It is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are harder than the diamonds used in <b>hardness</b> gauges.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers <b>hardness</b> test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a <b>hardness</b> of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} <b>hardness</b> and tensile strength of iron. Maximum <b>hardness</b> of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of the softness of iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{spraying}} processes {{have many}} advantages that help improve {{the performance and}} {{extend the life of}} materials and components. In the present paper the properties and wear behaviour of plain carbon specimenscoated with Ni or Co based alloy powders have been studied for the coating of tools employed in hot working applications, e. g. rolls in a rod mill plant. The morphologies of the different coating layers were very similar, showing the presence of porosity and inclusions, especially at the interface with the coated material, however their influence on the wear behaviour of the specimens was negligible. All the Ni based alloysshowed similar behaviour and satisfactory wear resistance, although small changes in chemical composition induced different <b>hardnesses</b> in the coating layers. The best wear resistance was observed with harder specimens. The Co based powder did not allow the formation of layers with <b>hardnesses</b> high enough to provide good wear resistance. When the Co based powder was mixed with a Ni based powder, the wear behaviour proved disappointing in applications involving rolling and sliding...|$|R

5|$|The {{density of}} {{individual}} particles varies with different eruptions. The density of volcanic ash varies between 700–1200kg/m3 for pumice, 2350–2450kg/m3 for glass shards, 2700–3300kg/m3 for crystals, and 2600–3200kg/m3 for lithic particles. Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and pumice shards are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations. The high density and <b>hardness</b> (~5 on the Mohs <b>Hardness</b> Scale) {{together with a}} high degree of angularity, make some types of volcanic ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive.|$|E
