Print version: OCLC# 906934062 The loss of the Cat Island Chain (CIC) in Green Bay, Lake Michigan has been a suspected factor in the reduction and degradation of important aquatic habitat. The CIC re- establishment project wave barrier (completed in 2012) was designed, in part, to positively impact aquatic habitat by reducing wave-related stress and subsequently improving water clarity and promoting aquatic vegetation (AV) growth. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) quantify potential effects of the wave barrier on water quality, wave energy, light extinction, and abundance and distribution of AV; 2) assess the existing aquatic seed-bank on the lee side of the barrier; 3) and determine the survival and growth of transplanted AV propagules and Schoenoplectus acutus (hardstem bulrush) plugs on the lee and windward sides of the barrier. Our study found differences in water quality conditions between the windward and leeward sides of the wave barrier changed over time, with poorer water quality conditions varying between the windward and leeward sites based upon temporal changes in climatic variables; however, transplanted propagules and <b>hard-stem</b> <b>bulrush</b> plugs had greater growth and survivability on the leeward side of the wave barrier. Analysis of the existing AV distribution and seedbank also provided evidence of widespread propagule limitation in the leeside aquatic habitat. Overall, the results of the research suggest the potential for increased AV abundance due to the wave barrier, especially with some facilitated vegetation re-establishment efforts; however, {{further research is needed to}} better understand this potential and the possible effects of other factors, such as Lake Michigan water levels, sediment resuspension, and the impacts of tributary runoff...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{national}} regulations to eliminate pollutant discharge, untreated stormwater runoff continues to detrimentally affect downstream water bodies. Planted bioretention (BR) {{systems have been}} proven to remove significantly more pollutants from storm runoff than unplanted systems and are increasingly used in response to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations. A portion of the pollutants removed from stormwater runoff is taken up into the aerial portions of plants. This biomass can be harvested and disposed of off-site, decreasing potentially hazardous buildup of pollutants in BR systems. It is well understood that certain species are more capable at surviving the stressful conditions of a stormwater BR system and some are better accumulators of pollutants. However, little {{work has been done}} to investigate the fate of pollutants within a BR system (water, plant, soil matrices), nor to evaluate the differences that might exist among plant species. Given the increase in BR use for stormwater pollutant reduction, and the lack of comprehensive information on individual species’ removal efficiencies, there is a critical need {{to determine the extent of}} pollutant uptake as a function of individual plant species, and to develop inexpensive and environmentally responsible systems for maximum stormwater pollutant removal. The goal of this study was to quantify differences in constituent (total phosphorous, nitrogen, copper, zinc and lead) distribution, and evaluate the differences in plant uptake of these constituents among species typically found within stormwater BR systems. This was accomplished by determining the fate of stormwater pollutants within each of the phases of a BR system (soil, plant roots, plant shoots, water) undergoing three hydraulic and pollutant loading regimes using a mass-balance approach. Six plant species typically found in stormwater basins were used in this study. They were: Phragmites communis (Common Reed), Typha latifoliaI (Broadleaf Cattail), Scirpus validus (Soft-stem Bulrush), Scirpus acutus (<b>Hard-stem</b> <b>Bulrush),</b> Carex microptera (Clustered Field Sedge), and Carex praegracilis (Smallwing Sedge). Study results showed that there is a significant difference in biomass production and constituent distribution as function of species and as a function of hydraulic and pollutant loading regime. For example, the highest loading rate consistently allowed higher fractions of metals to pass through the vegetated system and be discharged in the soil filtrate. Also, BR systems populated with the sedge species consistently accumulated lower fractions of metals in the soil than unplanted controls, and produced higher metals mass fluxes from the system in the soil filtrate. This suggests that the sedge species produce a root exudate to solubilize metals, decrease adsorption to the soil matrices, and increase metal mobility in the soil-pore water. The results of this study will enable municipalities, institutions, and state governments to improve plant recommendations for BR systems to optimize management and harvest procedures for reducing stormwater impacts to surface and groundwater...|$|E
40|$|Naphthenic acids (NAs) are toxic {{organic acid}} {{compounds}} released during the caustic hot-water extraction {{of crude oil}} from oil sands in north-eastern Alberta, Canada. NAs subsequently accumulate in the large volume of oil sands process water (OSPW) produced daily by oil sands operations. The complexity of dealing {{with a mixture of}} over 200 individual NA compounds, combined with their acute aquatic toxicity and large volume of production has made them an emerging pollutant of concern for western Canada. The following thesis outlines a variety of experiments designed to determine the potential to use wetland plants to enhance the dissipation of NAs from OSPW (phytoremediation). Investigations were carried out with three native emergent macrophyte species cattail (Typha latifolia), common reed (Phragmites australis subsp. americanus), and <b>hard-stem</b> <b>bulrush</b> (Scirpus acutus) to see if they enhanced the dissipation of NAs from a hydroponic system. Dissipation of NAs (at 30 mg L- 1 and 60 mg L- 1) was investigated with both a commercially available NA mixture as well as with a NA mixture extracted from the OSPW. Dissipation of NAs was also investigated under the different ionized forms of NAs (ionized, pH = 7. 8; and non-ionized, pH = 5. 0) to better elucidate the mechanisms of NA uptake and toxicity in plants. Phytotoxicity of NAs was investigated in hydroponic experiments through fresh weight gain and evapotranspiration was monitored throughout the experiment by water uptake. Commercially available NA mixture was more phytotoxic than oil sands NAs mixture. As well, NAs were found to be more phytotoxic in their non-ionized form therefore indicating that they may be taken up through an „ion-trap&# 8223; mechanism. However despite this, no significant dissipation of total NAs was observed from planted hydroponic systems. Nevertheless there was a significant change in the distribution (percent abundance) of individual NA families of certain size. These changes were related to the one- and two-ring NA compounds (Z = - 2 and Z = - 4). Despite not detecting any dissipation of total NAs from the systems, plants were able to reduce the toxicity of a NA system over 30 days by 45 % as determined by Daphnia magna acute toxicity bioassays; a 11 % greater reduction than unplanted systems. Studies were also conducted investigating the microbial community inhabiting cattail roots exposed to NAs. It was observed that the rhizosphere community changed with NA exposure, with a general increase in potentially pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in bacteria previously found to be beneficial to plant growth. The observed microbial community change could be an indirect effect of the Phytotoxicity experienced by aquatic macrophytes exposed to NAs. Synchrotron-sourced, fourier transform microspectroscopy analysis of root cross sections revealed that there were significant physiological changes to those roots exposed to NAs. These changes were identified as being cell death in the plant root epidermis as well as a change in the chemistry of parenchyma cells in the root pith. It is not known if these changes are a direct effect of NAs to the plant or due to changes of the associated rhizosphere community in the roots or some combination of both these factors...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1992 Waterbird use {{and aquatic}} {{vegetation}} were studied during seven seasons and in five units representing three water types at Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary (AMWS), 1 July 1990 - 30 June 1991. Dominant vegetation types were cover-mapped and sampled for species composition, biomass, and stem density. The PH, salinity, turbidity, and water depth measurements also were taken at appropriate vegetation plots. The five study units represented, a saline basin (Klopp Lake) {{filled with water}} from Humboldt Bay, a freshwater unit (Butcher Slough Log Pond, BSLP) filled with well water; and three freshwater units filled with treated domestic wastewater effluent. The PH was greatest in the units in late spring except BSLP where it was highest in late fall. Salinity was greatest in Klopp Lake in mid fall. All four freshwater units had salinities of less than one ppt. The BSLP was significantly less (p< 0. 05) turbid than the wastewater units from late fall through summer. Dominant vegetation types included marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides), lesser duckweed (Lemna minor), broad-leaved cattail (Typha latifolia), <b>hard-stemmed</b> <b>bulrush</b> (Scirpus acutus), and sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus). Marsh pennywort and lesser duckweed also commonly occurred as understory species in the emergent cover types. Mean stem densities of broad-leaved cattail and <b>hard-stemmed</b> <b>bulrush</b> were greatest in summer and were greater in the wastewater units (p< 0. 05) than in BSLP. Biomass of sago pondweed was greatest in all freshwater units during mid fall. BSLP maintained submergent beds later into the fall than the wastewater units. The wastewater units developed heavy mats of lesser duckweed over most of their surfaces in the fall. Coverage of marsh pennywort mats peaked in early fall in Gearheart Marsh and BSLP and in summer in Allen and Hauser Marshes. Ninety-four species of birds were recorded. There was an annual total of 768, 586 bird use-days on the five units. Almost 1 / 3 of the annual bird use-days occurred during late fall. Shorebirds (58. 1 percent) and waterfowl, coots and rails (35. 2 percent) accounted for 93. 3 percent of annual bird use-days. Lowest bird use occurred in summer. Bird densities were greatest on Klopp Lake for diving ducks, large and small shorebirds, gulls, and terns. Based on relative area use, great blue herons (Ardea herodias) and ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) used Klopp Lake at greater than expected rates. BSLP and Allen, Gearheart, and Hauser units had similar patterns of annual bird use. Densities were greatest on these units for herons, egrets, puddle ducks, coots, rails and raptors. Annually, fish-eating divers, represented mostly by some resident pied-billed grebes (Podilymbus podiceps) used BSLP more than either Klopp Lake or the wastewater units. Black-crowned night-herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) used BSLP at more than twice expected rates but other herons used BSLP at less than expected rates. Cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera) and mallards (A. platyrhynchos) were most common on BSLP. The wastewater units were used at or more than 1. 5 times than expected rates by herons, all puddle ducks, dowitchers (Limnodromus spp.), and Bonaparte's gulls (Larus philadelphia). The lesser scaup (Avthya affinis) was the only diving duck present on the wastewater units at expected or greater than expected rates. American coots (Fulica americana) and rails used all four freshwater units at least 1. 5 times more than expected. Continued annual marsh pennywort removal is strongly recommended, and guidelines should be established to stop encroachment of emergent vegetation into open water and submergent beds. If possible, a freshwater source should be routed into Klopp Lake to reduce high salinities and to allow for possible introduction of additional aquatic vegetation into the water column. An alternative to freshwater would be to introduce eelgrass (Zostera marina) into Klopp Lake...|$|R
