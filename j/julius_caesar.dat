5|$|On 22 January 41 (Suetonius {{gives the}} date as 24 January), Cassius Chaerea and other guardsmen accosted Caligula as he {{addressed}} an acting troupe {{of young men}} during a series of games and dramatics held for the Divine Augustus. Details recorded on the events vary somewhat from source to source, but they agree that Chaerea stabbed Caligula first, followed {{by a number of}} conspirators. Suetonius records that Caligula's death resembled that of <b>Julius</b> <b>Caesar.</b> He states that both the elder Gaius <b>Julius</b> <b>Caesar</b> (<b>Julius</b> <b>Caesar)</b> and the younger Gaius <b>Julius</b> <b>Caesar</b> (Caligula) were stabbed 30 times by conspirators led by a man named Cassius (Cassius Longinus and Cassius Chaerea). By the time Caligula's loyal Germanic guard responded, the Emperor was already dead. The Germanic guard, stricken with grief and rage, responded with a rampaging attack on the assassins, conspirators, innocent senators and bystanders alike.|$|E
