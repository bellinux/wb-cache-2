5|$|Now {{facing a}} more rugged and {{hazardous}} trek, Young chose {{to follow the}} trail used by the Donner–Reed party on their journey to California the previous year. As the vanguard company traveled through the rugged mountains, they divided into three sections. Young and several {{other members of the}} party suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a “mountain fever” induced by wood ticks. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move farther ahead on the <b>designated</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} Route S24 between Penwell and County Route 517 in the {{southern}} part of Hackettstown (Route 57’s current eastern terminus) became part of mainline Route 24 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering in order to complete the gap that existed in that route between Penwell and Long Valley. The portion of Route S24 from this point north to U.S. Route 46 was designated as Route 57. In 1965, a portion of Route 57 was designated to bypass Hackettstown, running from its intersection with Route 24 to U.S. Route 46 east of Hackettstown; this was never built. Around 1970, Route 24 west of Hackettstown became part of Route 57 while the portion of Route 57 that had existed between Route 24 and U.S. Route 46 was <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 182.|$|E
5|$|What is now Route 54 was {{originally}} legislated in 1938 {{to run from}} US 30/US 206 in Hammonton south to Main Road in Landis Township (part of present-day Vineland). The only part taken over as a state highway and <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 54 was north of US 40 in Buena, the proposed route south of this point remained as county-maintained Lincoln Avenue. In 1953, Route 54 was defined onto its current alignment. A freeway was proposed along the Route 54 corridor in the late 1960s to connect the southern terminus of US 206 in Hammonton to Route 55 in the Vineland/Millville area; it was eventually canceled.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Route 3 was legislated {{along the}} Paterson Plank Road portion of present-day Route 120. It was {{eventually}} designated {{along the entire}} portion of current Route 120. In 1953, Route 3 was moved to its current freeway alignment, replacing Route S3, and a portion of Route 20 was designated to run from current Route 3 north to Paterson Plank Road while Paterson Plank Road {{was removed from the}} state highway system. The portion of Paterson Plank Road that lost its state highway status in 1953 gained it back in 1972, when it became an extension of Route 20 {{as a result of the}} construction of the Meadowlands Sports Complex. As this route was not connected to the mainline of Route 20, it was <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 120 by the 1990s. As a result of the construction of American Dream Meadowlands, the interchange between Route 3 and Route 120 was improved. An overpass between eastbound Route 3 and northbound Route 120 was completed in 2009 and a flyover from southbound Route 120 to eastbound Route 3 was completed in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, {{the routes}} were redefined. Route 6 {{would be a}} {{completely}} new alignment from Paterson to the George Washington Bridge, and Route 5 would only run east from Route 1 (Broad Avenue, now U.S. Route 1/9) in Ridgefield. The alignment of Route 10 west of Ridgefield was <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 10N until it was eventually {{turned over to the}} county. Route 5 retained its routing in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. By the 2000s, the section of Route 5 along River Road to the former ferry was removed. In June 2007, construction began on a $24.6 million project to improve the route through Palisades Park. This project, which is to be completed later in 2009, will involve the replacement of the bridge over Delia Avenue, the removal of a bridge over an abandoned rail line, and the widening of the two-lane road to include a shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Route 6 was redefined in 1929 to use {{none of the}} old road east of Paterson (it had {{formerly}} {{been planned}} to use Market Street west of roughly where Route 17 now crosses it), and Route 5 was cut back to run only east from Ridgefield. The portion of pre-1927 Route 10 that was bypassed by Route 6 was <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 10N, but was eventually removed from the state highway system. In addition, Route 6 was redefined to bypass Paterson to the south. The new route would enter Paterson just south of Market Street, but then turn south and southwest before heading back west to rejoin the old route at {{the east end of}} the Little Falls bypass at the Union Boulevard crossing. The old road along Union Boulevard towards Paterson was assigned Route S6, as a spur of Route 6. Route S6 became Route 62 in the 1953 renumbering, and has since been truncated to a short piece between US 46 and I-80 in Totowa.|$|E

5|$|The {{entire length}} of US 130 follows {{a part of the}} Ocean Highway, a coastal highway that ran from New Brunswick south to Jacksonville, Florida. The current route was {{designated}} as portions of three state routes prior to 1927. In 1916, the road between the Camden area and Bordentown was legislated as part of pre-1927 Route 2 while the current US 130 north of Robbinsville was {{to become a part of}} pre-1927 Route 1. In addition, pre-1927 Route 17S was legislated to run from Penns Grove northeast to Westville in 1923; the only portion of road built ran from Pennsville south to Salem. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, US 130 was designated to connect US 30 in Camden to US 1 in Trenton, following pre-1927 Route 2. In the 1927 renumbering a year later, the US 130 alignment was <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 25 from Camden to Bordentown, Route 39 from Bordentown to White Horse, and Route 37 from White Horse to Trenton.|$|E
25|$|In April 1991, the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT) <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 169 as a Connecticut Scenic Road. This {{designation}} ran between Lisbon and the Massachusetts {{state line}} in Woodstock. Two years later, the highway {{was named to}} the country’s top 10 scenic byways by Scenic America. The highway was then designated a National Scenic Byway in September 1996.|$|E
25|$|Route 159 is {{a former}} {{alignment}} of U.S. Route 46, until the highway was bypassed in 1941. At that time, U.S. Route 46 also had the designation State Highway Route 6, and when the bypass opened in 1941, the original alignment was <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 6M. The 6M designation lasted just twelve years, when in 1953, it was renumbered as Route 159.|$|E

25|$|Route 140 {{was first}} legislated by the New Jersey State Legislature in 1973 {{as a state}} highway from U.S. Route 130 to U.S. Route 40. The eastern two-thirds was state-maintained because of the Interstate 295 and the New Jersey Turnpike interchanges. The route {{remained}} unnumbered however. In 1977, the western third (U.S. Route 130 to Interstate 295) {{was taken over by}} the state and the route was <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 140 and has remained the same since the legislation.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, Lou Dubois of Kingston, {{across the}} Hudson River from Red Hook, bought a popular Silk City Diner from the Paterson Vehicle Company, {{one of the}} leading diner manufacturers. He chose to install it first in an area along {{recently}} <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 9, the Albany Post Road, just north of nearby Rhinebeck called Astor Flats. They called it the Halfway Diner because he thought it was about halfway along Route 9 between New York City and Albany. Dubois's wife managed the diner while her husband continued to drive trucks for a beer distributor.|$|E

25|$|Route 171 is a {{state highway}} in New Jersey, United States. It runs 3.10 miles (4.99km) as an {{extension}} of U.S. Route 130 past its northern terminus at U.S. Route 1 in North Brunswick Township, New Jersey. Although its northern terminus is at an intersection with Route 27 in New Brunswick, the route is unsigned inside New Brunswick. The route is a major thoroughfare in North Brunswick and in New Brunswick, running on major city streets. The route originated as an alignment of pre-1927 Route 1 and later of U.S. Route 130. After Route 130 was truncated, the alignment, which had also been <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 25M was later re-designated as Route 171.|$|E
25|$|The vanguard {{company now}} faced a more rugged and {{hazardous}} journey, and {{were concerned about}} negotiating the passes of the Rocky Mountains. They had received conflicting advice, but Young chose to follow the trail used by the Donner-Reed party on their journey to California the previous year. Shortly after leaving Fort Bridger, the group met trapper Miles Goodyear, who owned a trading post {{at the mouth of}} the Weber River. He was enthusiastic about the agricultural potential of the large Weber Valley. During the trip through the rugged mountains, the vanguard company divided into three sections. Since crossing the Green River, several members of the party had suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a “mountain fever” probably induced by wood ticks. Young himself became ill soon after meeting Goodyear. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move ahead on the <b>designated</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
500|$|Another freeway routing of Route 20 {{was planned}} in 1959. This road, {{which was to}} be a six-lane freeway called the Paterson Peripheral, was to run from Clifton north to the {{existing}} Route 20 in downtown Paterson. This road was completed between the Garden State Parkway and Valley Road by 1969 and north to Interstate 80 in 1975. [...] Upon completion, this road received the Route 20 designation. In 1972, the state took over maintenance of the Paterson Plank Road from Route 3 to Route 17 in East Rutherford and made it a part of the route. As these three sections of Route 20 were not connected, they received three different route designations by the 1990s. The freeway section of Route 20 from the Garden State Parkway to Interstate 80 was <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 19, the section between Route 3 and Route 17 was <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 120, and the Route 20 designation was retained along McLean Boulevard through Paterson. The unfinished section of Route 20 that was to connect McLean Boulevard to Paterson Plank Road was built as a northern extension of the Route 21 freeway in 2000.|$|E
50|$|Phase II {{involved}} {{completion of}} highway north to Cartwright from Red Bay, and was opened in 2002. Although the entire <b>route</b> was initially <b>designated</b> as <b>Route</b> 510, {{upon completion of}} Phase III, the northern 94 km from Cartwright Junction was <b>designated</b> as <b>Route</b> 516.|$|R

500|$|The {{portion of}} US 22 between Phillipsburg and Somerville roughly follows the {{alignment}} of the Jersey Turnpike, which was chartered in 1806. What became US 22 across New Jersey was originally designated as pre-1927 Route 9 in 1916, a route that ran from Phillipsburg east to Elizabeth. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, US 22 was designated through New Jersey from the Northampton Street Bridge in Phillpsburg and followed Route 9 east to US 1/9 in Elizabeth. A year later, in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 9 was replaced by Route 28, which itself was rerouted to continue to the Goethals Bridge. As a result, the alignment of US 22 in Elizabeth was <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 27-28 Link. By 1941, US 22 underwent two significant realignments within the state. In Phillipsburg, the route was moved from Route 28 to follow its current alignment on what was Route 24 between the Easton-Phillipsburg Toll Bridge and present-day Route 57 (then a part of Route 24) and Route 24-28 Link between there and Route 28. The approach to the Easton-Phillipsburg Toll Bridge, which opened in 1938, had been planned to be <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 24N, but instead {{became a part of}} Route 24. With the realignment of US 22 in Phillipsburg, the old alignment was designated as US 22 Alternate (now Route 122). In addition, US 22 was moved off from Route 28 east of Bridgewater Township to follow Route 28-29 Link and Route 29 to Newark; Route 29 had been legislated in the 1927 renumbering while Route 28-29 Link was legislated in 1938.|$|E
500|$|Route 81 is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The route is a freeway {{connector}} between exit 13A of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) and U.S. Route 1/9 near Newark Liberty International Airport. [...] It runs for 1.18 miles (1.90km), entirely within the city of Elizabeth in Union County. A freeway called Route S100 was initially proposed on the current alignment of Route 81 in 1938; it, along with its parent Route 100, was never built. The current route was conceived in the 1960s as a freeway replacement for Route 164, which followed Humboldt Avenue, a surface road. It was to be <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 76, but was renumbered to Route 81 when Interstate 76 was created in New Jersey.|$|E
500|$|In 1932, the Pulaski Skyway {{was opened}} to traffic, and US 1/9 were {{designated}} {{to use it}} along with Route 25. Two years later, trucks were banned from the Pulaski Skyway, and a truck bypass of the structure called Route 25T was created. By the 1930s, US 1/9 was moved to follow Route 25 south to Woodbridge instead of Route 27. By the 1940s, the US 1/9 alignment was moved to its current location north the Tonnele Circle, following Route 1 and Route 6 to the George Washington Bridge into New York City. In {{the vicinity of the}} George Washington Bridge, the route also ran concurrent with US 46. In addition, US 9 was built to connect to US 1 in Woodbridge on its current alignment (then <b>designated</b> <b>Route</b> 35) instead of using Route 4 (the current Route 35).|$|E
