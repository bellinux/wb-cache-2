For these sensors to be in-stalled properly, the sampling volume {{that defines the}} volume of soil zone where the soil mois-ture affects the sensor readings has to be known. These dielectric sensors comprise plus and ground prongs, where {{the sensitivity of the}} plus prong is higher than that of the <b>ground</b> <b>prong.</b> Moreover, the sensor head in which the circuitry is embedded has some sensitivity. It is not straightforward to incorporate these characteristics into numerical quantification of the sampling volume that is often used for conventional TDR probes. Therefore, we re-visited a “classic” experimental approach for quantifying the bulk sampling volume of these sensors. We obtained sensor readings under varying distances between the sensor and a water-air interface, and de-termined the bulk sampling volume when the sensor readings start to show an “abrupt ” change. Firstly, we tested two TDR probes (CS- 640 and CS- 630, Campbell Scientific, Inc.) and showed that the experimental procedure yielded results that were consistent with the previous findings. Secondly, we examined four ECH 2 O soil moisture sensors that differ in design (EC- 5, TM, 5 TE, and 10 HS, Decagon Devices, Inc.). The results showed that: 1) the sensitivity of the plu...|$|E

Fig cultivar Sarilop was used as a material. It is the best fig cultivar for drying and it can also be consumed fresh. The mother plants were planted horizontally with distance of 70 x 60 cm in November {{after the fall of the}} leaves. In February, all the buds on the ground side of plants were blunted and plants were fixed parallel (layered) to the <b>ground</b> surface with <b>prongs</b> made of a thick galvanized wire in the shape of U. Bottom parts of the new shoots which developed from the mother plants and reached 20 cm were covered by 10 cm of soil. Bottom parts of the newly formed shoots were continuously covered with the soil taken from between the rows appropriately to the development of the shoots during vegetation period. At the end of the vegetation period, eighty nursery plants of different sizes were obtained from twenty mother plants. Most of the nursery plants (77. 5 %) had sufficient qualitative and quantitative features for sale. The small sized plants, which may not be sold, can be used as nursery plant or mother plant (stock) after one year of care period. It was determined in this research that it was possible to propagate nursery plant by stem layering. The production of fi g nursery plants by stem layering with low production costs is suggested to as an alternative method for the production of fig nursery plants...|$|R
