5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
60|$|Affonso Henriques {{sat down}} on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> took his head in his hands. He was checkmated--and yet....|$|E
60|$|It made a horrid smudge for {{so small}} a paper, {{and the king}} sat on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> watched it eagerly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{receiver}} stands or crouches at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> facing <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>The</b> {{active partner}} lies on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> with their head hanging over <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> backward. <b>The</b> receiver inserts their penis into the partner's mouth, usually to achieve deep throat penetration.|$|R
60|$|Poor Shadow was so {{confused}} {{he did not}} know what to say or do. He sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>the</b> picture <b>of</b> despair.|$|R
60|$|The manager {{made his}} escape and his relief was obvious. Hunterleys sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{will think}} it strange," [...] he murmured reflectively, {{sitting on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> thoughtfully pulling off his socks. [...] "She is sure to think it strange." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get up!" [...] Janet commanded, {{and watched}} her rather anxiously, {{uncertain}} as to the after effects of drunkenness. But Lise got up. She sat on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> yawned, putting {{her hand to her}} forehead.|$|E
60|$|The awakened sleeper groaned, {{sat up in}} the darkness, {{and felt}} gropingly in this unaccustomed bed and bedroom first for the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> then for the {{electric}} light that was possibly on the little bedside table.|$|E
5000|$|... {{to sit on}} <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> for a {{while before}} getting up and going to the toilet ...|$|R
60|$|The next instant Martin {{was seated}} on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> with <b>the</b> cub face {{downward}} across his knees.|$|R
60|$|Bill sat {{motionless}} on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> {{in their}} little room in San Jose that night, a musing expression in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{was awakened}} {{about two hours}} later by the sounds of excited talking. He opened his eyes to behold Polly Vane {{standing}} in the dormitory fully dressed, while Phil {{was sitting on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> Ben and Roger and some others were just rousing up.|$|E
60|$|Again he had {{recourse}} {{to the food}} shelf, where he emptied the sugar from a large paper bag. Into this he thrust the diamonds, large and small, wrapped {{it up in a}} bandana handkerchief, and stowed it away under his pillow. Then {{he sat down on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> took off his shoes.|$|E
60|$|Karenin {{lay on the}} {{bed with}} a soft white rug about him, and Fowler, who was to be his surgeon sat on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> talked to him. An {{assistant}} was seated quietly in the shadow behind the bed. The examination had been made, and Karenin knew what was before him. He was tired but serene.|$|E
60|$|Later, Strang {{was able}} to sit up on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> able to walk his first giddy steps, {{supported}} on either side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] sighed Ned, {{sitting down}} on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> {{with a look}} of despair, [...] "I came here by his invitation; and--" ...|$|R
60|$|I sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> waiting. In {{less than}} ten minutes the {{telephone}} bell rang again. Once more I heard Ashley's voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely," [...] said Mr. McClosky, seating {{himself on}} the extreme <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> painfully tucking his feet away under it,--"surely." [...] After a pause, he rubbed a short, thick, stumpy beard, that bore a general {{resemblance}} to a badly-worn blacking-brush, {{with the palm of}} his hand, and went on, [...] "You had a good time, Jinny?" ...|$|E
60|$|The visitor, justly {{concerned}} at {{his lack of}} intelligence, took {{a seat on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> spoke to him as a friend and a brother, but in vain. Mr. Scutts reminded him at last that it was medicine-time, after which, pain and weakness permitting, he {{was going to try to}} get a little sleep.|$|E
60|$|It WAS provoking. The contemplative German had {{collected}} {{a lot of}} short ham-bones--where she found them I cannot imagine--and had made of them a border around my wife's flower-bed. The bones stuck up straight a few inches above the ground, all along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> the marrow cavity of each one was filled with earth {{in which she had}} planted seeds.|$|E
6000|$|... "I surely will," [...] replied Columbine, gladly, and she {{sat down}} on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> [...] "Ben, you fetch that box and put his dinner on it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gee Christopher! what's <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> your {{throwing}} {{cold water}} on this camp meeting?" [...] came from Walt Baxter, who sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> munching an apple.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you're ready, are you?" [...] said Katharine, half {{turning in}} <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> her operations, {{and looking at}} Cassandra, who sat, {{clasping}} her knees, on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R
60|$|He paused, and, gently {{releasing}} Columbine, {{he went to}} Moore, and retied his loosened bandage, {{and spread}} out the disarranged blankets. Then {{he sat down on}} the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> bent over a little, running a roughened hand through the scant hair that had begun to silver upon his head. Presently he looked up, and from that sallow face, with its lines and furrows, and from the deep, inscrutable eyes, there fell a light which, however sad and wise in its infinite understanding of pain and strife, was still ruthless and unquenchable in its hope.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} an hour ago that I went into my bedroom, and was {{brushing}} my hair before the glass, when suddenly my eyes lit upon something which left me so sick and cold that I sat down upon the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> began to cry. It is many a long year since I shed tears, but all my nerve was gone, and I could but sob and sob in impotent grief and anger. There was my house jacket, the coat I usually wear after dinner, hanging on its peg by the wardrobe, with the right sleeve thickly crusted from wrist to elbow with daubs of green paint.|$|E
60|$|So that, for {{the night}} at least, the notion of flight must be abandoned. What the morrow would bring forth we must wait and see. Perhaps some way of escape would offer itself. Then my {{thoughts}} returned to Paola, and I was tortured by surmises as to her fate, and chiefly as to how she could have eluded the search {{that must have been}} made for her in the hut where I had left her. Had the peasant befriended her, I wondered; and what did she think of my protracted absence? I sat on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> gave rein to my conjectures. The noises in the castle had all ceased, and still I sat on, unconscious of time, my taper burning low.|$|E
60|$|He went out, {{bearing the}} light with him; but Swanhild {{rose from the}} ground and sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> staring into <b>the</b> {{darkness}} and shuddering from time to time.|$|R
6000|$|I obeyed. She sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> A flush {{had come}} to her cheeks, and her eyes were very bright. [...] "I asked you," [...] she repeated, [...] "not to talk." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the upper}} hall Richard asked Frank {{to come to}} his room, and giving his friend a chair and seating himself upon <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> he told <b>of</b> his {{adventure}} with Norris.|$|R
60|$|Often {{she could}} not eat in the evening. She {{would sit on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> cry hopelessly, with a long, feeble, peculiarly {{feminine}} sobbing, till Mrs. Lawrence slammed the door and went off to the motion pictures. Una kept repeating a little litany she had made regarding the things she wished people would stop doing--praying to be delivered from Ross's buoyant egotism, from Mrs. Lawrence's wearing of Una's best veils, from Mr. Schwirtz's acting as though he wanted to kiss her whenever he had a whisky breath, from the office-manager who came in to chat with her just when she was busiest, from the office-boy who always snapped his fingers as he went down the corridor outside her door, and from the elevator-boy who sucked his teeth.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a small}} room, such as {{is devoted}} to a concierge. A wood fire sparkled in the grate. At one side stood a truckle bed, and at the other a coarse wooden chair, with a round table in the centre, which bore {{the remains of a}} meal. As the visitor's eye glanced round he could not but remark with an ever-recurring thrill that all the small details of the room were of the most quaint design and antique workmanship. The candlesticks, the vases upon the chimney-piece, the fire-irons, the {{ornaments}} upon the walls, were all such as he had been wont to associate with the remote past. The gnarled heavy-eyed man sat himself down upon the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> motioned his guest into the chair.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{long walk}} to North Oakland, {{but it was not}} until he went up the steps and entered his room that he knew he had walked it. He found himself sitting on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> staring about him like an awakened somnambulist. He noticed [...] "Overdue" [...] lying on the table and drew up his chair and reached for his pen. There was in his nature a logical {{compulsion}} toward completeness. Here was something undone. It had been deferred against the completion of something else. Now that something else had been finished, and he would apply himself to this task until it was finished. What he would do next he did not know. All that he did know was that a climacteric in his life had been attained. A period had been reached, and he was rounding it off in workman-like fashion. He was not curious about the future. He would soon enough find out what it held in store for him. Whatever it was, it did not matter. Nothing seemed to matter.|$|E
60|$|He ran lightly downstairs, and {{the young}} man, sitting on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> waited. Ten minutes passed, and he heard Mr. Wragg returning, {{followed}} by his niece. He slipped back into bed again.|$|R
6000|$|Francis {{tried to}} speak again but his words beat against a wall of silence. He sat upon <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> shivering. In that moment of agony he seemed to hear again <b>the</b> echo <b>of</b> Oliver Hilditch's mocking words: ...|$|R
60|$|Tired <b>of</b> {{sitting on}} <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> Dave {{got up and}} tried to move around. Then he made the {{discovery}} that his ankles were tied to a rope that was secured to <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and that <b>the</b> latter was stationary.|$|R
