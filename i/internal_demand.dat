40|$|AbstractSynchronization of EEG alpha {{activity}} has {{been referred to}} as being indicative of cortical idling, but according to more recent evidence it has also been associated with active internal processing and creative thinking. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate to what extent EEG alpha synchronization is related to <b>internal</b> processing <b>demands</b> and to specific cognitive process involved in creative thinking. To this end, EEG was measured during a convergent and a divergent thinking task (i. e., creativity-related task) which once were processed involving low and once involving high <b>internal</b> processing <b>demands.</b> High <b>internal</b> processing <b>demands</b> were established by masking the stimulus (after encoding) and thus preventing further bottom-up processing. Frontal alpha synchronization was observed during convergent and divergent thinking only under exclusive top-down control (high <b>internal</b> processing <b>demands),</b> but not when bottom-up processing was allowed (low <b>internal</b> processing <b>demands).</b> We conclude that frontal alpha synchronization is related to top-down control rather than to specific creativity-related cognitive processes. Frontal alpha synchronization, which has been observed in a variety of different creativity tasks, thus may not reflect a brain state that is specific for creative cognition but can probably be attributed to high <b>internal</b> processing <b>demands</b> which are typically involved in creative thinking...|$|R

25|$|In {{his first}} two years in office, Perón nationalized the Central Bank and paid off its billion-dollar debt to the Bank of England; nationalized the {{railways}} (mostly owned by British and French companies), merchant marine, universities, public utilities, public transport (then, mostly tramways); and, probably most significantly, created a single purchaser for the nation's mostly export-oriented grains and oilseeds, the Institute for the Promotion of Trade (IAPI). The IAPI wrested control of Argentina's famed grain export sector from entrenched conglomerates such as Bunge y Born; but when commodity prices fell after 1948, it began shortchanging growers. IAPI profits were used to fund welfare projects, while <b>internal</b> <b>demand</b> was encouraged by large wage increases given to workers; average real wages rose by about 35% from 1945 to 1949, while during that same period, labor's share of national income rose from 40% to 49%. Access to health care was also made a universal right by the Workers' Bill of Rights enacted on 24 February 1947 (subsequently incorporated into the 1949 Constitution as Article 14-b), while social security was extended to virtually all members of the Argentine working class.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relation}} between university management and open access scholarly publishing in Sweden. Open access is generally promoted in Swedish national research policy, referring to internationally adopted recommendations on free access to knowledge by researchers and citizens alike. In principle, the conditions for universities to not only promote but also actively contribute to open access by hosting open access scholarly journals could therefore be deemed adequate. In reality, however, many universities choose to adapt only to external systems of assessment and disregard <b>internal</b> <b>demands</b> from the research community. Since hosting open access scholarly journals is not favored by existing external systems of assessment, university management that does not also act on <b>internal</b> <b>demands</b> from the research community {{runs the risk of}} becoming an obstacle rather than an enabler of open access scholarly publishing...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} theory of social control—achieved through a {{combination}} of state control and institutional changes, and individuals' compliance and cooperation achieved with the aid of the central authority—to analyze collective farms restructuring in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). The control function of the state—or external stimuli—is reflected through government intervention and protectionism. Through power mechanisms, the government intervenes to reduce uncertainty regarding privatization, bargain with farmers, negotiate new legal forms and control economic resources. Farmers' behavior is not only regulated by external pressures and constraints. It is also regulated by farmers' <b>internal</b> <b>demands</b> and preferences. However, the impact of this control is never total. ...|$|R
