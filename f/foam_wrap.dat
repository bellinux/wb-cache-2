40|$|An {{investigation}} on {{the feasibility of}} a crushable foamwrap productfor mitigation of annulus pressure buildup on the Linnorm projecthave been performed. Several different aspects of this technology havebeen investigated, including the collapse behaviour of the foam wrapand fluid behaviour when exposed to heat, HSE issues related to theproduct and the practical aspect around using this solution. A Literature study revealed that the annular pressure build-up, whena crushable foam is in place, have not been formulated hence a mathematicalmodel have been developed, explaining the pressure pressurebuild-up when the <b>foam</b> <b>wrap</b> is in place. This model have not yet beenverified since it requires monitoring of the B-annulus in a well that isyet to be drilled. Data describing the thermodynamic properties of annularfluids, needed to calculate the annular pressure build-up simplydoes not exist to the authors knowledge, hence the pressure build-upin the model have been calculated {{on the basis of}} using standard seawateras this is the only saline solution where the thermodynamic datais available. Laboratory measurements revealed that once the matrixfracture pressure is reached, fluid start propagating through the crackand into the collapsed glass spheres. Simulations on the cementing haveshown {{that it is possible to}} install the crushable foam-wrap withoutfracturing the foam in some sections. The flow restrictions however,due to reduction in annular clearance, creates a need to design a foamwith a collapse rating. With the information that is currently available, it is not possible togive a recommendation on what vendor to progress with.

The treated fruits in each treatment were then packaged in a <b>foam</b> tray, <b>wrapped</b> with 11 μm PVC film and stored at 5 °C, 95 % RH for 27 days. Pericarp browning, pericarp color, pericarp pH, titratable acidity (TA), weight loss, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and total phenol were monitored during storage. The results revealed that interaction betweenchitosan and CA demonstrated the best treatment in postponement of pericarp browning, which was indicated by the lowest browning index and high L* value, chroma, and hue angle. Based on browning index, the fruits treated with citric acid alone and the control fruits were not acceptable after 20 days, which those treated with both CA and chitosan were still acceptable after 27 days of storage. TA had a correlation with the pericarp pH and browning index. Chitosan mixed with citric acid exhibited a higher efficacy in preventing TA degradation in pericarp and maintaining low pericarp pH, compared to 1. 0 % CA treatment.

40|$|A {{cylindrical}} electrochemical reactor with a 3 {{in diameter}} copper or nickel metal foam cathode and a concentric carbon cloth anode {{was used to}} destroy aqueous phase carbon tetrachloride (CT). The results show that a high CT conversion can be achieved in regions of the cathode near the anode, but a low CT conversion is obtained in the region around {{the center of the}} cathode. This CT conversion distribution in the radial current-conducting direction suggests that a portion of the cathode worked inefficiently even though the overall CT conversion is still adequate. Further research by changing the solution pH and conductivity suggests that the radial conversion distribution is due to radial variations in cathode surface availability. The inherent difficulties that these results imply with regards to reactor scale up suggested a new approach to the design. An annular reactor, consisting of a thin (3. 2 mm) nickel <b>foam</b> cathode <b>wrapped</b> around an inert Plexiglas core and separated for an external concentric anode by a semi-permeable membrane was adopted. Under compatible operating conditions, the annular reactor showed a high overall effluent CT conversion. However, experiments at low pH (2. 25) yielded higher conversions than under neutral pH conditions. This result suggests that CT conversion is favored by a relatively high proton concentration. This reactor can be simulated by a one dimensional model. The annular reactor was used to destroy PCE and TCE successfully, which suggests that this technique can be employed to treat groundwater contaminated with complex mixtures of chlorinated hydrocarbons. A multi-layer reactor based on the principle of the annular reactor was developed as an option for the scale up of the system. This reactor exhibited high and uniform radial CT conversion...|$|R
40|$|Pneumococcal {{otitis media}} is most {{frequent}} {{in young children}} and {{is a matter of}} concern in cochlear implantation. In the course of the 'implantation surgery the physiological barrier between the middle ear and inner ear is broken down by incising the round window membrane or by fenestration of the cochlear wall. It is feared that the insertion of an electrode array into the scala tympani could provide a pathway for microorganisms and toxins to enter the cochlea, resulting in labyrinthitis. To assess the actual risk of, secondary inner ear infection post implantation we developed a cat animal model of otitis media. In addition we examined the, effectiveness of different sealing strategies compared to the alternative of leaving the electrode entry point unprotected. For sealing of the cochlea fibrous tissue or gelatine <b>foam</b> was <b>wrapped</b> around the electrode in the round window niche. 22 kittens (44 ears) were used for this study 32, ears were implanted at 2 months of age, and all 44 ears were inoculated after 2 months with a broth of, streptococcus pneumoniae and the animals sacrificed one week later. The bullae of the animals were swabbed and the cochleas processed and examined under light microscopy. Histological analysis of the cochleas showed,the� highest incidence (45 %) of labyrinthine spread of infection in the unimplanted control group. Suppurative or serous labyrinthitis was found in only one third (33. 3 %) of the implanted and unsealed cochleas. In contrast only one of 16 sealed cochleas, (6. 2 %) showed labyrinthine signs of acute inflammation. Experimental pneumococcal otitis media could be reliably established in all animals and proved to be a valuable animal model for the testing of the intracochlear spread of infection. We conclude that a cochlear implant electrode inserted via the round window does not increase the risk of tympanogenic abyrinthitis. Our results indicate that grafting of the electrode entry point results in significant protection of the inner ear against labyrinthine spread of ototis media along the leadwire of the cochlear implant. 24 - 27 SeptemberOpen Acces...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a rapidly}} growing demand for more {{environmentally}} sustainable materials in the construction industry. Natural flax fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) have potential applications as lightweight skins for utility poles, pedestrian bridge elements, and small wind turbine shafts but the structural behaviour of flax-FRP <b>wrapped</b> <b>foam</b> beams {{has yet to be}} investigated. Six beams with various internal foam density and fibre arrangements were constructed and tested. A control beam was made using one glass-FRP (one layer of longitudinal fibres, one transverse) while the remaining used flax-FRP. A fabrication technique for constructing the tubes was developed and presented here. An arrangement using 5 layers of longitudinal flax fibres and 3 hoop flax fibres gives similar strength to the glass-FRP control; 4 longitudinal and 3 hoop flax fibres is expected to give similar stiffness to the glass-FRP control. Flexural strength and stiffness was found to be proportional to the number of longitudinal layers. Increasing the amount of hoop layers shifted the failure mode from compression to tension controlled. Flax-FRP beams that failed in compression gave slightly more warning and higher deflections than those that failed in tension. The results show that flax-FRP skinned foam beams have potential applications in lightweight construction but further testing under environmental and cyclic loading is recommended before these tubes are used in practice...|$|R

In order to control such a complex system, much {{research has been done}} in the field of kinematics. There exist two derivations of kinematic solutions, forward and inverse. The forward kinematic (FK) solution tends to be much simpler than its inverse kinematic (IK) counterpart. There has been many methods developed to quickly, and efficiently solve the IK in order to control the position and orientation of a robot. This thesis details the process of developing the IK solution and two gait algorithms for TigerBug. The IK solution was developed by first solving for the FK solution of TigerBug using Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Parameters. After the FK solution was solved, differentials were applied to each equation in order to solve for the IK solution. Once the IK solution was tested, a fixed gait algorithm was developed in order to understand basic motion control of hexapod locomotion. Once the fixed gait was implemented successfully a rule-based free gait algorithm was developed. The rule-based free gait was accomplished using the rule set governed by restrictiveness to determine when leg state transitions were to occur, as described in the literature. Once implemented, the different combinations of gait parameters were tested for quickness of convergence and efficiency to determine the most optimal set of walking parameters for TigerBug...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{application}} of metal foam heat exchangers to the air-cooled condensers of geothermal power plants in Australia where the resources are mostly located at the arid areas {{where there is no}} water for evaporative cooling of the power plant. One way to remove the heat from the thermodynamic cycles is to use (the most common) finned-tube heat exchangers, consisting of tubes with external fins to increase the air-side heat exchange surface. Another possible alternative is a class of designed porous materials called metal foams, containing such advantages as low-density, high area/volume ratio, and high strength structure. Therefore, they have been applied in a variety of industrial. The numerical study, in three main sections, has been conducted to explore that possibility. First, a comparison between the performance of a metal foam-wrapped solid cylinder in cross-flow and a commercially available finned-tune heat exchanger is investigated. Effects of the key parameters including the free-stream velocity and characteristics of metal foam such as porosity, permeability, and form drag coefficient on heat and fluid flow are examined. Being a determining factor in pressure drop and heat transfer increment, the porous layer thickness is changed systematically to observe that there is an optimum layer thickness beyond which the heat transfer does not improve while the pressure drop continues to increase. This has been verified by {{the application of}} Bejan’s Intersection of Asymptotes method. Results have been compared to those of a finned-tube heat exchanger to observe a higher area goodness factor for metal foam-wrapped cylinder. In the second part, an optimization study is carried out to discover an optimized design of metal foam heat exchangers as replacements for finned-tubes in air-cooled condensers of a geothermal power plant. Two different optimization techniques, based on first and second law (of thermodynamics) are reported. While the former leads to the highest heat transfer rate with as low pressure drop as possible, the latter minimizes the generated entropy in the thermodynamic system. Interestingly the two methods lead to the same optimal design. The new design has been compared to the conventional air-cooled condenser designed and optimized by using the commercially available software ASPEN. It is shown that while the heat transfer rate increases significantly (by an order of magnitude) compared to the finned tube for the same main flow obstruction height, the pressure drop increase is within an acceptable range. Further comparison between the two systems are carried out, making use of Mahjoob and Vafai 2 ̆ 7 s performance factor developed specifically for metal foam heat exchangers. Following that, the third part explores the heat transfer from a metal foam-wrapped tube bundle. Effects of key parameters, including the free stream velocity, longitudinal and transversal tube pitch, metal foam thickness and characteristics of the foam on heat and fluid flow are examined. It can be observed that the performance of the metal foam heat exchangers, measured in terms of area goodness factor, can be about four times better than that of the conventional design of finned-tube heat exchangers. It is also found that even a very thin layer of metal <b>foam,</b> when <b>wrapped</b> around a bare tube bundle, can significantly improve the area goodness factor.
