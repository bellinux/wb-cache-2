5|$|By {{contrast}} Sherman was {{a popular}} hero in the North and well regarded by <b>his</b> <b>soldiers.</b> Military historians have paid special attention to his Atlanta campaign and the March to the Sea, generally giving him high marks as an innovative strategist and quick-witted tactician.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla {{was assassinated}} {{the next year}} {{on the road to}} Carrhae by <b>his</b> <b>soldiers.</b> After this debacle, the Parthians made a {{settlement}} with Macrinus (r.217–218) where the Romans paid Parthia over two-hundred million denarii with additional gifts.|$|E

5|$|Custine's {{leadership}} and character, although impugned by the Tribunal, proved fundamentally {{sound in the}} field. As an admirer of the Prussian style of drill and discipline, he was a strict disciplinarian, but <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> actually liked him, and felt inspired by him. Custine liked to make speeches and reportedly knew the names of <b>his</b> <b>soldiers.</b> He visited men in the hospital, demonstrated blunt good humor, and was the master of repartee. His ready wit was quoted throughout his command. He did not tolerate disorder or insubordination however; when encountering a troop of volunteers in 1792, who bragged {{that they were going}} to teach the army the right step (make it Republican), he ordered his cavalry to surround and disarm them.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Soundwave assembles a newer, more {{powerful}} chassis for Megatron, {{using it to}} resurrect him. Megatron then challenges Starscream and his loyalists for leadership of the Decepticons, kills <b>his</b> <b>soldiers,</b> defeats him and frees the Combaticons. He then leads a full-scale assault on the Autobot stronghold {{in the ruins of}} Iacon, where the massive Decepticon Trypticon's remains are kept. Megatron and <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> invade the facility and he takes Trypticon's power core, the heart of a transformer. He informs Trypticon that he is not being rescued as he , but he congratulates him for destroying Iacon City and thousands more Autobots. Trypticon is then transformed into the Nemesis, the Decepticon flagship.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when they}} reached the American compound, Lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} may have mingled with the crowd. Instead, Lownds ordered <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese artillery shells continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the lack of support and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people were being treated more like an enemy. On 10 February, Laotian civilian refugees started walking back to Laos along Highway 9, because they feared for their lives and preferred to die in their own country. On February 15, through arrangements made by the Laotian embassy in Saigon, the Laotian commander and <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> were flown back to their country on a Royal Laotian Air Force C-47 transport aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Remaining true to the Spartan {{ideals of}} austere living practices, Agesilaus {{rejected}} the gold saying “he {{would rather see}} it in <b>his</b> <b>soldier’s</b> hands than <b>his</b> own.” Agesilaus did, however, remove his army into Phrygia, grateful {{for the death of}} Tissaphernes.|$|R
5|$|In 62 BC, Pompey {{returned}} victorious from Asia, but {{the senate}} refused to ratify the arrangements {{that he had made}} with <b>his</b> <b>soldiers.</b> Pompey, in effect, became powerless, and thus when Julius Caesar returned from his governorship in Spain in 61 BC, he found it easy to make an arrangement with Pompey. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, known as the First Triumvirate. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements in Asia were to be ratified, and <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> were to be given land. Caesar was to be elected Consul in 59 BC, and then serve as governor of Gaul for five years. Crassus was to be promised a future Consulship.|$|E
5|$|In October, Texians engaged Mexican {{troops in}} the first {{official}} battle of the Texas Revolution. Determined to quell the rebellion, Santa Anna began assembling a large force, the Army of Operations in Texas, to restore order. Most of <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> were raw recruits, {{and a large number}} had been forcibly conscripted.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a number}} of other Australians were {{subsequently}} involved in the Malleson Mission under Major General (Sir) Wilfrid Malleson in Turkestan during 1918–1919, but they also saw little fighting. Malleson's aim was to block possible German-Turkish thrusts towards India and Afghanistan, but instead <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> became involved in fighting the Bolsheviks around Merv. The force withdrew by April 1919.|$|E

60|$|The Spaniards {{prefer to}} believe that after Jehan de Béthencourt's attack upon the Canaries (A.D. 1403), <b>his</b> <b>soldier</b> Lancelot, who named Lanzarote Island, touched at Porto Santo in 1417; and presently, sailing to the south-west, {{discovered}} Madeira. This appears reasonable enough.|$|R
50|$|Morychus: A notorious gourmand who was {{possibly}} also a tragic poet, he is named in lines 506 and 1142 as emblematic of a pampered life and because <b>his</b> <b>soldier's</b> kit resembles a Persian gown. He is mentioned also {{in two other}} plays.|$|R
5|$|On {{the north}} side of Zion Square stands the Jerusalem Hostel. This lodging opened as the Tel Aviv Hotel in 1926 and later became known as the Ron Hotel.

5|$|Once the {{fortress}} had been captured, Murad placed his own garrison of Janissaries and ordered {{his men to}} repair the walls. Perlati and <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> came to Skanderbeg, begging for mercy. Skanderbeg pardoned <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> for the surrender and even thanked them for holding out {{for as long as}} they did. Skanderbeg continued to shadow the Ottoman army as it headed back home in the hopes of dealing some serious damage, but his forces were not strong enough to risk provoking them. In October of the same year, Murad managed to inflict a serious a defeat on John Hunyadi's forces in Kosovo. Skanderbeg had planned to join Hunyadi's offensive with 20,000 men, but he was not able to get there in time due to Đurađ Branković blocking the roads to Kosovo.|$|E
5|$|Rtas 'Vadum {{is known}} for being a quick, smart, and ingenious tactician and an unparalleled fighter, {{especially}} with an Energy Sword and is an excellent leader.

25|$|Nelson's parents opposed his volunteering, {{but he saw}} it as a {{patriotic}} duty. He sent half <b>his</b> <b>soldier's</b> pay to <b>his</b> parents to help retire the debt on the farm. He seems to have enjoyed army life, noting that the food was better than at home. He shared the frustration of <b>his</b> fellow <b>soldiers</b> over not being put into battle soon enough. His unit moved from Racine to Camp Dix near Baltimore, Maryland. From there they moved to combat operations in Louisiana.|$|R
50|$|August 27: High ranking MEND {{commander}} Soboma George {{is killed}} {{by some of}} <b>his</b> own <b>soldiers.</b> <b>His</b> killers say they killed him because he ordered a hit on Rivers State governor Rotimi Amaechi.|$|R
5|$|The {{constant}} Dutch attacks led Sudirman, {{perhaps at}} the suggestion of one of his men, to change his clothes and give his old outfit to one of <b>his</b> <b>soldiers,</b> Second Lieutenant Heru Kesser– who bore a resemblance to Sudirman. Kesser was ordered to head south with a large company of soldiers, remove the clothes, and furtively return north, while Sudirman waited in Karangnongko. The diversion was successful, and on 27December Sudirman and his men made their way to Jambu Village. Arriving on 9January 1949, Sudirman met with several government ministers who had not been present during the Dutch attack on Yogyakarta: Supeno, Susanto Tirtoprojo, and Susilowati. With the politicians, Sudirman made his way to Banyutuwo, ordering some of <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> to linger back and hold off Dutch ground troops. In Banyutuwo, they held for over a week. However, on 21January, when Dutch forces approached the village, Sudirman and his entourage were forced to leave, fighting their way out in heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Lieutenant-General Renya Mutaguchi, {{commander of}} the Japanese 18th Division toured the hospital and distributed tinned fruits, all the while apologising profusely for the brutality of <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> and assured the staff of their safety.

5|$|The last {{sentence}} {{of the passage}} is similar to one from the Republican era Biography of Song Yue, Prince of E. But instead of teaching them his own technique, it states Yue taught what he had learned from Zhou to <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> who were victorious in battle.|$|E
50|$|Outram {{had also}} failed to protest his orders not to advance on 14 March, which had allowed most rebels to escape.

60|$|The change, the sea air, and the {{prospect}} of seeing his father again greatly benefited Charlie, and, while the company was marched to a large building assigned to their use, he was able to make his way on foot to his father's, assisted by <b>his</b> <b>soldier</b> servant, Jock Armstrong.|$|R

5|$|Von Kressenstein had {{prepared}} successive lines of defence during his advance towards Romani, and despite losing one artillery battery {{and more than}} one third of <b>his</b> <b>soldiers,</b> fought a series of effective rearguard actions which slowed the pursuit by British Empire mounted troops and enabled his force to retreat back to El Arish.|$|E
5|$|When {{the workers}} refused, the Governor of Katanga, Amour Maron, shot Mpoyi, killing him. The Governor then ordered <b>his</b> <b>soldiers</b> to {{fire on the}} other strikers in the stadium.

5|$|Affairs became further {{complicated}} when, on 2February 1583, {{also known as}} Candlemas, Gebhard married Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben in a private house in Rosenthal, outside of Bonn.
