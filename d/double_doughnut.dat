50|$|Donald Duk, a 1991 {{novel by}} Frank Chin, {{includes}} {{a version of}} the story using the Cantonese spelling Ngawk Fay. Chin uses the version of the story in which Yue Fei's mother inscribes the tattoo on his back; Chin also uses the version of the story in which the married couple who betrays him are immortalized as the origin of a Chinese <b>double</b> <b>doughnut,</b> which is fried and cut open {{as a sign of the}} people's hatred for the couple's treachery toward him.|$|E
5000|$|The cyanobacterial {{circadian}} {{system is}} so far unique {{in that it is}} the only circadian system in which the structures of full-length clock proteins have been solved. In fact, the structures of all three of the Kai proteins have been determined. KaiC forms a hexamer that resembles a <b>double</b> <b>doughnut</b> with a central pore that is partially sealed at one end. There are twelve ATP-binding sites in KaiC and the residues that are phosphorylated during the in vitro phosphorylation rhythm have been identified. KaiA has two major domains and forms dimers in which the N-terminal domains are [...] "swapped" [...] with the C-terminal domains. KaiB has been successfully crystallized from three different species of cyanobacteria and forms dimers or tetramers.|$|E
