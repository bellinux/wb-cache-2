40|$|Health {{insurance}} companies should offer plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces {{that cover the}} cost of basic outpatient carelike primary care, specialty care, and prescription drugsbefore people pay off their deductible. The new federal standardized silver plans, released by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) earlier this year, will do just that.   New, original research shows that federal standardized plans are a good deal for consumers who need a plan that covers basic health care services before they meet their deductible. Our report found that: The federal standardized silver plans would have premiums that are comparable to current silver marketplace plans that cover little to no services before the deductible. Offering these standardized plans could improve access to outpatient care without <b>driving</b> up <b>premiums.</b> Families USA produced the report with Milliman, an independent actuarial firm.   Families USA believes that insurers in all 34 states with federally facilitated marketplaces should offer these plans in 2017 so that consumers in these states have access to these plan options. In 2018 and future years, we urge the federal government to require insurers in these states to offer the federal standardized plans...|$|R
40|$|Researchers at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) have {{examined}} the impact {{of different kinds of}} State laws in a number of previous studies. This study examines the impact of State legislation that caps damage awards in malpractice cases on decisions of physicians about where to practice medicine. Twenty-four States now have laws that limit damage payments in malpractice cases. Most of these laws limit the amounts paid for noneconomic damages (e. g., pain and suffering) but a few limit both economic (e. g., medical expenses and lost wages) and noneconomic damages. There is currently a national debate on the desirability of extending caps on malpractice damage awards to all States, and President Bush recently introduced a proposal to cap payments for noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases at $ 250, 000. Supporters of legislation to cap damages in malpractice cases maintain that it reduces malpractice premiums and helps insure an adequate supply of physicians. They also assert that escalating, multi-million-dollar jury awards are <b>driving</b> malpractice <b>premium</b> increases and that capping damage awards for pain and suffering helps restrain the rate o...|$|R
40|$|Although {{predictions}} that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) {{would lead to}} reductions in employer-sponsored health coverage have not been realized, some of the law's critics maintain the ACA is nevertheless <b>driving</b> higher <b>premium</b> and deductible costs for businesses and their workers. Goal: To compare cost growth in employer-sponsored health insurance before and after 2010, when the ACA was enacted, and to compare changes in these costs relative to changes in workers' incomes. Methods: The authors analyzed federal Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data to compare cost trends over the 10 -year period from 2006 to 2015. Key findings and conclusions: Compared to the five {{years leading up to}} the ACA, premium growth for single health insurance policies offered by employers slowed both in the nation overall and in 33 states and the District of Columbia. There has been a similar slowdown in growth in the amounts employees contribute to health plan costs.

This paper {{examines}} {{influences of}} brand dynamics on insurance premium productions in Turkey using a dynamic GMM panel estimation technique sampling 31 insurance firms over 2005 - 2015. The results reveals that brands trust {{appears as a}} chief <b>driving</b> force behind <b>premium</b> production where its unit increase augments premium outputs by 5. 32 million Turkish Liras (TL). Moreover, the brand value of firms also appears a statistically significant determinant of premium sales, but its size impact remains limited comparing to brand trust, i. e. a million TL increase in brand value generates only 0. 02 million TL increase in sales. On the other hand, the study also documents a strong momentum driven from past years premium production with trade-off magnitude of 1 to 0. 85.

40|$|With the 2004 U. S. presidential {{election}} close at hand, George W. Bush and his Administration resurrected a previously-killed federal proposal to cap medical malpractice damage awards. The Bush Administration once again {{claimed that the}} United States is experiencing a medical malpractice insurance crisis and that frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits are {{the cause of this}} crisis. According to the current Administration, large jury awards lead to significant increases in medical malpractice insurance <b>premiums,</b> <b>driving</b> physicians from the practice of medicine. Indeed, an array of policymakers continue to argue that damage caps will quell sharply increasing medical malpractice premiums, despite the fact that empirical evidence regarding the impact of damage caps on premiums is inconclusive. This Case Study argues that imposing statutory caps on medical malpractice damages is not an effective method of remedying the medical malpractice insurance crisis; therefore, policymakers should consider alternatives to damage caps. In particular, evidence suggests that implementing mandatory disclosure of the contract terms between managed care organization (MCOs) and physicians for the provision of services to enrollees reduces medical malpractice insurance premiums...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{literature}} has {{recognized the importance}} of regime changes in the calculation of ex-ante equity premia. However, the methodologies used to estimate equity premia only allow for very restrictive forms of regime transitions. This paper addresses the issue by postulating an evolving model for the law of motion of dividend growth, consumption growth and dividend-price ratio. Model parameters are then used to compute conditional and unconditional U. S. equity premia. We substantially extend and confirm previous work on the declining equity premium, and uncover important macroeconomic factors <b>driving</b> the equity <b>premium.</b> We find that the equity premium has declined, particularly from 1950 to 1971 and from 1988 to 2000. Our results point to changing consumption volatility as an important priced factor. We find that volatility of consumption growth is a good indicator of economic uncertainty and, as such, its changes are reflected in expected returns, and are priced by the market. We also find that not accounting for parameter time variation induces large pricing errors, as too little variation in dividend yields is attributed to changes in expected dividend growth. ...|$|R
40|$|Obtaining health {{insurance}} through an employer pools risk, but {{may lead to}} moral hazard, where employees with more coverage seek care valued below cost, and adverse selection, where the unhealthy choose more generous plans, <b>driving</b> up <b>premiums.</b> In the first essay, I model the decision to choose the more generous employer plan, which suggests testable empirical predictions. Using MEPS data from 1996 - 2001, I find that enrollees in non-HMO plans, but not HMO plans, spend more on medical care the more generous their plan, indicating moral hazard. Within HMO or non-HMO options, the more generous plan does not enroll the unhealthier employees, but adverse selection may lead to healthier employees choosing an HMO over a non-HMO. The second essay, written with Catherine McLaughlin, examines the growing disparity between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites in {{health insurance}} coverage. While the percentage of non-Hispanic Whites without health insurance has fallen slightly since 1983, the uninsured rate has risen dramatically among Hispanics. Using 25 years of SIPP data, we find that differences in citizenship and education {{explain some of the}} divergence, but {{more than half of the}} increase in the gap, or more than one million extra uninsured Hispanics, remains unexplained by differences in any observable characteristic. While observable differences account for most of the divergence in public and employer coverage rates, much of the decline in family coverage remains unexplained. In the final essay, I examine the decision to select a health insurance plan from the options offered by one's employer, considering not only the level of the plan's financial generosity, but also the variability of out-of-pocket spending under the plan. I also consider other elements that may differ between plans, including access to providers and supplemental coverage. I find that employees demand a plan with lower expected out-of-pocket costs, but that the variance of a plan's out-of-pocket spending has no effect on plan choice. Employees are only weakly responsive to their share of the premium, but do tend to choose the most popular plan at a firm, suggesting the importance of unobserved plan quality differences and/or the employees opting for the default plan...|$|R
40|$|This three-essay thesis {{focuses on}} how {{value of the}} brand, i. e. brand equity is created, with each study {{investigating}} {{different parts of the}} relationships within the brand value chain. My first essay identifies and tests a new set of brand equity drivers such as brand structure and positioning, brand strategy, and customer characteristics. I use revenue premium as the retail level measure of brand equity and decompose it into price and volume premiums. Then, I explore the effects of different brand equity drivers on these premiums. The study on the universe of grocery industry in the U. S. shows compelling evidences that volume premium prevails over price <b>premium</b> in <b>driving</b> revenue <b>premium.</b> Brand structure and positioning, brand strategy and customer characteristics contribute significantly to the changes of the brand market performance measured with price, volume and revenue premiums. My second essay examines the association between consumer-based brand equity (IBBE) and brand market performance, and the moderators of this association. I explore a comprehensive set of market performance measures (penetration, loyalty, market share, price and revenue) of 216 major brands sold in the grocery channel in the U. S., in conjunction with EquiTrend© brand equity measure. The results show that customer based brand equity provides incremental explanatory power for brand market performance beyond the explanation by a wide array of performance determinants identified in the first essay. Furthermore, the equity-performance association is moderated by a set of product and category features, as well as the firm brand strategy. My third essay studies whether firms benefit from having multiple brands across different areas. I model brand market performance as a function of different elements of the firm brand portfolio, including the size and performance of sibling brands and the inter-brand distance. The dataset includes 1, 700 brands from over 350 firms in the grocery channel within the U. S. The results show that the brand portfolio information provides incremental explanatory power for brand market performance. Moreover, the size and the performance of sibling brands have significant impact on a focal brand 2 ̆ 7 s market performance, and these impacts are moderated by the inter-brand distance...|$|R

The analysis {{is based on the}} stochastic discount factor methodology, which imposes a no arbitrage condition on the relationship between the foreign exchange risk premium and its macroeconomic determinants. Estimation results suggest that U. S. inflation and consumption growth are important factors <b>driving</b> the risk <b>premium,</b> which is in line with the standard C-CAPM model. In addition, growth in international oil prices influences the risk premium, reflecting the important role played by the hydrocarbon sector in GCC economies. The methodology employed in this paper can be used for forecasting the risk premium on a monthly basis, which has important practical implications for policymakers interested in the timely monitoring of risks in the GCC.

40|$|A machine able to {{autonomously}} recognise driving styles has numerous applications, {{of which}} the most straightforward is to recognise risky behaviour. Such knowledge {{can be used to}} teach new drivers with the goal of reducing accidents in the future and increasing traffic safety for all road users. Furthermore, insurance companies can incentivise safe <b>driving</b> with lower <b>premiums,</b> which in turn can motivate a more careful driving style. Another application is within the field of autonomous vehicles where learning about driving styles is imperative for autonomous vehicles to be able to interact with other drivers in traffic. The first step towards identifying different driving styles is being able to recognise and distinguish between them. The aim of this thesis is to identify the indicators of aggressive driving in curves from a large amount of naturalistic driving data. The first step was finding curve sections to analyse within trips and the second step was reducing the data to become more manageable. Symbolic representations were used for the second preprocessing step, which in turn allowed the use of Natural Language Processing techniques for the analysis. We categorise drivers into different groups depending on their perceived tendency towards aggressive driving styles. This categorisation is used to compare the drivers and their driving style with each other. The tendencies used were Speeding, Braking, Jerky curve handling and Rough curve handling. Some general trends among the analysed drivers are also identified. It is possible to reuse the categorisation to include more drivers in the future or to use what we have learned about the features and drivers for further research...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the liquidity {{effect in}} Norway {{by examining the}} relationship between a range of liquidity variables and five different measures of the short-term interbank premium. The models are estimated on data from January 2007 and up to the end of September 2011, a period in which Norges Bank implemented its liquidity policy within a so-called floor system, and prior to the new liquidity system introduced on 3 October 2011. In a floor system the key policy rate is equal to banks’ deposit rate in the central bank, and as such, this analysis provides new information on the liquidity effect in a floor system. Both excess liquidity (total central bank reserves in the banking system) and structural liquidity (central bank reserves in the system before Norges Banks’ market operations) have, as expected, a negative a significant effect on almost all dependent variables. Structural liquidity is the important factor <b>driving</b> the interbank <b>premiums</b> during periods characterized by low volatility, while excess liquidity gained importance during the financial crisis. This result is in line with what should be expected in a floor system. Furthermore, in periods of financial turmoil European and Norwegian banks may face higher USD rates in the interbank market either because of a general USD liquidity premium or an institution specific credit premium. My analysis provides additional insight in the division between the liquidity premium and the credit premium in a way, to my knowledge, not done in earlier literature. The results indicate that during the financial crisis (2007 - 2009) the liquidity premium dominated in USD as the availability of credit deteriorated...|$|R
40|$|The {{deepening}} of {{the debt}} crisis in the euro area is due to three systemic causes which national governments {{are not able to}} overcome on their own. First, being members of a monetary union euro states cannot reverse the rise in public debt (caused by the financial crisis 2008) through devaluations. At the same time, they have no access to funds from a national central bank. Second, under "finance-capitalistic" framework conditions, speculators systematically exploit and strengthen the fiscal troubles in the weakest countries by <b>driving</b> up CDS <b>premiums</b> and interest rates to unsustainable levels. This (potentially) transforms a liquidity crisis into a solvency crisis. Third, these speculative activities widen the interest rate differentials within the euro area drastically thereby endangering the economic and political cohesion of the EMU and even of the EU. A systemic solution which restores the primacy of politics over speculation needs to stabilise interest rates for all euro countries. It is proposed to transform the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) into the European Monetary Fund (EMF). It would provide euro governments with financial means by selling Eurobonds. These bonds are guaranteed by all euro countries to an unlimited extent. The EMF would stabilise Eurobond interest rates at a level slightly below the level of medium-term economic growth (in nominal terms). The Eurobonds are held by investors with the EMF, they are not tradable but can be liquidated at any time. The EMF helps to restore sound public finances in euro countries in close cooperation with the ECB, the European Commission and national governments. To this end, the EMF provides funds for the euro states according to clear criteria ("conditionality") which are not exclusively restrictive.
