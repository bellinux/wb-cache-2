In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 {{he had heard the}} album, [...] "and it changed my life." [...] Nazareth took their name from [...] "The Weight" [...] - taken from the line [...] "I pulled into Nazareth, feeling half past dead" [...] Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album's influence on Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief, and journalist John Harris has suggested that The Band's debut also influenced the spirit of The Beatles' back-to-basics album Let It Be as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with Beggars Banquet. George Harrison said that his song [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] was heavily influenced by the Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. Meanwhile, the Big Pink song [...] "The Weight" [...] has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, [...] "We certainly didn't want everybody {{to go out and get}} a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to do now <b>is</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and record four sides, four psychedelic songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard feelings. Just pretty good rock and roll." ...|$|E

This private school is the best school I've seen in my life. It was judged one of the 100 best schools in America. It was phenomenal. The tuition was $5,500 a year, which {{is a lot of money}} for most parents. But the teachers were paid less than public school teachers - so it's not about money at the teacher level. I asked the state treasurer that year what California pays on average to send kids to school, and I believe it was $4,400. While there are not many parents who could come up with $5,500 a year, there are many who could come up with $1,000 a year.If we gave vouchers to parents for $4,400 a year, schools would be starting right and left.

5000|$|Back at the club, Nyx orders {{one of his}} minions {{to take a very}} injured Rand's {{memories}} of being tortured, hunt down Jonah, and give them to him. She does this by taking a medusa-like leech from her head and inserting into then removing it from the mark {{on the back of his}} neck, revealing what had happened earlier when paying for Jonah's session and what had happened with Elliot, implying that part of Nyx's business is selling people memories. Back with Jonah, he and the girl land in a quarry and after a few attempts to escape, she rapes him while singing, again creating a fantasy of him having sex with his fiance, Eva. When he comes back to himself, Jonah runs from the now sleeping girl and makes it back to his hotel room where the minion is waiting for him. She forces him to eat the leech and Jonah relives Rand's torture and the memory of Nyx speaking directly to him and offering a trade; the girl for Rand. All he has to do <b>is</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a church and the girl will follow him. Jonah agrees and follows the minion to the church.|$|E
50|$|Syrian {{women are}} legally allowed to {{participate}} in everyday life, although they are not guaranteed a spot in being part of political, social, cultural and economic categories. The legal marriage for females in Syria is seventeen years old and eighteen for males. Early marriage {{is not out of}} the ordinary in their culture. Even though the legal age is seventeen, the courts can allow for girls as young as thirteen to be married. Women are technically allowed to have a say in what the agreements are between them and the groom. Although, since this contract has to be signed by the groom and the male guardian of the bride, her wishes are rarely met. On the other hand, of marriage, the divorce laws are unique in Syria. Women are in fact allowed to file for divorce except it is a long drawn out process and she must get consent from her husband. There are some circumstances in which the woman can apply for a divorce through the judicial system. In order to do this, she must prove that her husband has abused her or neglected his other duties as a husband. If a man wants to divorce a woman, {{all he has to do}} <b>is</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> court and orally demand a divorce three times, then the court will order him a divorce.|$|E

50|$|The {{group of}} women include: Marirrosi, a {{divorced}} nurse from Bilbao who is lonely and looking for love; Patricia, {{a young woman with}} two children from the Dominican Republic who has been in Spain illegally and having difficulties to find decent work; and (joining later) Milady, a young Cuban who wants to see the world at any cost. They come to the town filled with eager men but not lots of opportunities other than farming. Patricia settles with Damian, a hardworking farmer who lives with his mother, Gregoria. Looking to find stability for her young children and a hard worker herself, Patricia tries in vain to find common ground with her stern mother-in-law, who seems to reject her because of her skin color and the fact that her son is no longer under her control. Patricia, with more time and experience in Spain, befriends the newcomer Milady. Milady settles with Carmelo an older Spanish man who wooed her in Havana. Carmelo tries to impress her with a big television and modern kitchen, but what she really wants to do <b>is</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> discos and have fun. She is in no way ready to settle down. Her dream of a life in Europe is very different from his fantasy of life with a gorgeous young wife. Milady is flirty and does not love Carmelo. Wanting to see the sea in Valencia, she takes a ride from a truck driver. When she comes back to town, the jealous Carmelo gives her a beating. Milady wishes she could leave him, but she has few friends and no real place to go.|$|E
