5000|$|The {{top drive}} allows the {{drilling}} rig to drill the longer section of a stand of drill pipe in one operation. A rotary table type rig can only drill 30 ft (single drill pipe) sections of drill pipe whereas a top drive can drill 60 - 90 ft stands (double and triple drill pipe respectively, a triple being three joints of drillpipe screwed together), depending on {{the drilling rig}} size. Handling longer sections of drill pipe enables a drilling rig to make greater daily progress because up to 90 ft can be drilled at a time, thus requiring fewer [...] "connections" [...] to add another 30 ft of drill pipe. Another advantage of top drive systems is time efficiency. When the bit progresses under a kelly drive, the entire string must be withdrawn from the well bore {{for the length of}} the kelly in order to add one more length of drill pipe. With a top drive, the <b>draw</b> <b>works</b> only has to pick up a new stand from the rack and make up two joints. Making fewer and quicker connections reduces the risk of a stuck string from annulus clogging while drilling fluid is not being pumped.|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringExcessive {{drill string}} {{torque and drag}} {{is one of the}} major {{limitations}} of extended-reach and horizontal drilling. The torque and drag models are used in the planning phase and during the drilling of a well, as a tool used for monitoring developing hole problems. The models used throughout the industry today are mostly based on equations presented more than two decades ago, little work have been done to improve upon these. The thesis gives a general overview of the various challenges of using such models. It is shown the importance of correcting for friction in the <b>draw</b> <b>works</b> sheaves to get realistic friction factors. A recently published model is used and work has been done to improve this model further. The model has some inaccuracies in the lower part of the string and a new model for drag in the lowest part is proposed. Further is a new criterion presented, for determining whether an element is straight or curved. This new criterion account for radial clearance between drill string and bore hole wall...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} a 5 year, $ 10 million Sandia/Industry project {{to develop an}} advanced borehole seismic source for use in {{oil and gas exploration}} and production. The development Team included Sandia, Chevron, Amoco, Conoco, Exxon, Raytheon, Pelton, and GRI. The seismic source that was developed is a vertically oriented, axial point force, swept frequency, clamped, reaction-mass vibrator design. It was based on an early Chevron prototype, but the new tool incorporates a number of improvements which make it far superior to the original prototype. The system consists of surface control electronics, a special heavy duty fiber optic wireline and <b>draw</b> <b>works,</b> a cablehead, hydraulic motor/pump module, electronics module, clamp, and axial vibrator module. The tool has a peak output of 7, 000 lbs force and a useful frequency range of 5 to 800 Hz. It can operate in fluid filled wells with 5. 5 -inch or larger casing to depths of 20, 000 ft and operating temperatures of 170 C. The tool includes fiber optic telemetry, force and phase control, provisions to add seismic receiver arrays below the source for single well imaging, and provisions for adding other vibrator modules to the tool in the future. The project yielded four important deliverables: a complete advanced borehole seismic source system with all associated field equipment; field demonstration surveys funded by industry showing the utility of the system; industrial sources for all of the hardware; and a new service company set up by their industrial partner to provide commercial surveys...|$|E

50|$|Thawan {{appeared}} to be prodigiously gifted artist {{since he was a}} child. In his youth, he had a consuming passion for Buddhism.

Thawan got good grades from his <b>drawing</b> <b>works</b> with his <b>drawing</b> <b>works</b> in university all along but he earned a low grade in Silpa’s drawing class. The reason his teacher gave to him is ‘your fish have no fishy smell, your bird can’t fly through the air, your horse can’t be ridden or rushed. You are just a copier not an actual artist’. Since then, Thawan started to work in a different way and became an outstanding student.|$|R
