40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{the control of the}} Crockett canal an {{automated}} control system for the <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> was proposed and an analysis of design alternatives was conducted. Design alternatives were analyzed based on the criteria of reliability, operational improvement, cost and safety. After the analysis was completed recommendations as to which type of automation system to install were made. A comprehensive design of the recommended design is included. The automation of the <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> has been separated into two phases. Items to be included in phase one are: retrofit each of the existing <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> with a multi-turn gate actuator and, installation of an electrical system to provide power to operate actuators. The electrical system will include provisions for future expansion phases, and a programmable data logger to provide automation. The estimated cost for this phase is $ 20, 000. The second phase includes the installation of a sliding gate for control of the spillway, and installation of a gate actuator to automate the new gate. The estimated cost of phase two is $ 13, 600. The design has been submitted to the canal company for approval...|$|R

40|$|In 2008, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory {{evaluated}} the Hofer Dam fish screen and provided technical assistance at two other fish passage sites as {{requested by the}} Bonneville Power Administration, the Walla Walla Watershed Council, or the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Evaluation of new sites such as Hofer Dam focuses on their design, construction, operation, and maintenance {{to determine if they}} effectively provide juvenile salmonids with safe passage through irrigation diversions. There were two requests for technical assistance in 2008. In the first, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation requested an evaluation of the Nursery Bridge fish screens associated with the fish ladder {{on the east side of}} the Walla Walla River. One set of brushes that clean the screens was broken for an extended period. Underwater videography and water velocity measurements were used to determine there were no potential adverse effects on juvenile salmonids when the west set of screens was clean enough to pass water normally. A second request, received from the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Walla Walla Watershed Council, asked for evaluation of water velocities through relatively new <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> above and adjacent to the Eastside Ditch fish screens on the Walla Walla River. Water moving through the <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> and not taken for irrigation is diverted to provide water for the Nursery Bridge fish ladder on the east side of the river. Elevations used in the design of the <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> were incorrect, causing excessive flow through the <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> that closely approached or exceeded the maximum swimming burst speed of juvenile salmonids. Hofer Dam was evaluated in June 2008. PNNL researchers found that conditions at Hofer Dam will not cause impingement or entrainment of juvenile salmonids but may provide habitat for predators and lack strong sweeping flows to encourage juvenile salmonid passage downstream. Further evaluation of velocities at the Eastside Ditch and wasteway gates should occur as changes are made to compensate for the design problems. These evaluations will help determine whether further changes are required. Hofer Dam also should be evaluated again under more normal operating conditions when the river levels are typical of those when fish are emigrating and the metal plate is not affecting flows...|$|R

50|$|Construction of {{the canal}} {{commenced}} in 1827 and it was opened on November 11, 1829. The canal was 5+1/4 mi long and had a vertical drop of 32 ft. The locks admitted craft up to 90 ft long and 20 ft wide. The canal was unique among canals of the era {{in that it was}} designed with structural reinforcement to facilitate steam tug boat traffic. The design {{of the canal}} included a massive <b>head</b> <b>gate</b> with apertures that could be opened and closed to precisely control water levels not only within the lock chambers but within the canal itself. The design feature supported the incorporator's dual intent to profit not only from tolls charged on canal traffic but from the sale of mill sites and the leasing of water rights to mill operators along the last mile of the canal bank.|$|E
50|$|Cattle crushes may {{be fully}} fixed or mobile; however, most crushes are best {{classified}} as semipermanent, being potentially movable but designed to primarily {{stay in one}} place. A cattle crush is typically linked to a cattle race (also known as an alley). The front end has a head bail (or neck yoke or <b>head</b> <b>gate)</b> to catch the animal and may have a baulk gate that swings aside to assist in catching the beast. The bail is often adjustable to accommodate animals of different sizes. This bail may incorporate a chin or neck bar to hold the animal's head still. A side lever operates the head bail to capture the animals, with the better types having a rear drop-away safety lever for easier movement of the cattle into the bail. Usually, smaller animals can walk through the head bails incorporated in crushes.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{water rights}} in Colorado are {{administered}} by the Colorado Division of Water Resources (CDWR) and by the water courts, which are district courts that only hear water matters. To get a surface water right, individuals submit an application to the water courts, and must show intent to divert the water for beneficial use - {{if there is no}} opposition, the right will be signed into a decree. The system is prior appropriation and priority based, with some priority dates going back to the 1890s. Transfers of rights require {{that there will be no}} adverse effect on other senior or junior rights holders, the result of which is that only the amount of water used consumptively in the past can be transferred. The CDWR administers the river water up to the <b>head</b> <b>gate</b> of a ditch that diverts water from the Colorado River, where a ditch company then controls the allocation of water to shareholders.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by {{mechanical}} devices. Proper aeration can make considerable improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by two phase flow systems such as high <b>head</b> <b>gated</b> conduit flow systems and two phase pipe flow systems using venturi tubes. When the gate of a high head outlet conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of the venturi tube, air suction occurs at air vents. In two phase flow systems, air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the air suction downstream of high <b>head</b> <b>gated</b> conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in two phase flow systems also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, two phase flow systems have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water. It was observed from the results that two phase flow systems were more efficient in deep ponds than in shallow ponds...|$|R

50|$|Most of the Medieval {{town was}} {{located within the}} town walls, which were {{originally}} {{the walls of the}} Roman town. The walls were further strengthened in the Middle Ages by the addition of bastion towers around the southern portion of the walls, which took place in either 1312 or during an extensive repair of the walls in 1382-1421. To the ire of the town officials, the walls were sometimes the target of illegal quarrying of building stone by the townspeople. Of the original six Roman gates, two (Balkerne Gate and Duncan's Gate) had been blocked up, probably in the 4th century. This left Hed Gate (modern <b>Head</b> <b>Gate)</b> as the main entrance to the town (hence its name), with North Gate, Suth Gate (modern South Gate) and Est Gate (modern East Gate) as the remaining Roman gateways. In addition, four new gates were cut through the town walls during the Middle Ages. These are Ryegate (meaning River Gate, sometimes called Northsherd, the modern Ryegate Street), le Posterne (modern St Marys Steps next to the Arts Centre), Scheregate (modern Scheregate Steps) and a small Postern gate somewhere in the South-East corner of the town walls. The gates were frequently in a state of disrepair.|$|E
50|$|The {{newly formed}} Maryland Public Service Commission refused to grant Bloede a {{franchise}} {{to compete in}} electricity generation. Bloede claimed that Consolidated was attempting to force a sale because the company was charging less on street light contracts with Catonsville and Baltimore. In 1913, the plant was sold to Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power, a predecessor company of Constellation Energy for $200,000 in stock. Consolidated constructed a new <b>head</b> <b>gate</b> and sluice after the purchase. The dam continued to generate electrical power within its interior until 1924 when it was closed due to the competition of larger, more powerful plants. The 38 acre property was sold to the State of Maryland on 22 July 1938 {{on the condition that}} the property would not be resold to competition to generate electricity or be developed in the future. Although the dam was severely damaged by the flood of Hurricane Agnes 1972, much of the dam still stands, although the dam has been gutted leaving only a mud filled shell. The gate house structures which did survive have been removed since the storm left them unsafe. A semi-exposed sewer line remains onsite. In 1979 the state of Maryland budgeted $30,000 to investigated stabilizing the dam. In 1992 the Department of Natural Resources added a $1.58 million dollar fish ladder to allow migrating fish to swim upstream without being blocked by the dam. More controversy has risen about the American eel in that the dam blocks their passage as well.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{rebuilding}} of the town after 60/1 new walls and a large defensive ditch were built around the colonia (the first town walls in Britain, predating other such walls in the province by at least 150 years). They were completed by 80, twenty years after the revolt. They were built with two external faces of alternating layers of tile and septaria mudstone containing a core of septaria boulders, with a 10 ft wide and 4 ft deep foundation trench, the whole structure taking up 45,000 cubic metres of stone, tile and mortar. They were 2,800m long and 2.4m thick, and survive up to a height of over 6m in the 21st Century. Later, in around 175-200 a large earth bank was built up against the inner face of the walls. The walls had between 12 and 24 towers and six large gates. Balkerne Gate, in {{the centre of the}} Western section of the walls, was the main gate out of the town. It has a large fortified barbican that still stands as Britain’s largest Roman gateway, which incorporated the earlier monumental arch built before the Iceni rebellion and was flanked by two possible temples, one of which may have contained the Venus statuette found during the 1973-76 excavations. Skulls showing signs of decapitation were found in the town ditch in front of the gate, interpreted as executions on public display. The North wall contained two gates, the modern North Gate and Duncan’s Gate, the East wall had the modern East Gate, and the Southern wall had the modern South Gate and <b>Head</b> <b>Gate.</b> Drains were constructed in the wall to allow sewerage out of the colonia.|$|E

50|$|The {{largest and}} richest Ecclesiastical {{institution}} in Medieval Colchester was St John's Abbey, a Benedictine monastery founded in 1095 {{on the site}} of an existing Saxon church to St John the Baptist or St John the Evangelist to the South of the town. As it was of the Benedictine order, no lay person was permitted to worship in the Abbey building itself, and so St Giles church was built by 1172 {{on the edge of the}} Abbey precinct to serve the lay community of St John's Green. To the North-East of the Abbey, on the road out of South Gate, was the Augustinian St Botolph's Priory. A third large institution was the Franciscan Greyfriars, founded by 1237 within the town walls on what is now the West end of East Hill. The Friary, part of the Wardenship of Cambridge, was a large building whose spire was the tallest structure in the Medieval town. A fourth monastic institution was the Crossed (also spelt Crouched) Friars on Crouch Street, an Augustinian order separate from those at St Botolph's Priory. They had taken control in 1496 of the Chapel of the Holy Cross, a hospital on the junction of Maldon Road and Crouch Street. A fifth monastic institution, and a second hospital, was St Mary Magdalene's on Magdalene Road on the way to the Hythe port. This was under the nominal control of St John's Abbey, against whom the hospital struggled for independence in the 14th century, including enlisting the aid of Parliament. There were two other Medieval hospitals connected to the town, St Catherine's somewhere outside of <b>Head</b> <b>Gate,</b> and St Anne's on Harwich Road, which was the site of a Holy Well. The town had several parish churches; St Mary-at-the-Walls (often called Our Lady-at-the-Walls), St Peter's, St Runwald's, St Martin's, St Nicholas', St James the Great's, All Saints/All Hallows, Holy Trinity, St Leonards-at-the-Hythe, and the chapel of St Helena. The Castle contained a chapel, and the town also contained small chantry chapels.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the course}} of the Middle Ages suburbs {{developed}} along the streets out of the town gates and around St John's Abbey. Outside of Hed Gate was a cross-roads between the road to Layer de la Haye (modern <b>Head</b> <b>Gate</b> and Butt Road) and the road to London and Lexden. At this cross roads was located the Bull Inn, which is still in existence as Colchester's oldest public house, and St Catherine's Hospital. The road to London was Croucherche Strete (modern Crouch Street), named after the Crouched Friars priory and Hospital of St Cross on the south-west corner of the junction with Maldone Lane (modern Maldon Road). Opposite the priory was an Inn called the Saracen's Head and an elaborate wayside cross. Croucherche Strete continued eastwards as Gutter Strete (modern St John's Street) where it met a cross-roads outside of Scheregate. Scheregate gave more direct access to the town for St John's Abbey and St John's Green via Lodders Lane (modern Abbey Gate Street) and Stanwell Strete (modern Stanwell Street). The Abbey precinct, surrounded on the east, north and west sides by a wall which enclosed St Giles church, the Abbey building itself and several smaller buildings, including the Abbot's house. Gutter Strete continued east to the cross-roads outside of Suth Gate as Bere Lane (modern Vineyard Street), {{which was one of the}} poorest districts in the town. Bere Lane took its name from the Berehalle (Bear Hall, a bear and bull bating arena) located on its southern side. The road was also home to Medieval Colchester's licensed brothels and stew houses (bath house/brothel buildings), and Medieval tennis courts. The area kept its reputation as the Red-light district of Colchester until the end of the Victorian era, when the houses along what is now Vineyard carpark were demolished in a slum clearance, and the roads name was changed to the more innocuous sounding Vineyard Street. Bere Lane met Botolph Strete (modern St Botolph's Street) outside of the Suth Gate, which became the main road south out of the town to Mersea Island. St Botolph's Priory stood in its precinct behind the street front on the east side of the road, whilst the east precinct wall of St John's Abbey lay against its west side.|$|E
