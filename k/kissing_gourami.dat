5000|$|<b>Kissing</b> <b>gourami</b> (the sole {{species in}} the family Helostomatidae) ...|$|E
50|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} <b>kissing</b> <b>gourami</b> is its mouth. Other than being terminal (forward-facing) rather than superior (upward-facing) as in other gourami families, the kissing gourami's mouth is highly protrusible as its family name suggests, the lips are lined with horny teeth. However, teeth are absent from the premaxilla, dentaries, palatine, and pharynx. The gill rakers are also well-developed and numerous. The visible scales of the body are ctenoid, whereas the scales {{of the top of}} the head are cycloid. <b>Kissing</b> <b>gourami</b> reach a maximum of 30 cm in total length. There is no outward sexual dimorphism and is difficult to almost impossible to distinguish the sexes.|$|E
50|$|Three new venues (Bangalore, Mumbai and Pune) {{were added}} during this edition. A National Champion event {{was held for}} the first time. <b>Kissing</b> <b>Gouramis</b> from Bangalore, {{represented}} by Swaminathan, Rajen Prabhu and Gopal Kidao were the national winners.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Kissing</b> <b>gouramis</b> {{are also}} popular with aquarists for the fish's {{peculiar}} [...] "kissing" [...] behavior of other fish, plants, and other objects. Kissers of both sexes will often spar by meeting mouths and pushing {{each other through the}} water. Large quantities of these fish are exported to Japan, Europe, North America, Australia, {{and other parts of the}} world for just this reason. <b>Kissing</b> <b>gouramis</b> need a roomy tank to thrive; they grow rapidly, and juvenile fish will quickly outgrow smaller aquaria. <b>Kissing</b> <b>gouramis</b> are territorial; some are tolerant towards fish of similar size, but others will bully, chase, and torment, causing significant stress on tank mates. Male kissers will occasionally challenge each other; however, the [...] "kissing" [...] itself is never fatal, but the constant bullying can stress the other fish to death. They often do in fact kill other fish by sucking the mucus off their skin as food, which opens the victim fish up to infections. These fish may be useful as algae eaters to control algae growth. To prevent digging and to present enough surface area for algae growth, the substrate should consist of large-diameter gravel and stones. The aquarium's back glass should not be cleaned during regular maintenance, as the gouramis will feed on the algae grown there. Most plants will not survive the fish's grazing, so inedible plants such as Java fern, Java moss, or plastic plants are recommended.|$|R
50|$|Shallow, slow-moving, and thickly vegetated backwaters are the <b>kissing</b> <b>gourami's</b> natural habitat. They are {{midwater}} omnivores that primarily graze on benthic {{algae and}} aquatic plants, with insects {{taken from the}} surface. They are also filter feeders, using their many gill rakers to supplement their diet with plankton. The fish use their toothed lips to rasp algae from stones and other surfaces. This rasping action, which (to humans) looks superficially like kissing, is also used by males to challenge the dominancy of conspecifics.|$|R
50|$|Other smaller {{labyrinth}} fish, such as {{the climbing}} perch, the <b>kissing</b> <b>gourami,</b> the snakeskin gourami, and other gouramies of the genus Trichogaster, are local food fish in Southeast Asia. In some areas, the fish are processed into salted and dried food.|$|E
50|$|Kissing gouramis, {{also known}} as kissing fish or kissers (Helostoma temminckii), are large {{tropical}} freshwater fish comprising the monotypic labyrinth fish family Helostomatidae (from the Greek elos nail, stoma mouth). These fish originate from Thailand to Indonesia. They can befood fish which are farmed in their native Southeast Asia. They are used fresh for steaming, baking, broiling, and pan frying. The <b>kissing</b> <b>gourami</b> is a popular aquarium fish.|$|E
50|$|Spawning occurs from May to October in Thailand. Kissing gouramis are open-water egg scatterers; {{spawning}} is {{initiated by}} the female and takes place under cover of floating vegetation. The eggs, which the adults do not guard, are spherical, smooth, and buoyant. Initial development is rapid: the eggs hatch after one day, and the fry are free-swimming two days thereafter. The <b>kissing</b> <b>gourami</b> does not care for its young.|$|E
30|$|The gas {{bubbles in}} the SC of gouramis enhance hearing between 0.3 and 4.0  kHz (Yan 1998). Our {{results showed that}} the gas in the SC of walking catfish only {{performed}} such hearing aid role at lower frequencies, i.e., < 3.0  kHz. At frequencies between 0.6 and 2.0  kHz, gas removal from the SC in walking catfish resulted in a mean threshold increase of 21.8 [*]±[*] 1.4  dB, a similar increase to that observed in SC-deflated <b>kissing</b> <b>gouramis</b> and dwarf gouramis at the same frequencies. However, threshold increases were not as great as those observed in SC-deflated blue gouramis, which have a distinctly larger SC. The auditory capacity of the gourami SC is suggested to be relative to its gas volume, i.e., species with a larger SC exhibit enhanced hearing (Yan 1998). However, no significant correlation was found between SC volume and hearing function in walking catfish. It {{should be noted that the}} range of SC volumes (359  μl, range 290 to 420  μl) in the walking catfish used in experiment 2 was less than that previously reported in blue gouramis, dwarf <b>gouramis,</b> and <b>kissing</b> <b>gouramis</b> by Yan (1998) (204  μl, range 126 to 290  μl; 151  μl, range 68 to 292  μl; and 100  μl, range 72 to 184  μl, respectively).|$|R
30|$|Other gas-holding {{structures}} in the fish body, such as the suprabranchial chamber (SC) in Anabantoidei and the otic gas bladder in Mormyridae, connect directly to the inner ear and are thus also capable of enhancing hearing ability (Yan and Curtsinger 2000; Yan 2004). The SC is a respiratory organ found in gouramis (Anabantoidei) of the families Anabantidae, Helostomatidae, and Osphronemidae. Catfishes of the family Clariidae have a similar structure (SC) as well. The SC enhances the hearing ability in gouramis, what {{has been shown in}} several species such as paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis, Osphronemidae) (see reviews in Yan 1998), blue gouramis (Trichogaster trichopterus; Osphronemidae), dwarf gouramis (Colisa lalia; Osphronemidae), and <b>kissing</b> <b>gouramis</b> (Helostoma temminckii; Helostomatidae) (Yan 1998).|$|R
50|$|Over {{six years}} later, in September 1998, South Korea {{is searching for}} Bang-hee. The {{agent in charge of}} her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former {{alcoholic}} and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of <b>kissing</b> <b>gourami,</b> a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.|$|E
50|$|About 300 {{species of}} fish have been {{identified}} in the river basin, of which 234 are of high economical value. This is more fish species than any other river basin in Indonesia. They belong to 120 genera and 40 families with the two major groups being cyprinids and catfish. More than 30% of the species originate from the sea and inhabit the delta areas. Among the economically important species are food fish such as Pangasius catfish, giant gourami, <b>kissing</b> <b>gourami,</b> snakeheads and large barbs (Leptobarbus, Puntioplites, Tor and others), and species from the aquarium trade such as the super red arowana and rasboras. Because of overfishing and habitat degradation, several species are threatened. Among these are the endangered arowana and white-edge freshwater whipray, and the wallago catfish, which formerly migrated in large groups in the Kapuas River.|$|E
50|$|These {{fish are}} {{omnivorous}} and need both {{plant and animal}} matter in their diets. The fish will accept vegetables such as cooked lettuce and any kind of live food. Water hardness should be between 5 and 30 dGH and pH between 6.8 and 8.5; the temperature should be between 22 and 28 C. When breeding kissing gouramis, soft water is preferred. As the fish do not build nests, lettuce leaves placed on the water surface serve as a spawning medium. The lettuce will eventually host bacteria and infusoria upon which the fish will feed. The maximum length for kissing gouramis in aquariums is between 20 and 30 cm. <b>Kissing</b> <b>Gourami</b> are also a very long lived fish, a long term commitment for the fish keeper. They {{have been known to}} live in excess of 25 years (*).|$|E
40|$|Registrou-se {{de janeiro}} a dezembro de 2006 a presença dos peixes exóticos Kribensis Pelvicachromis pulcher (Boulenger, 1901), Ramirezi {{boliviano}} Mikrogeophagus altispinosus (Haseman, 1911) e Beijador Helostoma temminckii Cuvier, 1829 para a bacia do rio Paraíba do Sul, Estado de Minas Gerais, Brasil. Com esses novos achados, o total de peixes exóticos aumenta para 44 na bacia. As espécies de Kribensis, Ramirezi boliviano e Beijador chegaram até os novos ecossistemas devido a fugas de tanques de pisciculturas ornamentais localizadas no maior pólo de piscicultura ornamental do país. It was reported from January to December, 2006 {{the presence of}} exotics Rainbow krib Pelvicachromis pulcher (Boulenger, 1901), Bolivian ram Mikrogeophaguss altispinosus (Haseman, 1911) and <b>Kissing</b> <b>gourami</b> Helostoma temminckii Cuvier, 1829 for the Paraíba do Sul river basin, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. According to these new findings, the total of exotic fish species for the basin increases to 44. The species of Rainbow krib, Bolivian ram and <b>Kissing</b> <b>gourami</b> arrived to the new ecosystems due to escapes from ponds of ornamental fish farms located at the largest ornamental pisciculture center in the country...|$|E
30|$|A {{number of}} workers have {{reported}} Saprolegnia infection in fishes; salmonids (Beakes et al. 1994; Hatai & Hoshiai, Hatai & Hoshiai Hatai & Hoshiai 1994), teleosts (Bruno & Wood 1999), Channel catfish (Howe et al. 1999), pike (Willoughby 1985), bass (Noga 1996), elver and suckers (Roberts 1989), roach, orfe, carp, tench, lamprey, sturgeon, barramundi, tilapia, and mullet (Bruno & Wood 1999). It has also been associated with tropical fish, including the <b>kissing</b> <b>gourami,</b> guppy, swordfish and platyfish (Willoughby 1994; Roberts 1989). The air breathing teleost, Anabas testudineus, from an Indian river was also found to carry S. parasitica infections (Mohanta & Patra 1992).|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the characterization of}} larval external morphology of the <b>kissing</b> <b>gourami</b> Helostoma temminckii, an aquarium fish of the family Helostomatidae, reared all over the world. A total of 38 larvae (standard length between 3. 2 and 10. 1 mm), obtained through natural reproduction {{carried out in the}} Fish Culture Station of the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, were used. The morphometric measurements pre-dorsal, pre-pectoral and pre-anal distances, and body height varied positively with standard length, and body proportions varied between 30. 8 and 51. 2 %; 12. 9 and 37. 9 %; 38. 2 and 58. 3 %, and 17. 2 and 30. 43 % CP, respectively. The eye diameter varied positively with the length of the head (CC), but its body proportion decreased with growth, varying between 63. 3 and 30. 2 % CC, within fish lenghts from 3. 2 to 10. 1 mm, respectively. The external morphological characterization of larvae with 3. 9, 6. 6, 7. 7, 8. 0 and 10. 1 mm CP are presented, showing the notochord flexion (CP between 5. 5 and 6. 8 mm), the appearance of rays and formation of the caudal (CP between 5. 5 and 7. 5 mm), dorsal (CP above 7. 5 mm), anal (larger than 7. 5 mm CP) and pectoral fins (larger than 8 mm CP); the modification of body shape and pigmentation absence. Larvae with 10. 1 mm CP don't show completely developed dorsal and anal fins, with their definitive number of rays. The opening of mouth and anus, and reduction of the yolk-sac were observed in larvae with CP between 6. 5 and 7. 5 mm. Such information is importam for larval rearing of the species, besides providing data for comparative ontogenic analysis of other Perciformes...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Control of {{contrast}} sensitivity was studied in {{two kinds of}} retina, that of the channel catfish {{and that of the}} <b>kissing</b> <b>gourami.</b> The former preparation is dominantly monochromatic and the latter is bichromatic. Various stimuli were used, namely a large field of light, a spot-annulus configuration and two overlapping stimuli of red and green. Recordings were made from horizontal, amacrine, and ganglion cells and the results were analyzed by means of Wiener's theory, in which the kernels are the contrast (incremental) sensitivity. Modulation responses from horizontal cells are linear, in that the waveform and amplitude of the first-order kernels are independent of the depth of modulation. In the N (sustained) amacrine and ganglion cells, contrast sensitivity was low for a large modulation input and was high for a small modulation input, providing an example {{of contrast}} gain control. In most of the cells, the contrast gain control did not affect the dynamics of the response because the waveform of the first-order kernels remained unchanged when the contrast sensitivity increased more than fivefold. The signature of the secondorder kernels also remained unchanged over a wide range of modulation. The increase in the contrast sensitivity for the second-order component, as defined by the amplitude of the kernels, was much larger than for the first-order component. This observation suggests that the contrast gain control proceeded the generation of the second-order nonlinearity. An analysis of a cascade of the Wiener type shows that the control of contrast sensitivity in the proximal retinal cells could be modeled by assuming the presence of a simple (static) saturation nonlinearity. Such a nonlinearity must exist somewhere between the horizontal cells and the amacrine cells. The functional implications of the contrast gain control are as follows: (a) neurons in the proximal retina exhibit greater sensitivity to input of lower contrast; (b) saturation of a neuronal response can be prevented because of the lower sensitivity for an input with large contrast, and (c) over a large range of modulation depths, the amplitude of the response remains approximately constant...|$|E
