40|$|Purpose: One key {{variable}} for improving efficiency in freight transport systems {{is to increase}} the load factor; the ratio of the actual load carried to the maximum load that could have been carried. A high <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in transport operations is of interest for several reasons; to lower costs and to reduce environmental impact. Shippers have a large influence on transport operations e. g. through choices concerning packaging, loading and planning. Therefore, it is of interest what opportunities there are for shippers to improve <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Meanwhile, there are few studies focusing on <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Since <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is often one of many aspects examined when discussing wider topics, such as transport efficiency, the research on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is dispersed. Thus, it is difficult to get an overview of the subject, in particular to identify opportunities from a shipper’s perspective. To address the lack of overview of research on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as well as how specific actors, in particular shippers, can increase <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> {{the purpose of this paper}} is to structure how academic literature has described how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> can be influenced, with a specific focus on the role of shippers. Research approach: An extensive literature search in scholarly journals was performed on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> terms using Summon search tool. A total of 473 articles were identified, where 29 articles discussed <b>factors</b> that influence <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> (determinants). Literature was categorized according to focus on <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> actor perspective, mode of transport covered, how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is measured and determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Findings and Originality: The literature review identifies determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> within warehousing; order and delivery; packaging and loading; transport operations; information sharing and IT; and regulations. Surprisingly few studies discuss determinants, especially from the perspective of a shipper. The literature review shows a lack of detailed descriptions of determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Also, it is difficult to gain reliable data about <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> and consequently also compare results between studies. Suggested research areas include how shippers can increase <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in their transports, detailed descriptions of how determinants influence <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as well as how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> performance can be measured; e. g. through standardized measuring methods. This research is unique since it is the first, to our knowledge, review on determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Research impact: This literature review contributes with an overview of the dispersed research on <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> structured according to determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Areas of interest for future research are suggested. Practical impact: The overview of determinants is useful for shippers, specifically logistics managers in order to gain understanding of their role when aiming for improved <b>load</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|R

The structure matrix {{is simply the}} <b>factor</b> <b>loading</b> matrix as in orthogonal rotation, representing the variance in a measured variable explained by a factor on both a unique and common contributions basis. The pattern matrix, in contrast, contains coefficients which just represent unique contributions. The more factors, the lower the pattern coefficients as a rule since {{there will be more}} common contributions to variance explained. For oblique rotation, the researcher looks at both the structure and pattern coefficients when attributing a label to a factor. Principles of oblique rotation can be derived from both cross entropy and its dual entropy.|$|E
50|$|The {{analysis}} will isolate the underlying factors that explain the data using {{a matrix of}} associations. Factor analysis is an interdependence technique. The complete set of interdependent relationships is examined. There is no specification of dependent variables, independent variables, or causality. Factor analysis assumes that all the rating data on different attributes can be reduced down to a few important dimensions. This reduction is possible because some attributes {{may be related to}} each other. The rating given to any one attribute is partially the result of the influence of other attributes. The statistical algorithm deconstructs the rating (called a raw score) into its various components, and reconstructs the partial scores into underlying factor scores. The degree of correlation between the initial raw score and the final factor score is called a <b>factor</b> <b>loading.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A modeler {{will often}} specify {{a set of}} {{theoretically}} plausible models {{in order to assess}} whether the model proposed is the best of the set of possible models. Not only must the modeler account for the theoretical reasons for building the model as it is, but the modeler must also take into account the number of data points and the number of parameters that the model must estimate to identify the model. An identified model is a model where a specific parameter value uniquely identifies the model, and no other equivalent formulation can be given by a different parameter value. A data point is a variable with observed scores, like a variable containing the scores on a question or the number of times respondents buy a car. The parameter is the value of interest, which might be a regression coefficient between the exogenous and the endogenous variable or the <b>factor</b> <b>loading</b> (regression coefficient between an indicator and its factor). If there are fewer data points than the number of estimated parameters, the resulting model is [...] "unidentified", since there are too few reference points to account for all the variance in the model. The solution is to constrain one of the paths to zero, which means that it is no longer part of the model.|$|E

5000|$|In statistics, a varimax {{rotation}} {{is used to}} simplify {{the expression of a}} particular sub-space in terms of just a few major items each. The actual coordinate system is unchanged, it is the orthogonal basis that is being rotated to align with those coordinates. The sub-space found with principal component analysis or factor analysis is expressed as a dense basis with many non-zero weights which makes it hard to interpret. Varimax is so called because it maximizes the sum of the variances of the squared loadings (squared correlations between variables and factors). Preserving orthogonality requires that it is a rotation that leaves the sub-space invariant. Intuitively, this is achieved if, (a) any given variable has a high loading on a single factor but near-zero loadings on the remaining factors and if (b) any given factor is constituted by only a few variables with very high loadings on this factor while the remaining variables have near-zero loadings on this factor. If these conditions hold, the <b>factor</b> <b>loading</b> matrix is said to have [...] "simple structure," [...] and {{varimax rotation}} brings the loading matrix closer to such simple structure (as much as the data allow). From the perspective of individuals measured on the variables, varimax seeks a basis that most economically represents each individual—that is, each individual can be well described by a linear combination of only a few basis functions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Public health {{interventions}} are directed towards social systems {{and it is}} difficult to foresee all consequences. While targeted outcomes may be positively influenced, interventions may at worst be counterproductive. To include self-reported health in an evaluation is one way of addressing possible side-effects. This study is based on a 10 year follow-up of a cardiovascular community intervention programme in northern Sweden. Methods Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to address the interaction between changes in self-rated health and risk <b>factor</b> <b>load.</b> Qualitative interviews contributed to an analysis of how the outcome was influenced by health related norms and attitudes. Results Most people maintained a low risk <b>factor</b> <b>load</b> and a positive perception of health. However, more people improved than deteriorated their situation regarding both perceived health and risk <b>factor</b> <b>load.</b> "Ideal types" of attitude sets towards the programme, generated from the interviews, helped to interpret an observed polarisation for men and the lower educated. Conclusion Our observation of a socially and gender differentiated intervention effect suggests a need to test new intervention strategies.
