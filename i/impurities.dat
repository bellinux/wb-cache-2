5|$|If pure {{platinum}} {{is found}} in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting <b>impurities.</b> Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its <b>impurities,</b> the lighter <b>impurities</b> can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is paramagnetic, whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic. These two <b>impurities</b> are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many <b>impurities</b> can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{property}} of a magnetic <b>impurity</b> on a single-layer graphene within an Anderson <b>impurity</b> model. Due to the vanishing local density of states at the Fermi level in graphene, the <b>impurity</b> spin cannot be effectively screened out. Treating the problem within the Gutzwiller approximation, we found a region in the parameter space of $U$-$E^f$ where the <b>impurity</b> is in the local moment state, which {{is characterized by a}} zero effective hybridization between the bath electron and the magnetic <b>impurity.</b> Here $U$ is the onsite Coulomb repulsion of the <b>impurity</b> electrons and $E^f$ the <b>impurity</b> energy level. The competition between $U$ and $E^f$ is also discussed. While larger $U$ reduces double occupation and favors local moment formation, a deeper <b>impurity</b> level prefers double occupation and a nonzero hybridization and thus a Kondo screened state.
