5|$|Lieutenant Colonel F. O. Chilton's 2/2nd Infantry Battalion {{found that}} it was best to keep skirmishing forward {{throughout}} this advance, because going to ground <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> meant sitting {{in the middle of the}} enemy artillery concentrations that inflicted further casualties. The Australian troops made good progress, six tank crossings were readied and mines between them and the wire had been detected. Five minutes later, the 23 Matildas of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment advanced, accompanied by the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion. Passing through the gaps, they swung right along the double line of posts.|$|E
5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} respiratory depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory rate and a marked decrease in respiratory minute volume, with a relatively mild decrease in tidal volume. In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant. The net effect of these changes is profound respiratory depression, as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant decrease in arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a respiratory acidosis) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|While the {{original}} settlement at Sheriff Hill developed through {{the growth of}} industry in the area, the suburb today is predominantly residential with no significant industry. The suburb was once considered affluent, but as of 2012, {{almost half of the}} working age population are economically inactive and less than half of households own a car. The area has than higher levels of unemployment in comparison with Gateshead and England: at Broadway, Pottersway and the Avenue, only 23.8% of adults have full-time employment and 10.09% have part-time jobs. Around 3.1% of the population are self-employed. Those in employment work outside the area, except those employed in the suburb's public houses, betting shops or fast-food outlets. Other small shops provide some local employment, but few are open <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> as they cannot compete with larger retailers elsewhere in Gateshead.|$|E

5|$|Escaping {{the castle}} is made {{difficult}} by shadow creatures {{sent by the}} Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> or if she is in {{certain areas of the}} castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.|$|E
5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} {{student who has}} discovered a novel compound that allows a person {{to be put in}} a state of sleep <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a safety deposit vault and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years. Jack's experiment works and he awakes in the year 2010 to a very different future. Transportation has been radically changed to pneumatic tubes allowing him to be transported to the mayor. The woman mayor takes an interest in him and invites her over to her home. In the intervening years, the world has become ruled by women and Jack is now out of place, but the two fall in love. Her father is an advocate for men's rights and Jack joins their society. The group soon appears before the mayor and she sends all of them to jail through the pneumatic tube, except for Jack. She proposes to him, but Jack only consents if the rights of men would be granted. The mayor is true to her word and signs a decree to give the men their liberty. During the ceremony, she attempts to lead Jack to the altar, but Jack shows her that the man must lead. When the bridal veil is placed on Jack, he places it on his new wife.|$|E

25|$|The {{fate of the}} French fugitives from Fort Caroline was various and eventful.

25|$|The strike lasted 172 days, at {{the time}} making it ({{at the time}}) the longest in UAW history and the longest strike in International Harvester history.

25|$|Performance {{art is a}} {{performance}} presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.|$|E
25|$|Aaron Kosminski {{was born}} in Kłodawa in Congress Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. His parents were Abram Józef Kozmiński, a tailor, and his wife Golda née Lubnowska. He may have been {{employed}} in a hospital as a hairdresser or orderly for a time. Aaron emigrated from Poland in 1880 or 1881, likely with his sisters' families. The family initially lived in Germany for a while. A nephew of Aaron's was born there in 1880 and a niece in 1881. It is not known precisely when Aaron left Poland to join his sisters or whether he lived in Germany <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> although he may have left Poland {{as a result of}} the March 1881 pogroms following the assassination of Tzar Alexander II, the impetus for many other Jews to emigrate. The family moved to Britain and settled in London sometime in 1881 or 1882. His mother, who was listed as a widow, apparently did not emigrate with the family immediately, but had joined them by 1894. It is unknown whether his father died or abandoned the family, but he did not emigrate to Britain with the rest of them. It is known that he had likely died before 1901, and an 1887 death certificate indicates that an Abram Kosminski had died in the Polish town of Koło, only five miles from Grzegorzew, the hometown of Kosminski's father.|$|E

25|$|In New York, the Cages first {{stayed with}} painter Max Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim. Through them, Cage met {{numerous}} important {{artists such as}} Piet Mondrian, André Breton, Jackson Pollock, Marcel Duchamp, and many others. Guggenheim was very supportive: the Cages could stay with her and Ernst <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and she offered to organize a concert of Cage's music {{at the opening of}} her gallery, which included paying for transportation of Cage's percussion instruments from Chicago. After she learned that Cage secured another concert, at the Museum of Modern Art, Guggenheim withdrew all support, and, even after the ultimately successful MoMA concert, Cage was left homeless, unemployed and penniless. The commissions he hoped for did not happen. He and Xenia spent the summer of 1942 with dancer Jean Erdman and her husband. Without the percussion instruments, Cage again turned to prepared piano, producing a substantial body of works for performances by various choreographers, including Merce Cunningham, who had moved to New York City several years earlier. Cage and Cunningham eventually became romantically involved, and Cage's marriage, already breaking up during the early 1940s, ended in divorce in 1945. Cunningham remained Cage's partner {{for the rest of his}} life. Cage also countered the lack of percussion instruments by writing, on one occasion, for voice and closed piano: the resulting piece, The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs (1942), quickly became popular and was performed by the celebrated duo of Cathy Berberian and Luciano Berio.|$|E
