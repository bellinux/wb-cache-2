40|$|In {{the last}} few days, some good stuff to read about China has {{appeared}} in places you might not think to look. First, the Winter, 2008 Dissent has an excellent article by Thomas Pogge (pp. 66 - 75) called “Growth and Inequality: Understanding Recent Trends and Political Choices. ” It’s an admirably clear overview {{of some of the}} vagaries of poverty statistics, differing ways of estimating inequality, and the relationship between growth and poverty reduction, tied to a very sensible argument about how somewhat slower growth could actually do much more to reduce poverty (and wreak less havoc on the environment) if it was accompanied by a decrease in inequality – or even a slowing of the increase. The scope of the article is global, but several of the key examples are Chinese. If you don’t usually think quantitatively, but you’re not a complete numero-phobe, this {{is a good place to}} get caught up on what the recent data do and don’t tell us about changes in the material conditions of the poor. Second, Science News for January 19, 2008 (pp. 36 - 37) has a brief but thought-provoking piece on changes in the Chinese diet and their implications for the country’s ever-worsening water shortages. The main focus is on how rising meat consumption (driven by rising incomes) strains the water supply (raising a kilo of beef uses 10 - 15 times as much water as raising a kilo of grain); animal-related foods account for 16 % of China’s diet, but use almost half the water used for food consumption. But in some ways the growth of fruit and vegetable production may be just as big a story. Consumption of fruits and vegetables is up over 300 % since the 1960 s, but production of these products is rising faster, as they have become export commodities: fruit production has more than quadrupled just since 1992. (China now grows more than 1 / 3 of the world’s apples, for instance.) Because fruit and vegetable production absorbs a lot more labor per acre than grain production, while also yielding higher incomes to producers, shifting to fruits and vegetables has been an important way for farmers to raise their incomes without abandoning the land: and China needs every such expedient its people can find, as income from grain-growing falls further and further behind other occupations, and the strains of very rapid urbanization intensify. Fruit tree planting has also been encouraged for environmental reasons, and a number of local governments subsidize farmers who want to switch from grain to fruits. But anything that increases the demand for water is a problem. Urban water shortages are getting worse and worse, and there is probably far less waste to cut there than in agriculture (as is true almost everywhere in the world). I have seen estimates that the economic benefits of water used in North China industry are anywhere from 20 to 60 times the benefits of that same amount of water being used in agriculture; even if these numbers are inflated, it’s not hard to see that the pressures for reducing agricultural water use will rise. (Prices for irrigation water have been rising for the last several years, thus far with limited effect.) But when more water-intensive kinds of farming are also among the best bets for keeping people in the countryside while raising their incomes – especially in the North, where <b>fruit</b> <b>boom</b> has been greatest and the water crisis most severe – the trade-offs are likely to become more and more difficult as both social and environmental pressures intensify...|$|E
50|$|Mark Waid {{and artist}} J. G. Jones {{produced}} {{a comic book}} dealing with themes of racism and civil rights, entitled Strange <b>Fruit</b> for <b>Boom!</b> Studios.|$|R
50|$|Since then Jones {{has been}} mostly {{providing}} covers for DC Comics on titles such as Batman and Robin, Doc Savage, Frankenstein, Agent of S.H.A.D.E. and Mister Terrific. Writer Brian Azzarello and Jones collaborated on the Before Watchmen: Comedian limited series in 2012-2013. Jones and writer Mark Waid produced Strange <b>Fruit</b> for <b>Boom!</b> Studios in July 2015.|$|R
50|$|On July 27, 2007, at the San Diego Comic-Con International, Boom! Studios {{announced}} that Waid would join Boom! as Editor-in-Chief the following month. As his non-creator assignments at DC lapsed, {{he stated that}} all his future creator-owned work will be with Boom!. Waid was promoted to Chief Creative Officer in August 2010. In December 2010, Waid announced he would be leaving his role as Chief Creative Officer, and return to freelance work, though he would continue writing for the publisher. Waid and artist J. G. Jones produced Strange <b>Fruit</b> for <b>Boom!</b> Studios in July 2015.|$|R
50|$|Air Blast {{sprayers}}, {{also known}} as air-assisted or mist sprayers, are often used for tall crops, such as tree <b>fruit,</b> where <b>boom</b> sprayers and aerial application would be ineffective. These types of sprayers can only be used where overspray—spray drift—is less of a concern, either through the choice of chemical which does not {{have undesirable effects on}} other desirable organisms, or by adequate buffer distance. These can be used for insects, weeds, and other pests to crops, humans, and animals. Air blast sprayers inject liquid into a fast-moving stream of air, breaking down large droplets into smaller particles by introducing a small amount of liquid into a fast-moving stream of air.|$|R
50|$|Hunt's is {{the name}} of a brand of {{preserved}} tomato products owned by ConAgra Foods, Inc. The company was founded in 1888, in Sebastopol, California, as the Hunt Bros. Fruit Packing Co. by Joseph and William Hunt. The brothers relocated to nearby Santa Rosa in 1890, and then to Hayward in 1895. This small canning operation grew rapidly, focused on canning the products of California's <b>booming</b> <b>fruit</b> and vegetable industries. By 1941, the plant shipped a hundred million cans of soup, fruits, vegetables, and juices annually.|$|R
50|$|In the beginning, wharves were {{primitive}} {{and there were}} few traveller amenities, but improvements were made and business increased. Mining developments in the 1890s meant large volumes of traffic. The Okanagan had a <b>booming</b> <b>fruit</b> industry by the early 1900s and steamers were essential for exportations. York was launched in 1902 as relief steamer for Aberdeen. By 1904, it was becoming clear that the ageing Aberdeen could not handle the traffic on the lake. Okanagan was launched in 1907 and replaced Aberdeen, freeing her for freight. Aberdeen was retired in 1916 and her hull was sold for $35.|$|R
50|$|Three hundred {{permanent}} settlers {{resided in}} Fair Oaks by 1897 and bought land in 5, 10, and 20 acre tracts {{at an average}} of $30 per acre. These pioneers planned to sustain themselves by planting and cultivating fruit orchards although the majority of them had little experience with farming. Promises of a bridge being built over the American River to better transport the new colony’s <b>fruit</b> to the <b>booming</b> markets in Sacramento and beyond further sustained this hope. The following year, however, investment began to diminish and the Howard-Wilson Company withdrew from the colony and with it went unfulfilled promises of a bridge over the American River and railroad service from Sacramento.|$|R
25|$|In the 1980s Dallas was a {{real estate}} hotbed, with the {{increasing}} metropolitan population bringing with it a demand for new housing and office space. Several of Downtown Dallas' largest buildings are the <b>fruit</b> of this <b>boom,</b> but over-speculation, {{the savings and loan}} crisis and an oil bust brought the 80's building boom to an end for Dallas as well as its city sister Houston. Between the late 1980s and the early 2000s, central Dallas went through a slow period of growth. However, since the early 2000s the central core of Dallas has been enjoying steady and significant growth encompassing both repurposing of older commercial buildings in downtown Dallas into residential and hotel uses as well as the construction of new office and residential towers. The opening of Klyde Warren Park, built across Woodall Rodgers Freeway seamlessly connecting the central Dallas CBD to Uptown/Victory Park, has acted synergistically with the highly successful Dallas Arts District so that both have become catalysts for significant new development in central Dallas.|$|R
40|$|Booms and busts {{have played}} a {{prominent}} role in American economic history. In the 19 th century, the United States benefited from the canal boom, the railroad boom, the minerals boom, and a financial boom. The 20 th century brought another financial boom, a postwar boom, and a dot-com boom.; The details differed, but each of these cases featured initial discoveries or breakthroughs, widespread adoption, widespread investment, and then a collapse where prices could not keep up and many investors lost a lot of money. When the dust cleared, there was financial carnage and many investors learning to be more careful the next time. But <b>fruits</b> of the <b>boom</b> were still around to benefit productivity.; The late Edward M. Gramlich prepared the luncheon address for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s 2007 symposium last summer in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This article, based on his speech, describes why he believed the subprime lending market, despite its problems, is a promising development that has permitted low-income and minority borrowers to participate in credit markets.

40|$|Tourism {{industry}} {{has become the}} highlighted sector which has amazingly increased the national income level. Despite the tourism industry {{being one of the}} highest income generating sectors, Homestay Programme as a Community-Based Tourism (CBT) product in Malaysia does not absorbed much of the incoming wealth. Homestay Programme refers to a programme in a community where a tourist stays together with a host family and experiences the everyday way of life of the family in both direct and indirect manner. There are over 100 Homestay Programme currently being registered with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism Malaysia which mostly are located in rural areas, but only a few excel and enjoying the <b>fruit</b> of the <b>booming</b> industry. Hence, this article seeks to identify the critical success factors for a Community-Based Rural Homestay Programme in Malaysia. A modified pairwise method is utilized to further evaluate the identified success factors in a more meaningful way. The findings will help Homestay Programme function as a community development tool that manages tourism resources. Thus, help the community in improving local economy and creating job opportunities...|$|R
