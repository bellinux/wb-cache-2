5|$|England resumed on {{the fourth}} morning with only three wickets <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> still 159 runs in arrears. Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs. Only ten runs were added, with Hollies being removed for a golden duck, skying a ball to Morris, {{immediately}} after Yardley was the ninth man to fall. Johnston ended with 4/40 from 27.3 overs while Lindwall took 3/50 from 25 overs. This result sealed the series 4–0 in favour of Australia. The match {{was followed by a}} series of congratulatory speeches.|$|E

Karin drives to Bobby's house and chases {{him into the}} orchard. Suddenly, Bobby is dragged {{downward}} into the mud. While attempting to rescue the teenager, Mulder simultaneously encourages Karin {{to break the cycle}} and to fight the voice inside her head. A tendon-like root snakes out of the mud and begins to drag Mulder downward. Ramirez appears, his axe <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> decapitates Karin, killing her. Mulder and Bobby are released by the unseen force.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{began work}} on the film that would become Monsters, Inc. in 1996 while others focused on A Bug's Life (1998) and Toy Story 2 (1999). Its code name was Hidden City, named for Docter's {{favorite}} restaurant in Point Richmond. By early-February 1997, Docter had drafted a treatment together with Harley Jessup, Jill Culton, and Jeff Pidgeon that bore some resemblance to the final film. Docter pitched the story to Disney with some initial artwork on February 4 that year. He and his story team left with some suggestions <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> returned to pitch a refined {{version of the story}} on May 30. At this pitch meeting, longtime Disney animator Joe Grant– whose work stretched back to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)– suggested the title Monsters, Inc., a play on the title of a gangster film Murder, Inc., which stuck. The film marks the first Pixar feature to not be directed by Lasseter instead being helmed by Docter, as well as Lee Unkrich and David Silverman who served as co-directors.|$|E

5|$|England resumed on {{the fourth}} morning with only three wickets <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> they were still 159 runs in arrears. Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs. Only ten runs were added; the match ended when Hollies fell for a golden duck after skying a ball to Morris, {{immediately}} after Yardley's departure. Johnston ended with 4/40 from 27.3 overs while Lindwall took 3/50 from 25 overs. Miller claimed 2/22 while Ring bowled the most overs, 28, to finish with 1/44. Given the time lost to inclement weather on the first day, Australia had won the match {{in less than three}} days of playing time.|$|E
5|$|Having {{left his}} command to General Belliard on 8 March, three days later, Nansouty {{was a part}} of a convoy of several officers, heading to Paris. On the road to the capital, they were {{attacked}} by a pulk of Cossacks, which managed to disperse the convoy's escort. Nansouty and his officers fought their way out sabre <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> made a run for it towards the river Aisne. Reaching the riverbanks, the General got isolated and, as he was preparing to cross the river on horseback, his horse was shot under him, throwing the General to the ground. Nevertheless, he stood up and swam to the other bank of the river and safety. This event, as well as his tireless activity during the campaign, seem to suggest that his health was not the main reason of his departure from the army. It is also unlikely that the Emperor himself decided to replace him, given Belliard's tentative approach at the Battle of Craonne and this General's subsequent provisional status as commander, after Nansouty's departure. It is thus more likely that Nansouty resigned, following his disputes with the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|McCool was rested for {{the second}} tour match against Leicestershire, which Australia won by an innings. The next match against Yorkshireon a damp pitch {{favourable}} to slower bowlingwas the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour. McCool made three in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101. After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 5/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory when McCool arrived at the crease. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively only had four wickets <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> faced the prospect of losing to an English county {{for the first time}} since 1912. McCool scored five before hitting a long hop back to left-arm spinner Johnny Wardle to leave Australia at 6/31. However, Australia lost no further batsmen and scraped home by four wickets. McCool’s leg spin was used as Keith Miller and Bill Johnston bowled almost unchanged for the entire match.|$|E

5|$|Hamence {{made his}} debut on English {{soil in the}} second tour match against Leicestershire. Batting at No. 6, he came in at 4/344 and made only seven. His {{dismissal}} triggered a collapse of 5/38 as Australia were bowled out for 448 before winning by an innings. The next match against Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling, was the closest Australia came to defeat on the tour. Batting at No. 4, Hamence made 12 in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101. He batted slowly, coming in at 2/24 before departing at 7/74. After Australia dismissed the hosts for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 3/13 in pursuit of 60 for victory. Hamence came in and scored one before he was run out after being slow to set off for a quick single; Australia collapsed to 6/31. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively had only three wickets <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> faced their first loss to an English county since 1912. However, Australia scraped home by four wickets after a counterattack by Neil Harvey and Don Tallon, aided by a dropped catch and missed stumping.|$|E
5|$|May {{brought on}} the {{part-time}} spin of Brian Close and 15 runs came in two overs, helping Davidson {{to feel more}} at ease. At the time, Allen had bowled 25 maidens in 37 overs. Davidson responded to the situation by hitting Allen out of the attack. In Allen's 10th over for the day, Davidson took 20 runs. He lofted an off drive over the boundary for six, and drove through the covers for four from both {{the front and back}} foot. Davidson then hit the bowler out of the stadium onto the adjacent railway lines. Fred Trueman came on and struck Davidson on the foot with a yorker. Davidson responded with a three and a cut for four that brought up Australia's 400. He ended with a hard-hitting 77 not out, after a final wicket partnership of 98 in 102 minutes. This extended Australia's lead to 256 on the last day and gave them hope of stopping England from winning the match. England looked to be heading towards victory with seven wickets <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> less than 100 runs required, but a Benaud-inspired collapse saw Australia home by 54 runs. Davidson knocked Brian Statham's off stump out of the ground to end the match and ended with 2/50. It was Australia's first victory at Old Trafford since 1902 and sealed the series.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly shook English {{confidence}} in the Third Test, played on a placid surface at Old Trafford, by taking three wickets in four balls. Cyril Walters, who {{up to that point}} had been untroubled, failed to pick the bosie and thus inside edged the ball to short leg. Bob Wyatt came in and was clean bowled for a golden duck, bringing Hammond in to face the hat-trick ball. The new batsman inside edged the ball past the stumps and through the legs of wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield, but the next delivery clean bowled him. This left England at 3/72, and O'Reilly removed Sutcliffe soon after, but the batsmen settled down and the next wicket did not come until Hendren fell just {{before the end of the}} first day's play. England were 5/355 and O'Reilly had taken each wicket. The next day, the hosts ended on 9/627, despite a relentless 59 overs from O'Reilly, who ended with 7/189 and was the only bowler to challenge the batsmen. The high-scoring match never looked likely to produce a result, except when Australia were in danger of being forced to follow on. They were 55 runs away from the follow on mark of 478 at the end of the third day with two wickets <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> O'Reilly was on one. The next day Arthur Chipperfield fell with 24 runs still needed and O'Reilly and Wall saw them to 491 before the latter fell. O'Reilly ended with 30 not out after an innings in which he was lucky not to be caught off an edge multiple times.|$|E

5|$|On December 15, the Mint shipped five kegs {{of the new}} coins, each holding 10,000 pieces, to Chicago. Each keg held five {{bags with}} a {{thousand}} coins each, though in one keg, one bag was intentionally short four coins, as also in that keg was a cigar box containing four envelopes, with coins number 1, 400, 1492, and 1892 {{from the first day}} of production. The kegs were taken to the Chicago Sub-Treasury, and on December 19 at 1:00pm conveyed to Room 404 of the Rand McNally Building, the exposition's headquarters. There, Harlow N. Higinbotham, president of the Exposition Company, took mallet and chisel <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> opened the keg, removing the cigar box. Placing three of the envelopes in his pocket, he displayed the first coin to the assembled crowd, then exchanged it for a check—Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict (later the Remington Typewriter Company and makers of the official typewriter of the fair), was purchasing the first coin struck for $10,000 as a publicity stunt. That coin was donated to the newly established Columbian Museum (today the Field Museum). The Company immediately put the pieces on sale for $1 each, and the first shipment was soon all sold to those who lined up to buy them, had ordered them by mail, or had purchased them at local banks that were given allocations. No official packaging was provided; the pieces exist in holders supplied by various banks.|$|E
5|$|Poulton was {{selected}} for the 2009 World Twenty20 in England and Australia hosted New Zealand for three T20 matches in tropical Brisbane during the southern hemisphere winter before the teams departed for the tournament. Poulton scored 4, 33 and 30 as Australia took the series 2–1. Once the Australians were in England, Poulton top-scored with 66 and took 1/7 against the hosts in her only innings in the pre-tournament practice matches. Poulton made only two and eight in Australia's first two pool matches against New Zealand and the West Indies; Australia lost the first by nine wickets and won the second by eight wickets. In the final pool match, against South Africa, Australia needed a victory to progress. Batting first, she scored 22 before being run out as Australia made 6/164 from their 20 overs. In reply, South Africa were on track to reach the target, having reached 0/73 after seven overs. Poulton trapped Shandre Fritz for 39 with the first ball of the next over, and the South Africans lost momentum, scoring only 41 runs {{for the loss of}} seven wickets in the next ten overs. On the last ball of the 17th over, Poulton trapped opposition captain Sunette Loubser and ended with 2/20 from three overs as Australia prevailed by 24 runs to reach the semi-finals, where they faced England. Poulton scored 39 to push Australia to 5/163 but the hosts reached the target with eight wickets <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> progressed to the final, which they won.|$|E
5|$|Seeing Arnaud felled by gunfire, Magruder, who {{was wearing}} body armor, stepped back and drew her sidearm. However, before she could return fire, Logan then shot six bullets at her, one of which struck her in the head, mortally {{wounding}} her. Logan then went over to Arnaud and, while standing over his body, shot him four more times, injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding. Arnaud would die from severe gunshot-induced blood loss at the scene, but the mortally wounded Magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9:34p.m. Logan's father, {{who was in the}} house's master bedroom, had heard the gunshots, and thinking that the deputies had shot him, went over to see what had happened. Instead, he saw Logan leaving the house with a firearm <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> saw that the two deputies had been shot. Logan's father then called 9-1-1 via telephone at 9:39p.m. to report the shooting to authorities. Emergency medical technicians arrived and removed Arnaud and Magruder were removed from the house via stretchers, with Magruder being airlifted via medical helicopter to the Prince George's Hospital Center, with CPR being applied on her while en route. However, she would be pronounced dead at the hospital before midnight.|$|E
