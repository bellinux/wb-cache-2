500|$|In 1916, Coach Yost {{shared his}} {{recollections}} of the Buffalo game with Big Bill Edwards: [...] "Buffalo University came to Michigan with a much-heralded team. They were coached by a Dartmouth man {{and had not}} been scored upon. Buffalo papers referred to Michigan as the Woolly Westerners, and the Buffalo enthusiasts placed bets that Michigan would not score." [...] The score {{at the end of}} the first half was 65 to 0. About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, [...] "on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket." [...] Yost was curious and asked, [...] "Simpson, what are you doing over here? You are on the wrong side." [...] To which, Simpson replied, [...] "Don't say anything. I know where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at.</b> <b>The</b> coach has put me in three times already and I'm not going in there again. Enough is enough for any one. I've had mine." ...|$|E
500|$|Through {{the summer}} siege, illness {{spread through the}} British camps. [...] In August, Wolfe himself was bedridden, causing already low morale to slump even further among the British troops. With many men in camp hospitals, British {{fighting}} numbers were thinned, and Wolfe personally felt that a new attack was needed {{by the end of}} September, or Britain's opportunity would be lost. In addition, his frustration with Montcalm's defensive stance continued to grow. In a letter to his mother, Wolfe wrote, [...] "The Marquis of Montcalm is {{at the head of a}} great number of bad soldiers, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of a small number of good ones that wish for nothing so much as to fight him; but the wary old fellow avoids an action, doubtful of the behaviour of his army." [...] Montcalm also expressed frustration over the long siege, relating that he and his troops slept clothed and booted, and his horse was always saddled in preparation for an attack.|$|E

2500|$|In his own words, [...] "Being {{aware of}} myself in my body, I'm {{at the root}} of personality. Being aware of myself in the other one's body, I'm {{at the root of}} sex. Being aware of myself in all human bodies, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> root of unity". Noticing that one of the Aramaic {{languages}} translates Spirit as Rucha, a female entity, Merezhkovsky interpreted the Holy Trinity as Father and Son's unity in the higher being, their common godly Mother. It is the latter's Kingdom Come that the Third Testament was supposed to lead to. Seeing both God and man as intrinsically unisexual, Merezhkovsky regarded a male/female schism to be a symptom of imperfection, the cause for primal human being's fatal disintegration.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{prevailing}} atmosphere of panic, no-one attributed the defeat to overwhelming odds. Nottingham accused Torrington of treachery, informing William on 13 July [...] "In plain terms ... Torrington deserted the Dutch so shamefully {{that the whole}} squadron had been lost if some of our ships had not rescued them." [...] Nottingham was anxious to shift blame but no one disputed his interpretation. [...] "I cannot express to you", wrote William to the Grand Pensionary Anthonie Heinsius in the Dutch Republic, [...] "how distressed <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> disasters of the fleet; I am so much the more deeply affected as I have been informed that my ships did not properly support those of the Estates, and left them in the lurch.|$|E

Campbell said that County, who had {{recently}} {{been the subject of}} a takeover by a Middle Eastern consortium, were the best club for [...] "where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment in my life", and that the recent appointment of ex-England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson as director of football played a [...] "big role" [...] in his decision. He made his debut for County in a 2–1 defeat to Morecambe at Christie Park on 19 September. He walked out on the club three days later, and his contract was cancelled by mutual consent on 24 September. He later admitted he felt embarrassed and that [...] "I was being a mug" [...] in believing the club's owner's were ambitious billionaires who intended to take the club into the Premier League.|$|E

But I believe that before <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of this [...] I shall have to repeat the same things several times; for which, O reader! do not blame me, for the subjects are many and memory cannot retain them [...] and say: ‘I will not write this because I wrote it before.’ And if I wished to avoid falling into this fault, it would be necessary in every case when I wanted to copy [...] that, not to repeat myself, I should read over all that had gone before; and all the more since the intervals are long between one time of writing and the next.|$|E
