50|$|A {{concealed}} <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> will typically {{be installed}} within an accessible ceiling void or services zone. The {{return air grille}} and supply air diffuser, typically set flush into the ceiling, will be ducted {{to and from the}} <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> and thus allows a great degree of flexibility for locating the grilles to suit the ceiling layout and/or the partition layout within a space. It is quite common for the return air not to be ducted and to use the ceiling void as a return air plenum.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> (FCU) is {{a simple}} device {{consisting}} of a heating and/or cooling heat exchanger or 'coil' and fan. It {{is part of an}} HVAC system found in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. A <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> is a diverse device sometimes using ductwork, and is used to control the temperature in the space where it is installed, or serve multiple spaces. It is controlled either by a manual on/off switch or by a thermostat, which controls the throughput of water to the heat exchanger using a control valve and/or the fan speed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reason that}} these DC <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Units</b> are, despite their {{apparent}} relative complexity, becoming more popular is their improved energy efficiency levels {{compared to their}} AC motor driven counterparts {{of only a few}} years ago. A straight swap, AC to DC, will reduce electrical consumption by 50% but applying Demand and Occupancy dependent fan speed control can take the savings to as much as 80%. In areas of the world where there are legally enforceable energy efficiency requirements for <b>Fan</b> <b>Coils</b> (such as the UK), DC <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Units</b> are rapidly becoming the only choice.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Air {{conditioning}} systems represent {{one important}} source of microbial pollutants for indoor air. In the past few years, numerous strategies have been conceived to reduce the contamination of air conditioners, mainly in hospital settings. The biocidal detergent BATT 2 represents a natural product obtained through extraction from brown seaweeds, that has been tested previously on multidrug-resistant microorganisms. Methods BATT 2 has been utilized for the disinfection of <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> from four air conditioning systems located in hospital environments with a mean degree of risk. Samples were collected from the air supplied by the conditioning systems and from the surfaces of <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units,</b> before and after sanitization procedures. Total microbial counts at 37 °C and 22 °C and mycotic count at 32 °C were evaluated. Staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also detected on surfaces samples. Results The biodetergent was able to reduce up 50 % of the microbial pollution of <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> surfaces and air supplied by the air conditioners. Conclusions BATT 2 could be considered for cleaning/disinfection of air conditioning systems, that should be performed {{on the basis of}} accurate and verifiable sanitization protocols. </p...|$|R
50|$|A unit {{ventilator}} is a <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> {{that is used}} {{mainly in}} classrooms, hotels, apartments and condominium applications. A unit ventilator can be a wall mounted or ceiling hung cabinet, and is designed to use a fan to blow outside air across a coil, thus conditioning and ventilating the space which it is serving.|$|E
5000|$|In this setup, {{there is}} an outdoor air system that dumps preconditioned air (accounting for latent load and partial {{sensible}} load) directly into the space in its own duct/diffuser. There is a separate system (e.g. <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit)</b> that takes air from the space and conditions it to meet the remaining space sensible load.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are various}} sub-definitions of SFP for {{different}} specific applications, including SFPe (building energy performance calculations), SFPv (for performance verification tests), SFPi (individual fan), SFPAHU (air handling unit), SFPFCU (<b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit),</b> and SFPBLDG (whole building). These are explained in [...] {{and in part}} in. Reference 1 also describes how account for intermittently operated fans, e.g. kitchen hoods, and part-load performance in variable air volume (VAV) systems.|$|E
5000|$|Conditioned {{outdoor air}} is ducted to the {{terminal}} unit in the space. In this setup, the preconditioned outdoor air is ducted into the <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> directly, mixing with the return air from the space. This system {{is similar to a}} chilled beam setup.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has highlighted {{the importance of}} increasing the resource efficiency of building services. In this paper, a literature review of life cycle assessment and embodied carbon studies clearly signposts {{the need for more}} research on the embodied impacts of building services. Theoretical and practical challenges are identified in the use of LCA methods in construction along with possible solutions compatible with BIM-led design. A case study of horizontal, ducted <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> demonstrates that variations in embodied carbon of similar units could be associated with variations in total cooling capacity. This raises the possibility that metrics could subsequently be devised to predict embodied carbon for a generic class of <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units.</b> Implications of these results are explored and recommendations made for future studies...|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{simplicity}} and flexibility, <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> {{can be more}} economical to install than ducted 100% fresh air systems (VAV) or central heating systems with air handling units or chilled beams. Various unit configurations are available, including horizontal (ceiling mounted) or vertical (floor mounted).|$|R
50|$|In {{high-rise}} residential construction, typically each <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> {{requires a}} rectangular through-penetration {{in the concrete}} slab on top of which it sits. Usually, there are either 2 or 4 pipes made of ABS, steel or copper that go through the floor. The pipes are usually insulated with refrigeration insulation, such as acrylonitrile butadiene/polyvinyl chloride (AB/PVC) flexible foam (Rubatex or Armaflex brands) on all pipes, or {{at least on the}} chilled water lines to prevent condensate from forming.|$|E
5000|$|Speed {{control of}} the fan motors within a <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some {{manufacturers}} accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require adjustment at the commissioning stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> design. A simple speed selector switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this speed selector switch is integral to the room thermostat, and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital room thermostat. Building Energy Management Systems {{can be used for}} automatic fan speed and temperature control. Fan motors are typically AC Shaded Pole or Permanent Split Capacitor. More recent developments include brushless DC designs with electronic commutation. Compared to units with asynchronous 3-speed motors, the fan coil units with brushless motors will reduce the power consumption up to 70%.http://heinenhopman.com/en/merchant/fan-coil-unit/ ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit</b> design falls principally {{into two}} main types: blow through and draw through. As the names suggest, {{in the first}} type the fans are fitted such that they blow through the heat exchanger, {{and in the other}} type the fans are fitted after the coil such that they draw air through it. Draw through units are {{considered}} thermally superior, as ordinarily they make better use of the heat exchanger. However they are more expensive, as they require a chassis to hold the fans whereas a blow-through unit typically consists of a set of fans bolted straight to a coil.|$|E

40|$|A quasi-steady state {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} {{ground source heat pump}} has been developed. Heating and cooling is delivered to the building using <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units,</b> which are either in constant operation (Strategy 1) or switched on/off as water flow to the coil is diverted (Strategy 2). The performance of the system is evaluated using a system performance factor (SPF). It was observed that values for SPF 4 (which includes all components) decreases for decreasing building load. For strategy 2, the energy saving associated with SPF 4 are greater than Strategy 1, but savings are diminished at higher loads. Improved system performance was observed at lower return water temperatures in heating and higher return temperatures in cooling. However, in both cases the capacity of the <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> is reduced.

50|$|Small air handlers, {{for local}} use, are called {{terminal}} units, and may only include an air filter, coil, and blower; these simple terminal units are called blower <b>coils</b> or <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units.</b> A larger air handler that conditions 100% outside air, and no recirculated air, {{is known as}} a makeup air unit (MAU). An air handler designed for outdoor use, typically on roofs, {{is known as a}} packaged unit (PU) or rooftop unit (RTU).|$|R
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{selected}} chilled water temperatures {{and the relative}} humidity of the space, {{it is likely that}} the cooling coil will dehumidify the entering air stream, and as a by product of this process, it will at times produce a condensate which will need to be carried to drain. The <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> will contain a purpose designed drip tray with drain connection for this purpose. The simplest means to drain the condensate from multiple fan coil units will be by a network of pipework laid to falls to a suitable point. Alternatively a condensate pump may be employed where space for such gravity pipework is limited.|$|E
50|$|The coil {{receives}} hot or {{cold water}} from a central plant, and removes heat from or adds heat to the air through heat transfer. Traditionally fan coil units can contain their own internal thermostat, or can be wired to operate with a remote thermostat. However, and as is common in most modern buildings with a Building Energy Management System (BEMS), {{the control of the}} <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> will be by a local digital controller or outstation (along with associated room temperature sensor and control valve actuators) linked to the BEMS via a communication network, and therefore adjustable and controllable from a central point, such as a supervisors head end computer.|$|E
50|$|Fan coil {{units are}} divided into two types: Two-pipe fan coil units or four-pipe fan coil units. Two-pipe fan coil units have one (1) supply and one (1) return pipe. The supply pipe {{supplies}} either cold or hot water to the unit depending {{on the time of}} year. Four-pipe fan coil units have two (2) supply pipes and two (2) return pipes. This allows either hot or cold water to enter the unit at any given time. Since it is often necessary to heat and cool different areas of a building at the same time, due to differences in internal heat loss or heat gains, the four-pipe <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> is most commonly used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> {{circulate}} hot or {{cold water}} through a coil in order to condition a space.

Up to a signal voltage of 2.5 Volts (which may vary with different fan/motor manufacturers) the fan will be in a stopped condition but as the signal voltage is increased, the fan will seamlessly increase in speed until the maximum is reached at a signal Voltage of 10 Volts. Fan Coils will generally operate between approximately 4 Volts and 7.5 Volts because below 4 Volts the air volumes are ineffective and above 7.5 Volts the Fan Coil is likely to be too noisy for most commercial applications.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master of Science Thesis was {{to develop}} an MS Excel-based {{calculation}} tool for cooling and heating capacities in Halton Group´s new product, the <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit.</b> The <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit</b> is commonly used in passenger cabins of cruisers to cool or heat the cabin air. The number of customer orders of the <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit</b> has been increasing, therefore, Halton Group’s subdivision Marine had a need to get this tool to save time, which had earlier gone to calculations for each unit order separately. Cooling demand consists of two kinds of heat loads: latent and sensible heat load. The part of the heat load which is caused by evaporation, is called the latent heat load. The latent heat load comes from for example the cabin, when the passenger's skin is sweating and from the shower facilities when water vapor is released into the cabin air. Sensible heat is heat exchanged by a body or thermodynamic system that has as its sole effect a change of temperature. This Thesis {{is divided into two}} parts.

The basic principles of <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit,</b> heat transfer properties between air and water and other mathematical functions that have been used in this work are presented in the first part.
