2500|$|The omnipotence {{paradox is}} a family of paradoxes that arise with some {{understandings}} of the term 'omnipotent'. The paradox arises, for example, If one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even logically contradictory ideas such as creating square circles. A no-limits understanding of omnipotence such as this has been rejected by early theologians such as Thomas Aquinas to contemporary scholars in the philosophers of religion, such as Alvin Plantinga.

40|$|During the Second Empire, the {{development}} of educational field commenced {{the development}} in other fields, such as economics and politics.

40|$|Overweight {{children}} show abnormalities {{in eating}} style, such as restrained eating and tendency toward overeating (comprising both emotional and <b>external</b> eating). Family <b>surroundings</b> {{play a major}} role in developing eating behaviors in children. We tested whether restrained eating and tendency toward overeating predicted the amount of food intake in 41 overweight children (23 girls and 18 boys) and their parents (40 mothers and 11 fathers) after receiving a preload. We further investigated with questionnaires whether there were associations between the parents' and their children's eating behavior and whether mothers' food intake predicted the amount of food consumed by children in an experimental trial. We found that neither children with restrained eating nor their mothers ate more after a preload, but children with a high tendency toward overeating ate somewhat more after receiving a preload. Further analyses showed that children's food intake in the preload paradigm was predicted by mothers' food intake. Our findings point to a familial transmission of eating styles: children eat as their primary caregivers do, even when the caregivers are not present in the laboratory...|$|R
50|$|Dr. Matthias Harder, Director of the Helmut Newton Foundation in Berlin, {{wrote about}} the artist’s reason for taking this approach: “Venables’ real {{intention}} is to open up unfamiliar perspectives and to transform real spaces into imaginary ones with realistic traits.” The artist creates surrealistic, digitally composed images of everyday and sacred spaces with no people in it, which allows us to observe how we mark our environment and vice versa. She believes that by showing a space void of people, the viewers can focus on the space itself, {{the life of an}} environment, and how this space is being used. The artist places us in private intimate spaces to evoke the unconscious memories and emotions we have with them. This is a daring approach to exploring human psyche and its relationship with the <b>external</b> <b>surroundings.</b> Venables is compared to Louise Bourgeois, Lee Bontecou, and Cindy Sherman for the similar themes they explore.|$|E

50|$|James Joyce {{was a major}} {{pioneer in}} the use of stream of consciousness. Some hints of this technique, are already present in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916), along with {{interior}} monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his <b>external</b> <b>surroundings.</b> Joyce began writing A Portrait in 1907 and it was first serialised in the English literary magazine The Egoist in 1914 and 1915. Earlier in 1906 Joyce, when working on Dubliners, considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called Leopold Bloom under the title Ulysses. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Serial publication of Ulysses in the magazine The Little Review began in March 1918. Ulysses was finally published in 1922. In his final work Finnegans Wake (1939) Joyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in, which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{used the}} modal {{framework}} of Simpson in doing a stylistic {{analysis of the}} story “Things You Don’t Know” by Ian Rosales, a highly-acclaimed Filipino writer. Since stylistics has always been concerned with how readers interpret the texts by focusing on linguistic choices, the modal choices of the writer based on Simpson’s modal framework would allow the readers to identify {{the attitude of the}} narrator. Indeed, results show that the epistemic type of modal was preponderant –this type apparently allows the readers to feel the narrator’s uncertainty in situations or events. In addition, this modal framework also enables the readers to further identify the shade of a text, since the choice of modals highlights either a positive, negative, or neutral shade of a story. Since the epistemic modal was the most pronounced, the story is definitely negative in shade, and this can be inferred in the short story where the narrator is uncertain {{what was going on in}} her everyday affairs. In turn, this uncertainty is emphasised by the narrator’s dependence on his/her perception of <b>external</b> appearances or <b>surroundings...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Among all the Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) methods {{available}} to describe large molecular systems, the Local Self-Consistent Field/MM (LSCF/MM) one uses frozen doubly occupied Strictly Localized Bonding Orbital (SLBO) {{to connect the}} QM fragment to the one treated at the MM level. This approach is correct {{as long as the}} QM part is large enough to minimize the artifacts that could arise because of the fixed SLBO. If one wants to decrease the size of the QM subsystem, one clearly needs to help the SLBO to relax according to the variations of the global wave function. Also, the SLBO have to adjust itself according to the modification of the surrounding if we want to improve the method. Here, we present a modification of the original LSCF method called Optimized LSCF (OLSCF) where each SLBO is allowed to mix with its corresponding Strictly Localized Anti Bonding Orbital (SLABO) resulting in an adjustment of the two-electron bond described by a self-consistent SLBO (SCSLBO). We test the new methodology against the modification of the QM part (internal perturbation) and against the variation of the <b>surroundings</b> (<b>external</b> perturbation) represented either by a dielectric continuum or by a classical point charge. In each case the initial SLBO is the symmetric C-C SLBO of the ethane molecule. It is shown that the optimized SCSLBO presents a final polarity in perfect agreement with what could be expected {{as the result of a}} reaction to the internal or external perturbation. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to gain an {{understanding}} of the identity problems Syrian refugees experiencing in relation with integration into Swedish society. Furthermore, the study aims to identify the main reasons why Syrian refugees choose Sweden as a destination country. The study is based on a qualitative research approach. The empirical data consists of eight in-depth interviews with individual from Syria. Theories that are used in the analyze of the result is Richard Jenkins (2008) Social Identity, Nils Hammarén & Thomas Johansson (2009) description of hybrid identities, Aleksandra Ålunds (1997) theory of ”multikultiungdomar”, Jonas Stiers (2003) description of cross-border identities and Everett S. Lee (1966) A Theory of Migration. The results are analyzed on the basis of these theoretical assumption and previous research on the topic. The result show that the majority of respondents had a preunderstanding about Sweden before they arrived. The information is mainly provided through contacts in Sweden. Safety, security and permanent residence permit constituted the most significant factors for the choice of destination country. Previous studies show that refugees undergo a mentalitet- and identity change associated with migration (Cormos, 2014). Whether respondents experiencing an identity change tends to be an individual experience. Consideration should be given to the notion the refugee had about migration and how the life situation looked before migration. Furthermore, identity problems tends mainly arise when the refugee's internal self-definition not corresponds with the surroundings definition. What may be considered to affect the identity in the new society is partly the refugees ”new” self-definition, and the experience of the <b>surroundings</b> <b>external</b> definition. Whether this is consistent or not brings consequences for the refugee's identity. Syrian refugees everyday life tend to be characterized by a cultural diversity which is resulting in a fusion of different cultural elements of life and lifestyles, which in turn tends to result in new hybrid identities.
