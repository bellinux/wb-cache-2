5|$|A {{company from}} the 2/28th Battalion {{captured}} Victoria shortly after coming ashore, and the battalion first met opposition at Flagstaff <b>Hill</b> <b>at</b> 10:45 am. One of the battalion's companies subsequently captured the hill, while its other companies continued to advance. The 2/28th Battalion encountered increasing opposition {{as the day}} progressed, particularly {{to the west of}} its area of responsibility. During the afternoon of 10 June the battalion engaged Japanese troops in the area west of Flagstaff <b>Hill</b> (<b>at</b> the junction of Callaghan and MacArthur Roads), with the infantrymen being supported by tanks and mortars; the Australians counted 18 Japanese dead {{by the end of the}} day, and suffered several fatalities and men wounded in this fighting. After civilians reported that no Japanese were stationed on the Hamilton peninsula which formed the western side of Victoria Harbour, a troop from the 2/11th Commando Squadron was landed in the area during 10 June and secured it without opposition.|$|E
5|$|On 20 April 2005, the Norwegian Ski Federation's board supported, with 13 against 1 vote, {{to build}} both a normal {{and a large}} <b>hill</b> <b>at</b> Rødkleiva and to close Vikersundbakken. However, the {{following}} day Svarstad Haugland stated that the government supported keeping Vikersundbakken rather than building a new venue in Rødkleiva. Clas Brede Bråthen responded that the federation hoped to build the venue with grants from the private sector, such as naming rights, and used Color Line Stadion in Ålesund {{as an example of}} a venue that had generated significant funding from corporate sponsors. A majority of the county chapters supported Vikersundbakken, with only 4 of 19 chapters supporting Rødkleiva. The Norwegian Ski Federation's national convention voted on 28 May with a large majority to place first a normal hill and then a ski flying <b>hill</b> <b>at</b> Rødkleiva.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{tenacious}} North Korean defense {{halted the}} Marines. Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans {{out of their}} positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill overwhelmed them, one <b>hill</b> <b>at</b> a time. The Marines approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and a barrage from U.S. tanks, but strong resistance caused heavy casualties, {{and they had to}} withdraw. The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back. The division's previously successful tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise failed in the face of massive U.S. numerical superiority.|$|E

5|$|In 1836, the Reverend Richard Hill {{had a fit}} of {{apoplexy}} in the vestry and died. Soon {{after this}} dramatic event, and while the church was still in mourning, the Right Reverend William Grant Broughton was installed as Bishop of Australia during a service in St James' lasting five hours. Since Macquarie's {{plans for a new}} cathedral on George Street had not come to fruition, Broughton acted as if St James' were a pro-cathedral. Robert Cartwright and then Napoleon Woodd succeeded Richard <b>Hill</b> <b>at</b> St James'.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Budge was {{approached}} by a resident of Gebelein {{who claimed to have}} found more mummies.

5|$|One {{neighborhood}} of New York County is contiguous with the U.S. mainland. Marble <b>Hill</b> <b>at</b> one time {{was part of}} Manhattan Island, but the Harlem River Ship Canal, dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan. Before World War I, {{the section of the}} original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from The Bronx was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Civic District Master Plan public {{exhibition}} was held from 22–26 February by the URA.

The URA explained that the 380m long tunnel would help smoothen the major traffic intersection in front of Cathay Building and direct heavy traffic away from the Marina to Orchard areas, thus giving the museum precinct a peaceful and quiet ambience.|$|E
