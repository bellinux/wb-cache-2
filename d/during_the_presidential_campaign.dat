The official statement from the President's office, however, claims that the house was used only a few times for meetings and not when he was president.|$|E
25|$|Roh was {{perceived}} as an anti-American before the presidential race, which was not a handicap <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign.</b> Public antipathy to the United States was prevalent in 2002, particularly evoked by the Yangju highway incident, where two South Korean middle school girls were crushed to death by a U.S. Army armored bridge-laying vehicle. The American soldiers involved were tried by a U.S. Army court martial, but the Roh administration continued to demand a South Korean trial, although the incident occurred 'on duty' (as part of a convoy) and thus was an American responsibility under the Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and South Korea.|$|E

25|$|On February 24, 2017, Republican Congressman Darrell Issa {{called for}} a special {{prosecutor}} to investigate whether Russia meddled with the U.S. election and was in contact with Trump's team <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign,</b> saying {{that it would be}} improper for Trump's appointee, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to lead the investigation. On March 19, 2017, Schiff told Meet the Press that there was sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation. On March 22, 2017, Schiff stated that he had seen evidence of a higher standard than circumstantial regarding collusion. On April 6, 2017, Nunes temporarily recused himself from the Russia investigation after the House Ethics Committee announced that it would investigate accusations against him that he had disclosed classified information without authorization. Representative Mike Conaway subsequently assumed control of the investigation.|$|E
25|$|On January 14, 2004, Bush {{announced}} a Vision for Space Exploration, {{calling for the}} completion of the International Space Station by 2010 and the retirement of the space shuttle while developing a new spacecraft called the Crew Exploration Vehicle under the title Project Constellation. The CEV would be used to return American astronauts to the Moon by 2018, with the objective of establishing a permanent lunar base, and eventually sending future manned missions to Mars. To this end, the plan proposes that NASA's budget increase by five percent every year until it is capped at US$18 billion in 2008, with only inflationary increases thereafter. The planned retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2010 after the ISS is completed is also expected to free up US$5 billion to US$6 billion a year. The US$16.2 billion budget for 2005 proposed by NASA met with resistance from House and Senate spending committees, and the initiative was little-mentioned <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign.</b> Nonetheless, the budget was approved with only minor changes shortly after the November elections.|$|E

This was Pat's first national television appearance, and she, her daughters, and the dog were featured prominently. Defending himself {{as a man of}} the people, Nixon stressed his wife's abilities as a stenographer, then said, [...] "I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat.

500|$|For {{the train}} ride to Washington, Obama invited 41"everyday Americans" [...] {{that he met}} during his presidential {{campaign}} to accompany him on the tour and attend other inaugural events, including the swearing-in ceremony, the parade and an inaugural ball. The group of citizens who joined the tour had shared stories with then-candidate Obama about {{themselves and their families}} <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign,</b> and included Matt Kuntz and Lilly Ledbetter. Kuntz, who lost his own step‑brother to suicide after returning home from the GulfWar, dedicated his efforts to improve mental health screening for IraqWar veterans. Ledbetter, who learned years later that her employer had discriminated against her in pay based on gender, lost her case before the Supreme Court because she did not file her claim within 180days of the discriminatory act. Nine days after his inauguration, Obama as president signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, allowing claims filed against employers not only within 180days of the pay discrimination, but also restarting the 180-day period for claims upon receiving any paycheck based on a discriminatory pay action.|$|E
