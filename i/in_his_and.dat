5|$|I Want You is {{the fourteenth}} studio album by American soul {{musician}} Marvin Gaye, released March 16, 1976, on Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. Recording sessions for the album took place throughout 1975 and 1976 at Motown Recording Studios, {{also known as}} Hitsville West, and Gaye's personal studio Marvin's Room in Los Angeles, California. The album has often been noted by critics for producer Leon Ware's exotic, low-key production and the erotic, sexual themes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> Gaye's songwriting. The album's cover artwork adapts neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes's famous painting The Sugar Shack (1971).|$|E
5|$|In June 1139 {{a knight}} was killed during {{a fight in}} Oxford between a party of Roger of Salisbury's men {{and a group of}} noblemen. The king ordered Roger to attend his court to explain the {{circumstances}} of the incident and to surrender custody of his castles, which Roger refused to do, resulting <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> Alexander's arrest; Roger's other nephew, Nigel, evaded capture. Another possible explanation for the arrests is offered by the Gesta Stephani, a contemporary chronicle, which reported the king's fear that Roger and his nephews were plotting to hand their castles to the Empress Matilda. Stephen may alternatively have been attempting to assert his rights over the castles, and demonstrate his authority over powerful subjects. Alexander was imprisoned in Oxford, in conditions described by some medieval chroniclers as bad.|$|E
50|$|In the 1,000 m event he came second <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heat <b>and</b> {{then came}} third <b>in</b> <b>his</b> quarterfinal <b>and</b> was eliminated; he {{finished}} eleventh. In the 500 metre contest he came third <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heat <b>and</b> was eliminated and finished 23rd.|$|R

5|$|In {{his fifth}} {{year with the}} Grizzlies, he became the franchise's all-time leading rebounder on March 24 against the New York Knicks when he grabbed his 3,072nd rebound in a Grizzlies uniform. He made 29 {{consecutive}} free throw attempts from January 24 to 28, tying the second best mark in Grizzlies history, including two straight games going 12–12 from the line, tying the best single-game mark in franchise history. Gasol and the Grizzlies returned to {{the playoffs for the}} third time <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> his team's history. Once again, they were eliminated in the first round and did not win a single game against the Dallas Mavericks.|$|E
5|$|By early 1938 the Group {{had made}} their static rocket motor, which {{originally}} burned for three seconds, run for over a minute. In May that year, Parsons was invited by Forrest J Ackerman to lecture on his rocketry work at Chapter Number 4 of the Los Angeles Science Fiction League (LASFL). Although he never joined the society, he occasionally attended their talks, on one occasion conversing with a teenage Ray Bradbury. Another scientist {{to become involved in}} the GALCIT project was Sidney Weinbaum, a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal Marxist; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in their creation of a largely secretive communist discussion group at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the People's Daily World and joined the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he refused to join the American Communist Party, causing a break <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> Weinbaum's friendship. This, coupled with the need to focus on paid employment, led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group, leaving only its three founding members by late 1938.|$|E
5|$|Libby and Dan {{protest against}} the {{decision}} and Susan tries blackmailing a senior board member. The board change their minds and Susan becomes pregnant. Dan {{finds it hard to}} relate to Susan and begins to question her part <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> Libby's lives. Karl books a holiday for them all to get away and talk. Dan and Susan argue about where the baby will be brought up and Dan says that he regrets agreeing to the surrogacy. When Dan goes for a walk, Susan follows him and they continue to argue. Dan walks away and Susan tries running after him, but she trips and falls. She calls out, but Dan does not hear her and he walks off. Libby and Karl find Susan and rush her to the hospital, where Susan miscarries. Susan attends the memorial for Libby and Dan's baby and during Dan's speech, she lashes out at him. As everyone leaves the park, Susan collapses and reveals that she cannot feel her legs. Susan has an MS relapse, but she recovers. Susan and Karl take up golf, and Susan also enrols in a media course at Eden Hills University. She begins receiving threats, which tell her to leave the university. Susan is deeply upset by the threats and her family worry that the stress will lead to an MS relapse.|$|E

25|$|George Earl Toolson was {{a pitcher}} with the Newark Bears in 1949, a farm {{team for the}} New York Yankees in the AAA-class International League.

But due to the reserve clause <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> every other player's contract, under which teams reserved rights to a player for a year after the contract expired, he was effectively bound to the talent-rich Yankees and could not negotiate a new contract with another team.|$|E

25|$|As warden (kerkmeester) of St. John's, Vijd between 1410 and 1420 {{not only}} financed the {{construction}} of the principal chapel's bay, but endowed a new chapel off the choir, which took his family name and was regularly to hold masses <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> his ancestors' memory. It was for this new chapel that he commissioned Hubert van Eyck to create an unusually large and complex polyptych altarpiece. He was recorded as donor on an inscription on the original, now lost, frame. The chapel was dedicated to St. John the Baptist, whose traditional attribute is the Lamb of God, a symbol of Christ.|$|E
25|$|The most {{successful}} artisan is Jacobo Angeles, whose work have been prominently displayed at The Smithsonian and the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago. It {{can also be}} found in numerous museums, art colleges and galleries in the world. Jacobo learned to carve from his father when he was twelve, and later was mentored by elders <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> other communities. While alebrijes designs have been innovative and incorporating modern elements, the Angeles family’s designs focus on representations of Zapotec culture. This {{can be seen in the}} painted designs, based on influences such as the friezes of Mitla, and other ancient symbols as well as the continued use in aniline paints made from natural ingredients such as the bark of the copal tree, baking soda, lime juice, pomegranate seeds, zinc, indigo, huitlacoche and cochineal. Each year, Jacobo travels the United States to promote Oaxacan folk art in general to educational institution as well as a speaker at art institutions.|$|E
25|$|The murders {{were not}} {{committed}} {{in the heat of}} sudden passion for some fancied wrong: they were the result of a deliberate system. The wronged individual laid his case before a quasijudicial tribunal demanding the death, say, of a mining boss and urging his reasons. If they were satisfactory, as they usually were, the murder was decreed; but the task was not assigned to the aggrieved person or to any one <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> the victim's neighborhood: perhaps directly aggrieved parties might be tempted to use more force or more cruelty than necessary. Two or more relatively disinterested Mollies from {{a different part of the}} county or even from the adjoining county were selected to do the killing because, being unknown, they could the more easily escape detection. Refusal to carry out the dictate of the conclave was dangerous and seldom happened, although an arrangement of substitution, if properly supported, was permitted. The meeting generally took place in an upper room of a hotel or saloon and, after the serious business, came the social reunion with deep libations of whiskey.|$|E
25|$|These are {{the kings}} who ruled {{in the land}} of Edom before a king ruled the {{children}} of Israel. And Bela ben Beor ruled in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.

500|$|After {{establishing}} Hudson Township, Hudson {{played a}} significant part in the buying, selling and farming of land <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> neighboring towns.

He also provided accommodations for visitors to the town. Hudson was party to about 200 financial transactions, making him a prominent figure in the area. During this period, it was typical for employers to pay employees partially in whiskey. Hudson broke this tradition by declining to pay his workers with alcohol, to their disgruntlement.|$|E
500|$|Springsteen himself {{remained}} quite interested <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> the band's commercial fortunes.

He called it [...] "the worst day of my life", and resigned after the tournament. Stand-in captain David Luiz and goalkeeper Júlio César both offered apologies to the people of Brazil. Fred, who was booed by Brazilian fans during the match, said it was the worst defeat <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> his teammates' careers. He later announced his retirement from international football following the tournament. Recovering from his injury, Neymar expressed his support to his teammates and, despite the 7–1 score, said he was proud {{to be part of this}} team.|$|E
500|$|When {{he began}} Louis Riel, Brown had {{increasingly}} been {{making use of}} notes and appendices in his work, beginning with his researching and annotating the 1994 comics essay, [...] "My Mom was a Schizophrenic".

[...] In Louis Riel, the appendix totalled 23 pages, along with a bibliography and an index. [...] Alan Moore's use of extensive end notes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>and</b> Eddie Campbell's From Hell, another fictional reconstruction of a historical event, influenced Brown's appendices.

500|$|In AD 15 he {{held the}} consulship {{alongside}} Gaius Norbanus Flaccus.

He reportedly carried out his duties as consul well, although he was prone to violence and earned the nickname [...] "Castor" [...] from fighting an equestrian. There was also an incident at a theater between the Praetorians and claqueurs ("actors") in which Drusus reportedly sided with the actors, preventing the Praetorian Guard from punishing unruly actors. In Annals 1.77, Tacitus says the unruly behavior of actors and the crowds were later addressed by the Senate which passed measures allowing the praetors to punish riotous spectators. Such were his excesses that Tiberius decided to make him governor of Illyricum the following year, both to give him experience in war and bolster his popularity with the troops - perhaps also to keep {{him away from the}} indulgences of city life.|$|E
