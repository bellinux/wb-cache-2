5|$|The {{station was}} badly damaged on 24 April 1993 by the Bishopsgate bombing and was {{temporarily}} closed as a result. About £250,000 of damage was caused to the station, {{primarily to the}} <b>glass</b> <b>roof.</b> The station re-opened on 26 April 1993.|$|E
5|$|Green Park {{railway station}} opened in 1870 as the {{terminus}} of Midland Railway's Mangotsfield and Bath Branch Line. For {{some of its}} life, it was known as Bath Queen Square. It includes a vaulted <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> in a single-span wrought iron arch structure. Parts of the distinctive <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> were damaged during bombing raids in April 1942, and the glazing was not re-instated during railway usage after the war. Following the Beeching Report, passenger trains ceased from 1966 and the last goods train ran in 1971. In the 1980s the rail approaches to the station were redeveloped as a major supermarket opened in December 1982, and the station itself {{is used as a}} pedestrian passageway to and from the city; {{there are a number of}} small shop units in the former station buildings.|$|E

5|$|The {{museum was}} {{designed}} in a French inspired Egyptian Revival style by the architects Antoine Nahas and Pierre Leprince Ringuet, and built with Lebanese ochre limestone. It comprises a basement, a ground floor, a mezzanine floor and a terrace; the central block {{is covered by}} a <b>glass</b> <b>roof,</b> above the mezzanine, giving natural overhead light.|$|E
5|$|So far {{during this}} period, Leeds has seen much development, {{particularly}} in the city centre, most notably the highrise developments such as Bridgewater Place, the developments around Clarence Dock, K2 (albeit a conversion from an older building) {{as well as many}} developments incorporating student accommodation. The 2002 redevelopment of Leeds railway station incorporated a notable steel and <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> covering the main platform hall and providing panoramic views to the south west from the mezzanine level.|$|E
5|$|The Corridor {{is one of}} the world's {{earliest}} retail arcades, {{designed by}} architect Henry Goodridge and built in 1825, with a <b>glass</b> <b>roof.</b> The High Street end has a Doric colonnade. Each end has marble columns. A musicians gallery, with a wrought iron balustrade and gilt lions heads and garlands, is in the centre of the arcade. Cleveland Bridge was built in 1826 by William Hazledine with Henry Goodridge as the architect.|$|E
50|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>roofed</b> {{shopping}} arcade, stepped war memorial {{and market}} square {{mentioned in the}} book can still be found in Hitchin. Nearby is the former Fairfield Hospital (now Fairfield Park) which appears as the Northgate Asylum in the book.|$|R

50|$|Thompson {{served as}} {{voluntary}} curator until 1924. The local corporation provided a small grant and also gave the museum {{the use of}} a building in Egerton Park known as the Egerton Park Shelter Hall. This <b>glass</b> <b>roofed</b> hall had been built in 1903.|$|R
5|$|The Girossi newsstands project, {{which was}} never carried out, was a {{commission}} from the tradesman Enrique Girossi de Sanctis. It would have consisted of 20 newsstands, spread throughout Barcelona. Each would have included a public lavatory, a flower stand and glass panels for advertisements {{as well as}} a clock, a calendar, a barometer and a thermometer. Gaudí conceived a structure with iron pillars and marble and glass slabs, crowned by a large iron and <b>glass</b> <b>roof,</b> with a gas illumination system.|$|E
5|$|The station, {{which had}} been subject to {{structural}} neglect prior to World War II, suffered extensive bomb damage and was hit by several incendiary devices which damaged the roof. A high explosive also hit platform 8. The original <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> had been removed before the war {{in an attempt to}} save it; however, the factory in which the roof was stored was itself badly bombed, destroying the roof.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the exterior, Pei {{borrowed from the}} tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby Kyoto. He created a concise spaceframe wrapped into French limestone {{and covered with a}} <b>glass</b> <b>roof.</b> Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a bench in the entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old keyaki tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350million.|$|E
50|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>roofed</b> element {{surrounds}} a seven storey car park, {{and when}} originally opened, an ice rink. This was closed in 1999 when a refurbishment programme (initiated {{to compete with}} the newer Buchanan Galleries), saw it being replaced by more shops and an enlarged restaurant area.|$|R
5000|$|Shops and {{factories}} had particular problems. Factories with {{large areas of}} <b>glass</b> <b>roofing</b> {{found it impossible to}} install temporary blackout panels and permanent methods (such as paint) lost natural light during daylight. Shops had to install double [...] "airlock" [...] doors to avoid lights showing as customers arrived and departed.|$|R
40|$|The {{load-carrying}} {{steel structure}} of the shopping centre is proposed in two versions. The more advantageous version is elaborated in detail. The roof structure is designed using three-dimensional curved trusses with <b>glass</b> <b>roofing</b> and the structure rests on steel columns. The ground plan dimensions of the steel structure are 120 by 73 meters...|$|R
5|$|Between 5–28 June 1926, {{the station}} was closed to allow the Southern Railway to carry out various works, {{including}} the rebuilding of the platforms, relaying of the tracks and installation of {{a new system of}} electrical signalling – the four-aspect colour light scheme. The station was also renovated and the <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> cleaned. The number of platforms was reduced from nine to eight, with five set aside for the new electric trains. The signal box spanning the width of the railway bridge was removed. In July 1939, Cannon Street was closed for a week following a fire in Borough Market which prevented any trains accessing it.|$|E
5|$|Three modern {{shopping}} centres {{are located}} in the town. Park Mall opened in 1985 on the former Folkestone Glass Works site. The town's main shopping centre is County Square, which was built over Hempsted Street and connecting roads, opening in 1973 as the Tufton Centre. In 1989, the centre was renamed to County Square and refurbished by CIN Properties, who added a <b>glass</b> <b>roof.</b> In 2008, the centre was expanded to include 50,000 sq ft of new retail space including a Debenhams store. Outside the town centre is the Ashford Designer Outlet designed by Richard Rogers, which attracts around 3 million customers a year. The centre has won industry awards for Retail Destination of the Year and Best Shopping Venue and has been praised by the British Parking Association for its range of facilities, cleanliness and lack of crime. A Waitrose store opened in November 2009 on the former Templar Barracks site, followed by a John Lewis store in November 2013.|$|E
5|$|The town centre, {{which has}} seen {{significant}} regeneration {{over the past}} decade, is dominated by its distinctive town hall (Hôtel de Ville) at Place du Soldat Inconnu. It {{was built in the}} Flemish Renaissance style between 1911 and 1925 to commemorate the unification of the cities of Calais and Saint Pierre in 1885. A previous town hall had been erected in 1818. One of the most elegant landmarks in the city, its ornate 74 metre (246ft) high clock tower and belfry can be seen from out to sea and chimes throughout the day and has been protected by UNESCO since 2005 as part of a series of belfries across the region. The building parts have also been listed as a series of historic monuments by government decree of 26 June 2003, including its roofs and belfry, main hall, <b>glass</b> <b>roof,</b> the staircase, corridor serving the first floor, the rooms on the first floor (including decoration): the wedding room, the VIP lounge, the lounge of the council and the cabinet room. The hall has stained glass windows and numerous paintings and exquisite decor. It houses police offices.|$|E
5000|$|Some modern {{athletic}} {{facilities are}} using affordable, less complex roof systems that resemble retractable roofs in appearance and effect. These roof systems, {{commonly referred to}} as open roofs, are constructed with similar materials as retractable roofs. Most open roof companies offer polycarbonate or tempered <b>glass</b> <b>roofs</b> for safer sports play and durability.|$|R
50|$|A fresh {{planning}} {{application for}} the East Barnet School building was submitted by new architects Frank Shaw Associates Ltd in April 2008. The new design follows {{the same basic}} site layout as before, but the curved <b>glass</b> <b>roofed</b> elliptical building {{is replaced by a}} simple oblong box. The plans were agreed by the borough planning committee in June 2008.|$|R
50|$|Indicative designs show several linked buildings, {{the highest}} {{of which would be}} 10 storeys from Flourmill Lane. The {{development}} would also feature gardens, <b>glass</b> <b>roofed</b> court-yards and the pedestrianisation of Broad Street to create a civic space between the development and Marischal College. Provost Skene's House which dates from the 17th century would be retained as part of the proposals.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s it was {{occupied}} by Edmund Selous and his wife Fanny Margaret Maxwell. Selous was a naturalist, author and traveler. The <b>glass</b> <b>roofed</b> round tower of the Castle was once decorated with his collection of butterflies. During their time at the castle, Fanny Margaret Maxwell founded the local branch of the Women's Institute in 1923, and became its first president.|$|R
50|$|The {{restoration}} work {{includes a}} <b>glass</b> <b>roofed</b> courtyard {{and a new}} gallery which displays aspects of the National Flat Textile collection. As well as historic machinery, a raised walkway gives a view of textiles in production at Melin Teifi, the site's commercial woollen mill. In 2005 a Research and Collections Centre opened which includes a room dedicated to hands-on learning opportunities.|$|R
40|$|In the 19 th-century architecture, {{the use of}} {{iron and}} <b>glass</b> <b>roofs</b> made it {{possible}} to bring light to the core of buildings. Together with the social context of the Industrial Revolution and the improvements in heating techniques, the creation of a “Garden of Eden” became popular. Building typologies like railway stations, market halls, fabrication halls, exhibition halls and greenhouses exploited this possibility at full extend. When renovating the 19 th-century iron and <b>glass</b> <b>roofs,</b> both the heritage value and modern standards on safety and structural performance have to be taken into account. A first part of the research, which is based on literature study, goes into the construction history of iron and <b>glass</b> <b>roofs</b> to define the heritage value of the roof (and its components) to be restored. The second part puts forward a methodology to recalculate the performance of the original structure by taking into account iron and glass. Lab tests were performed to deliver data that was still missing to do so. Tests on historic adhesives, namely putty, were carried out. And modern adhesives were applied on elements that show effects of deterioration, present in renovation projects. Finally, a parameter study was carried out to determine the effect of renovation options which are applied nowadays: replacing historic putty by modern adhesives, replacing single glass by laminated glass, etc. Simulations showed that taking in account the original single glass panels in a calculation (even when connected with putty), has a positive impact on the overall behaviour...|$|R
