25|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> (ID) of an HPLC {{column is}} an {{important}} parameter that influences the detection sensitivity and separation selectivity in gradient elution. It also determines the quantity of analyte that can be loaded onto the column. Larger columns are usually seen in industrial applications, such as the purification of a drug product for later use. Low-ID columns have improved sensitivity and lower solvent consumption {{at the expense of}} loading capacity.|$|E
25|$|Varricchio et al. (1997) {{described}} the exact {{structure of the}} nests. They were built from sediments, they were dish shaped, about 100cm in <b>internal</b> <b>diameter,</b> and with a pronounced raised rim encircling the eggs. The more complete nests had between 16 (minimum number in MOR 246) and 24 (MOR 963) eggs. The eggs are shaped like elongated teardrops, with the more tapered ends pointed downwards and imbedded about halfway in the sediment. The eggs are pitched at an angle so that, on average, the upper half {{is closer to the}} center of the nest. There is no evidence that plant matter was present in the nest.|$|E
25|$|Jari Dam {{is also an}} earthfill type with silt as {{the core}} material. Gravel is applied on the {{shoulders}} of the dam. The maximum height of Jari dam above the core trench is 274 feet and the length is 6,800 feet. The main spillway is a submerged orifice type with 9 radial gates, 36 x 40 feet each; it has a maximum capacity of 1.1 million cusecs. The emergency spillway is weir type with an erodible bund and a maximum capacity of 0.23 million cusecs. The 5 tunnels are steel and concrete lined and 1,560 feet long in bedrock. The <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> ranges between 26 and 31 feet.|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} reamer has {{two or more}} cutting surfaces. The {{combination reamer}} is precision ground into a pattern that resembles the part’s multiple <b>internal</b> <b>diameters.</b> The advantage of using a combination reamer {{is to reduce the}} number of turret operations, while more precisely holding depths, <b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> and concentricity. Combination reamers are mostly used in screw machines or second-operation lathes, not with Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines because G-code can be easily generated to profile <b>internal</b> <b>diameters.</b>|$|R
30|$|The Deluxe Jaszczak phantom (model ECT/DLX/P) is a Plexiglas {{cylinder}} partially {{composed of}} cold rods (diameters 4.8 to 12.7  mm) and partially of six inserted hollow spheres. The main cylinder of 6060  mL {{was filled with}} a 5  kBq mL− 1 FDG solution. Four spheres (<b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> 7.86, 12.43, 15.43, and 24.82  mm) were filled with a 15  kBq mL− 1 FDG solution. The remaining two spheres (<b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> 9.89 and 31.27  mm) were filled with cold water.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to a naturally-aspirated engine, a turbocharged engine would warrant pipes with larger <b>internal</b> <b>diameters,</b> due to the higher gas flow rate arising from the boosted cylinder filling.|$|R
25|$|The {{components}} {{include the}} yoke, the magnetic coil, the poles, the polepiece, and the external control circuitry. The pole piece must be manufactured {{in a very}} symmetrical manner, as this provides the boundary conditions for the magnetic field that forms the lens. Imperfections {{in the manufacture of}} the pole piece can induce severe distortions in the magnetic field symmetry, which induce distortions that will ultimately limit the lenses' ability to reproduce the object plane. The exact dimensions of the gap, pole piece <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> and taper, as well as the overall design of the lens is often performed by finite element analysis of the magnetic field, whilst considering the thermal and electrical constraints of the design.|$|E
25|$|Splicing timber piles {{is still}} quite common {{and is the}} easiest of all the piling {{materials}} to splice. The normal method for splicing is by driving the leader pile first, driving a steel tube (normally 60–100cm long, with an <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> no smaller than the minimum toe diameter) half its length onto {{the end of the}} leader pile. The follower pile is then simply slotted into {{the other end of the}} tube and driving continues. The steel tube is simply there to ensure that the two pieces follow each other during driving. If uplift capacity is required, the splice can incorporate bolts, coach screws, spikes or the like to give it the necessary capacity.|$|E
25|$|Another Classical domed mosque type is, {{like the}} Byzantine church of Sergius and Bacchus, the domed polygon within a square. Octagons and hexagons were common, {{such as those}} of Üç Şerefeli Mosque (1437–1447) and Selimiye Mosque in Edirne. The Selimiye Mosque was the first {{structure}} built by the Ottomans that had a larger dome than that of the Hagia Sophia. The dome rises above a square bay. Corner semi-domes convert this into an octagon, which muqarnas transition to a circular base. The dome has an average <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> of about 31.5 meters, while that of Hagia Sophia averages 31.3 meters. Designed and built by architect Mimar Sinan between 1568 and 1574, when he finished it he was 86 years old, and he considered the mosque his masterpiece.|$|E

40|$|The {{developmental}} {{changes in}} the tunica media of the pulmonary trunk and left and right pulmonary arteries were studied in 51 hearts and the great vessels of infants and children up {{to the age of}} ten years who died from non-vascular diseases. The <b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> of the pulmonary arterial tree were measured together with the thickness of the tunica media and the packing density of its elastic fibres. In spite of the age-related (about sixfold) increase in the <b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> of the vessels there were no parallel significant {{changes in the}} characteristics of their tunica media. Furthermore, the configuration of the elastic fibres showed no clear age-related changes in any of the vessels. In conclusion the structure of the wall of the pulmonary trunk and of the pulmonary arteries, although different in embryological origin, seems to show the same pattern of growth during bodily development, with absence of significant correlations between the <b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> {{on the one hand and}} media thickness and packing densities of the elastic fibres on the other. This is possibly the result of the low pulmonary blood pressure...|$|R
30|$|Intubation was {{performed}} using an endotracheal tube with 7.0  mm of <b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> (Mallinckrodt, Dublin, Ireland). The direct laryngoscopy {{was performed}} using a Macintosh blade (Size 4). Participants {{could use a}} flexible mandrel if needed.|$|R
25|$|Other {{advantages}} are {{that because it}} empties near the heart, medications can also be quickly distributed {{to the rest of}} the body. As there is room for multiple parallel compartments (lumen) within the catheter, so that multiple medications can be delivered at once even if they would not be chemically compatible within a single tube. Caregivers can also measure central venous pressure and other physiological variables through the line. It is commonly believed that fluid can be pushed faster through a central venous catheter but as they are often divided into multiple lumens then the <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> is less than that of a large-bore peripheral cannula. They are also longer, which as reflected in Poiseuille's law, requires higher pressure to achieve the same flow, all other variables being equal.|$|E
25|$|The Reynolds number can {{be defined}} for several {{different}} situations where a fluid is in relative motion to a surface. These definitions generally include the fluid properties of density and viscosity, plus a velocity and a characteristic length or characteristic dimension (L in the above equation). This dimension {{is a matter of}} conventionnbsp&– for example radius and diameter are equally valid to describe spheres or circles, but one is chosen by convention. For aircraft or ships, the length or width can be used. For flow in a pipe or a sphere moving in a fluid the <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> is generally used today. Other shapes such as rectangular pipes or non-spherical objects have an equivalent diameter defined. For fluids of variable density such as compressible gases or fluids of variable viscosity such as non-Newtonian fluids, special rules apply. The velocity may also be a matter of convention in some circumstances, notably stirred vessels.|$|E
25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered mandrel is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material against the back side of the tapered rollers. This compressive loading fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|E

The effect of inlet radius is easily discernible at all velocities considered; however it is more pronounced at lower flow rates. At a velocity of 16. 79 cm/s of ozone gas, and for a target sensing time of ≤ 0. 5 seconds; we observed that the inlet radius requirements for gas cells of varying lengths and varying <b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> is not the same for a specific target sensing speed.

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples include}} the half-domes of the late 13th century tomb of Balban and the small dome of the tomb of Khan Shahid, which were made of roughly cut material and would have needed covering surface finishes. Under the Lodi dynasty {{there was a large}} proliferation of tomb building, with octagonal plans reserved for royalty and square plans used for others of high rank, and the first double dome was introduced to India in this period. The first major Mughal building is the domed tomb of Humayun, built between 1562 and 1571 by a Persian architect. The central double dome covers an octagonal central chamber about 15 meters wide and is accompanied by small domed chattri made of brick and faced with stone. Chatris, the domed kiosks on pillars characteristic of Mughal roofs, were adopted from their Hindu use as cenotaphs. The fusion of Persian and Indian architecture {{can be seen in the}} dome shape of the Taj Mahal: the bulbous shape derives from Persian Timurid domes, and the finial with lotus leaf base is derived from Hindu temples. The Gol Gumbaz, or Round Dome, is one of the largest masonry domes in the world. It has an <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> of 41.15 meters and a height of 54.25 meters. The dome was the most technically advanced built in the Deccan. The last major Islamic tomb built in India was the tomb of Safdar Jang (1753–54). The central dome is reportedly triple-shelled, with two relatively flat inner brick domes and an outer bulbous marble dome, although it may actually be that the marble and second brick domes are joined everywhere but under the lotus leaf finial at the top.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 {{the land}} for the temple had to be bought {{in the name of}} three African Ugandan Bahá'ís rather than an {{institution}} directly foreign or domestic. These Bahá'ís were Joseph Mbogo, Erisha Kiwanuka and Max Kanyerezi who held the land in trust. The Bahá'í House of Worship in Uganda, named as the Mother Temple of Africa, is situated on Kikaya Hill on the outskirts of Kampala. At the ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone in 1958 Hands of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum and Músá Banání presented material gifts for the building - some soil from the inner-most Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh and the fortress of Maku where the Báb was imprisoned. The building was designed by Mason Remey and the green dome is made of fixed mosaic tiles from Italy, the lower roof tiles are from Belgium, and the colored glass in the wall panels was brought from Germany. Nine massive columns, each two feet in diameter, support the great dome, itself forty-four feet in diameter at its base; while the two roofs are supported by two sets of twenty seven slightly smaller columns. The overall height is 127ft., the <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> of the building is eighty four feet and the seating capacity is over 600. The inside of the dome is painted a pale blue; the rotunda, into which are set nine enormous windows and fifty-four small windows, all filled with green, amber and pale blue glass, is painted a brilliant white, while the columns and the lower walls are painted a very pale green. All this lends itself to an effect of lightness and airiness which is intensified by the large green and amber glass-filled grilles which stand {{on either side of the}} huge mvule doors.|$|E

40|$|Abeta peptide {{deposits}} {{are observed}} in brain cortical and leptomeningeal microvessels {{in a few}} families, in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in cognitively normal elderly subjects. These deposits, which cause Abeta amyloid angiopathy, are usually associated with other lesions induced by Abeta peptide and tau pathologies. To investigate the consequences of cerebral amyloid angiopathy on arterial morphology and search for correlations with the degree of cognitive impairment, we carried out a prospective clinicopathological and morphometric study in 29 institutionalized elderly patients cognitively normal or affected with sporadic dementia associated with Alzheimer-type lesions, cerebral infarcts or both. We measured the external and <b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> of arteries 40 - 120 microm wide, containing moderate or severe Abeta deposits, and of unaffected arteries in the temporal and frontal lobes. We found no differences in the mean external diameters. In contrast, the mean <b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> of vessels with moderate Abeta deposits were smaller than those of unaffected vessels. Conversely, the <b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> of severely affected vessels were larger than those of unaffected vessels. This suggests that arterial walls become thicker {{during the early stages}} of amyloid angiopathy, and the diameter of the lumen decreases, whereas during advanced stages, the walls become thinner and the lumen becomes larger. In addition, we assessed the overall severity of amyloid angiopathy. This showed that thinner arterial walls and the severity of amyloid angiopathy were correlated to dementia. In a multivariate model that integrates the other macroscopic and microscopic lesions that may be implied in the mechanism of cognitive impairment, the severity of amyloid angiopathy per se explained 10 % of the variability in the cognitive impairment...|$|R
