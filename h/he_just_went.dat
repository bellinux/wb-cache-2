5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
500|$|Fred Russell had a {{well-known}} story of Cody during a chicken-eating contest at Clemson with Herman Stegeman, the coach at Georgia. [...] "Josh weighed about 260 then. He outstripped Stegeman by eleven chickens. He wasn't satisfied just to win. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> on to a decisive victory." [...] As Cody explained: [...] "I got two chickens {{ahead of him}} early and just coasted." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Paul Butterfield was out of the {{commercial}} mainstream. [...] Although for some, he was very much the bluesman, Maria Muldaur commented [...] "he had the whole sensibility and musicality and approach down pat... <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> for it and took it all in, and he embodied the essence of what the blues was all about. Unfortunately, he lived that way a little too much".|$|E
500|$|Donovan {{commented that}} Scott loved Charlene, {{so when he}} saw she was in danger, he forgot to think about himself and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> in to rescue her. Donovan added that Scott was [...] "devastated" [...] when he saw Charlene had been injured. At the hospital, Scott gave Charlene the {{friendship}} ring and declared that they would live together. Minogue told Bourne that Charlene was flattered by the gift, while Donovan stated that it proved that they loved each other and {{were not going to}} break up again. Minogue agreed with Donovan, saying [...] "There is that underlying love whether they are together or not." [...] After learning about the couple's plans to move in together, their friends and neighbours expressed their shock at how serious the couple had become. When Charlene showed the ring to Daphne Clarke (Elaine Smith) and told her how she and Scott wanted to live together, Daphne was taken back. Scott's friend Mike Young (Guy Pearce) also voiced his opposition, but Scott was determined that no one would stop them from moving in together. Bourne noted that Daphne's shock at the couple's plans was [...] "the start of a major controversy, splitting apart the inhabitants of Ramsay Street." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{family moved}} often {{as his father}} worked at jobs along the West Coast, {{although}} they did not move at all between 1940 and 1949. Settled in Piedmont, California, the Eastwoods lived in a very wealthy part of town, had a swimming pool, belonged to the country club, and each parent drove their own car. Clint attended Piedmont Junior High School. Shortly before he was to enter Piedmont High School, he rode his bike on the school's sports field and tore up the wet turf; this resulted in his being asked not to enroll. Instead, he attended Oakland Technical High School, where he was held back due to poor academic scores and scheduled to graduate in January 1949 as a midyear graduate, {{although it is not}} clear if he ever did. [...] "Clint graduated from the airplane shop. I think that was his major," [...] joked classmate Don Kincade. Another high school friend, Don Loomis, echoed [...] "I don't think he was spending that much time at school because he was having a pretty good time elsewhere." [...] "I think what happened is <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> off and started having a good time. I just don't think he finished high school," [...] explained Fritz Manes, a boyhood friend two years younger than Eastwood, who remained associated with him until their falling out in the mid-1980s. Biographer Patrick McGilligan notes that high school graduation records are a matter of strict legal confidentiality.|$|E

500|$|The six {{finally agreed}} that Capper {{had to be}} removed from the house after Michelle Capper told them her {{stepfather}} was going to report her to the police as a missing person. In the early hours of 14 December 1992, Capper was forced into the boot of a stolen white Fiat Panda car and driven 15 miles (25 km) to a narrow lane at Werneth Low near Romiley, on the outskirts of Stockport. In the car were McNeilly, the Powells and Dudson. McNeilly [...] "giggled" [...] as they made the journey. Capper was pushed down an embankment into a patch of brambles and then McNeilly poured petrol over her. Powell stated: [...] "Suzanne was still wobbly and fell over. Bernie [...] said 'Get up.' Bernie pushed her down the hill and poured petrol on her." [...] When McNeilly had difficulty getting the petrol to ignite, Glyn Powell asked Dudson for some paper, who handed him a folded envelope which Powell then attempted to light and use as a taper. After three failed attempts, Dudson said: [...] "In the end <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> up to her with a lighter and lit her. He lit her on the back. She went straight up in flames and was screaming. The flames lit up the whole forest." [...] McNeilly began to sing [...] "Burn baby burn! Burn baby burn!" [...] from the Trammps' song Disco Inferno. [...] Believing Capper to be dead, the four returned to Jean Powell's house, stopping to buy canned drinks on the way. Both Leigh and Pook were at the house when they arrived and Dudson stated: [...] "Cliff [...] asked Glyn , 'Have you done it?' Glyn said 'Yes' and he was laughing. He gave Cliff his lighter back." ...|$|E
60|$|But Freddie wouldn't be comforted. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> {{on looking}} {{as if he had}} {{swallowed}} his last sixpence. However, I got him to promise to come to Marvis Bay with me. He said he might as well be there as anywhere.|$|E
6000|$|... "Trimblett has not behaved well," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Truefitt, slowly, [...] "by no means, but I {{must say}} that he has displayed a certain amount of dash; he didn’t allow anything or anybody to come between him and matrimony. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> and did it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You want {{to watch}} this one-lung boarder of ours," [...] he warned, with a grin. [...] "He's been writing to Berrie, and <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> down to see her. His highfalutin ways, and his fine white hands, have {{put her on the}} slant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, sir," [...] said Mr. Smith, in a shocked voice, [...] "I ain't so bad as that; I've {{got some}} 'art, I hope. <b>He's</b> <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> {{for a little}} trip with 'is old pal Hardy on the Conqueror. Kybird's idea it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cert'nly! Cert'nly!" [...] chuckled Ol' Mistah Buzzard. [...] "It's Mistah Mockah the Mocking-bird. Why, {{that bird}} <b>just</b> likes to <b>go</b> around making trouble; <b>he</b> <b>just</b> {{naturally}} likes to. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> around mocking everything and everybody he hears, until {{sometimes it seems}} like yo' couldn't be sure of yo' own voice when yo' hear it. Why do yo' ask, Brer Coon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, then, Barney's jist my daughter's own son; and he {{coming down}} from the {{mountains}} with turf, and said he must lave the kishes here, till <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> back round Loch Sheen with the ass, he'd borrowed from Paddy Byrne, and he'd be--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot say for certain," [...] Ronald replied; [...] "but {{if you ask}} {{my opinion}} I should say, that having no stomach for meeting people outside, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> out the way I came in, {{especially}} as I heard the worshipful magistrate say that a board in the attic had been lifted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not ill. Upset. And {{it was my}} fault, too. Thinking he'd be interested, I {{read him}} a piece from the paper where I seen about these English Suffragettes, and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> up in the air. I guess he'll be all right now you've come back. I was a fool to read it, I reckon. I kind of forgot for the moment.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But all {{the folks}} {{are talking about}} it, Eb. And mother is {{fretting}} her heart out over it. Father has never acted like himself since these meetings began. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> there night after night, and sits like a mummy, with his head down. And almost everybody else in Avonlea has testified." ...|$|R
5000|$|Summers {{came from}} a family of athletes, with a father who was a prizefighter in the United States Navy and a mother who was a pro bowler. Summers {{received}} his nickname [...] "Champ" [...] from his father: [...] "Dad took one look at me when I was born and said, 'He looks like <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> 10 rounds with Joe Louis.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Old Man Coyote {{is full of}} tricks. People {{with such}} clever wits as his usually are full of tricks. On the other hand Bowser the Hound isn't tricky at all. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> {{straight}} ahead with the thing {{he has to do}} and does it in the most earnest way. Not being tricky himself, he sometimes forgets to watch out for tricks in others.|$|R
6000|$|... (4) Mr. Booth {{refuses to}} {{guarantee}} his officers any fixed amount of salary. While {{he and his}} family of high officials live in comfort, if not in luxury, the pledged slaves whose devotion is the foundation of any true success the Army has met with often have [...] "hardly food enough to sustain life. One good fellow frankly told me that when he had nothing <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> and begged." ...|$|E
60|$|He went on stubbornly for a time. Then {{the strain}} became too great for him. A hot, {{accumulated}} consciousness was always awake in his chest, his wrists felt swelled and quivering, his mind became full of lustful images, his eyes seemed blood-flushed. He fought with himself furiously, to remain normal. He {{did not seek}} any woman. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> on {{as if he were}} normal. Till he must either take some action or beat his head against the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only this, Macumazahn, {{that the}} axe went {{straight}} through my brother from {{the crown of}} {{his head to the}} groin, cutting him in two, and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> on talking! Indeed, he did more, for stooping down he gathered a white lily-bloom which grew there and gave it to Nada, who smelt at it, smiled and thanked him, and then thrust it into her girdle, still thanking him all the while. Yes, she did this for I saw it with my eyes, Macumazahn." ...|$|E

5000|$|French Holly was not {{particularly}} adept at jumping obstacles, relying on his size and strength to compensate. In 1998 Ferdy Murphy said of him: [...] "When he's out in front like that he doesn't bother shortening up at a hurdle, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> and kicks {{them out of the}} way and goes straight through. He's so big he gets away with it. A smaller horse might hurt himself".|$|R
6000|$|He {{could not}} tell her, of course, the secret details of the thing. Naturally those must remain hidden. No, <b>he</b> would <b>just</b> <b>go</b> airily in and say: ...|$|R
60|$|In {{a little}} while Gudu screamed loudly: 'I am burnt! I am burnt!' though he was not burnt at all. Now, though Isuro had the leaves about him, he did not dare to produce them {{at the last moment}} lest the baboon should guess why he had stayed behind. So <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> round a corner for a short time, and then came hopping back in a great hurry. But, quick though he was, Gudu had been quicker still, and nothing {{remained}} but some drops of water.|$|E
6000|$|... "D'you {{remember}} my {{telling you about}} that chap I met in Brittany? I saw him the other day here. He's just off to Tahiti. He was broke to the world. He was a brasseur d'affaires, a stockbroker I suppose you call it in English; {{and he had a}} wife and family, and he was earning a large income. He chucked it all to become a painter. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> off and settled down in Brittany and began to paint. He hadn't got any money and did {{the next best thing to}} starving." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was terrible. It {{was some}} kind of a stroke. He had been working too hard and taking no exercise. You know when he sent Steve away that time he didn't engage anybody else in his place. He went back to his old way of living, which the doctor had warned him against. He worked and worked, until one day, Bailey says, he fainted at the office. They brought him home, and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> out like a burned-out candle. I--I went to him, but for a long time he wouldn't see me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, nothin' like that--though there's nothin' to stop him. He's straight, all right, all right. But <b>he</b> <b>just</b> won't {{fall for}} {{anything}} in skirts. He dances, an' runs around, an' has a good time, an' beyond that--nitsky. A lot of 'em's got fooled on him. I bet you there's a dozen girls {{in love with him}} right now. An' <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> on turnin' 'em down. There was Lily Sanderson--you know her.

50|$|Head of Cheka Srubov {{describes}} {{the concept of}} the necessity of violence in the affairs of the Revolution. If ordinary executors simply take their revenge on the bourgeois with sadistic pleasure, enjoying the animal fear of victims, their pleas for mercy, then Srubov justifies the horrible bloodbath with certain public welfare. Pangs of conscience become so unbearable to Srubov that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> insane: it starts to seem to him that everything around is filled with blood.|$|R
