U. S. 1960 - 2000 data are tested using 2 SLS with heteroskedasticity controls. Data in first differences are used to reduce multicollinearity, non stationarity and autocorrelation. The models explain 90 % {{of the variance in}} plant and equipment demand, 85 % of housing demand and 67 % of <b>inventory</b> demand. Plant, <b>equipment</b> and <b>inventory</b> investment appear driven by the accelerator effect, crowd out, depreciation, interest, and the exchange rate; residential construction by disposable income.

500|$|Equipment means tangible, {{non-expendable}} property acquired {{with federal}} assistance funds, {{that has a}} useful life {{of more than one}} year, and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit (though, consistent with a recipient’s own equipment policy, lower cost limits may be established). Basically, this section requires that, as per [...] and [...] regulations, equipment must be used in the federal program it was bought for, or—when appropriate—other federal programs. Additionally, the recipient must keep equipment records, perform a physical <b>equipment</b> <b>inventory</b> at least once every two years, and implement an appropriate internal control system to safeguard and maintain the equipment. When equipment with a current fair market value of $5,000 or more is no longer needed, it may be retained or sold, as a proportionate share is provided to the federal government amount of the current fair market value, based on the percent of federal funds to own recipients fund used to buy the item.|$|E
