5|$|Activision {{provided}} {{a budget of}} US$1.8 million; the amount was intentionally kept low to make the project manageable for Nihilistic and reduce the risk to Activision, which was relatively inexperienced with RPGs at the time. Nihilistic's management was committed to the entire team working in a one-room <b>environment</b> <b>with</b> no walls, doors, or offices, believing this would force the individual groups to communicate and allow each department to respond to queries immediately, saving hours or days of development time. Redemptions story was developed with input from Wolf; it was co-written by Daniel Greenberg, {{a writer for the}} source pen-and-paper RPG.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Neural {{networks}} can be {{evolved to}} control robot manipulators in tasks like target tracking and obstacle avoidance in complex environments. Neurocontrollers are robust to noise {{and can be}} adapted to different environments and robot configurations. In this paper, neurocontrollers were evolved to position the end effector of a robot arm close to a target in three different environments: environments without obstacles, <b>environments</b> <b>with</b> stationary obstacles, and <b>environments</b> <b>with</b> moving obstacles. The evolved neurocontrollers perform qualitatively like inverse kinematic controllers in <b>environments</b> <b>with</b> no obstacles and like path-planning controllers based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees in <b>environments</b> <b>with</b> obstacles. Unlike inverse kinematic controllers and path planners, the approach reliably generalizes to <b>environments</b> <b>with</b> moving obstacles, making it possible to use it in natural environments...|$|R

5|$|All of {{the fossil}} sites that have yielded Velociraptor remains {{preserve}} an arid <b>environment</b> <b>with</b> fields of sand dunes and only intermittent streams, although the younger Barun Goyot environment {{seems to have}} been slightly wetter than the older Djadochta. The posture of some complete fossils, as well as the mode of preservation most show within structureless sandstone deposits, may show that a number of specimens were buried alive during sandstorm events common to the three environments.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus was {{the most}} common large {{theropod}} in the vast tract of Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid <b>environment</b> <b>with</b> distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the <b>environment,</b> <b>with</b> Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E

5|$|During Copeland's training, {{he trained}} one weekday and all weekend. The school's {{practice}} ring was a 12-by-14-foot boxing ring with a harder mat {{than that of}} a typical wrestling ring. The ceiling above it was low, with exposed pipes, preventing top-rope moves from being performed. Copeland later credited this <b>environment</b> <b>with</b> forcing him to drill and improve his technical mat-based wrestling. His classmates included Johnny Swinger, Joe E. Legend, and Rob Etcheverria (who later became notable for training wrestlers such as Gail Kim, Angelina Love, and Taylor Wilde).|$|E
5|$|Giganotosaurus was {{probably}} the apex predator in its ecosystem. It shared its <b>environment</b> <b>with</b> herbivorous dinosaurs such as the titanosaurian sauropod Andesaurus, and the rebbachisaurid sauropods Limaysaurus and Nopcsaspondylus. Other theropods include the abelisaurid Ekrixinatosaurus, the dromaeosaurid Buitreraptor, and the alvarezsaurid Alnashetri. Other reptiles include the crocodyliform Araripesuchus, sphenodontians, snakes, and the turtle Prochelidella. Other vertebrates include cladotherian mammals, a pipoid frog, and ceratodontiform fishes. Footprints indicate the presence of large ornithopods and pterosaurs as well.|$|E

After NeXT exited the hardware business, Canon produced a line of PCs, called object.station, including models 31, 41, 50 and 52, specifically designed to run NeXTSTEP/Intel. Canon also served as NeXT's distributor in Japan.|$|E
5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale.

Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source oil shale.|$|E

5|$|The depositional {{environment}} was a nearshore {{one where the}} seashore alternated between advance (transgression) and retreat (regression). At Zion, the limestones and fossils of the Timpoweap, Virgin Limestone, and Shnabkaib members of the Moenkopi Formation document transgressive episodes. Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and interbedded mudstone resulting from deposition in a restricted marine <b>environment</b> <b>with</b> complex watertable fluctuations. Regressive, red bed layers separate the transgressive strata. Ripple marks, mud cracks, and thinly laminated bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.|$|E
