This anisotropy is {{developed by a}} thermo-mechanical control process (TMCP) in a <b>heavy</b> <b>plate</b> <b>mill</b> and a cold forming process in a pipe mill. In this study, experimental work was carried out using both as received and pre-strained (up to 6 % along the T direction) steel plates for X 100 -grade pipes, in order to analyze anisotropic toughness.

The results show that solidification time in forced air cooling and water cooling shortened than that in air cooling respectively by 0. 9 hours and 2. 2 hours; The primary fine-grain area is large in the forced air cooling and water cooling. In forced air cooling, we can obtain the largest equiaxial crystal ratio and the minimum columnar crystal ratio; The shrinkage cavity position of the ingot in forced air cooling and water cooling is closer to riser {{than it is in}} air cooling, but the volumes of shrinkage cavities respectively increased {{to a greater extent than}} in air cooling...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain a {{predictive}} model able to perform an early detection of central segregation severity in continuous cast steel slabs. Segregation in steel cast products is an internal defect that can be very harmful when slabs are rolled in <b>heavy</b> <b>plate</b> <b>mills.</b> In this research work, the central segregation was studied with success using the data mining methodology based on multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) technique. For this purpose, the most important physical-chemical parameters are considered. The results of the present study are two-fold. In the first place, the significance of each physical-chemical variable on the segregation is presented through the model. Second, a model for forecasting segregation is obtained. Regression with optimal hyperparameters was performed and coefficients of determination equal to 0. 93 for continuity factor estimation and 0. 95 for average width were obtained when the MARS technique was applied to the experimental dataset, respectively. The agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latter...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{air raids}} {{of the allied}} forces in July 1944, the entire {{facilities}} were severely damaged. By {{the end of the}} war, production had basically stopped. In July 1945, the [...] "Alpine Montan AG Hermann Göring" [...] plant was renamed to [...] "Vereinigte Österreichische Eisen- und Stahlwerke" [...] (VÖEST) (United Iron and Steel Plants). For the plant’s reconstruction, some divisions were combined into the so-called “New Building Division”, designed to reconstruct the metallurgical plant in Linz. Thus, the most important metallurgical facilities could all be started up again by the year 1949: the coking plant, blast furnaces, SM-steel making plants (plant with Siemens-Martin-furnace, named after inventors) and <b>heavy</b> <b>plate</b> <b>mills</b> (<b>mills</b> producing <b>plates</b> of over 3 mm thickness). Many of the products were scarce commodities after the war. For this reason, the metallurgical plant was able to recover pretty soon, investing largely into the expansion of its own facilities. Due to the shortage of steel scrap, necessary for the operation of SM blast furnaces, the yearly steel mill capacities of 220,000 tons soon proved to be insufficient. The solution was a new manufacturing process: the LD-process (Linz-Donawitz-process, also called oxygen steelmaking) manufactured in house and commissioned in 1952 in Linz, and 1953 in Donawitz. The huge advantages of this process were cost-saving on the one hand (investment costs were only 65% and operation costs only 55% compared to the SM blast furnace), and larger production capacities on the other.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{surface of}} work rolls and back up rolls is worn out during hot rolling of heavy plates and strip steel because of micro {{structural}} changes and induced crack propagation. After {{the operation of}} the rolls in the mills, the surface will be regenerated by the following grinding process in the roll shops. This provides sufficient surface conditions for the next set in service. The roll shops of ThyssenKrupp Stahl will be gradually equipped with modern eddy current and ultrasonic techniques. The procedure for the implementation of these NDE techniques into the roll shop of a <b>heavy</b> <b>plate</b> <b>mill</b> will be described exemplarily. In the first step after bringing the installations into operational use, the former practice skills should be considered within the calibration of the systems. For this, the workmanship is documented by a statistical analysis of the signals obtained by these two non-destructive testing devices. Accordingly, the sensitivity of the operating systems is determined by comparing signals obtained from artificial notches with signals obtained from roll damages. These results are confirmed by taking micrographic examinations of the roll surface. After accurate confirmation {{of the relationship between the}} obtained signals and the condition of the rolls, the systems are fully set in service and integrated into {{the operation of the}} roll shop. This methodical approach contributes to a considerable benefit during the operation of the rolls since their service life is prolonged significantly. 1...|$|E

These types of inspection procedures continuously were further developed {{in the last two}} decades so that today the forth generation of system hard and software is in industrial use. The application is in steel industry where steel sheets in hot-dip-galvanizing lines were annealed after cold rolling but also in <b>heavy</b> <b>plate</b> rolling <b>mills</b> where after thermo-mechanical rolling special textures and texture gradients can occur. An increasing number of applications are also to find in the machinery building industry and here especially in case of machinery parts of the car supplying industry. The contribution introduces in the methodology of the micromagnetic, multiparameter, microstructure and stress analysis (3 MA), which, however, only can be applied at ferromagnetic materials and describes the physical basics of the techniques. The applied technology is especially sensitive for mechanical property determination as the relevant microstructure is governing the material behavior under mechanical loads (strength and toughness) in a similar way as the magnetic behavior under magnetic loads, i. e. during the magnetization in a hysteresis loop. In different case studies the advantage to implement 3 MA into the industrial processes is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to develop and apply {{mathematical}} models for determining the velocity and temperature profiles of <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> processed by accelerated cooling at Usiminas’ <b>Plate</b> <b>Mill</b> in Ipatinga.

With the aid of this tool the thermal profile through the plate thickness for any steel grade and dimensions can be generated, which allows the tuning of online process control models. The simulation tool has been very useful for the development of new steel grades, since the process variables can be related to the thermal profile, which affects the mechanical properties of the steels...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{manufacturing}} process of <b>heavy</b> steel <b>plates</b> generates some internal residual stresses. During machining {{process at the}} end users, shape defects may be created by these residual stresses. An industrial characterization method of residual stress state in <b>heavy</b> steel <b>plates</b> with a thickness of several hundreds of millimetres is described here. The measurement principle by acoustical birefringence and the used experimental equipment are presented. The first tests were performed on standard plates representative of the various possible residual stress states. The analysis of ultrasonic signals allowed {{the definition of the}} most suitable measurement configuration and the attainment of satisfactory accuracy. Assessments of the acoustical birefringence coefficient across plate width permits to estimate residual stress profile of these plates and to identify <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> where the geometric stability during the machining process will be insufficient. The method is then validated on the <b>heavy</b> industrial <b>plates</b> at different manufacturing steps. Introduction: The {{manufacturing process}} of <b>heavy</b> steel <b>plates</b> generates some internal residual stresses.
