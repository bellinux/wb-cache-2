5|$|Accordingly, {{building}} a new oil terminal in Europe capable of handling the largest vessels that were planned was judged appropriate. The intention was that oil coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> would be off-loaded at this terminal and then stored for trans-shipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 {{as a result of}} the Six-Day War reinforced the economic viability of this scheme. Oil shipments had to come round the Cape of Good Hope, thus avoiding the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Australia, {{all members of}} the 9th Division were given three weeks leave. The men were then assembled in their home state capital and took part in a welcome-home march; these marches were conducted both to acknowledge the division's service in the Middle East and advertise a war loan drive. Following the marches the division re-assembled at training camps on the Atherton Tableland in far North Queensland, where it was to complete its training for jungle warfare. The 9th Division next saw action against Japanese forces during the Salamaua–Lae campaign in New Guinea during September 1943; had the division not returned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> at least part of this task would have fallen to less-experienced militia units.|$|E
5|$|By early 1943 the Australian Army's focus {{had shifted}} to {{operations}} in the Pacific theatre against the Japanese, and the 9th Division received orders to return to Australia to join the other two 2nd AIF divisions, the 6th and 7th, which had departed earlier in 1942. A divisional parade was held in Gaza, after which the 2/15th embarked upon the transport Acquitania and sailed with a large convoy established under Operation Pamphlet {{as part of the}} final stage in the withdrawal of the 2nd AIF divisions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> After a journey of just over a month, the Acquitania berthed at Sydney in late February 1943.

5|$|English Salukis (chiefly {{descendants}} of Sarona Kelb) were exported to many countries, {{but by the}} mid-1930s, interest slackened, and with the outbreak of World War II, breeding and show activities almost entirely stopped. The number of litters was minimal – just {{enough to keep the}} breed alive. Food rationing reserved all edible meat for humans, and to prevent the Salukis from dying from starvation or being killed by bombs, some owners euthanized entire kennels. A small number of Saluki kennels survived the war, and along with fresh imports belonging to a second wave of soldiers returning <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> the slow process of re-establishing the breed began again.|$|E
5|$|Following Japan's {{entry into}} the war, the {{decision}} was made to transfer a large number of Australian troops <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> to the Pacific region. In early 1942, as the Japanese advanced through the Netherlands East Indies, the majority of the battalion was captured during the Battle of Java. A small number of the battalion's personnel returned to Australia and it was subsequently re-raised in mid-1942. It was later attached to the 6th Division as a corps unit and served in Papua New Guinea during the Aitape–Wewak campaign in 1944–1945. The battalion was disbanded in January 1946.|$|E

5|$|From Europe, {{the legend}} {{maintains}} that the returning crusaders brought the Saluki back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> The painting of Henry IV, Duke of Saxony with his hunting dog, painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder in 1514, is thought by some to show a Saluki. The dog wears a collar decorated with a scallop shell, which is the badge of a pilgrim who has traveled the Way of Saint James in Spain. Salukis appear in Paolo Veronese's 1573 work The Adoration of the Magi (also known as the Adoration of the Kings), currently located at the National Gallery, London. Veronese painted the breed in another two of his religious paintings: The Marriage at Cana and The Finding of Moses.|$|E
5|$|Herring was {{promoted}} to the temporary rank of major general on 14August1941 {{when he took over}} command of the 6th Division. He returned to Australia with it in March 1942. Unaware that the government had already decided that General Sir Thomas Blamey should be appointed Commander in Chief, Herring, along with Major General George Alan Vasey and Brigadier Clive Steele, approached Army Minister Frank Forde with a proposal that all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Major General Horace Robertson appointed Commander in Chief. The 'revolt of the generals' collapsed with the announcement that General Blamey was returning <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> to become Commander in Chief, but seems to have done the participants no harm.|$|E
