500|$|Much of {{the early}} {{criticism}} of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names. [...] Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold [...] compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems. [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "The traveler may shed tears as he drives the Lincoln Highway or dream dreams as he speeds over the Jefferson Highway, but <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>he</b> get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?" [...] (A popular song later promised, [...] "Get your kicks on Route 66!")

Stevens nourished himself on the Senate floor with raw eggs and terrapin, port and brandy. He spoke only twice before making a closing argument for the House managers on April 27. [...] As he spoke, his voice weakened, and finally he allowed Butler to read {{the second half of}} his speech for him. Stevens focused on ArticleXI, taking the position that Johnson could be removed for political crimes; he need not have committed an offense against the law. The President, having sworn to faithfully execute the laws, had intentionally disobeyed the Tenure of Office Act after the Senate had refused to uphold his removal of Stanton, [...] "and now this offspring of assassination turns upon the Senate who have... rebuked him in a constitutional manner and bids them defiance. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>he</b> escape the just vengeance of the law?" ...|$|E

500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the June 1796 Critical Review argued, [...] "When {{the character of the}} Maid of Orleans, and the part taken by her against the English, are considered, together with {{the manner in which the}} history has been treated by other writers, some suspicion may at first arise, that Mr. Southey has chosen a subject scarcely suited to the dignity of epic poetry. His prudence at least may be called into question. <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>he</b> expect to interest the English nation in the fortunes of a heroine who was an active champion against his own countrymen, or be hardly enough to felicitate those successes that involved the English in disgrace?" [...] In regard to the effort put into writing the poem, the review concluded: [...] "The poetical powers of Mr. Southey are indisputable very superior, and capable, we doubt not, of producing a poem that will place him in the first class of English poets. He is at present, he tells his readers, engaged in the execution of Madoc [...] We cannot, therefore, help expressing our wish, that he would not put his future poem to so hazardous an experiment as he has this, by assigning himself so little time for its completion." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Gus {{installing}} a surveillance camera into the meth lab {{stemmed from the}} idea of Walter and Gus employing what Gilligan called [...] "brinkmanship and gamesmanship" [...] against each other after their falling {{out at the end of}} the third season. Gilligan commented: [...] "What's one way Gus can amp up the story there? <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>he</b> mess with Walt's head a little bit?" [...] The footage shown from the first-person perspective of the camera is actual footage from the real camera, including the numbers shown at the top and bottom of the screen. This is why that shot is shown in pillarbox and in lower quality than the rest of the episode, which was shot in 35 mm film. The episode features a subplot with Marie engaging in acts of kleptomania, which had been a major part of her character during the first season. Catlin said it was conceived early on that Marie would act this way while brainstorming the ideas for Marie coping with Hank's difficult recovery. Gilligan described Marie's acts of stealing as a respite for her: [...] "She's looking for another life, but she's not actively ready to leave her husband or anything like that. ... We liked the quirkiness of it." [...] Betsy Brandt said [...] "Open House" [...] was her favorite episode of the season to shoot.|$|E

Why don't you surrender now?" [...] Pang De retorted angrily, [...] "Mean fellow, what is surrender? The King of Wei has thousands of troops and his might trembles the Empire.

[...] Most of the difficulties, according to Link, arise in addressing the second problem, [...] "where the impossibility of perfect answers spawns endless debate."

[...] At the literalist extreme, efforts are made to dissect every conceivable detail about {{the language of the}} original Chinese poem.

2500|$|Liao Hua was {{critical}} of the Shu general Jiang Wei, who continued Zhuge Liang's aggressive foreign policy against Shu's rival state, Cao Wei, by launching a series of eleven campaigns to attack Cao Wei between 240 and 262.

[...] It was said that Cui recognized Lu's talent and made the remark, [...] "Lu Ten [...] will one day be in that particular office [...]" [...] It was said that thereafter, Lu was recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as an imperial censor with the title Jiancha Yushi (監察御史), and thereafter would remain at the capital. [...] Early in the Xiantong era (860-874) of Emperor Xuānzong's son Emperor Yizong, Lu served as Tuntian Yuanwailang (屯田員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of public works (工部, Gongbu), and later an imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi), then a highly prestigious position.

2500|$|Elizabeth I, {{as part of}} the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, gave {{royal assent}} to the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion, which sought to {{distinguish}} Anglican from Roman Church doctrine. The Articles declared that [...] "Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions." [...] The Elizabethan Settlement accepted the Real Presence of Christ in the Sacrament, but refused to define it, preferring to leave it a mystery. Indeed, for many years it was illegal in Britain to hold public office whilst believing in transubstantiation, as under the Test Act of 1673. Archbishop John Tillotson decried the [...] "real barbarousness of this Sacrament and Rite of our Religion", considering it a great impiety to believe that people who attend Holy Communion [...] "verily eat and drink the natural flesh and blood of Christ. And what can any man do more unworthily towards a Friend? [...] <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>he</b> possibly use him more barbarously, than to feast upon his living flesh and blood?" [...] (Discourse against Transubstantiation, London 1684, 35). In the Church of England today, clergy are required to assent that the 39 Articles have borne witness to the Christian faith.|$|E

[...] Coleman refused and {{compiled}} a 3–0 record and a 0.00 ERA in his first eight appearances of the 1978 season. [...] Coleman had a 1.37 ERA when he was sold by Oakland to the Toronto Blue Jays for the waiver price of $10,000. [...] Finley reportedly [...] "blew his top" [...] after Coleman gave up a home run to Chicago's Lamar Johnson. Bobby Winkles resigned as Oakland's manager after Finley's impulsive decision to sell the club's most effective relief pitcher. [...] Days later, Finley offered to buy Coleman back from Toronto for double the price Toronto had paid. Blue Jays' president, Peter Bavasi, declined Finley's proposal, suspecting that Finley had found another team prepared to pay more for Coleman. [...] Coleman noted {{at the time that he}} was happy to escape Finley. [...] After his bid to reacquire Coleman was rejected, Finley claimed he had only wanted to reacquire Coleman to trade him to Pittsburgh and lashed out at Coleman: [...] "He's a very fine old man, but all he does is throw that slop up there.

He {{was one of the}} Wu scholars who debated with Zhuge Liang over Sun Quan's decision to ally with Liu Bei against Cao Cao before the Battle of Red Cliffs. Lu Ji argued, [...] "Even though Cao Cao controls the Emperor and holds sway over the lords, he is still a descendant of the chancellor Cao Shen. Liu Bei may be a descendant of Prince Jing of Zhongshan, but there is no proof for this. As far as we see, he {{is no more than a}} straw mat weaver and shoe seller. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>he</b> compete with Cao Cao?" [...] Zhuge Liang replied, [...] "Aren't you the 'Young Man Lu' who hid oranges in his sleeve at Yuan Shu's house? Please sit down and listen to me. Since Cao Cao is a descendant of Chancellor Cao, he is therefore a subject of the Han Empire. However, he monopolises state power and bullies the Emperor. This is a disgrace to his ancestor. He is not only a villain of the Han Empire, but also a miscreant of the Cao family! Liu Bei is a member of the imperial clan. His Majesty the Emperor checked the family records and granted him a title. How can you say there is no proof? Emperor Gaozu started off as a minor patrol officer, but yet he became an Emperor eventually. What is disgraceful about weaving straw mats and selling shoes? Your opinions are those of a child.

2500|$|In the 1980s {{a fierce}} {{interchange}} {{took place between}} Gardner and Colin Wilson. [...] In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich Wilson wrote of this book(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, {{and in most cases}} one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards that make him so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>he</b> be so sure that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer once remarked wryly [...] "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence. In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in The New York Review of Books describing Wilson as [...] "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene". Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding [...] "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of CSICOP—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: [...] "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..." ...|$|E
