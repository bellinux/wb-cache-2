5|$|Philosophy of {{chemistry}} is the philosophical {{study of the}} methodology {{and content of the}} science {{of chemistry}}. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on <b>general</b> <b>philosophy</b> of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by quantum mechanics or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of how theories are confirmed in the context of confirming reaction mechanisms. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of. Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as chemical bonds.|$|E

25|$|In Human, All Too Human, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche {{suggested}} {{that those who}} refrain from lying may do so {{only because of the}} difficulty involved in maintaining the lie.

25|$|Though {{he had a}} vast {{influence}} on psychophysics, the actual disciples of his <b>general</b> <b>philosophy</b> were few. Ernst Mach was inspired by his work on psychophysics.

The two departments were reunified in 2000.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} the {{survival}} of Wiccan traditions and rituals from ancient sources is contested by most recent researchers, who suggest that Wicca is a 20th-century creation which combines elements of freemasonry and 19th-century occultism. However, historians such as Ronald Hutton have noted that Wicca not only predates the modern New Age movement but also differs markedly in its <b>general</b> <b>philosophy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Philosopher-mathematicians such as Spinoza have {{attempted}} to formulate philosophical arguments in an axiomatic manner, whereby mathematical proof standards {{could be applied to}} argumentation in <b>general</b> <b>philosophy.</b> Other mathematician-philosophers have tried to use standards of mathematical proof and reason, without empiricism, to arrive at statements outside of mathematics, but having the certainty of propositions deduced in a mathematical proof, such as Descartes' cogito argument.|$|E
25|$|While {{the period}} is {{generally}} {{known for its}} adoption of highly regulated and stylised literary forms, some of the concerns of writers of this period, with the emotions, folk and a self-conscious model of authorship, foreshadowed the preoccupations of the later Romantic era.

25|$|Until 1914, the American {{judicial}} system, {{including the}} Supreme Court of the United States, largely followed the precepts of English common law {{when it came}} to matters dealing with the validity of introducing evidence in criminal trials. In most cases, the <b>general</b> <b>philosophy</b> was that the process by which the evidence was obtained had little, if {{anything to do with the}} permissibility of its use in court. The only limiting factor was that the police agents could not break the law to seize the evidence; however, since what is now illegal seizure was then permitted by the courts, it rarely presented a significant challenge.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, the University of Sydney {{was at the}} centre of rows to {{introduce}} courses on Marxism and feminism at the major Australian universities. At one stage, newspaper reporters descended on the university to cover brawls, demonstrations, secret memos and a walk-out by David Armstrong, a respected philosopher who held the Challis Chair of Philosophy from 1959 to 1991, after students {{at one of his}} lectures openly demanded a course on feminism. The philosophy department split over the issue to become the Traditional and Modern Philosophy Department, headed by Armstrong and following a more traditional approach to philosophy, and the <b>General</b> <b>Philosophy</b> Department, which follows the French continental approach.|$|E

500|$|The {{basis of}} the {{organization}} came in 1841. The organization transmuted further from other war fighting groups like The General Society of the War of 1812, The Grand Army of the Republic and The Order of Indian Wars. All these had the same <b>general</b> <b>philosophy,</b> so had a common ground. By 1886, it was realized that these organizations would naturally become extinct due to deaths of the veterans if something wasn’t done to give them new life. The idea came about to restructure all these individual organizations into one permanent organization. These fighting group organizations founded the Army and Navy Union of the United States of America that was open to all who had served honorably or are serving in the United States Armed Forces.|$|E
