500|$|About 1454Z (now 0954 CDT {{due to the}} flight's {{crossing}} {{into the}} Central Time zone), a U.S. Air Force F-16 test pilot from the 40th Flight Test Squadron at Eglin AFB in western Florida, {{who happened to be}} in the air nearby, was directed by controllers to intercept N47BA. When the fighter was about [...] from the Learjet, at an altitude of about , the test pilot made two radio calls to N47BA but did not receive a response. The F-16 pilot made a visual inspection of the Lear, finding no visible damage to the airplane. Both engines were running, and the plane's red rotating anti-collision beacon was on (standard operation for aircraft in flight). The fighter pilot could not see inside the passenger section of the airplane because the windows seemed to be dark. Further, he stated that the entire right cockpit windshield was opaque, as if condensation or ice covered the inside. He also indicated that the left cockpit windshield was opaque, although several sections of the center of the windshield seemed to be only thinly covered by condensation or ice; a small rectangular section of the windshield was clear, with only a small section of the <b>glare</b> <b>shield</b> visible through this area. He did not see any flight control movement. At about 1512Z, the F-16 pilot concluded his inspection of N47BA and broke formation, proceeding to Scott AFB in southwestern Illinois.|$|E

50|$|Umbrellas with a {{reflective}} inside {{are used by}} photographers as a diffusion device when employing artificial lighting, and as a <b>glare</b> <b>shield</b> and shade, most often in portrait situations. Some umbrellas are shoot-through umbrellas, meaning the light goes through the umbrella and is diffused, rather than reflecting off {{the inside of the}} umbrella.|$|E

50|$|The 2,400-square-meter HIU {{building}} has three floors {{and a full}} cellar to accommodate 120 employees. The research building is divided into different types of usable space: The atrium is adjoined towards the inside by the chemistry and physics laboratories, and the offices are found on the outer sides. The ground floor accommodates additional special-purpose laboratories which are illuminated naturally either through roof light walls or upstream lighting panels. The architecturally characteristic façade of the building consists of punched-sheet elements whose differently sized punched holes create a pattern of optical interferences. The elements can be folded {{up in front of}} the office windows and can thus be used as sun protection and <b>glare</b> <b>shields.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The TARPS mission first {{exposed the}} Tomcat to the AAA and SAM threat {{on a routine}} basis and spurred {{upgrades}} {{not only to the}} cameras, but to the aircraft itself. The existing RHAW gear, the ALR-45/50 was vintage Vietnam era and could not keep up with the latest threats of the SA-5 and SA-6, both present in several threat countries in the Mediterranean. As such, TARPS Tomcats were provided with an Expanded Chaff Adapter (ECA) rail that provided 120 extra expendable rounds and another rail that mounted an ALQ-167 [...] "Bullwinkle" [...] jammer. Eventually, the F-14B arrived with the improved ALR-67 RHAW gear capable of keeping pace with the latest threats. Prior to that, some Tomcat squadrons used modified [...] "Fuzz-buster" [...] automotive police radar detectors mounted ad hoc on the pilot's <b>glare</b> <b>shield</b> to detect threats not handled by the ALR-45/50.|$|E
5000|$|Dodge vans, {{particularly}} Tradesman vans {{from the}} 1971-1977 model years, were very popular {{as the basis}} for many custom vans during the custom van craze that occurred during the mid- to late '70s and early 1980's. Dodge capitalized on this craze, creating a factory customization package called the [...] "Street Van" [...] package. This was advertised alongside the Lil' Red Express and Warlock trucks as [...] "Adult Toys". The Street Van package consisted of a [...] "Street Van" [...] logo on the passenger and driver's side door in lieu of the Tradesman logos, chrome trim on the grille and windshield, simulated wood grain inlays in the steering wheel horn cover and passenger side <b>glare</b> <b>shield,</b> five-slot chrome wheels or white spoked [...] "off-road" [...] type wheels, chrome front and rear bumpers, chrome trim on the gauges, smaller chrome side-view mirrors, patterns and plans to create custom interiors, and membership in the [...] "Dodge Van Clan". This package was available from the 1976 model year until it was discontinued in the early 1980s. This was not an overly popular option from the factory, and Street Vans are somewhat rare. The chrome metal Street Van emblems found on later Street Vans (emblems through mid-1978 were stickers) in good shape are quite valuable to collectors or restorers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>glare</b> <b>shield</b> {{is usually}} {{installed}} on the cement crash barrier to block strong light from the vehicles in contrary direction. It is useful to prevent car accidents and increase the safety of driving. This study uses the contradiction matrix in the TRIZ method, 39 engineering parameters, and 40 inventive and innovative principles to identify the areas of improvement to address the above problems. There are two features of our study. (1) We install a spring structure {{for the sake of}} reducing the damage rate of glare shields. When glare shields suffer from strong wind, a flexible structure located at base can let glare shields curve and spring back to original position, and therefore endures more powerful wind hit. In addition, the spring back function lets the guide post automatically return to original position to block strong light and protect drivers. This structure will have more durable service life, so, {{it can be used to}} reduce the maintenance times, and cost for the users. (2) We add solar LED light on the body of a <b>glare</b> <b>shield,</b> that can enhance the alert function when attacked by strong wind on the night time or insufficient light and then reduce the accident rate...|$|E
40|$|Crew {{comments}} {{indicate that}} Space Shuttle simulator seats place crewmembers {{in a position}} {{different from that of}} the actual Orbiter seats. The crew feel that they launch in a different position, and with a different reach and visibility, from that in which they had trained. This study examined three factors in differences between training and flight positions. Key dimensions, which were considered important to spatial orientation, were compared in the Orbiters and simulators. These were dimensions such as seat back to <b>glare</b> <b>shield</b> and seat pan to overhead. The differences between flight and training crew equipment, and how these differences may contribute to the problem were discussed with engineers and technicians responsible for the equipment. Eye position measurements were taken on subjects to assess any differences that could be attributed to different ingress methods in the Orbiters and the simulators. This report presents the data, analysis, and recommendations...|$|E
40|$|For {{roadside}} work-zones {{in areas}} that have opposing traffic flow, safety is enhanced if the temporary barriers incorporate a “glare-shield ” that blocks headlight glare from opposing traffic. Currently-available 32 -inch portable concrete barriers {{require the use of}} an add-on <b>glare</b> <b>shield</b> attached {{to the top of the}} barrier. The addon glare shields are an extra expense and complicate barrier set-up and handling. An alternative solution was to develop a 50 -inch high portable concrete barrier which is tall enough to serve as its own glare-shield. Finite element analysis was used to investigate various barrier shapes and connection schemes to identify a successful crashworthy design that would meet requirments of NCHRP Report 350 Test level 3. A 50 -inch portable concrete barrier design was developed based on the results of the finite element analyses and was crash tested at the Transportation Research Center in East Liberty, Ohio. The system successfully met all safety criteria of NCHRP Report 350 and has been approved by the Federal Highway Administration for use on the National Highway System as a test level 3 device...|$|E
