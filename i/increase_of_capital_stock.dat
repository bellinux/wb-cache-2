30|$|Why {{per capita}} utility under delayed {{retirement}} {{is lower than}} that of undelayed retirement scenario? With average life expectancy unchanged, delayed retirement means the extension of working time, consumption postponement and compulsory savings, and the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>stock,</b> so, it increases output. But under the assumption of an economic man, due to the utility of future consumption per unit is {{lower than that of}} present consumption per unit, so per capita utility will decrease according to objective function. That is, every worker under the condition of delayed retirement will have to work longer than before, become more patient with economic prospect and reduce more present consumption to increase savings, and provide more heritages to their children. Delayed retirement also means that the labor population have to work longer, receive much less pension, and carry on less present consumption and private consumption because discount factor is less than 1 and people give larger weight to present consumption and private consumption. Therefore, delayed retirement will decrease per capita utility for every adult.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this study}} we have {{analyzed}} {{the evolution of the}} EU- 15 labour productivity in the last years to identify the structural problems of the European economy. According to statistical data, the productivity per hour has decreased from 2 % in 1981 - 1995 to 1. 6 % in the 1995 - 2000 period and then to only 1. 3 % in 2000 - 2006. The main causes of the productivity slowdown refer to lower investment, which caused a smaller <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> the <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> and to smaller growth rate of total factor productivity. In the last thirteen years, labour productivity growth in Europe was below the level from United States, which leads to larger gap between the two economies. Key words: Hodrick-Prescott filter, potential growth, ICT capital, total factor productivity. The term “productivity ” describes labour productivity, measured by real GDP per worker or by GDP per hour worked. According to Cobb Douglass production function form, labour productivity growth is influenced by <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> accumulation, by <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> per employed person, and by total factor productivity (TFP).

Incoming migration fluxes are scattered across the national territory following patterns that appear mostly relational rather than economically driven. The resulting effect can be the well known problem of Spatial Mismatch, SM. The institutionalist approaches permits to use different scaled units of analysis, with different levels of integration but coexistent under the very same historical-social pattern-determining context. This work will try to explain the relationship between SM and the more general Transaction Costs.

30|$|The nexus between {{international}} migration and human capital remains a disputed topic. At the individual level, the positive effect remittances can have by relaxing liquidity constraints and thus enabling educational investments are often cited and widely acknowledged (see Antman 2013). However, at the aggregate level, the outflow of skilled migrants – {{what has been}} termed brain drain – has been characterized as detrimental to the sustainable growth of developing countries. Only recently has this perspective been challenged by various authors (e.g., Stark et al. 1997, Beine et al. 2001), who theoretically demonstrate that the option to migrate can increase human capital investments by individuals. Their argument is rooted in a neo-classical framework emphasizing that the incentive to invest {{is driven by the}} possible higher returns to education from going abroad. Since not all individuals who invest in education to migrate actually leave the country, a net <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> the human <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> in the sending countries takes place. This hypothesis has been supported empirically by recent macro studies (e.g., Beine et al. 2007), but only few studies have attempted to empirically test the human <b>capital</b> externalities <b>of</b> migration at the household level. Batista et al. (2012) are a notable exception, presenting evidence for the case of Cape Verde that cannot reject the brain gain hypothesis.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} classic {{macroeconomic}} inquiries is the effect <b>of</b> public <b>capital</b> investment on economic growth. While many analysts debate the magnitude, evidence has shown a statistically significant positive relationship between infrastructure investment and economic performance. U.S. Federal Reserve economist David Alan Aschauer asserted an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> the public <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> by 1% would result in an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> the total factor productivity by 0.4%. [...] Aschauer argues that {{the golden age of}} the 1950s and 1960s were partly due to the post-World War II substantial investment in core infrastructure (highways, mass transit, airports, water systems, electric/gas facilities). Conversely, the drop of U.S. productivity growth in the 1970s and 1980s was in response to the decrease <b>of</b> continual public <b>capital</b> investment and not the decline of technological innovation. Likewise, the European Union nations have declined public capital investment through the same years, also witnessing declining productivity growth rates. A similar situation emerges in developing nations. Analyzing OECD and non-OECD countries’ real-GDP growth rates from 1960 to 2000 with public capital as an explanatory variable (not using public investment rates), Arslanalp, Borhorst, Gupta, and Sze (2010) show that increases in the public <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> does correlate with increases in growth. However, this relationship depends on initial levels <b>of</b> public <b>capital</b> and income levels for the country. Thus, OECD countries witness a stronger positive link in the short term while non-OECD countries experience a stronger positive link in the long term. Hence, developing countries can benefit from non-concessional foreign borrowing to finance high-prospect public capital investments.|$|R

40|$|When {{studying}} the "economic growth" of a country, {{one must be}} careful to identify it with processes that occur in real economic life. It is neither adequate nor correct to define it merely {{in terms of the}} growth of a particular statistical indicator such as real GNP or national income. But when dealing with real growing economies, one actually has only two possible courses of action, namely, to study either the growth of aggregate value [...] however it is defined [...] or the growth of the aggregate use value. The latter option means {{studying the}} growth of the aggregate utility of all goods and services produced during the period concerned. I believe that aggregate value has little or {{nothing to do with any}} useful definition of economic growth, whereas aggregate use value is precisely what should be kept in mind in any such studies. Having adopted this definition of economic growth, however, the problem of measurement immediately arises. To measure the growth of aggregate utility adequately, it is necessary to measure both the growth in the quantity of goods and services produced and the improvements in their quality. My feeling is that the present state of the art in measuring the quality component of economic growth is such that almost nothing definite can be said about the actual rate of economic growth of a given country. Except one thing: it must be higher than the rate of growth of real GNP. Therefore, this paper does not set out to examine the measurement of economic growth per se. Rather, it is concerned with the measurement of one of the factors of economic growth, namely, capital input, which is at least more or less observable. Several estimates of the rate of growth of the productive capacity <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> have already been published, mainly by US economists such as Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, Dale Jorgenson of Harvard, and others. One very noticeable feature of the available estimates is that they reflect different facets of economic reality, and do not directly correspond to one another. Therefore, the first purpose of this paper is to arrange and systematize them somewhat. The second purpose is to provide a rough estimate of the growth rate of the productive capacity <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> for the US economy: this is chosen purely as an illustrative example. It is clear that the problem itself is of a general, universal nature. The need to assess the contribution <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> productivity to national economic growth exists in all countries, even though perceptions of its relative importance may differ from one country to another...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{estimate}} the series <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> at the regional level for Italy. Using the permanent inventory approach we obtain series for 20 regions and 17 sectors of economic activity covering the period 1970 - 1994. The first descriptive analysis presented in this paper confirms the dualistic structure of the Italian economy. Southern regions represent only 30 % <b>of</b> total <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> and their accumulation rate is declining.

Existing literature, however, shows a great variation on the estimation <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> in China in terms of methods and data sources. Improvements and one major adjustment in GDP accounting practices for Chinese provinces, which were made between 1986 - 88, 1988 - 97 and 1994 - 95, respectively, have made possible for more standardized and consistent construction <b>of</b> provincial <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> series using perpetual inventory method (PIM). This paper is the revised and extended version of original paper in 2004 which {{for the first time in}} the literature provides a systematic, detailed and standardized compilation <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> series for China’s provinces for post- 1952 period. This dataset, though suffering some drawbacks, can be easily updated up to more recent years using Chinese official statistics...|$|R
