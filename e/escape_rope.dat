25|$|The only {{successful}} hijacking of a SAA flight {{took place}} on 24 May 1972, when a Boeing 727-044 (ZS-SBE) was hijacked en route from Salisbury, Rhodesia (now known as Harare, Zimbabwe) to Johannesburg. Two Lebanese, Kamil and Yagi, {{took control of the}} aircraft by packing dynamite sticks on the hatracks. They were armed with a pistol. They forced the pilot, Captain Blake Flemington, to return to Salisbury, where they landed and re-fuelled with 12 hostages remaining on board. The captain tricked them into thinking that they were en route to the Seychelles, while he was in fact heading for Blantyre, Malawi. After landing, the passengers used nightfall to enter the cockpit, where they climbed down the emergency <b>escape</b> <b>rope.</b> By the time the hijackers realised this, the captain, one passenger, and a flight steward, Dirk Nel, remained on the aircraft. The two hijackers started fighting with each other for possession of the dynamite fuse. In the ensuing chaos, the three captives escaped, leaving the two hijackers on board. Malawi security forces started shooting and the two surrendered. They were jailed for two years on a charge of being in possession of an undeclared firearm on board an aircraft. After serving one year of their sentence, they were released.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{overwing}} exits in a ditching {{varies from}} airline to airline but are generally a secondary (not primary) means of escape. On aircraft fitted with overwing exits, there is typically a raised <b>escape</b> <b>rope</b> bracket (about {{a third of}} the way from the door) attached to the wing's upper surface and typically painted yellow. This is accompanied by an <b>escape</b> <b>rope</b> found in the frame of the exit after opening the hatch. Once this rope is attached to the <b>escape</b> <b>rope</b> bracket, it will aid passenger evacuation onto the wing to await rescue or to enter the water (depending on the airline's procedures). On aircraft with life rafts to be launched via the overwing exit, the wing will be used to provide a boarding platform onto the life raft. On certain regional aircraft, the overwing exits are the only escape route in the event of a ditching.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1994 King of Pancrase tournament, {{the rules}} were {{slightly}} different, in that the first round had one 10-minute round and three <b>rope</b> <b>escapes,</b> and the finals had one 20 minute round with three <b>rope</b> <b>escapes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Firemen, some of {{them still}} in their dress uniforms from the parade, made heroic rescues, but they were {{hampered}} by the crowds; the fire moved too fast for them to reach every window with ladders, and water pressure was inadequate. Almost 90 people died (estimates vary), with numerous bodies landing on the pavement; some people fell when <b>escape</b> <b>ropes</b> burned their hands, while some jumped in preference to being burned alive. The operator of the hotel, Warren F. Leland, was unable to identify his 20-year-old daughter, Helen, who had jumped from the 6th floor.|$|R
50|$|On October 31, the NTSB {{reported}} that the left main gear failed after landing and during rollout. The left engine and left wing scraped the runway and the aircraft veered {{to the left and}} came to a stop partially off the runway. Both flight crew members escaped through the right cockpit window using an <b>escape</b> <b>rope.</b> No injuries were reported. Cockpit voice and flight data recorders were taken to the NTSB lab in Washington for analysis. Following an examination of the runway, the NTSB returned control of the runway to the Fort Lauderdale Airport. The NTSB will release a preliminary report 30 days after the accident.|$|E
50|$|The apartments {{had been}} {{illegally}} subdivided using drywall partitions. Six firefighters {{on the fourth}} floor were trapped when the fire flashed through the door of the apartment, unable to find their way to the fire escape, and decided to jump from windows. Only two had an <b>escape</b> <b>rope,</b> which one of them had bought for himself. Two were killed in the fall: John G. Bellew and Lieutenant Curtis W. Meyran, who was in command of Ladder 27. The other four, Brendan Cawley, Jeff Cool, Joe DiBernardo, and Gene Stolowski, were severely injured and disabled and had to retire. DiBernardo died six years later; he had been promoted to lieutenant in May 2005 and Bellew received a posthumous promotion.|$|E
50|$|As Akaroas speed {{dropped below}} 140 knots the {{aeroplane}} landed very heavily, collapsing the landing gear; Akaroa shed wings, engines, tailplane and tail as she skidded off the runway {{and across the}} grass towards the control tower. Somehow, the two standing officers stayed standing, the fire extinguishers were turned on and everyone was evacuated through the cockpit windows, with one man burning {{his hand on the}} <b>escape</b> <b>rope.</b> TEAL salvaged what they could from the wreck and the remains were quickly pushed into a gully behind the NAC hangars before the public saw them. The crash took place {{in the early hours of}} the morning. The training procedure was quickly deleted from TEALs manuals. TEAL purchased from Qantas a replacement Electra, VH-ECC, after it changed its name to Air New Zealand on 1 April 1965, It took the registration, ZK-CLX. (At the time of the accident, ZK-TEC had its Air New Zealand titles painted on its fuselage in anticipation of the name change).|$|E

5000|$|The plot {{concerns}} corporate {{attorney and}} comic fan Gavin Lucas {{being caught in}} a laboratory explosion engineered by embittered scientist Hector Harris. Lucas develops the power to channel energy into powerful blasts, sense approaching people and detect energy flows nearby. He uses these abilities to become Surge, a superhero. Harris's former partner, Ronald Richards, develops a number of gadgets for Surge such as a bulletproof costume and gauntlets that have concealed blades for <b>escaping</b> <b>ropes</b> and spray strands to restrain criminals. Harris also develops superpowers from the explosion {{and is able to}} control metal objects via magnetism and takes the name Metal Master. Surge constantly encounters a nameless [...] "Young Man" [...] whom he repeatedly needs to save from danger and who is implied to be attracted to Surge.|$|R

50|$|Case number seven: The next {{customer}} doesn’t {{answer the}} desk buzzer. Joe {{goes to the}} door and sees that the next customer is himself, standing frozen, surrounded by blocks of ice. Joe finds a blue poker chip that the little girl left on the floor and he enters his own autobiographical dream. He is playing poker with his friends around a table being watched over by a classical bust of a bearded man (Morpheus?). As Joe reaches for a liquor glass, it explodes. In the spilt fluid on the table, he sees his own reflection. Joe’s skin suddenly turns blue, causing his friends to reject him (“would you want to sit at a table with a blue man?”). They leave Joe alone in the room where his furniture becomes alive and closes in on him. He finds a blue cord and follows it (“the blue thread of hope will lead me out of the labyrinth”). The cord leads outdoors where he is accosted by the public who block his progress (“the right of being in everybody’s way is the right of everybody.”) The people turn into ladders leading up in four directions. Joe chooses a ladder and starts to climb. He remembers the jubilance at the end of World War II and the prospect of peace and optimism. Streamers fall from the sky. Suddenly Joe realizes the rungs are disappearing from his ladder. He desperately grabs a window sill and pulls himself inside a room. Dangling colorful circles surround a woman reclining in a hammock. She offers Joe a drink, a bowl of cherries and a knife. He kisses the woman and makes a move to slice open her throat but instead cuts the blue cord he’s been following. The cord bleeds red. Joe exits the room and re-enters the poker room. The bearded bust bursts into flames. He again sees his friends around the poker table but now they’ve become flaming bird cages. He takes the bearded bust and attempts to escape out his window - hanging by a rope. The woman he abandoned uses the knife to cut his <b>escape</b> <b>rope.</b> Joe and the statue fall but become balls of colored ink in water that rains down upon the broken classical bust on the pavement below that appears to be staring upward into the colored patterns.|$|E
50|$|Schilt got {{a rematch}} against Masakatsu Funaki on March 18, 1998, but {{although}} {{he managed to}} take the bout to the judges, he lost by points due to spent <b>rope</b> <b>escapes.</b>|$|R

50|$|At Sziget'95 (now {{called the}} Sziget Festival), Merlini was {{strapped}} in a straitjacket, and {{was tied to}} a flaming rope by his feet. His aim was to <b>escape</b> from the <b>rope</b> and descend 20 meters to the platform below with a safety line.|$|R
50|$|On November, Shamrock fought Funaki in a rematch. This {{time the}} two fighters traded <b>rope</b> <b>escapes,</b> and Frank caught Funaki in a toehold {{which made him}} tap out. Shamrock, however, {{believes}} that Funaki took a dive and {{allowed himself to be}} defeated in order to build Frank's popularity.|$|R
60|$|Had the man's death {{been brought}} about by any other means, Ellenby would have counselled his coming forward and facing his trial, as he himself was anxious to do; but, viewed in {{conjunction}} with the relief the man's death must have been to both of them, that loaded revolver was too suggestive of premeditation. The isolation of the house, that conveniently near pond, would look as if thought of beforehand. Even if pleading extreme provocation, Michael <b>escaped</b> the <b>rope,</b> a long term of penal servitude would be inevitable.|$|R

50|$|In The Two Towers, Frodo and Sam {{struggled}} through the eastern Emyn Muil {{en route to}} the Black Gate of Mordor. Tolkien writes that he padded Frodo and Sam's difficult crossing with enough days to synchronize their movements with those of Aragorn and Gandalf. Frodo and Sam eventually <b>escaped</b> using a <b>rope</b> to descend a cliff to the Dead Marshes.|$|R
50|$|Góes had his MMA debut for Japanese Pancrase promotion, {{taking on}} Frank Shamrock in 1995. Allan scored the first takedown, which Frank {{followed}} {{with one of}} his own, but the Brazilian threatened him twice with Kimura attempts from the bottom and also threw ground and pound after taking from top position. The shoot wrestler answered sweeping him and clamping an ankle lock, but Góes reversed into a rear naked choke. It marked a controversial instance, as Góes refused to release the hold when Frank utilized a <b>rope</b> <b>escape</b> as by Pancrase's rules, and he gained a yellow card from the referee; moreover, according to Shamrock, Góes eye-gouged him without the referee noticing in order to secure the choke. As the match continued, Shamrock continued utilizing ankle locks and heel hooks, badly dislocating Góes's ankle and making him spend his own <b>rope</b> <b>escape.</b> The Brazilian ended the match taking Frank's back, but the bout was ruled a draw by points.|$|R
5000|$|Baker's {{cover for}} Phantom Lady #17 (Apr, 1948) was {{reproduced}} in Seduction of the Innocent, the 1954 book by Dr. Fredric Wertham denouncing {{what he saw}} as the morally corrupting effect of comics on children. The cover, which illustrated Phantom Lady attempting to <b>escape</b> from <b>ropes,</b> was presented by Wertham with a caption that read, [...] "Sexual stimulation by combining 'headlights' with the sadist's dream of tying up a woman." [...] In the meantime, Fox went under and its assets were acquired by other publishers, and a Phantom Lady story from All-Top was then reprinted as a backup feature in Jungle Thrills by Star Publications, which then itself went out of business.|$|R

He appeared as a teacher in the CBBC reality TV show, The Sorcerers Apprentice, on 25 October 2009.|$|R
50|$|The {{next round}} saw Cosentino {{returned}} to escapology. The escape involved Cosentino escaping from a straight jacket while suspended from his ankles, six metres above the ground, inside a jaws-like apparatus. These jaws were held open {{by a single}} piece of rope that was to be set alight for the act. Cosentino had to <b>escape</b> before the <b>rope</b> burned through and the jaws snapped around his ankle with over 200 kg of force.|$|R
5000|$|Alan {{achieved}} fame {{through a}} series of stunts staged for the media. He made headline news in 1949 when a [...] "buried alive" [...] stunt, performed for Pathe News, nearly went wrong. He is credited with devising the burning-rope straitjacket escape, in which he is suspended upside-down from a crane with a length of thick rope doused with petrol; once ignited there is a short time to <b>escape</b> before the <b>rope</b> burns through.|$|R
50|$|As {{the race}} progresses, despite a very late start, Mabel, with a {{co-driver}} beside her, manages {{to gain a}} lead of three laps. Charlie with his henchmen, tries to sabotage the race by using oil and bombs on the track. The oil temporarily spins Mabel's car, no.4, around and it goes backwards for a lap until the oil spins it around again to continue the right way. The car tips over on a bend but {{a group of men}} push the heavy Bentley V8 upright again. Meanwhile the rival <b>escapes</b> his <b>ropes</b> and sees Mabel driving his car. The crowd stand as she crosses the finishing line. The rival and his friend go to congratulate her. Meanwhile Charlie throws a bomb in the air and blows up both himself and his two thugs.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{the image}} of the classic magician, Houdini was short and stocky and {{typically}} appeared on stage in a long frock coat and tie. Most biographers give his height as , but descriptions vary. Houdini was also said to be slightly bow-legged, which aided in his ability to gain slack during his <b>rope</b> <b>escapes.</b> In the 1997 biography Houdini!!!: The Career of Ehrich Weiss, author Kenneth Silverman summarizes how reporters described Houdini's appearance during his early career: ...|$|R
50|$|The video {{opens with}} Jay <b>escaping</b> from a <b>rope</b> that ties {{him to a}} chair. The scenes then show what happens to him earlier and who ties him up. Clad in a black suit, Jay is mesmerized by a sexy lady (played by Arielle Reitsma) he meets at a party.

6000|$|... "You are mistaken, Lieutenant Horton," [...] {{the admiral}} said. [...] "Captain Walsham {{is not your}} accuser. Nay, more, he has himself {{committed}} a grave dereliction of duty in trying to screen you, and by endeavouring to destroy the principal evidence against you. Mr. Middleton overheard a conversation between the Canadian pilot and the French general, and the former described how he had been liberated by an English officer, who assisted him to <b>escape</b> by a <b>rope</b> from the porthole in his cabin." ...|$|R
50|$|Within {{three months}} of landing he was arrested, {{and sent to the}} Gatehouse, Westminster. After about eight months' imprisonment, he tried to <b>escape</b> by a <b>rope</b> let down from the window in his cell, but was {{captured}} on reaching the ground. This was at midnight 14-15 June 1616. For seventy hours he was placed in the stocks in a dungeon at the Gatehouse, and was then on Monday night (17 June) removed to Newgate Jail, where he was amongst criminals.|$|R

50|$|The same year, Frank {{would also}} fight a {{controversial}} bout with Carlson Gracie BJJ black belt Allan Goes. The Brazilian illegally eye-gouged Shamrock while {{on his back}} without the referee noticing, and also refused to release a rear naked choke despite Shamrock using a <b>rope</b> <b>escape,</b> an action which finally gained him a yellow card. On the other hand, Frank retaliated by breaking his leg with a heel hook. Both fighters ended the match with a point lost, and it was ruled a draw despite Goes's penalization.|$|R
50|$|With Lippi's {{return to}} Florence in 1432, his {{paintings}} had become popular, warranting {{the support of}} the Medici family, who commissioned The Annunciation and the Seven Saints. Cosimo de' Medici had to lock him up in order to compel him to work, and even then the painter <b>escaped</b> by a <b>rope</b> made of his sheets. His escapades threw him into financial difficulties from which he did not hesitate to extricate himself by forgery. His life included many similar tales of lawsuits, complaints, broken promises and scandal.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, {{after taking}} revenge on Jason DeLucia by {{defeating}} him via submission, Funaki was pitted against Frank Shamrock, Ken's adoptive brother and next rising {{star of the}} company. Funaki again showed his new found affinity for working from the bottom, fending Frank off from his guard and catching him in a triangle choke/kimura combination for a <b>rope</b> <b>escape,</b> before finishing him with a toehold. Funaki's next match would be an upset loss to former Shooto fighter Manabu Yamada, in which Yamada flipped over a mount and caught Funaki in a heel hook for the finish. Funaki bounced back against Pancrase rookie Guy Mezger in a back and forth match, which saw Mezger dominating the action with kicks, strikes and pressure until Funaki clamped an achilles lock to get the win. Funaki's last high level bout in 1995 would be a rematch with Frank Shamrock. Funaki mocked Frank, keeping his hands low and even throwing a flying spinning heel kick in an instance, but he {{was caught in a}} choke and forced to spend a <b>rope</b> <b>escape</b> before returning the favor with a triangle armbar. Funaki got the advantage in points with a rolling toehold, but he then was shockingly forced to tap out in a leglock exchange, losing the match.|$|R
25|$|On 26 October 1996, Hasdell fought Cees Bezems in a no holds barred {{match at}} IMA - Battle of Styles held in Amsterdam, Holland. Hasdell lost by Technical {{knockout}} {{due to a}} cut. On 2 February 1997, Hasdell returned to RINGS Holland where he fought Dutch fighter, Hans Nijman. This bout ended up having a controversial finish. In the second round Nijman had Hasdell in a guillotine choke, Hasdell grabbed the ropes for a <b>rope</b> <b>escape</b> although the referee did not see it, forcing Hasdell to tap out to break the hold.|$|R
