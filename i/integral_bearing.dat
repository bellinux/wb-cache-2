40|$|Extensive {{measurements}} {{were made to}} determine the stiffness and damping parameters of O-rings with circular cross-section. First approaches to a numerical determination of these parameters from typical material characteristics (shear modulus, loss angle, master curve) were developed and verified in part. The stiffness or damping coefficient of an O-ring depends on the amplitude or frequency of the exciting load. In contrast to metallic materials, the rubber material has an entropy-elastic behavior rather than an energy-elastic behavior. Measurements were made of the <b>integral</b> <b>bearing</b> stiffness and damping for sinusoidal loads. O-rings with circular cross-section were subjected to systematic test series, {{in order to determine}} the radial, tangential and <b>integral</b> <b>bearing</b> stiffnesses under quasi-static load. The radial stiffness behavior for the quasi-statically loaded O-ring was numerically predicted with high precision. For a description of the behavior under tangential load some preliminary considerations have been made, which however still need verifying. When these basic problems will have been clarified, the method is to be extended to the effet that dynamic effects are also included. The systematic investigation of rings with square or rectangular cross-sections eliminates the high variance of contact surface width which occurs when O-rings with circular cross-section are used. Nonlinear problems relating to the material are then freed of the contact problem which is nonlinear too. It appears to be advisable to initially place the emphasis of further work here, in order to solve the tangential problem. Also, for first more detailed investigations under dynamic loads, such a procedure simplifies the problem of giving a theoretical description. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract Background The {{identification}} of protein trafficking signals, and their interacting mechanisms, {{is a fundamental}} objective of modern biology. Unfortunately, the analysis of trafficking signals is complicated by their topography, hierarchical nature and regulation. Powerful strategies to test candidate motifs include their ability to direct simpler reporter proteins, {{to which they are}} fused, to the appropriate cellular compartment. However, present reporters are limited by their endogenous expression, paucity of cloning sites, and difficult detection in live cells. Results Consequently, we have engineered a mammalian expression vector encoding a novel trafficking reporter – pIN-G – consisting of a simple, type I <b>integral</b> protein <b>bearing</b> permissive intra/extracellular cloning sites, green fluorescent protein (GFP), cMyc and HA epitope tags. Fluorescence imaging, flow cytometry and biochemical assays of transfected HEK 293 cells, confirm the size, topology and surface expression of PIN-G. Moreover, a pIN-G fusion construct, containing a Trans-Golgi Network (TGN) targeting determinant, internalises rapidly from the cell surface and localises to the TGN. Additionally, another PIN-G fusion protein and its mutants reveal trafficking determinants in the cytoplasmic carboxy terminus of Kv 1. 4 voltage-gated potassium channels. Conclusion Together, these data indicate that pIN-G is a versatile, powerful, new reporter for analysing signals controlling membrane protein trafficking, surface expression and dynamics. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. CD 44 {{has been}} {{identified}} as a membranebinding partner for ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins, plasma membrane/actin filament cross-linkers. ERM proteins, however, are not necessarily colocalized with CD 44 in tissues, but with CD 43 and ICAM- 2 in some types of cells. We found that glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins with the cytoplasmic domain of CD 43 and ICAM- 2, as well as CD 44, bound to moesin in vitro. The regions responsible for the in vitro binding of CD 43 and CD 44 to moesin were narrowed down to their juxta-membrane 20 – 30 –amino acid sequences in the cytoplasmic domain. These sequences and the cytoplasmic domain of ICAM- 2 (28 amino acids) were all characterized by the positively charged amino acid clusters. When E-cadherin chimeric molecules bearing these positively charged amino acid clusters of CD 44, CD 43, or ICAM- 2 were expressed in mouse L fibroblasts, they were co-concentrated with ERM proteins at microvilli, whereas those lacking these clusters were diffusely distributed on the cell surface. The specific binding of ERM proteins to the juxta-membrane positively charged amino acid clusters of CD 44, CD 43, and ICAM- 2 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and site-directed mutagenesis. From these findings, we conclude that ERM proteins bind to <b>integral</b> membrane proteins <b>bearing</b> a positively charged amino acid cluster in their juxta-membrane cytoplasmic domain.

40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{model of}} an axial piston-type machine with a so-called wobble plate and Z-shaft mechanism is presented. The overall {{aim is to}} design and construct an oil-free piston expander demonstrator {{as a first step}} to realizing an advanced and compact small-scale steam engine system. The benefits of a small steam engine are negligible NOx emissions (due to continuous, low-temperature combustion), no gearbox needed, fuel flexibility (e. g., can run on biofuel and solar), high part-load efficiency, and low noise. Piston expanders, compared with turbines or clearance-sealed rotary displacement machines, have higher mechanical losses but lower leakage losses, much better part-load efficiency, and for many applications a more favourable (i. e., lower) speed. A piston expander is thus feasible for directly propelling small systems in the vehicular power range. An axial piston machine with minimized contact pressures and sliding velocities, and with properly selected construction materials for steam/water lubrication, should enable completely oil-free operation. An oil-free piston machine also has potential for other applications, for example, as a refrigerant (e. g., CO 2) expander in a low-temperature Rankine cycle or as a refrigerant compressor.   An analytical rigid-body kinematics and inverse dynamics model of the machine is presented. The kinematical analysis generates the resulting motion of the integral parts of the machine, fully parameterized. Inverse dynamics is applied when the system motion is completely known, and the method yields required external and internal forces and torques. The analytical model made use of the “Sophia” plug-in developed by Lesser for the simple derivation of rotational matrices relating different coordinate systems and for vector differentiation. Numerical solutions were computed in MATLAB. The results indicate a large load bearing in the conical contact surface between the mechanism’s wobble plate and engine block. The lateral force between piston and cylinder is small compared with that of a comparable machine with a conventional crank mechanism.   This study aims to predict contact loads and sliding velocities in the component interfaces. Such data are needed for bearing and component dimensioning and for selecting materials and coatings. Predicted contact loads together with contact geometries can also be used as input for tribological rig testing. Results from the model have been used to dimension the <b>integral</b> parts, <b>bearings</b> and materials of a physical demonstrator of the super-critical steam expander application as well as in component design and concept studies...|$|R
40|$|Precise {{machining}} of <b>bearing</b> rings is <b>integral</b> to finished <b>bearing</b> assembly quality. The output {{accuracy of}} center-based machining {{systems such as}} lathes or magnetic chuck grinders relates directly {{to the accuracy of}} part centering before machining. Traditional tooling and methods for centering on such machines are subject to wear, dimensional inaccuracy, setup time (hard tooling) and human error (manual centering). A flexible system for initial part centering is developed based on a single measurement system and actuator, whereby the part is placed by hand onto the machine table, rotated and measured to identify center of geometry offset from center of rotation, then moved by a series of controlled impacts or pushes to align the centers. The prototype centering system is developed as a demonstration platform for research in a number of mechanical engineering areas, particularly: Characterization of optimal state estimators through analysis of accuracy and computational efficiency; Distributed communication and control, efficient transfer of information in a real-time environment, and information sharing between processes; Modeling of sliding dynamics and the interaction of friction with compliant body dynamic models; Motion path planning through both deterministic geometric transforms and through frequency domain command manipulation. A vision is created for future work not only in the described areas, but also in the areas of advanced controller design incorporating multiple variables, derived machine diagnostic information, and application of the distributed communication architecture to information flow throughout the manufacturing organization. The guiding motivation for this research is reduction of manufacturing processing costs in the face of global competition.
