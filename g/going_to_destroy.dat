5|$|At Bound for Glory, Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) fought The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott Steiner) in a two out {{of three}} falls tables match. They were {{unsuccessful}} at defeating the Steiners as The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin; MCMG) interfered and helped the Steiners win the match. On the October 18 episode of Impact!, Team 3D attacked MCMG during their match in The 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament, injuring them in the plot, which led to a spot being vacant. Afterwards, they stated they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> the X Division, for which MCMG belonged. On the November 1 episode of Impact!, MCMG returned from injury and attacked Team 3D. Afterwards, Shelley challenged Team 3D to a fight at Genesis, which was later made official by TNA.|$|E

25|$|When I had {{a meeting}} with the Council a day before the concert, they were {{absolutely}} petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates. So, I will stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.|$|E

They’re guys that I’ve known for years, and great guitar players, but I’d like to put them in another environment, in a situation that they’ve never been in before. And I’d like to get some sax players—jazz players and other kinds. And I’ll definitely use Shankar Mahadevan, the amazing vocalist who appears on Remember Shakti’s Saturday Night in Bombay. I’ve been thinking about this underground thing for three years but I just haven’t had time to do it. I’m dying to get it out. It’s like giving birth." ...|$|E

There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E

500|$|Another {{featured}} {{match on}} the card [...] was a Six Man Tag Team Tables match pitting the teams of Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) against Jay Lethal and The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) (MCMG). On the October 18 episode of Impact!, Team 3D attacked MCMG and declared they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> the X Division to which they belonged. This was due to MCMG helping The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott Steiner) defeat Team 3D at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event on October 14. The two teams then fought at Genesis with MCMG winning the contest. Later in the event, Team 3D attacked and stole the TNA X Division Championship from then-champion Lethal. On the November 15 episode of Impact!, Devine, an X Division wrestler, turned on the division and joined Team 3D, helping to attack MCMG and Lethal. A Six Man Tag Team Tables match was later added to the Turning Point card.|$|E

However, John betrays Gray by leaving a tracking device on Jack {{in the shape of a}} ring, thus allowing Jack to be recovered by the Torchwood Institute and frozen in the morgue, escaping at the right moment to stop his brother. Having frozen Gray in cryopreservation, unwilling to witness any more death that day, Jack offers to help pinpoint another Rift event to allow John to leave, but John instead states his desire to travel Earth, commenting that he'd like to learn what Jack finds so fascinating about the planet.|$|E

2500|$|Hutchinson took Cotton's doctrines {{concerning}} the Holy Ghost far beyond his teachings, and she [...] "saw {{herself as a}} mystic participant in the transcendent power of the Almighty." [...] Her theology of direct personal revelation opposed {{the belief that the}} Bible was the final authority concerning divine revelation, which was basic to the Reformed doctrines held by the majority of English settlers at that time. She also adopted Cotton's minority view that works, behavior, and personal growth are not valid demonstrations of a person's salvation. [...] She went beyond this, however, and espoused some views that were more radical, devaluing the material world and suggesting that a person can become one with the Holy Spirit. [...] She also embraced the heterodox teaching of mortalism, the belief that the soul dies when the body dies, and she saw herself as a prophetess. [...] She had prophesied that God was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> England, and she prophesied during her trial that God would destroy Boston.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1939, when Ribbentrop {{announced}} at a secret {{meeting of the}} senior staff of the Foreign Office that Germany was ending talks with the Poles and was instead <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> Poland in an operation late that year, the news was greeted joyfully by those present. Anti-Polish feelings had long been rampant in the agency, and so {{in marked contrast to}} their cool attitude about attacking Czechoslovakia in 1938, diplomats such as Weizsäcker were highly enthusiastic about the prospect of war with Poland in 1939. Professional diplomats such as Weizsäcker who had never accepted the legitimacy of Poland, which they saw as an [...] "abomination" [...] created by the Versailles treaty, were whole-hearted in their support of a war to wipe Poland off the map. This degree of unity within the German government with both the diplomats and the military united in their support of Hitler's anti-Polish policy, which stood in contrast to their views the previous year about destroying Czechoslovakia, very much encouraged Hitler and Ribbentrop with their chosen course of action.|$|E

Their feud began at the pre-fight press conference. After most of the attention from the media was given to Shamrock, Severn got up {{and walked out of the}} door without explanation. Shamrock took Severn's action as a sign of disrespect. Severn later said that he walked out because he felt that it would be unfair to Shamrock for him to be present in the room while Shamrock was discussing his fight strategy to the media. Shamrock became even more furious when he found a newsletter back at the hotel that explained to readers how Severn was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> Shamrock. During the match, Shamrock forced Severn to tap out to a choke in 2:14 to win the UFC Superfight Championship.|$|E
