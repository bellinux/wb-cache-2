Al-Badr had sent radio messages and summonses by runner in all directions calling for reinforcement. He asked reserve forces training in the Jawf to arrive in trucks mounting 55- and 57-millimeter cannon and 81 millimeter mortars and heavy machine guns. They arrived within <b>forty-eight</b> <b>hours,</b> in time to face the attackers. They outflanked the Egyptian columns, still stuck in mud in the ravines. They later announced they had knocked out ten of the Egyptian tanks and about half of their armored cars, and claimed to have shot down an Ilyushin bomber. The royalists also carried out two supporting movements. One was a raid on Jihana, in which several staff officers were killed. The second was an attempt, involving British advisors and French and Belgian mercenaries from Katanga, to bombard San'a from a nearby mountain peak. Other diversionary operations included raids on Egyptian aircraft and tanks at the south airport of San'a and a mortar at the Egyptian and republican residence in a suburb of Taiz. Although the Egyptians managed to drive al-Badr out of his headquarters to a cave on Jabal Shedah, they could not close the Saudi border. They declared victory on the radio and on the press, but were obliged to agree to a ceasefire on the upcoming Erkwit conference on November 2.|$|E

25|$|The blue {{color of}} the blue-footed booby's webbed feet comes from {{carotenoid}} pigments obtained from its diet of fresh fish. Carotenoids act as antioxidants and stimulants for the blue-footed booby's immune function, suggesting that carotenoid-pigmentation is an indicator of an individual's immunological state. Blue feet also indicate the current health condition of a booby. Boobies that were experimentally food-deprived for <b>forty-eight</b> <b>hours</b> experienced a decrease in foot brightness due {{to a reduction in}} the amount of lipids and lipoproteins that are used to absorb and transport carotenoids.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Forty-eight</b> <b>hour</b> {{numerical}} forecasts {{during a}} period of 5 years are studied with emphasis on cases of false alarms and missed windstorms at 850 hPa. The overall performance of the forecast system is very good. Windstorms from the southwest are very well predicted, there are a few false alarms in southeasterly winds and northeasterly windstorms tend to be underestimated by the forecast model. The false alarms are in many cases associated with fronts, where a slight shift of a position of the weather system in time may give a large difference in the forecasted and observed winds. Yet, the true value of the forecast may be high. We attribute an underestimation in the wind speed in northeasterly windstorms to non-resolved orography, leading to an underestimation of the corner effect SW-Iceland, and possibly to winds that are generated by a pressure gradient at the western side of the Iceland wake...|$|R
40|$|Human {{peripheral}} blood lymphocytes, irradiated In vitro, die by an apoptotic process. The number of apoptotic cells after in vitro gamma-irradiation (0, 0. 1, 0. 2, 1, 2 and 5 Gy) {{was measured by}} flow cytometry using Annexin V and DiOC(6) (a cationic dye) after 24 and 48 h incubation. The mean dose-response curves for apoptosis of six healthy volunteers obtained with both methods were steep below 1 Gy and flatter at higher doses. A slightly higher number of apoptotic cells was observed with DiOC(6), compared to Annexin V. This can be assigned to a minor DiOC(6) -int/PI- population. <b>Forty-eight</b> <b>hour</b> cultures contained higher numbers of apoptotic cells compared with 24 h cultures.

A procedure was examined in which known amounts of contaminated milk carton stock were added to nutrient solutions and, after a defined growth period, the increase in cell number determined by means of a luciferin-luciferase assay for ATP. The results showed that the inherent dormancy periods and outgrowth rates of the Bacillus spores present in industrial board samples were too variable to provide a needed relationship between the initial bacterial count and the cell count after a period of growth.

This assay was used to investigate the influence of various factors on plasma vasopressin levels in a total of 121 awake male rats. Blood samples obtained in Wistar rats via an indwelling arterial catheter yielded results similar to those following decapitation, i. e., 1. 27 +/- 0. 26 vs. 1. 68 +/- 0. 39 pg/ml. <b>Forty-eight</b> <b>hour</b> dehydration markedly increased plasma AVP to 21. 8 +/- 2. 39 pg/ml.

Low and high sodium intake, angiotensin II infusion (10 and 30 ng/min), and converting enzyme inhibition by captopril (100 mg/kg) did not alter plasma AVP. During norepinephrine infusion (250 ng/min) plasma AVP rose to 5. 28 +/- 1. 29 pg/ml, whereas it tended to fall with isoproterenol infusion (10 ng/min).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR {{changes in}} denervated muscles have been {{reported}} to occur within days up to several weeks after peripheral nerve damage. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the longitudinal changes in denervated muscles by using MR imaging. METHODS: In 12 Lewis rats, the left sciatic nerve was transected {{at the level of the}} proximal thigh. MR imaging of both legs was performed before and 1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 28 days, and 2 months after the procedure. The MR protocol included T 1 -weighted spin-echo, T 2 -weighted double turbo spin-echo, and turbo inversion recovery magnitude (TIRM) sequences obtained in the axial plane. Signal intensities (T 2 -weighted double turbo spin-echo and TIRM sequences) and the T 2 TR (T 2 -weighted double turbo spin-echo sequence) were recorded for the soleus, peroneal, and gracilis muscles of both sides. Moreover, the circumferences of both lower legs were determined on the basis of T 1 -weighted images. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after denervation, a signal intensity increase in the denervated peroneal and soleus muscles was present on TIRM images. On T 2 -weighted images, only the peroneal muscle exhibited slightly increased signal intensities and T 2 TR. <b>Forty-eight</b> <b>hour...</b>|$|R
