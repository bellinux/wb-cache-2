5000|$|Pregnant and {{separated}} from Prestes, Benário {{clung to her}} alias, only to have her real identity disclosed by Brazilian diplomats, working hand-in-hand with the Gestapo. Her lawyers attempted to avoid extradition {{by means of a}} habeas corpus at the Brazilian Supreme Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal), based on her pregnancy, because extradition would have left a newborn Brazilian national in the power of a foreign government. As Brazilian law forbids the <b>extradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>nationals,</b> Olga's lawyers expected to win time until Olga gave birth on Brazilian soil to an ipso facto Brazilian citizen - irrespective of the child's paternity, which remained legally doubtful in the absence of evidence for Olga's and Prestes' marriage - something that would have rendered extradition quite unlikely. The plea, however, was speedily quashed, the rapporteur-justice alleging that habeas corpus was superseded by martial law and that Olga's deportation was justified as [...] "an alien noxious to public order". She was then, despite an international campaign, taken back to Germany in September 1936, the captain of the German liner that took her having cancelled scheduled stops in non-German European ports, therefore foiling communist attempts at rescuing her. On arrival, she was put in prison, where she gave birth to a daughter, Anita Leocádia. The child was subsequently released into the care of her grandmother, Leocádia Prestes.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of the EAW Framework Decision in 2002, 11 of the then 15 member states — namely Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal and Sweden — had domestic rules which prevented the <b>extradition</b> <b>of</b> their <b>nationals.</b> Although the Nordic EU members - Denmark, Finland and Sweden - did allow the <b>extradition</b> <b>of</b> their <b>nationals</b> {{to each other and to}} other Nordic countries, they refused the <b>extradition</b> <b>of</b> both their <b>nationals</b> and the <b>nationals</b> <b>of</b> other Nordic countries elsewhere. In addition seven of the 12 member states which joined between 2004 and 2007 - namely Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovenia - employed a similar prohibition prior to their accession.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} analyses {{the effect}} of Europeanisation on sovereignty in the post-Yugoslav states by examining {{the evolution of the}} different states’ policies related to <b>extradition</b> <b>of</b> their own <b>nationals.</b> <b>Extradition</b> is an important aspect of these countries’ political transformation, because {{the rule of law and}} regional co-operation are enshrined in the set of conditions these countries have to meet to enter the European Union (EU). The research thus looks at how the different post-Yugoslav states approach the <b>extradition</b> <b>of</b> their own <b>nationals,</b> and whether they have altered them in view of the requirements of the accession process. By doing so, this paper looks at the dynamics between the duty of the state to protect its citizens and the transformative power of Europeanisation in the Western Balkans...|$|R
50|$|In November 1997, the Colombian Congress {{amended the}} {{constitution}} to permit the <b>extradition</b> <b>of</b> Colombian <b>nationals,</b> albeit not retroactively. In late 1999, President Pastrana authorized the first extradition in almost 10 years of a Colombian trafficker to stand trial for U.S. crimes. Three such extraditions to the United States have taken place, the most recent in August 2000, with cases against others pending in Colombian courts. Under the Pastrana administration, Plan Colombia was developed and implemented with U.S. backing.|$|R
50|$|In {{matters such}} as <b>Extradition</b> <b>of</b> British <b>nationals,</b> courts must first consent and the Home Secretary must agree and sign an Extradition Order or the {{individual}} cannot be extradited. A recent {{example of this is}} computer-hacker and Aspergers syndrome sufferer Gary McKinnon being extradited to the United States. The courts decreed that he could be extradited and that it would not harm him. However the Home Secretary announced that she refused to sign the order as she believed it would harm his life rights and could lead to him committing suicide.|$|R

40|$|In most {{candidate}} countries, enlargement {{will contribute}} {{most likely to}} the constitutional modernization of the country. The EU accession will be a fundamental landmark in this respect. This will especially concern the implications of their membership for the national constitutional provisions concerning, among others, {{the principle of the}} transfer of the exercise of certain state powers to the EU deriving from national state sovereignty, supremacy, primacy, priority, direct applicability and direct effect of community law, specific provisions of the EU and EC Treaty regarding European citizenship, voting rights etc., as well as specific provisions in national constitutions which contradict the acquis communautaire, such as acquisition of land and realestate by non-residents, <b>extradition</b> <b>of</b> own <b>nationals</b> etc. This paper outlines some of the major problems of a new constitutional design in accession countries...|$|R
40|$|Extradition {{as an act}} of {{international}} cooperation for the repression of criminal activities of the criminal offenders is one of the various models whereby one sovereign state delivers up the alleged accused criminals found within its jurisdiction, on demand, to another sovereign state, so that they might be dealt with according to the penal laws. Extradition has evolved among states because they are vitally interested in the repression of crimes and punishment of criminals who violate their national laws and thus disturb the general peace of the society. This article aims to describe the problems with which extradition is faced, especially with the obligation to extradite and with the obligation {{to take care of her}} own citizens in situations when the Constitution does not allow <b>extradition</b> <b>of</b> own <b>nationals</b> and in the absence <b>of</b> an <b>extradition</b> treaty...|$|R
25|$|As {{these events}} were developing, the growing illegal drug trade and its {{consequences}} were also increasingly becoming a matter of widespread importance to all participants in the Colombian conflict. Guerrillas and newly wealthy drug lords had mutually uneven relations and thus numerous incidents occurred between them. Eventually the kidnapping of drug cartel family members by guerrillas {{led to the creation}} of the 1981 Muerte a Secuestradores (MAS) death squad ("Death to Kidnappers"). Pressure from the U.S. government and critical sectors of Colombian society was met with further violence, as the Medellín Cartel and its hitmen, bribed or murdered numerous public officials, politicians and others who stood in its way by supporting the implementation <b>of</b> <b>extradition</b> <b>of</b> Colombian <b>nationals</b> to the U.S. Victims of cartel violence included Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, assassinated in 1984, an event which made the Betancur administration begin to directly oppose the drug lords.|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{at the main}} {{problems}} regarding the current application <b>of</b> EU <b>extradition</b> procedures {{in relation to the}} area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It introduces the ‘Europeanisation’ <b>of</b> <b>extradition</b> procedures through a discussion based on the continuity of the principle of mutual recognition from the EC Treaties to the EU Constitutional Treaty. The latest manifestation of this continuity is the introduction of the European Arrest Warrant (adopted on June 13, 20002) that is aimed to simplify the extradition procedures for suspected criminals within the territory of the European Union by creating a positive list of criminal areas. The author discusses the innovations introduced by the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (abolition of the test of dual criminality) and then focuses on two main problem areas based on the reaction of certain Member States: i) Compatibility with Constitutional Guarantees: where the author notices a change of attitude in the national courts from being eager to contest the constitutionality of EU Arrest Warrant implementation law to being more pragmatic about authorising the <b>extradition</b> <b>of</b> their own <b>nationals</b> ii) Compatibility with Human Rights: where the author argues that the principle of mutual recognition is not adequate for adjudicating interstate criminal cases when it operates in isolation. He therefore proposes the enforcement of mutual trust or ‘full faith and credit’ accompanied by the standards of procedural rights set out in the ECHR and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights...|$|R
