5|$|Since 2003, {{the park}} is under the {{administrative}} authority of the 'Northern Pindus Management Body'. This authority {{is responsible for the}} ecological management of a much larger region that includes eight protected areas in Greece, also part of the Natura 2000, an initiative by the governments of the European Union that aims to protect the most seriously threatened habitats and species across Europe. The 'Northern Pindus Management Body', together with the local forest service, is responsible for regulating human activities and maintaining the ecological value of the protected area. However,until now this target remains elusive, {{because of a lack of}} expertise and of a science-based management plan. A <b>great</b> <b>need</b> therefore exists to conduct conservation-oriented research that can be translated directly into practical management proposals.|$|E

The <b>great</b> <b>need</b> of the coal-transportation market attracted aggressive competitors, and the laissez-faire environment of the day encouraged tactics that included paper railroads, buying and selling of corporations {{as though they were}} used cars, and financial manipulation by syndicates of investors.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between and among parents, teachers, and administrators of elementary, junior and senior high school students regarding their perceptions of the difference between the present and desired applications of computer technology. The areas of computer technology were computer assisted instruction, computer managed instruction, and computer literacy. ^ The needs assessment survey, Applications of Computer Technology, was developed for the study. Respondents indicated to what extent they felt the school currently applied a particular area of computer technology and to what extent it should be applied. Responses were analyzed for each computer technology area by level (elementary, junior and senior high school) and sub-group (parents, teachers, and administrators). ^ The sample population was selected, through a random sampling technique, from parents, teachers, and administrators associated with the Lincoln Public Schools, Lincoln, Nebraska. ^ The following conclusions were drawn based on the perceptions of parents, teachers, and administrators surveyed: (1) Parents, teachers, and administrators perceived a <b>need</b> for <b>greater</b> implementation in all areas of computer technology. (2) Parents perceived a <b>greater</b> <b>need</b> for further implementation of computer assisted instruction and computer literacy than did teachers and administrators. (3) Elementary school parents, teachers, and administrators perceived a <b>greater</b> <b>need</b> for further implementation of computer managed instruction than junior high school parents, teachers, and administrators. (4) Parents of junior high school students perceived a <b>greater</b> <b>need</b> for further implementation of computer assisted instruction than elementary school parents. (5) Elementary school teachers perceived a <b>greater</b> <b>need</b> for further implementation of computer managed instruction than junior and senior high school teachers. Elementary school teachers also perceived a <b>greater</b> <b>need</b> for the implementation of computer literacy than senior high school teachers. (6) Elementary school administrators perceived a <b>greater</b> <b>need</b> for further implementation of computer managed instruction than junior high school administrators. ...|$|R

25|$|Ross saw the <b>great</b> <b>need</b> for steel, {{and formed}} a {{syndicate}} to buy the Dominion Coal Company. Investing in further shares independently, Ross built up such a huge stake in Dominion Coal that {{he was invited to}} join the board of the Dominion Iron and Steel Company. However, his influence could not resolve a long contract dispute between the two for the supply of high-grade coal at a disadvantageous price, which resulted in a case review at the High Court of Justice in London, England. Although fault was found on both sides, the contract was found to be legal. Ross resigned from both boards, thus allowing a later merger between the two companies.|$|E
25|$|Deliveries of {{production}} P-63As began in October 1943. The USAAF concluded the Kingcobra was {{inferior to the}} Mustang, and declined to order larger quantities. American allies, particularly the Soviet Union, had a <b>great</b> <b>need</b> for fighter aircraft, however, and the Soviets were already the largest users of the Airacobra. Therefore, the Kingcobra was ordered into production to be delivered under Lend-Lease. In February 1944, the Soviet government sent a highly experienced test pilot, Andrey G. Kochetkov, and an aviation engineer, Fyodor P. Suprun, to the Bell factories {{to participate in the}} development of the first production variant, the P-63A. Initially ignored by Bell engineers, Kochetkov's expert testing of the machine's spin characteristics (which led to airframe buckling) eventually led to a significant Soviet role in the development. After flat spin recovery proved impossible, and upon Kochetkov's making a final recommendation that pilots should bail out upon entering such a spin, he received a commendation from the Irving Parachute Company. The Kingcobra’s maximum aft CG was moved forward to facilitate recovery from spins.|$|E
25|$|Not every Gregorian chant fits {{neatly into}} Guido's hexachords {{or into the}} system of eight modes. For example, there are chants — {{especially}} from German sources – whose neumes suggest a warbling of pitches between the notes E and F, outside the hexachord system, or in other words, employing a form of chromatism. Early Gregorian chant, like Ambrosian and Old Roman chant, whose melodies are most closely related to Gregorian, {{did not use the}} modal system. The <b>great</b> <b>need</b> for a system of organizing chants lies in the need to link antiphons with standard tones, as in for example, the psalmody at the Office. Using Psalm Tone i with an antiphon in Mode 1 makes for a smooth transition between the end of the antiphon and the intonation of the tone, and the ending of the tone can then be chosen to provide a smooth transition back to the antiphon. As the modal system gained acceptance, Gregorian chants were edited to conform to the modes, especially during 12th-century Cistercian reforms. Finals were altered, melodic ranges reduced, melismata trimmed, B-flats eliminated, and repeated words removed. Despite these attempts to impose modal consistency, some chants — notably Communions — defy simple modal assignment. For example, in four medieval manuscripts, the Communion Circuibo was transcribed using a different mode in each.|$|E
