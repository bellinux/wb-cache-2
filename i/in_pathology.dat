5|$|With an {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>pathology,</b> Stansfield {{spent the last}} few months of his time in Edinburgh working at the Royal Infirmary. In 1889, the London County Council (LCC) was established and took over the running of several London mental asylums; in the process, it advertised for a Fourth Assistant Medical Officer and Pathologist at Banstead Asylum, essentially a junior assistant with pathological duties which often related to postmortems. Stansfield successfully applied for the position. While at Banstead, he became interested in the pathology of mental illness and asylum administration. Accustomed to the laboratories at Edinburgh and drilled in rigorous note-taking skills, he set about instilling similar facilities and ethos at Banstead under the auspices of its superintendent, Dr T. Claye Shaw. Each ward would also have its own fixed notebook for medical officers, a practice which over time spread to all other asylums in the country. Thanks to this and his enjoying good relations with its steward, F. Alderton, Stansfield was made Banstead's Second Assistant Medical Officer in 1890 and, when Claybury Asylum opened in 1892–93, he was transferred there as First Assistant Medical Officer, helped by Claye Shaw's influence at the LCC. Over the course of the 1890s, he visited numerous domestic and foreign institutions, travelling to Germany and the United States.|$|E

50|$|There are {{currently}} three paths {{to qualify as}} a forensic pathologist in Australia. The first is to train solely <b>in</b> forensic <b>pathology</b> (although {{a significant amount of}} anatomical pathology knowledge is still required) and pass two examinations for forensic pathology only. The second is to commence training <b>in</b> anatomical <b>pathology,</b> and complete an initial anatomical pathology examination, which takes a minimum of three years; then go on to train solely <b>in</b> forensic <b>pathology</b> and complete a forensic pathology examination, which takes a minimum of two years. The third is to complete a minimum 5 years' training <b>in</b> anatomical <b>pathology</b> to qualify as a fellow <b>in</b> anatomical <b>pathology,</b> then complete a post-fellowship year <b>in</b> forensic <b>pathology</b> (a minimum twelve months further training plus successful completion of an examination).|$|R

25|$|His work <b>in</b> <b>pathology</b> {{was even}} more important. He filled the place <b>in</b> <b>pathology</b> left empty by Hunter's death in 1793; {{this was the time}} of {{transition}} from Hunter's teaching, which for all its greatness was hindered by want of the modern microscope, to the pathology and bacteriology of the present day. Paget's greatest achievement was that he made pathology dependent, in everything, {{on the use of the}} microscope, especially the pathology of tumours. He and Virchow may truly be called the founders of modern pathology; they stand together, Paget's Lectures on Surgical Pathology and Virchow's Cellulär-Pathologie.|$|E

There he continued his work on reflexes and reciprocal innervation. His papers on the subject were synthesized into the Croonian lecture of 1897.|$|E

25|$|Finding {{his youth}} limited his influence, and {{dissatisfied}} with urban life, Reed joined the U.S. Army Medical Corps. This allowed him both professional opportunities and modest financial security {{to establish and}} support a family. After Reed passed a grueling thirty-hour examination in 1875, the army medical corps enlisted him as an assistant surgeon. By this time, two of his brothers were working in Kansas, and Walter soon was assigned postings in the American West. Over the next sixteen years, the Army assigned the career officer to different outposts, where he was responsible not only for American military and their dependents, but also various aboriginal American tribes, at one point looking after several hundred Apaches, including Geronimo. Reed noticed the devastation epidemics could wreak and maintained his concerns about sanitary conditions. During {{one of his last}} tours, he completed advanced coursework <b>in</b> <b>pathology</b> and bacteriology in the Johns Hopkins University Hospital Pathology Laboratory.|$|E

He rose quickly through the ranks, and in 1893 was appointed Senior Assistant Medical Officer at the new Claybury Asylum. Five years later, he was transferred to Bexley Mental Hospital as superintendent, serving there until he retired in 1921.|$|E

40|$|Whilst {{studies have}} {{consistently}} identified early symptom reduction {{as an important}} predictor of treatment outcome, the impact of early change on common comorbid features has not been investigated. This study of CBT for eating disorders explored patterns of early change <b>in</b> eating <b>pathology</b> and longer-term change <b>in</b> personality <b>pathology,</b> anxiety and depression. It also explored the impact of early change <b>in</b> eating <b>pathology</b> on overall change <b>in</b> personality <b>pathology,</b> anxiety and depression. Participants were 179 adults diagnosed with eating disorders who were offered a course of CBT in an out-patient community eating disorders service in the UK. Patients completed a measure of eating disorder psychopathology {{at the start of}} treatment and following the 6 th session. They also completed measures of personality disorder cognitions, anxiety and depression at the start and end of treatment. There were significant changes <b>in</b> eating <b>pathology</b> over the first six sessions of treatment. Significant improvements were also seen <b>in</b> personality disorder <b>pathology,</b> anxiety and depression by the end of therapy. Effect sizes were medium to large for both completer and intention to treat analyses. Early changes <b>in</b> eating <b>pathology</b> were associated with later changes in common comorbid features, with early reduction in restraint being a key predictor. These findings demonstrate that early symptom change can be achieved in CBT for eating disorders when delivered in routine clinical practice. Such change has long-term benefits that go beyond the domain of eating <b>pathology,</b> enhancing change <b>in</b> personality <b>pathology,</b> anxiety and depression...|$|R
