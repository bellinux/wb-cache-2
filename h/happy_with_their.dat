Local author and former mayor, Keith Rawlings, suggests that Bournemouth has a thriving youth culture {{due to its}} large university population and many language school students. In recent years, Bournemouth has become a popular nightlife destination with UK visitors and many clubs, bars and restaurants are located within the town centre. In a 2007 survey by First Direct, Bournemouth {{was found to be}} the happiest place in the UK, with 82% of people questioned saying they were <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives.|$|E
5|$|Maier {{writes that}} the novel {{includes}} themes of love, with Hidjo's love for Woengoe, Betje, and Biroe paralleling that of Walter's love for Roos, Woengoe, and Betje. He also notes {{that there is a}} theme of social mobility, where Hidjo's relationships with noble women are fostered by his merchant father to grant the family a greater social position; bride prices also feature prominently, showing that one can become a noble through marriage if one has enough money. He notes that, {{towards the end of the}} novel, love is described as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find, as the social-financial meaning of marriage remains predominant among the traditional Javanese. The characters, despite not all marrying for love, are <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> eventual partners and have a comfortable life.|$|E

40|$|Are {{people who}} are best able to {{implement}} strategies to regulate their emotional expressive behavior happier and more successful than their counterparts? Although past research has examined individual variation in knowledge {{of the most effective}} emotion regulation strategies, little is known about how individual differences in the ability to actually implement these strategies, as assessed objectively in the laboratory, is associated with external criteria. In two studies, we examined how individual variation in the ability to modify emotional expressive behavior in response to evocative stimuli is related to well-being and financial success. Study 1 showed that individuals who can best suppress their emotional reaction to an acoustic startle are <b>happiest</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives. Study 2 showed that individuals who can best amplify their emotional reaction to a disgust-eliciting movie are <b>happiest</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives and have the highest disposable income and socioeconomic status. Thus, being able to implement emotion regulation strategies in the laboratory is closely linked to well-being and financial success. Emotion Regulation Ability...|$|R
25|$|Single-mother and lower-class {{families}} {{have a much}} more difficult time negotiating childcare or finding sustainable childcare options. The breadwinner-homemaker family and economic model does not apply to single-parent families because the single-parent must be both roles at all times. Because child care services cost a substantial amount, low-income mothers spend a higher percentage of their income on child care than middle class mothers do. Few low-income mothers are <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> childcare arrangements {{especially in light of the}} fact that low-income childcare arrangements suffer from frequent disruptions. In the United States, state assistance for childcare is nowhere near the level of other developed countries and has actually decreased.|$|E
25|$|When Estonia regained its {{independence}} in 1991, Narva again became a border city. Local leaders, holdovers from the Soviet era, wanted autonomy, and {{contended that the}} notion of a breakaway 'Transnarovan SSR' republic in northeastern Estonia was becoming increasingly popular, but this was contradicted by polls showing 87% of the region's population opposed secession from Estonia. In 1993, dissatisfaction with newly enacted citizenship and election laws (non-citizens were not allowed to hold office) culminated in the Narva referendum of 16–17 July 1993, which proposed autonomy for Narva and Sillamäe, a nearby town. 97% voted in favor of the referendum, though turnout in Narva was 55% and there were credible charges of vote rigging. Russian residents nowadays are <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> status as Estonian citizens and live peacefully alongside their compatriots.|$|E
25|$|On 8 March 1798 Brune was {{appointed}} to lead the Army of Italy. He left for his new command on 29 March and Schauenburg was named the new army commander. Meanwhile, cash and gold worth 10 million francs were seized of which three million helped finance Napoleon Bonaparte's French campaign in Egypt and Syria. In addition, 293 cannons, 38 howitzers and 32 mortars were taken to Huningue and Carouge. Though the two countries became allies on 19 August 1798, many Swiss were not <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> new French overlords. The French soldiers were kept busy suppressing revolts in Valais (Wallis) and other cantons. During his tenure, Schauenburg got Nicolas Oudinot transferred to his army. Schauenburg was an excellent organizer but not a first-rate general like his successor. On 11 December, he relinquished command to André Masséna and {{assumed the role of}} Inspector General of Infantry.

5000|$|Some {{couples in}} open marriages report {{high levels of}} {{satisfaction}} <b>with</b> <b>their</b> relationships. A study conducted by Wolf found that 76 percent of openly married couples described {{the quality of their}} relationships as [...] "better than average" [...] or [...] "outstanding." [...] Dixon found similarly high levels of marital satisfaction in a study of 100 bisexual and heterosexual husbands in open marriages. In another study, Dixon observed that 80 percent of wives in open marriages rated their marital compatibility as [...] "excellent" [...] or [...] "good," [...] and 76 percent of the wives rated their sexual satisfaction as [...] "excellent" [...] or [...] "good." [...] Buunk has also reported high levels of satisfaction in openly married couples. [...] Some couples feel open marriage has increased their marital satisfaction. Bergstrand and Williams collected online questionnaires from 1092 people involved in swinging style open marriages. Among those people who said they were [...] "somewhat unhappy" [...] or [...] "unhappy" [...] <b>with</b> <b>their</b> marriages before swinging, around 80-90 percent said they were <b>happier</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> marriages after they started swinging. Nearly half of people who said they were [...] "very happy" [...] <b>with</b> <b>their</b> marriages before swinging claimed to be even <b>happier</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> marriages after swinging. Open marriage can in some cases increase marital satisfaction.|$|R
25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{minstrel}} show {{coincided with}} the growth of the abolitionist movement. Many Northerners were concerned for the oppressed blacks of the South, but most had no idea how these slaves lived day-to-day. Blackface performance had been inconsistent on this subject; some slaves were happy, others victims of a cruel and inhuman institution. However, in the 1850s minstrelsy became decidedly mean-spirited and pro-slavery as race replaced class as its main focus. Most minstrels projected a greatly romanticized and exaggerated image of black life with cheerful, simple slaves always ready to sing and dance and to please their masters. (Less frequently, the masters cruelly split up black lovers or sexually assaulted black women.) The lyrics and dialogue were generally racist, satiric, and largely white in origin. Songs about slaves yearning to return to their masters were plentiful. The message was clear: do not worry about the slaves; they are <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lot in life. Figures like the Northern dandy and the homesick ex-slave reinforced the idea that blacks did not belong, nor did they want to belong, in Northern society.|$|E

The results indicate that differences in material outcomes, like higher pay or a lower number of working hours, as well as potential differences in personality cannot account for the observed job satisfaction differences. Rather, the higher job satisfaction among the self-employed can be directly attributed to the greater independence and autonomy they enjoy. “Being your own boss ” seems to provide non-pecuniary benefits from work that point to the existence of “procedural utility”: autonomy is valued beyond outcomes as a good decision-making procedure.

40|$|Recently {{economists have}} shown that people who {{graduate}} during recessions earn less money and hold less prestigious jobs, even decades after entering the workforce. This dissertation argues that despite these suboptimal outcomes, these graduates {{are likely to be}} <b>happier</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> jobs, even long after these economic conditions have changed. Four studies found that people who entered the workforce when the economy was sputtering and jobs were difficult to secure were more satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> jobs than their peers who entered during better economic times, even decades after these early workforce experiences. Study 1 utilized a large cross-sectional national survey of working adults in the United States and found that college graduates who first looked for work during difficult economic times were more satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> jobs well into their careers. Study 2 found that people who graduated from both college and graduate school during times of higher unemployment were <b>happier</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> jobs both early in their careers and years later, even when they earned less money. Study 3 replicated this effect in a different country, the United Kingdom, and among a more diverse educational population. Study 3 found that economic conditions at workforce entry predicted life satisfaction as well. Finally, Study 4 explored potential mediators of this effect and suggested that people who entered the workforce during economic downturns were less likely to entertain upward counterfactual thoughts about how they might have done better. This tendency fully mediated the relationship between workforce economic conditions and job satisfaction. While past research on job satisfaction has focused on dispositional and situational antecedents, these findings suggest that strong experiential factors also may have an enduring effect on how satisfied people are <b>with</b> <b>their</b> jobs...|$|R

500|$|Bruce and {{the conservatives}} in {{parliament}} became increasingly convinced that [...] "economic deterioration [...] the product, {{rather than the}} possible cause, of worsening industrial relations." [...] Exasperated, the Prime Minister made a dramatic move and presented an ultimatum to the Australian state governments: either they should voluntarily hand their powers of industrial regulation to the federal government, or {{the federal government would}} divest itself of its industrial powers and dismantle federal arbitration. The announcement came as a major shock to all sides of politics, not least the members of Bruce's own cabinet, most of whom had not been informed of the dramatic change in policy until the day it was announced to the states. Bruce calculated that the states would not give up their powers, and thus the move was one designed to sanction the end of Commonwealth arbitration. For Bruce, the only inconceivable outcome now was that the status quo of dual jurisdiction remained unchanged. The opposition to the proposal, which the Prime Minister introduced to the parliament as the Maritime Industries Bill, was swift and fierce. In 1929 over 150 unions and 700,000 workers were covered by Commonwealth awards over a wide range of industries although there was dissatisfaction in the coal and timber sectors, most were <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> arrangements and feared worse pay and conditions if moved back to state awards.
