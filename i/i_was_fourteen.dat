His father was a coal miner, and Veach also began working in the coal mine as a boy. In 1915, Veach recalled: [...] "I started in as a miner when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fourteen</b> years old and worked {{at it in the}} winters until a couple years ago, long after I was earning money as a player." [...] At age 17, Veach moved to Herrin, Illinois, where he began playing semi-pro baseball.|$|E

[...] "To be quite honest, I quite liked it when I lived there. When I moved to Drumchapel, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fourteen</b> {{and there was}} a {{bluebell}} wood there, and it was in great condition then— I don't think it's in quite so good condition now— but it was lovely then. We had rabbits and pheasants, and I really quite liked it. I just started to dislike it when I got older, into my teens and things. In my late teens, when I was stuck out there, it cost me {{a lot of money to}} go anyplace. It was a kind of cowboy town, but I liked that aspect of it, buying stuff out of vans, a ragman coming in a wee green van." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carl Frederick Buechner, {{the eldest}} son of Katherine Kuhn and Carl Frederick Buechner Sr., was born on July 11, 1926 in New York City. During Buechner's early {{childhood}} the family moved frequently, as Buechner's father searched for work. In The Sacred Journey Buechner recalls: [...] "Virtually every year of my life until <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fourteen,</b> I lived in a different place, had different people {{to take care of}} me, went to a different school. The only house that remained constant was the one where my maternal grandparents lived in a suburb of Pittsburgh called East Liberty...Apart from that one house on Woodland Road, home was not a place to me when I was a child. It was people." [...] This changed in 1936, when Buechner's father committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, a result of his conviction that he had been a failure. Immediately afterwards, the family moved to Bermuda, where they remained until World War II forced the evacuation of Americans from the island. [...] In Bermuda, Buechner experienced [...] "the blessed relief of coming out of the dark and unmentionable sadness of my father's life and death into fragrance and greenness and light." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{the time}} was rapidly drawing near when I was to begin my second series of bouts with John Barleycorn. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fourteen,</b> my head filled with the tales of the old voyagers, my vision with tropic isles and far sea-rims, I was sailing a small {{centreboard}} skiff around San Francisco Bay and on the Oakland Estuary.

I was in the flower of my adolescence, a-thrill with romance and adventure, dreaming of wild life in the wild man-world. Little I guessed how all the warp and woof of that man-world was entangled with alcohol.|$|E

Still, as I said, he was consistent, and there was literature he would not handle, nor when they made him a councillor would he wink at certain municipal jobbery. The latter fact was duly remembered when his lease fell in, as well as on other occasions, and when he died, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fourteen,</b> there was nothing left for me. He was a scholar, and an upright man--as well as a Tory of the old school and a high churchman." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{must have}} been two years afterwards, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> almost <b>fourteen,</b> when one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> reading aloud, and she <b>was</b> listening. <b>I</b> had come down at nine o'clock as I always did to read the Bible to her, and was reading from St. John how our Saviour stooped down, writing with his finger in the dust, when they brought the sinful woman to him.|$|R
6000|$|... “So I was, sir. I was {{an orphan}} {{at the age}} of five. My father left enough money to buy a boat, and, as one of the {{fishermen}} had lately lost his, he adopted me, and I became bound to him as an apprentice till <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fourteen.</b> The clergyman’s daughter took a fancy to me from the first, and she used to teach me for half an hour a day, which gave me a great advantage over the other boys in the school. I was very fond of reading, and she supplied me with books. As I said I meant to go to sea, she bought me some books that would help me. So there is nothing extraordinary in my knowing these things; it all came from her kindness to me for ten years.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, yes. Perhaps {{you don't}} {{know that our}} 'now-mother,' as Jack says sometimes, is Father's second wife. My own mother died when I was a baby, and my aunt, who had no {{children}} of her own, took me to bring up. Her husband was a sea-captain, and she always went on his sea-voyages with him. So I went too. I almost grew up on shipboard. We had delightful times. I never went to school. Auntie had been a teacher before her marriage, and she taught me. Two years ago, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fourteen,</b> Father married again, and then {{he wanted me to}} go home to him and Jack and our new mother. So I did, although at first I was very sorry to leave Auntie and the dear old ship and all our lovely wanderings." ...|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fourteen</b> I {{was living}} with my parents, who were very poor--and correspondently honest. We had a youth living with us {{by the name of}} Jim Wolfe. He was an {{excellent}} fellow, seventeen years old, and very diffident. He and I slept together--virtuously; and one bitter winter's night a cousin Mary--she's married now and gone--gave what they call a candy-pulling in those days in the West, and they took the saucers of hot candy outside of the house into the snow, under a sort of old bower that came from the eaves--it was a sort of an ell then, all covered with vines--to cool this hot candy in the snow, and they were all sitting there. In the mean time we were gone to bed. We were not invited to attend this party; we were too young.|$|E
