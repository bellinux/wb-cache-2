50|$|The Five-seven can be {{disassembled}} {{quickly and}} easily, {{by using the}} left hand to retract and hold the slide 5 mm rearwards, while simultaneously using the left-hand thumb to push and hold the takedown lever rearwards. When the slide is released, it moves forward freely and the complete slide assembly can be disengaged from the frame, whereupon the barrel (and captured recoil spring) can {{be removed from the}} slide. This level of disassembly is sufficient to perform thorough cleaning of the pistol, and FNH USA recommends no <b>further</b> <b>disassembly</b> except by an authorized armorer, FN Herstal, or FNH USA. Reassembly of the pistol is done in the reverse order, except no use of the disassembly lever is necessary.|$|E

The optimal conditions for ATP-induced specific disassembly of the bionanocomposite network were identified, highlighting the existing competition between ATP/aptamer interactions and DNA duplex stability. A new, dialysis-based method for ATP removal was proposed, allowing partial re-formation {{of the initial}} DNA duplexes. <b>Further</b> <b>disassembly</b> was re-achieved by subsequent addition of ATP. These data constitute promising preliminary steps towards DNA-based fully reversible responsive bionanocomposite devices...|$|E
40|$|The {{end-of-life}} (EOL) disassembly is {{an important}} process in the product retirement stage. In order to improve the ease of disassembly, {{it is essential to}} design a product which can be easily disassembled. In this paper, a novel concept of eco-architecture is introduced and a method for analyzing the eco-architecture of a product at the configuration design stage is proposed. The eco-architecture is the architecture of a product, described from the end-of-life viewpoint, in which a product is represented as an assembly of EOL modules. An EOL module is a physical chunk of connected components which can be recovered or disposed as a single unit without <b>further</b> <b>disassembly.</b> The eco-architecture prescribes the optimal EOL strategy concerning how to disassemble a product and what to do with each of the resulting disassembled parts. The understanding of eco-architecture supports designers to accomplish Design for Disassembly from the early stage of design in an efficient and effective manner. Keywords...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recycling concepts, as {{they are}} {{required}} in the actual waste management legisla-tion, often need the development of disassembly processes to assure, i. e. an efficient sepa-ration of hazardous materials, or the accumulation ofworthy ingredients for further ecov-ery. Therefore methods and tools have {{to be found in}} order to determinate law-conformal and economic <b>disassembly</b> strategies. <b>Further</b> efficient <b>disassembly</b> processes and tool have to be developed, considering the specific reqirements. In this contribution is given an overview of the actual German legislative situation regard-ing waste management.

40|$|Sonoporation {{is based}} upon an ultrasound-microbubble {{cavitation}} routine that physically punctures the plasma membrane on a transient basis. Over such process, the actin cytoskeleton may be disrupted in tandem since this network of subcellular filaments is physically interconnected with the plasma membrane. Here, by performing confocal fluorescence imaging of single-site sonoporation episodes induced by ultrasound-triggered collapse of a single targeted microbubble, we directly observed immediate rupturing of filamentary actin (F-actin) at the sonoporation site (cell type: ZR- 75 - 30; ultrasound frequency: 1 MHz; peak negative pressure: 0. 45 MPa; pulse duration: 30 cycles; bubble diameter: 2 - 4 ÔÅ≠m). Also, through conducting a structure tensor analysis, we observed <b>further</b> <b>disassembly</b> of the F-actin network over the next 60 min after the onset of sonoporation. The extent of F-actin disruption {{was found to be}} more substantial in cells with higher uptake of sonoporation tracer. Commensurate with this process, cytoplasmic accumulation of globular actin (G-actin) was evident in sonoporated cells, and in turn the G:F-actin ratio was increased in a trend similar to drug-induced (cytochalasin D) actin depolymerization. These results demonstrate that sonoporation is not solely a membrane-level phenomenon: organization of the actin cytoskeleton is concomitantly perturbed...|$|E
40|$|The Glory {{observatory}} is {{the current}} incarnation of the Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) mission spacecraft bus. The VCL spacecraft bus, having been cancelled for programmatic reasons in 2000, was nearly integrated when it was put into storage for possible future use. The Glory mission was a suitable candidate for using this spacecraft and in 2006 an effort to recertify the two axis solar array gimbal drive after its extended storage was begun. What {{was expected to be}} a simple performance validation of the two dual axis gimbal stepper motors became a serious test, diagnosis and repair task once questions arose on the flight worthiness of the hardware. A significant test program logic flow was developed which identified decisions that could be made {{based on the results of}} individual recertification tests. Without disassembling the bi-axial gimbals, beginning with stepper motor threshold voltage measurements and relating these to powered drive torque measurements, both performed at the spacecraft integrator s facility, a confusing picture of the health of the actuators came to light. Tests at the gimbal assembly level and tests of the disassembled actuators were performed by the manufacturer to validate our results and torque discrepancies were noted. <b>Further</b> <b>disassembly</b> to the component level of the actuator revealed the source of the torque loss...|$|E
40|$|The {{breakdown}} of most nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins involves their partial cleavage by the 26 S proteasome followed by <b>further</b> <b>disassembly</b> to {{free amino acids}} by the combined action of endo- and exopeptidases. In animals, one important intermediate exopeptidase is tripeptidyl peptidase (TPP) II, which digests peptide products of the 26 S proteasome and other endopeptidases into tripeptides. Here, we describe the purification and characterization of TPPII from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Like its animal counterparts, Arabidopsis TPPII exists as a soluble, approximately 5 - to 9 -MD complex. Two related species of 153 and 142 kD {{are present in the}} purified preparations that are derived from a single TPP 2 gene. Sequencing by Edman degradation of the intact polypeptides and mass spectrometry of proteolytic fragments demonstrated that the 142 -kD form mainly differs from the 153 -kD form by a truncation at the C-terminal end. This serine protease {{is a member of the}} subtilisin superfamily and is sensitive to the inhibitors alanine-alanine-phenylalanine-chloromethylketone and butabindide, which are diagnostic for the TPPII subfamily. The Arabidopsis TPP 2 gene is widely expressed in many tissue types with related genes evident in other plant genomes. Whereas the 26 S proteasome is essential, TPPII appears not as important for plant physiology. An Arabidopsis T-DNA mutant defective in TPP 2 expression displays no phenotypic abnormalities and is not hypersensitive to either amino acid analogs or the 26 S proteasome inhibitor MG 132. As a consequence, plants likely contain other intermediate exopeptidases that assist in amino acid recycling...|$|E

40|$|Polo-like kinase (Plk 1) plays {{a central}} role in {{regulating}} the cell cycle. Plk 1 -mediated phosphorylation is essential for centrosome maturation, and for numerous mitotic events. Although Plk 1 localizes to multiple subcellular sites, a major site of action is the centrosomes, which supports mitotic functions in control of bipolar spindle formation. In G 0 or G 1 untransformed cells, the centriolar core of the centrosome differentiates into the basal body of the primary cilium. Primary cilia are antenna-like sensory organelles dynamically regulated during the cell cycle. Whether Plk 1 has a role in ciliary biology has never been studied. Nephrocystin- 1 (NPHP 1) is a ciliary protein; loss of NPHP 1 in humans causes nephronophthisis (NPH), an autosomal-recessive cystic kidney disease. We here demonstrate that Plk 1 colocalizes with nephrocystin- 1 to the transition zone of primary cilia in epithelial cells. Plk 1 co-immunoprecipitates with NPHP 1, suggesting {{it is part of the}} nephrocystin protein complex. We identified a candidate Plk 1 phosphorylation motif (D/E-X-S/T-w-X-D/E) in nephrocystin- 1, and demonstrated in vitro that Plk 1 phosphorylates the nephrocystin N-terminus, which includes the specific PLK 1 phosphorylation motif. <b>Further,</b> induced <b>disassembly</b> of primary cilia rapidly evoked Plk 1 kinase activity, while small molecule inhibition of Plk 1 activity or RNAi-mediated downregulation of Plk 1 limited the first and second phase of ciliary disassembly. These data identify Plk 1 as a novel transition zone signaling protein, suggest a function of Plk 1 in cili...|$|R
40|$|The kinesin- 13 motor protein {{family members}} drive {{the removal of}} tubulin from microtubules (MTs) to promote MT turnover. A point {{mutation}} of the kinesin- 13 family member mitotic centromere-associated kinesin/Kif 2 C (E 491 A) isolates the tubulin-removal conformation of the motor, and appears distinct from all previously described kinesin- 13 conformations derived from nucleotide analogues. The E 491 A mutant removes tubulin dimers from stabilized MTs stoichiometrically in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but is unable to efficiently release from detached tubulin dimers to recycle catalytically. Only in adenosine diphosphate (ADP) can the mutant catalytically remove tubulin dimers from stabilized MTs because the affinity of the mutant for detached tubulin dimers in ADP is low relative to lattice-bound tubulin. Thus, the motor can regenerate for <b>further</b> cycles of <b>disassembly.</b> Using the mutant, we show that release of tubulin by kinesin- 13 motors occurs at the transition state for ATP hydrolysis, which illustrates a significant divergence in their coupling to ATP turnover relative to motile kinesins...|$|R
40|$|Incoming {{environmental}} legislation {{is expected to}} impose recycling activities on industrial and consumer product manufacturers. Disassembly of used products is {{needed in order to}} make recycling economically viable in {{the current state of the}} art of reprocessing technology, thus avoiding the future high disposal costs. This paper gives an overview of disassembly research at universities, research centers and industrial companies, pointing out ongoing topics and trends for future activities. Among them, major attention has been paid to basic technological development, product design (design for disassembly), process design (selection of disassembly strategy and automation level) and system design (configuration of manual and automated disassembly facilities, design of disassembly tools). It is also shown how the emerging life cycle concept can be fully exploited to develop suitable ways of dealing with information related to environmental protection and resource optimization. A result of the survey is that <b>further</b> development on <b>disassembly</b> of existing products (technology, planning at process and system level) is needed to allow future products to be designed with recycling considerations in mind...|$|R
40|$|After Listeria, a bacterium, is phagocytosed by a macrophage, it dissolves the phagosomal {{membrane}} {{and enters}} the cytoplasm. The Listeria than nucleates actin filaments from its surface. These newly assembled actin filaments show unidirectional polarity with their barbed ends associated with {{the surface of the}} Listeria. Using actin concentrations below the pointed end critical concentration we find that filament elongation must be occurring by monomers adding to the barbed ends, the ends associated with the Listerial surface. If Listeria with tails are incubated in G actin under polymerizing conditions, the Listeria is translocated away from its preformed tail by the elongation of filaments attached to the Listeria. This experiment and others tell us that in vivo filament assembly must be tightly coupled to filament capping and cross-bridging so that if one process outstrips another, chaos ensues. We also show that the actin filaments in the tail are capped on their pointed ends which inhibits <b>further</b> elongation and/or <b>disassembly</b> in vitro. From these results we suggest a simple picture of how Listeria competes effectively for host cell actin. When Listeria secretes a nucleator, the host's actin subunits polymerize into a filament. Host cell machinery terminate the assembly leaving a short filament. Listeria overcomes the host control by nucleating new filaments and thus many short filaments assemble. The newest filaments push existing ones into a growing tail. Thus the competition is between nucleation of filaments caused by Listeria and the filament terminators produced by the host...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of functional neural circuits depends upon a huge excess of synapses forming, {{many of which}} are subsequently eliminated in an activity-dependent manner. Critically, robust mechanisms must be in place to ensure selected synapses are maintained. The coordinated gain, loss and maintenance of synapses require a complex molecular dialogue between pre and postsynaptic neurons involving multiple signals. In addition to establishing functional neuronal circuits, normal brain function requires the correct balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs on a single neuron impacts significantly on its output, which in turn determines circuit formation and function. Whilst {{progress has been made in}} elucidating mechanisms that regulate synapse assembly, disassembly and maintenance, and the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory synapses, many aspects remain poorly understood. Wnt proteins are a diverse family of secreted glycoproteins known to stimulate synaptogenesis via Gsk 3 √¢. The aim of my thesis has been to further characterize the Wnt signaling pathway and determine whether Wnt 7 a is a pan-synaptogenic factor or if it preferentially stimulates the assembly of excitatory synapses. I have also explored a role for Wnt-mediated synaptic maintenance in mature synapses. My studies reveal that Wnt 7 a signals through a divergentcanonical Wnt pathway that is independent of transcription to specifically regulate presynaptic differentiation of excitatory synapses; inhibitory synapses are not affected. I also found that blockade of endogenous Wnt induces a rapid loss of synapses. Synapse disassembly was revealed by a coordinated loss of multiple pre- and postsynaptic proteins and neurotransmitter release sites. Ultrastructural analyses of remaining synapses revealed significant shrinkage of the active zone and postsynaptic density. To <b>further</b> explore synapse <b>disassembly</b> during Wnt-blockade, I imaged mature neurons expressing VAMP 2 -mRFP using time-lapse microscopy. Here I found that blockade of endogenous Wnt signaling rapidly induces disassembly of stable synaptic vesicle clusters. My results demonstrate that Wnt signaling plays two roles in hippocampal neurons. Firstly, Wnts promote the assembly of nascent excitatory synapses in young cultures. Secondly, Wnt signaling is required for synaptic maintenance in mature neurons. Synaptic maintenance is a novel role for Wnt signaling at synapses and this thesis work provides new insights into the mechanisms by which Wnt signaling modulates synapses in hippocampal neurons...|$|R
