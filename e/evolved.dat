5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{has been}} used by {{scientists}} in the interpretation of the evolution of lemurs and their kin. They are thought to have <b>evolved</b> from early adapiform primates around the Eocene or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they <b>evolved</b> from European adapids, but the fossil record suggests that they <b>evolved</b> from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the Paleocene (66 to 55mya) and might have <b>evolved</b> from early cercamoniines from Asia. Fossil primates such as Djebelemur, 'Anchomomys' milleri, and Plesiopithecus may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record prior to 40mya has created a conflict with molecular clock studies that suggest an older divergence between lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a ghost lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa.|$|E

5|$|It is {{now clear}} that the common {{ancestor}} of the bony fishes (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later <b>evolved</b> into a swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes).

5|$|Among extant strepsirrhines, {{only the}} diurnal and cathemeral lemurs have <b>evolved</b> {{to live in}} multi-male/multi-female groups, {{comparable}} to most living simians.

Strepsirrhines spend a considerable amount of time grooming each other (allogrooming). When lemuriform primates groom, they lick the fur and then comb it with their toothcomb.
