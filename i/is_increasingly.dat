5|$|Microbial {{communities}} {{produce a}} vast array of biologically active chemicals that are used in competition and communication. Many of the drugs in use today were originally uncovered in microbes; recent progress in mining the rich genetic resource of non-culturable microbes has led to the discovery of new genes, enzymes, and natural products. The application of metagenomics has allowed the development of commodity and fine chemicals, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals where the benefit of enzyme-catalyzed chiral synthesis <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> recognized.|$|E

The international ban on the use of drift nets has also helped reduce the mortality of seabirds and other marine wildlife.|$|E

The rise of the Internet, particularly blogs, has diminished the importance of Speaker's Corner as a political platform, and it <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> seen as simply a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{affected}} by avian malaria, {{the incidence of}} which has tripled in the last 70 years, in parallel with increasing global temperatures.

5|$|A recent threat, first {{reported}} in 1978, is forest dieback. In some areas, {{especially in the}} peripheral region, this has been severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as {{the main cause of}} dieback as droughts are becoming more frequent. Regrowth of forest is hindered by frost which <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> severe. The forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with Calophyllum walkeri being the most affected. A study has suggested that low calcium causes soil acidification and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing the dieback. Leaching of nutrients and the resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to the dieback.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they {{are ready to}} leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium is used, in {{conjunction}} with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials and commercial lighting. Because of dysprosium's high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section, dysprosium-oxide–nickel cermets are used in neutron-absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors. Dysprosium–cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation, which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data-storage applications, such as in hard disks. Dysprosium <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> in demand for the permanent magnets used in electric car motors and wind turbine generators.|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} this Symposium {{originally}} was “Rethinking Financial and Securities Markets. ” It is, of course, somewhat presumptuous for scholars to try to rethink financial markets per se. Markets, including financial markets, are driven primarily by supply and demand. But scholars can and should try to influence the future of financial markets by rethinking their fundamental aspects. This Symposium presents work from leading scholars {{in the fields of}} law, economics, finance, and accounting. I will try to frame the discussion from the perspectives of these four disciplines. First, however, we need to identify what it is about financial markets that is worth rethinking. I will focus on ways in which financial markets have been changing. They <b>are</b> <b>increasingly</b> decentralized and fragmented. They <b>are</b> <b>increasingly</b> direct sources of firm capital—a process called disintermediation. They <b>are</b> <b>increasingly</b> global. They <b>are</b> <b>increasingly</b> creating funding mismatches, as short-term securities are used to finance long-term capital needs. And they (as well as financial market products) <b>are</b> <b>increasingly</b> complex and obscure to market participants, even with full disclosure.
