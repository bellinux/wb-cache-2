60|$|Sir Thomas More.--London is {{the heart}} of your {{commercial}} system, but it is also the hot-bed of corruption. It is at once the centre of wealth and the sink of misery; the seat of intellect and empire: and yet a wilderness wherein they, who live like wild beasts upon their fellow-creatures, find prey and cover. Other wild beasts have long since been extirpated: even in the wilds of Scotland, and of barbarous, or worse than barbarous Ireland, the wolf is no longer to be found; a degree of civilisation this to which no other country has attained. Man, and man alone, is permitted to run wild. You plough your <b>fields</b> and <b>harrow</b> them; you have your scarifiers to make the ground clean; and if after all this weeds should spring up, the careful cultivator roots them out by hand. But ignorance and misery and vice are allowed to grow, and blossom, and seed, not on the waste alone, but in the very garden and pleasure-ground of society and civilisation. Old Thomas Tusser's coarse remedy is the only one which legislators have yet thought of applying.|$|R

40|$|Non-chemical {{weed control}} methods {{need to be}} {{directed}} towards a site-specific weeding approach, {{in order to be}} able to compete the conventional herbicide equivalents. A system for online weed control was developed. It automatically adjusts the tine angle of a harrow and creates different levels of intensity: from gentle to aggressive. Two experimental plots in a maize <b>field</b> were <b>harrowed</b> with two consecutive passes. The plots presented from low to high weed infestation levels. Discriminant capabilities of an ultrasonic sensor were used to determine the crop and weed variability of the field. A controlling unit used ultrasonic readings to adjust the tine angle, producing an appropriate harrowing intensity. Thus, areas with high crop and weed densities were more aggressively harrowed, while areas with lower densities were cultivated with a gentler treatment; areas with very low densities or without weeds were not treated. Although the weed development was relatively advanced and the soil surface was hard, the weed control achieved by the system reached an average of 51 % (20 %– 91 %), without causing significant crop damage as a result of harrowing. This system is proposed as a relatively low cost, online, and real-time automatic harrow that improves the weed control efficacy, reduces energy consumption, and avoids the usage of herbicide.

40|$|Orientation {{is a key}} {{component}} to successful movements between habitats. We hypothesized that barren agricultural landscapes hinder the ability of frogs to orient and move between habitats. Specifically, we predicted that when presented with a choice between a short route through a hostile environment and a longer but safer route, individuals would select the one that entails the least risk. During a field experiment, we translocated 104 Edible Frogs (Rana klepton esculenta) into a recently <b>harrowed</b> <b>field</b> according to two treatments: the distance to their pond of origin (5 - 70 m) and the distance to a wooded hedgerow (10 - 60 m).

In addition, frogs were more successful in orienting toward the pond under high wind conditions.

40|$|The {{effect of}} three tillage {{implements}} (<b>field</b> cultivator, disk <b>harrow,</b> rotary harrow) {{on the soil}} incorporation of various herbicides and consequently on the efficacy of these herbicides against the weeds and on their selectivity on cotton, was evaluated in four field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2003 and 2004. All experimental plots were irrigated with sprinklers, immediately after the pre-emergence application of herbicides, while later all plots were irrigated with either drip irrigation or mobile sprinklers. The herbicide treatments consisted of a broadcast preplant-incorporated (PPI) application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by pre-emergence (PRE) applied prometryn, a pre-emergence 38 cm band application of s-metolachlor + fluometuron and a broadcast PPI application of s-metolachlor followed by post-emergence applied trifloxysulfuron-sodium or pyrithiobac. The PPI application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by PRE application of prometryn resulted the greatest control of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). The efficacy of herbicides against common lambsquarters and black nightshade was slightly reduced when they were incorporated into the soil with the rotary harrow. Cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, boll opening and cotton lint yield were not affected in most cases by the tillage implement. Cotton lint yield in plots irrigated with drip irrigation was higher or equal with plots irrigated with sprinklers. The effect of three tillage implements (<b>field</b> cultivator, disk <b>harrow,</b> rotary harrow) and various herbicides was also evaluated in two field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2006 and 2007. Herbicide treatments included the pre-plant incorporation of s-metolachlor + fluometuron, trifluralin + fluometuron, ethalfluralin, pendimethalin + fluometuron, fluometuron. Irrigation with sprinklers was not made after cotton sowing. Cotton lint yield in plots treated with preplant incorporated s-metolachlor + fluometuron was equal to plots treated with trifluralin + fluometuron or pendimethalin + fluometuron, but significantly higher than plots treated with ethalfluralin or fluometuron. The incorporation of herbicides in the soil with disk <b>harrow</b> or <b>field</b> cultivator compared to rotary harrow, provided higher efficacy against some weeds and similar effect on cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, bolls opening and cotton lint yield. In addition, the fossil-fuel and labor time requirements of disk <b>harrow</b> and <b>field</b> cultivator were {{lower than that of}} rotary harrow. The findings of this study showed that the herbicides trifluralin, s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron or prometryn should be used for effective control of broad leaved weeds in cotton. Finally, drip irrigation combined with the PPI application of s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron and incorporated in the soil with field cultivator or disk harrow should be the first choice of cotton growers in integrated crop management systems. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} was performed {{during the summer}} and autumn in 1984. The purpose was to investigate factors on low profile implement tyres affecting the coefficient of rolling resistance. The following factors were studied: - inflation pressure - width - diameter - construction - ply rating - aspect ratio - tread pattern Tests wars performed on concrete, <b>harrowed</b> <b>fields,</b> ploughed fields and stubble. Important factors when reducing the CRR when driving on concrete are: - increase the diameter and width - higher ply rating - decrease in aspect ratio - less aggressive tread pattern - choice of particular constructions (Garden Tractor or Steel Belt). The most important factor in reducing rolling resistance on soft ground is to ensure that the tyre size is adequate to carry the vertical load at as low inflation pressure as possible. A big soft tyre with low inflation pressure giving no or little sinkage is desirable. Choice of aggressive tread patterns will lead to an increase in rolling resistance because of the energy losses produced by the high compaction under the lugs. The relation between diameter and width must be large enough to ensure no or a minimum of bulldozing resistance. Reducing rolling resistance will lead to a number of advantages. The low inflation pressures will cause a decrease in soil compaction, and there will be an increase in yields. Lower railing resistance will also result in savings in fuel and time...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{design of}} {{structural}} modeling is usually {{based on the}} different geometric function. Since every component has a definite life span, {{it is necessary to}} calculate its core parameters. To find the life span of component, the component must be as input parameter to the Finite Element Analysis. The Finite Element Analysis is nothing but a numerical method for solving Engineering and Mathematical problems. The Analysis of the “Rear Axle Casing of Tractor ” using cast iron material with special grade “SG 500 ” for already existing model, taken in the real time is done by using “ANSYS”. The stress, strain, deformation analysis of the component is done by giving various boundary conditions. These analyzed results help to redesign the rear casing of tractor. The redesigning of rear axle casing of a tractor is done using “PRO/E”. During redesigning the component, various criteria’s which are undergoing in the real field must be taken into an account. The analysis of the redesigned model is done by giving various boundary conditions for both materials ‘SG 500 ” and “SG 200 ”. Then the stress, strain, deformation, structural supports, structural results are evaluated and also cores, dies and patterns are generated and hence the redesigned rear axle casing of tractor is found to be in safer mode. The better material which is suitable for the rear axle casing is given, by comparing the above mentioned materials.

40|$|Sixteen {{acres of}} corn were grown {{on the grounds}} of the Iowa Experiment Station in 1889. The {{principal}} part of it was produced from the best ears of our last year’s crop of Learning corn, and the remainder consisted of Arleus and early Mastodon corn. It was grown on a black heavy soil, which was too wet formerly in wet seasons, to produce paying crops of anything, except grass; but last year it was tile-drained thoroughly. The greater part of the field had been used for many years as a pasture and the remainder, (perhaps five acres) was a part of an old field which had been used for different kinds of crops. It was well plowed early in September, 1888. Last spring, we ran over it twice with a disc harrow and once with a reversible harrow and then plowed it about eight inches deep. Then we ran over it again with a disc harrow and a reversible harrow and also with a heavy farm roller. It was planted May 2 d and 3 d, with a two horse planter in rows three feet and eight inches apart. From two to three grains were planted in each of the hills, which were thirty inches apart in the rows; but the entire field was thinned afterwards to two stalks in each hill. The <b>field</b> was <b>harrowed</b> twice with a Thomas smoothing harrow after the com came up; when it was divided into four lots, each of which was cultivated four times afterwards and hoed once. The south lot was cultivated each time with the Tower cultivator. The lot next to it was cultivated each time with the Eagle- Claw cultivator. The next or third lot, was cultivated with the riding Pearl cultivator, and the remainder of the field each time with the Albion Spring Tooth cultivator. The work of the Tower cultivator was excellent where oat stubble had been plowed under; but where old weeds or corn stalks were near the surface of the ground, it did not work well. The work of the Eagle-Claw cultivator was better than could be done by the walking or riding plows which are used in every neighborhood; because it pulverizes the surface of the ground better and leaves it level. But the Albion 248 Spring Tooth cultivator excels all other kinds which we have used, on all kinds of ground and in every respect. When our crop of corn was husked and measured during the latter part of October, the yield of the entire field proved to be eighty bushels per acre of sound shelled corn. I find from the reports of the Secretary of the Iowa Board -of Agriculture, that the average yield of corn in Iowa for the years 1883 - 8 inclusive, was 31 and 312 / 3 bushels per acre. The highest average yield per acre for a single year, was considered remarkable, being 411 / 4 bushels.

Na štirih poskusnih poljih smo predsetveno pripravo tal opravili s predsetvenikom ali vrtavkasto brano, nato smo opravili setev z dvema razlicnima sejalnicama. Prva je pnevmatska nadtlacna, druga pnevmatska podtlacna. Pri vseh opravilih smo merili porabo goriva in casa, pri setvi pa še porabo semena. Po 14 dnevih smo opazovali vznik. Jeseni smo izmerili pridelek na vseh poskusnih parcelah in izmerili vlago zrnja koruze. Zbrali smo tudi vremenske podatke za celo leto. Ugotovili smo, da se predsetvena priprava tal opravi hitreje in bolje z vrtavkasto brano v primerjavi s predsetvenikom poleg tega pa prihranimo tudi gorivo. Setev s podtlacno sejalnico je bolj natancna, poraba semena pa je nižja v primerjavi z nadtlacno sejalnico.

We have found that the pre-sowing soil preparation was carried out more quickly and effectively with rotary harrow in comparison with seed bed combination. Also this method saves the fuel. Using the seed drill vacuum is more accurate, consumption of seeds is lower in comparison with the seed drill overpressure.

40|$|Interest {{in various}} forms of reduced tillage is {{steadily}} increasing, in line with today’s high machinery and fuel costs and increasing awareness of harmful effects of soil compaction. Reduced tillage in its various forms does, however, place higher proportions of coarse aggregates and greater quantities of plant residues. In the summer of 1995, the Väderstad Concorde underwent evaluation in field trials. The Väderstad Concorde is essentially a seedbed harrow with a seed hopper installed above it. The seed is fed pneumatically, with each harrow tine functioning as a seed coulter. Depth control is achieved using a wheel which follows the contour of the land, transmitting control signals to the hydraulics unit to raise or lower the machine as required. The Concorde was developed to allow farmers {{to reduce the number}} of machinery passes required. The trails encompassed spring drilling (With different numbers of harrow passes and various drilling depth), and involved studies of the bottom of the drill and the seedbed itself to investigate seed placement, the size distribution of aggregates and the moisture content of the bottom of the drill and the rest of the seedbed. During the growing season there followed monitoring of the number of plants, shoots (tillers) and ears, and of yields. The number of weeds at the various stages of growth was also investigated. Another aspect of these trials involved drilling nitrogen fertilizer amongst growing autumn wheat in the spring (drilled both along and across the direction of seed drilling). In spring drilling, an implement with Crosskill rollers was used after the Concorde. The result showed that seed placement after the Concorde in spring drilling was good, with, at lowest, 96 % of seed placed at the bottom of the drill. The number of plants per square metre after the Concorde was higher where no prior harrowing had taken place. This indicates that harrowing prior to drilling does not improve the result, provided that the <b>field</b> has been <b>harrowed</b> in the autumn or levelled. In the trail crops which had not been harrowed prior to drilling, pressure on the crop from weeds was lower than in the crops which had been harrowed twice before drilling. The harvest result also indicated that a reduced number of harrow passes before drilling with Concorde produced increased yields. Drilling nitrogen fertiliser in autumn wheat produced increased yields when compared with topdressing, in spite of the fact that a great deal of precipitation fell on the following night. It is difficult to determine whether the increased yield was a result of the tillage effect or the placement of the fertiliser. Even greater effects are probably to be expected if rain does not fall on the crop immediately after the fertiliser is drilled in this way...|$|R
