5|$|In {{the colonial}} period, {{most of the}} {{surviving}} Chajoma were forcibly settled in the towns of San Juan Sacatepéquez, San Pedro Sacatepéquez and San Martín Jilotepeque {{as a result of}} the Spanish policy of congregaciones; the people were moved to whichever of the three towns was closest to their pre-conquest land holdings. Some Iximche Kaqchikels seem also to have been relocated to the same towns. After their relocation some of the Chajoma <b>drifted</b> <b>back</b> to their pre-conquest centres, creating informal settlements and provoking hostilities with the Poqomam of Mixco and Chinautla along the former border between the pre-Columbian kingdoms. Some of these settlements eventually received official recognition, such as San Raimundo near Sacul.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the British Band, and the Fox, Kickapoo, Sauk, Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi that later joined them, {{suffered}} unknown numbers of dead during the war. While some died fighting, others were tracked down and killed by Sioux, Menominee, Ho-Chunk, and other native tribes. Still others died of starvation or drowned during the Band's long trek up the Rock River toward {{the mouth of the}} Bad Axe. The entire British Band was not wiped out at Bad Axe; some survivors <b>drifted</b> <b>back</b> home to their villages. This was relatively simple for the Potawatomi and Ho-Chunk of the band. Many Sauk and Fox found return to their homes more difficult, and while some returned safely, others were held in custody by the army. Prisoners, some taken at the Battle of Bad Axe, and others taken by U.S.-aligned Native American tribes in the following weeks, were taken to Fort Armstrong at modern Rock Island, Illinois. About 120 prisoners – men, women, and children – waited until the end of August to be released by General Winfield Scott.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakening}} trend ended {{early on}} September26 and Bonnie regained tropical storm status that afternoon as deep convection re-established itself. Bonnie continued its change in direction, {{turning to the}} southeast at this point as it slowly redeveloped despite being in a high-shear environment. It had also briefly showed signs of becoming extratropical on September27 as it made the turn to the northeast as a weak tropical storm, and was operationally declared extratropical at that point until the afternoon of September28. During that period, Bonnie actually strengthened back into a high-end tropical storm. Bonnie roughly followed Hurricane Charley's path towards the Azores thereafter. The storm became entrenched in an environment with greater wind shear, although it only weakened slightly on September29 as it accelerated towards the northeast. The storm crossed over the Azores on September30 as a strong tropical storm with 65mph (100km/h) winds. After that, Bonnie quickly lost its tropical characteristics and was declared extratropical late that afternoon, {{just east of the}} Azores. The extratropical low <b>drifted</b> <b>back</b> to the southwest in a clockwise loop, actually approaching the Azores once again while dissipating. It dissipated on October2.|$|E

25|$|After {{a half-hour}} of battle Guerrero {{appeared}} to signal {{that it was}} surrendering, but then tried to run off. Nimble resumed the pursuit, even though the ships were entering shallower water. At about 7:30 PM Guerrero hit a reef while sailing at close to ten knots. The impact tore the hull open and toppled the masts. Forty-one of the Africans confined in the hold were drowned as Guerrero sank. Nimble tried to turn away, but five minutes later it also ran onto a reef. Although its crew managed to get Nimble off the reef, it <b>drifted</b> <b>back</b> onto the reef, and a receding tide left it there, about two-and-one-half miles (four km) from the wreck of Guerrero.|$|E

25|$|The puddlers in the union's {{ironworker}} locals {{attempted to}} secede in 1907. Angered at the union's decline {{and the way}} national leaders ignored their interests, the puddlers had retained membership throughout the battles with Carnegie and U.S. Steel. Adopting their old Sons of Vulcan name, about 1,250 of the AA's 2,250 puddlers left the union. But the secession did not last. The Sons of Vulcan won recognition from the Lockhart Iron and Steel Company of McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. But when the new union demanded a massive wage hike in 1910, the union was forced to strike. After the successful strike, fights broke out between returning union members and strikebreakers who had stayed in the plant. The company slowly replaced all the strikers. Weakened, the Sons of Vulcan soon lost recognition at Youngstown Sheet and Tube, and at the A.M. Byers ironworks. The secessionists slowly <b>drifted</b> <b>back</b> into the AA.|$|E

25|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere on record, {{as well as the}} strongest to make landfall in the Southern Hemisphere. Winston is also the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the South Pacific basin. The system was first noted as a tropical disturbance on 7February2016, when it was located to the northwest of Port Vila, Vanuatu. Over the next few days, the system gradually developed as it moved southeast, acquiring gale-force winds by 11February. The following day, it underwent rapid intensification and attained ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph). Less favourable environmental conditions prompted weakening thereafter. After turning northeast on 14 February, Winston stalled to the north of Tonga on 17February. Due to a change in higher level steering, the storm <b>drifted</b> <b>back</b> to the west. In the process, Winston again rapidly intensified, reaching Category5 intensity on both the Australian tropical cyclone scale and the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on 19February. The storm passed directly over Vanua Balavu, where a national record wind gust of 306km/h (190mph) was observed.|$|E

Beck sat on the songs, not wanting {{to talk about his}} {{personal}} life; he later said that he wanted to focus on music and [...] "not really strew my baggage across the public lobby". Eventually, however, he decided the songs spoke to a common experience (a relationship breakup), and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them. In 2001, Beck <b>drifted</b> <b>back</b> to the songs and called producer Nigel Godrich.|$|E

40|$|DC photoguns {{are used}} to produce high-quality, high-intensity {{electron}} beams for accelerator driven applications. Ion bombardment {{is believed to be}} the major cause of degradation of the photocathode efficiency. Additionally to ions produced in the accelerating cathode-anode gap, the electron beam can ionize the residual gas in the transport line. These ions are trapped transversely within the beam and can <b>drift</b> <b>back</b> to the accelerating gap and contribute to the bombardment rate of the cathode. This paper proposes a method to reduce the flow of ions produced in the beam transport line and <b>drifting</b> <b>back</b> to the cathode-anode gap by introducing a positive potential barrier that repels the trapped ions. The reduced ion bombardment rate and increased life time of photocathodes will reduce the downtime required to service photoinjectors and associated costs...|$|R
