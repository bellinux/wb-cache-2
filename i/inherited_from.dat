5|$|Beauchamp and the Bishop of Worcester had {{a dispute}} over the lands that Beauchamp <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> d'Abetot. The dispute caused the two sides {{to agree to the}} {{creation}} of the Worcester Survey, a land survey undertaken in Worcestershire sometime between 1108 and 1118 that shows changes in land ownership after the Domesday Book.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} known monotremes was Teinolophos, which lived about 120 million years ago in Australia. Monotremes have some features which may be <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> the original amniotes such as the same orifice to urinate, defecate and reproduce (cloaca) – as lizards and birds also do – and they lay eggs which are leathery and uncalcified.|$|E
5|$|Onneca {{was thus}} the {{paternal}} grandmother of Abd-ar-Rahman III, who <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> {{her as well}} as from his mother Muzna hailing from the Pyrenees (probably a Basque) European facial features such as blue eyes and light reddish hair that he attempted to alter (notably through hair coloring) in order to look more typically Arab.|$|E
5|$|A {{haplotype}} is a {{group of}} genes found in an organism that is <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> one of its parents. A haplogroup {{is a group}} of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> their common ancestor. The mDNA haplotypes of the golden jackal form two haplogroups: the oldest haplogroup is formed by golden jackals from India, and the other, younger, haplogroup diverging from this includes golden jackals from all of the other regions. Indian golden jackals exhibit the highest genetic diversity, and those from northern and western India are the most basal, which indicates that India was the center from which golden jackals spread. The extant golden jackal lineage commenced expanding its population in India 37,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, the warmer regions of India and Southeast Asia provided a refuge when compared with the surrounding areas. At the end of the Last Glacial Maximum {{and the beginning of the}} warming cycles, the golden jackal lineage expanded out of India and into Eurasia to reach the Middle East and Europe.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the common}} law, extra-marital or illegitimate {{children}} were not qualified to <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> their father’s intestate estate, but could <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> that of their mother. There {{is no longer any}} distinction between legitimate and extra-marital children; both are now in the same position.|$|R
2500|$|Structures {{require some}} {{more work than}} classes. For example, you need to {{explicitly}} create a default constructor which takes no arguments to initialize the struct and its members. The compiler will create a default one for classes. All fields and properties of a struct must have been initialized before an instance is created. Structs do not have finalizers and cannot <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> another class like classes do. However, they <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> , that <b>inherits</b> <b>from</b> [...] Structs {{are more suitable for}} smaller constructs of data.|$|R
50|$|Interfaces can <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> other {{interfaces}} {{just like}} classes. Unlike classes it {{is allowed to}} <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> multiple interfaces. However, {{it is possible that}} several interfaces have a field with the same name, in which case it becomes a single ambiguous member, which cannot be accessed.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{conflicts}} occurred between the Empire and its neighbors. Brazil experienced no serious conflicts {{with its neighbors}} {{to the north and}} west, due to the buffer of the nearly impenetrable and sparsely populated Amazonian rainforest. In the south, however, the colonial disputes <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> Portugal and Spain over the control of the navigable rivers and plains which formed the frontiers continued after independence. The lack of mutually agreed borders in this area led to several international conflicts, from the Cisplatine War to the Paraguayan War.|$|E
5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are {{due in part}} to {{variations in}} its genotype (particular set of genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of a gene (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> each parent.|$|E
5|$|All the {{foregoing}} rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, {{on the view}} that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking,...|$|E
50|$|The Maryland slayer rule is harsher {{than most}} other states. In {{addition}} to prohibiting murderers <b>from</b> <b>inheriting</b> <b>from</b> their victims, Maryland's slayer rule prohibits anyone else <b>from</b> <b>inheriting</b> <b>from</b> murder victims through their murderers; Maryland's Slayer Rule is thus similar in structure to corruption of blood.|$|R
5000|$|Singleness: Using single inheritance, a {{subclass}} can <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> {{only one}} superclass. Continuing the example given above, [...] {{can be either}} a [...] or an , but not both. Using multiple inheritance partially solves this problem, as one can then define a [...] class that <b>inherits</b> <b>from</b> both [...] and [...] However, in most implementations, it can still <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> each superclass only once, and thus, does not support cases in which a student has two jobs or attends two institutions. The inheritance model available in Eiffel makes this possible through support for repeated inheritance.|$|R

5|$|As {{support for}} {{multiple}} instruction set architectures complicates symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support, DragonFly BSD now limits its {{support to the}} x86-64 platform. DragonFly originally ran on the x86 architecture, however as of version 4.0 {{it is no longer}} supported. Since version 1.10, DragonFly supports 1:1 userland threading (one kernel thread per userland thread), which is regarded as a relatively simple solution that is also easy to maintain. <b>Inherited</b> <b>from</b> FreeBSD, DragonFly also supports multi-threading.|$|E
5|$|Before version 3.0, Python had {{two kinds}} of classes: old-style and new-style. The syntax of both styles is the same, the {{difference}} being whether the class object is <b>inherited</b> <b>from,</b> directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.|$|E
5|$|By the 4th century BC, the {{military}} formations the Romans had <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> the Etruscans {{were still in}} use. Though their efficiency was doubtful, they proved effective against Rome's largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help from Rome. The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked a full-scale attack on Rome and the entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia.|$|E

In general, angiosperms <b>inherit</b> plastids <b>from</b> the female gamete, whereas many gymnosperms <b>inherit</b> plastids <b>from</b> the male pollen. Algae also <b>inherit</b> plastids <b>from</b> only one parent. The plastid DNA {{of the other}} parent is, thus, completely lost.|$|R
5|$|Descriptions of Imogen as a {{small child}} {{indicate}} that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> her mother. In 1912, {{at the age of}} five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Holidays were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Hwa Chong Junior College was {{established}} in 1974 at the Bukit Timah campus of The Chinese High School as a separate institution offering pre-university education. <b>Inherited</b> <b>from</b> the pre-university section of The Chinese High School, it come under the same management board as The Chinese High. The college was the government-aided junior college, with its name being an abbreviation of the high school's Chinese name to mark {{the relationship between the}} two schools.|$|E

5|$|JAL Flight Academy (JFA) was {{established}} by Japan Airlines (JAL) in August 1989, as a flight training school subsidiary based at Omura Airport, Nagasaki. It provided conversion training for its flight engineers to become pilots. In April 1991, a new division of JFA was created to operate scheduled services to succeed the troubled Nishi Seto Airlink services, a commuter airline serving cities in western Japan.

5|$|Kingship had its ritual aspects. The {{kings of}} Dál Riata were inaugurated by putting their {{foot in a}} {{footprint}} carved in stone, signifying that they would {{follow in the footsteps}} of their predecessors. The kingship of the unified kingdom of Alba had Scone and its sacred stone at the heart of its coronation ceremony, which historians presume was <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> Pictish practices. Iona, the early centre of Scottish Christianity, became the burial site of the early kings of Scotland until the eleventh century, when the House of Canmore adopted Dunfermline near Scone.|$|E
5|$|Military {{architecture}} was {{the supreme}} {{expression of the}} Ayyubid period, {{as well as an}} eagerness to fortify the restoration of Sunni Islam, especially in a previously Shia-dominated Egypt by constructing Sunni madrasas. The most radical change Saladin implemented in Egypt was the enclosure of Cairo and al-Fustat within one city wall. Some of the techniques of fortification were learned from the Crusaders, such as curtain walls following the natural topography. Many were also <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> the Fatimids like machicolations and round towers, while other techniques were developed simultaneously by the Ayyubids, particularly concentric planning.|$|E
