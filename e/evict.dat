A dispute between Bufton and Bird led to a fight at Bird's law offices, during which he was shot in the mouth and taken to intensive care on 16 December 1997; this followed Bird speaking up for the Buftons' cause before voting in support of a motion to allow the police to <b>evict</b> them, using force if necessary.

40|$|Eviction {{of people}} for {{establishment}} of protected areas is often accompanied with negative consequences to the livelihoods of the <b>evicted.</b> This study assessed the eviction process {{and its effects on}} the socio-ecological resilience of the <b>evicted,</b> examined coping strategies for the <b>evicted</b> and analysed socio-economic factors that affected socio-ecological resilience of people <b>evicted</b> for establishment of Uluguru Nature Reserve in Morogoro, Tanzania. The results show that most of the <b>evicted</b> did not receive eviction notice prior to eviction nor proper training on how to cope with the eviction. There was also low involvement of the <b>evicted</b> in planning the eviction. Most of the <b>evicted</b> had low ability to reorganize themselves after the eviction. Provision of casual labour was mostly adopted by the <b>evicted</b> as a coping strategy after the eviction because they could not adopt other coping strategies. This resulted in reduced income and certainty of livelihood. Male respondents were better informed and better able to reorganise than female respondents. It is recommended that eviction planning should be participatory and include provision of appropriate prior information to the to-be <b>evicted</b> in a gender-considerate manner in order to enhance their socio-ecological resilience in the face of eviction.
