50|$|Fern Valley is a Y-shaped {{valley in}} the parish of St Lawrence. Wildlife found here {{includes}} red squirrels and <b>Jersey</b> <b>Tiger</b> moths (Euplagia quadripunctaria).|$|E
50|$|Vápenice is also {{important}} from an entomological point of view. There live a number of insects dependent on the local shrub-steppe grasslands. Some of notable species which were observed here are for example European Mantis (Mantis religiosa) and butterfly <b>Jersey</b> <b>Tiger</b> (Euplagia quadripunctaria).|$|E
50|$|His {{break-out}} performances as a kickboxer came while {{representing the}} New <b>Jersey</b> <b>Tigers</b> in the World Combat League in the 2007-08 season. On May 3, 2008, he defeated K-1 veteran Pat Barry at the WCL Eastern & Western Conference Finals in San Antonio, Texas, the biggest feat {{of his career}} at that point.|$|R
50|$|Carpenter {{resumed his}} {{coaching}} career in 1962, taking {{a job as}} the {{head coach of the}} Indianapolis Warriors, a team in the United Football League. He spent most of the 1960s coaching in the UFL and CFL, a pair of smaller leagues that struggled to compete with the NFL and AFL. In 1968, however, he joined the NFL's Washington Redskins as an assistant coach after his former Browns teammate Otto Graham became head coach. He left that job the following year and was coach of the <b>Jersey</b> <b>Tigers</b> in the minor-league Atlantic Coast Football League for two seasons.|$|R
50|$|Jarrell Miller (born July 15, 1988) is an American boxer and kickboxer who competes in the Heavyweight division. Known for his {{aggressive}} fighting style, Miller initially began {{training in}} Muay Thai {{as a way}} to defend himself on the streets. He came to prominence in 2007 when he competed for the New <b>Jersey</b> <b>Tigers</b> in the World Combat League and made it to the finals of the New York Golden Gloves tournament that same year. In 2012, he began fighting in K-1. Undefeated in boxing (19 wins, 1 draw), his only two defeats in kickboxing (21 wins, 2 losses) came against Mirko Cro Cop.|$|R
50|$|Euplagia quadripunctaria, the <b>Jersey</b> <b>tiger,</b> is a day-flying moth of {{the family}} Erebidae. The adult {{wingspan}} is 52 - 65 mm, and they fly from July to September, depending on the location. They tend to fly close to Eupatorium cannabinum, where they are hard to notice because of their camouflage.|$|E
50|$|The valley, rich in {{flora and}} fauna, takes {{its name from}} the large number of {{butterfly}} species found here. Scientists recorded some 147 flora species belonging to 54 families and 105 butterfly species from 15 families native to the valley. The butterfly species include the <b>Jersey</b> <b>tiger</b> (Euplagia quadripunctaria rhodosensis). Butterflies of many varieties {{in a wide range of}} colors can be observed in the valley between June and September.|$|E
50|$|The Petaloudes Valley (sometimes {{known as}} Valley of the Butterflies) {{is home to}} {{thousands}} of the Rhodes subspecies of the <b>Jersey</b> <b>Tiger</b> Moth (Euplagia quadripunctaria rhodosensis) that cover the entire landscape after the wet season (late May) due to the high humidity in the area. The Oriental Sweetgum trees in Petaloudes Valley give off a scent that attracts the moths and creates a unique biotope. Due to the increased amount of visitors, the Euplagia are facing population issues as they have no stomach and when disturbed tend to fly frequently and thus deplete their energy.|$|E
5|$|The first intercollegiate {{football}} {{game was played}} on November 6, 1869, between the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, then known as the Rutgers Queensmen, and the New <b>Jersey</b> <b>Tigers,</b> now the Princeton Tigers. The game {{was a mixture of}} rugby and soccer, with teams scoring by kicking the ball into the opponent's net. The game slowly developed, with many new and safer rules being added during the early 1870s. The number of schools participating in the sport also grew. However, even with the expansion, Princeton dominated the game, being declared the champion eight times in ten years. Yale was the only team which came close to Princeton, being awarded four championship designations during the same period.|$|R
50|$|From 2003-2007, Lockwood had {{her college}} {{career at the}} Ivy League college, Princeton University in Princeton, New <b>Jersey</b> for the <b>Tigers.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 2005, for {{the first}} time in its history, the NFL lifted the {{blackout}} policies for a team: the New Orleans Saints. Due to damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, the Saints split their home games between Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New <b>Jersey,</b> <b>Tiger</b> Stadium at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, and the Alamodome in San Antonio, with most home games being played in Baton Rouge. Baton Rouge is a secondary market for the Saints and is subject to blackouts when games held at the Superdome carried by over-the-air networks do not sell out, since CBS affiliate WAFB and Fox affiliate WGMB reach within 75 miles of the Superdome, even though the city limits of Baton Rouge are more than 75 miles from the stadium (the Baton Rouge DMA is not subjected to a blackout when Saints games televised by ESPN or the NFL Network do not sell out).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} preventive and protective measures for the <b>Jersey</b> <b>tiger</b> on the territory administered by the State Forests National Holding. On the basis of the natural and forest inventory a characteristics of biotopes was determined, in which the images were most often found. It was concluded that in most of the refugia <b>Jersey</b> <b>tiger</b> occurs in tight forest complexes, as well as that the hemp-agrimony (Eupatorium cannabinum L.) was the most important nectar giving plant for the images of Euplagia quadripunctaria at over 50 % of locations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTourism {{sector has}} been one of the leading sectors growing and {{developing}} most all around the world. However, it has been an incontrovertible fact that this development leads to many negative effects in terms of the natural environment, environmental pollution as the leading. Protected areas which are one of the protection statues as a requirement of providing sustainable use of our natural and cultural values have been exposed to several negative effects in regions where tourism is intense. Butterflies Valley located near Faralya Village as one of the bays in eastern coasts of Ölüdeniz-Belcekız Bay on 12 km south of Muğla province Fethiye district takes its name from more than 80 butterfly species and especially from “Euplagia quadripunctaria” (<b>jersey</b> <b>tiger).</b> Butterflies Valley which was declared as the 1 st degree natural protected area on 8 th February, 1995 and closed to any kinds of settlement has had a rich flora. Within the valley, there have been nearly 150 plant species of families more than 50. In this study, the tourism pressure in Butterflies Valley grabbing the attention through the spectacular natural views, the biodiversity it has and its wilderness was analyzed and the required precautions that should be taken to provide the sustainable use of Butterflies Valley were mentioned...|$|E
50|$|September 2015 {{also saw}} the {{announcement}} of a three-year sponsorship agreement with Brydens Lawyers. The three year multimillion-dollar deal was {{the largest in the}} clubs history and saw Brydons logo on the front and sleeve of the Wests <b>Tigers</b> <b>jerseys.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After the 1995 rule change, {{on three}} {{occasions}} LSU {{was forced to}} wear colored <b>jerseys</b> at <b>Tiger</b> Stadium. The first time was in 1996 against Vanderbilt, who was still angry at LSU for hiring Gerry DiNardo, who left Vanderbilt to become LSU's head coach after the 1994 season. LSU wore gold jerseys for that game (a 35-0 LSU victory), and fans were encouraged to wear white {{in an effort to}} [...] "white out" [...] the Commodores. The other was in 2004 when Oregon State did not want to suffer in its black jerseys due to the humid weather of Louisiana in late summer, thus forcing LSU to wear its purple jerseys for a nationally televised game on ESPN. On October 10, 2015, LSU was scheduled to play a road conference game at South Carolina, but due to massive flooding in the state of South Carolina, the game was relocated from Columbia to Baton Rouge. Despite the game being played at Tiger Stadium, South Carolina was still the designated home team and had first choice of jersey selection. South Carolina chose to wear white as they had originally planned, forcing LSU to wear their purple <b>jerseys</b> at <b>Tiger</b> Stadium for an SEC game {{for the first time since}} 1994.|$|R
5000|$|The Tiger Inn (or [...] "T.I." [...] {{as it is}} colloquially known) is one of {{the eleven}} active eating clubs at Princeton University in Princeton, New <b>Jersey.</b> [...] <b>Tiger</b> Inn [...] was founded in 1890 and {{is one of the}} [...] "Big Four" [...] eating clubs at Princeton (the others are The Ivy Club, University Cottage Club, and Cap and Gown Club), the four oldest and most prestigious on campus.

50|$|A new company, Telford Tigers Ice Hockey Club (1990) {{reformed}} {{the team}} for next season. A year later, former NHLer Jere Gillis took over the coaching role from Taylor (who carried on as a managing director). By now, the junior programme was starting to pay dividends, with local youngsters Geoff Lane,Darren Broome, Norman Pinnington and Mark Hazlehurst all pulling on <b>Tigers</b> <b>jerseys</b> in the mid 1980s and early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Billy Barlow, {{the star}} player of Montreal {{was not able}} to play and Clarence McKerrow took his place. McKerrow had not played any games for Montreal, and could be {{considered}} a ringer, but there was no protest from Queen's. The Queen's team, although described as looking fast in their <b>tiger</b> <b>jerseys,</b> were no match for Montreal and the game proved uninteresting. R. McLennan of Queen's would later play for Dawson City in its 1905 challenge of Ottawa.|$|R
5000|$|Prior {{to these}} accomplishments, however, Tiger seemed {{condemned}} to poor management and a resulting lack of exposure. In 1957, using Liverpool as his fighting base, Dick Tiger was fighting on undercards for small purses, when by fortune, facing off against popular favorite Terry Downes at Shoreditch Town Hall, {{he walked away}} with a TKO after 6 heats. [...] New management saw to it certain [...] "errors in his style" [...] were corrected, and in another year, Tiger had taken 17 of 19 fights and won the British Middleweight title. In 1959, handled by the independent <b>Jersey</b> Jones, <b>Tiger</b> came to America, to face adversity in a whole, new way. Jersey Jones, resisting the influences of Madison Square Garden, brokered deals for Tiger by himself, which in the short run, cost them both. In an independent promotion at Edmonton, Alberta, Tiger's Empire belt was lost in a more-than questionable 15 round nod to local challenger Wilf Greaves. The decision as rendered, had first been called a draw; appalled, Jones demanded a recount of the cards, which boomeranged, showing the fight, dominated by Tiger, as a win for Greaves. Tiger, sincere and honorable in his dealings, often found this virtuous approach not reciprocated, particularly in North America.|$|R
25|$|The {{last two}} front-engined Tigers {{known to have}} been {{rebodied}} were two completed by Vernon Priaulx, then coachbuilder for Guernseybus in 1991/2. After the success of open top RT-type AEC Regent III on tourist routes on Guernsey two former <b>Jersey</b> Motor Transport <b>Tiger</b> PS1s were purchased. Their Reading of Portsmouth bodies were too decayed to be restored so the first Tiger was rebodied as a single-deck open topper (Southport Corporation had used Ribble PS2s as such in the 1960s) and the second became a 35-seat coach with full-length sunshine roof. Both went to Mac Tours of Edinburgh after Guernseybus closed and passed to the Ensignbus preserved fleet, although the open topper is to operate a tourist service back on Jersey in 2012. On repatriation to Jersey it was registered J1942.|$|R
