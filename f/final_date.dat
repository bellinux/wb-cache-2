5|$|No {{immediate}} {{effort was}} made to start the works and they were postponed indefinitely when World War I started. With wartime restrictions in place, construction work for the railway was prevented. Yearly extensions to the earlier E acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922, giving a <b>final</b> <b>date</b> by which compulsory purchases had to be made of 7 August 1924. Although the permissions had been maintained, the UERL could not raise the money needed for the works.

40|$|The <b>final</b> warming <b>date</b> of {{the polar}} vortex is a key {{component}} of Southern Hemisphere stratospheric and tropospheric variability in spring and summer. We examine the effect of external forcings on Southern Hemisphere <b>final</b> warming <b>date,</b> and the sensitivity of any projected changes to model representation of the stratosphere. <b>Final</b> warming <b>date</b> is calculated using a temperature-based diagnostic for ensembles of high- and low-top CMIP 5 models, under the CMIP 5 historical, RCP 4. 5, and RCP 8. 5 forcing scenarios. The <b>final</b> warming <b>date</b> in the models is generally too late in comparison with those from reanalyses: around two weeks too late in the low-top ensemble, and around one week too late in the high-top ensemble. Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is used to analyse past and future change in <b>final</b> warming <b>date.</b> Both the low- and high-top ensemble show characteristic behaviour expected in response to changes in greenhouse gas and stratospheric ozone concentrations. In both ensembles, under both scenarios, an increase in <b>final</b> warming <b>date</b> is seen between 1850 and 2100, with the latest dates occurring in the early twenty-first century, associated with the minimum in stratospheric ozone concentrations in this period. However, this response is more pronounced in the high-top ensemble. The high-top models show a delay in <b>final</b> warming <b>date</b> in RCP 8. 5 that is not produced by the low-top models, which are shown to be less responsive to greenhouse gas forcing. This suggests that {{it may be necessary to}} use stratosphere resolving models to accurately predict Southern Hemisphere surface climate change. ...|$|R
