5000|$|He {{shows that}} {{the first and the}} third of these can be {{expressed}} as a resistance times the current, R1I. As for the second, the difference between the quasi-Fermi levels at the junction, he says that we can estimate the current flowing through the diode from this difference. He points out that the current at the p terminal is all holes, whereas at the n terminal it is all electrons, and the sum of these two is the constant total current. So the total current is equal to the decrease in <b>hole</b> <b>current</b> {{from one side of the}} diode to the other. This decrease is due to an excess of recombination of electron-hole pairs over generation of electron-hole pairs. The rate of recombination is equal to the rate of generation when at equilibrium, that is, when the two quasi-Fermi levels are equal. But when the quasi-Fermi levels are not equal, then the recombination rate is [...] times the rate of generation. We then assume that most of the excess recombination (or decrease in <b>hole</b> <b>current)</b> takes place in a layer going by one hole diffusion length (Lp) into the n material and one electron diffusion length (Ln) into the p material, and that the difference between the quasi-Fermi levels is constant in this layer at VJ. Then we find that the total current, or the drop in <b>hole</b> <b>current,</b> is ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>current</b> <b>hole</b> {{region in}} the tokamak has been {{observed}} to arise naturally during the development of internal transport barriers. The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) potential energy in the <b>current</b> <b>hole</b> region is shown to be determined completely {{in terms of the}} displacements {{at the edge of the}} <b>current</b> <b>hole.</b> For modes with finite toroidal mode number n {ne} 0, the minimized potential energy is the same as if the <b>current</b> <b>hole</b> region were a vacuum region. For modes with toroidal mode number n = 0, the displacement is a superposition of three types of independent displacements: a vertical displacement or displacements that compress only the plasma or the toroidal field uniformly. Thus for ideal MHD perturbations of plasma with a <b>current</b> <b>hole,</b> the plasma behaves as if it were bordered by an extra ''internal vacuum region''. The relevance of the present work to computer simulations of plasma with a <b>current</b> <b>hole</b> region is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|The current {{which will}} flow in an {{intrinsic}} semiconductor consists of both electron and <b>hole</b> <b>current.</b> That is, the electrons {{which have been}} freed from their lattice positions into the conduction band can move through the material. In addition, other electrons can hop between lattice positions to fill the vacancies left by the freed electrons. This additional mechanism is called hole conduction because {{it is as if}} the holes are migrating across the material in the direction opposite to the free electron movement. The current flow in an intrinsic semiconductor is influenced by the density of energy states which in turn influences the electron density in the conduction band. This current is highly temperature dependent.|$|E
50|$|Another {{benefit of}} the high-field domain is the direct {{connection}} of any p-type emitter through a copper-doped thin CdS layer directly to an electron-blocking electrode through which the holes are extracted, and the open circuit voltage is increased to approach the theoretical limit of the band gap or the emitter at 0K. Because in the CdS the <b>hole</b> <b>current</b> is now carried by drift only, we can finally draw the band model of a typical solar cell. e.g. the CdS/CdTe cell as given in Fig. 11.For {{the first time we}} can replace the estimate of the band connection of abrupt hetero-junctions from the difference of electron affinities by calculating it from the continuity of the majority carrier current, with the only small discontinuity left by the difference of the effective masses of the carriers at the different carrier bands.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} organic {{semiconductors}} are, in principle, insulators but become semiconducting when charge carriers are injected from the electrode(s) {{was discovered by}} Kallmann and Pope. They found that a <b>hole</b> <b>current</b> can flow through an anthracene crystal contacted with a positively biased electrolyte containing iodine that {{can act as a}} hole injector. This work was stimulated by the earlier discovery by Akamatu et al. that aromatic hydrocarbons become conductive when blended with molecular iodine because a charge transfer complex is formed. Since it was readily realized that the crucial parameter that controls injection is the work-function of the electrode, it was straightforward to replace the electrolyte by a solid metallic or semiconducting contact with an appropriate work-function. When both electrons and holes are injected from opposite contacts they can recombine radiatively and emit electroluminescence. It was observed in organic crystals in 1965 by Sano et al.|$|E

For that the radial extent of the plasma core area with zero rotational transform is used as a characteristic parameter. The modification of the fast ion orbit topology, as caused by the <b>current</b> <b>hole,</b> is studied.

5000|$|The concept {{involves}} drilling a borehole about 5 km {{down into}} the Earth's crust. High level waste, like spent nuclear fuel, would be sealed in strong steel containers and lowered down the borehole, filling the bottom one or two kilometers of the <b>hole.</b> <b>Current</b> technology limits {{the diameter of the}} borehole to less than 50 centimeters. This means that some waste currently stored in large containers would need to be repackaged in smaller containers. The rest of the borehole is then sealed with appropriate materials, including clay, cement, crushed rock backfill, and asphalt, to ensure a low-permeability barrier between the waste and the land surface. In some concepts, waste may be surrounded by cementitious grout or a highly compacted bentonite buffer matrix to provide improved containment and to reduce the effect of rock movement on the canisters' integrity. A high-temperature scenario involves very young hot waste in the containers which releases enough heat to create a melt zone around the borehole. As the waste decays and cools, the melt zone resolidifies, forming a solid granite sarcophagus around the containers, entombing the waste forever. [...] Under both scenarios, chemically reducing conditions adjacent to the borehole will reduce the transport of most radionuclides.|$|E

The C-AFM hole-current images clearly showed two phases: an electrically conductive region assigned to the P 3 HT-rich donor domain and a nonconductive region assigned to the PF 12 TBT-rich acceptor domain. The <b>hole</b> <b>current</b> in the conductive region was small {{compared with that of}} a neat P 3 HT film with similar thickness, indicating that the P 3 HT-rich domain contained a large fraction of PF 12 TBT as a minor component. Thermal annealing initially increased the <b>hole</b> <b>current</b> throughout the P 3 HT-rich domain because of reorganization of the P 3 HT chains from their as-cast configurations. Further annealing increased the <b>hole</b> <b>current</b> mainly {{in the middle of the}} P 3 HT-rich domain, but it decreased the <b>hole</b> <b>current</b> in the boundary areas close to the PF 12 TBT-rich domain owing to the presence of an intermixed region with a gradient of the P 3 HT/PF 12 TBT composition ratio. After annealing at temperatures above the glass-transition point of PF 12 TBT, the widths of the intermixed regions decreased to ∼ 30 nm as phase separation proceeded with decomposition of the intermixed region.
