It was the first split in the repeal movement and she lost many personal supporters because of her stance. The bill faced too much opposition from the parliamentary supporters of the Contagious Diseases Acts, and was withdrawn.|$|E

We believe that by introducing a systematic approach for exploring alternative policies we can improve the decomposition of these problems, decrease the required time for analysis and formulate more effective polices. A case in policy formulation and analysis in the transport sector for achieving CO 2 emission targets in the UK is presented; this solution is based on a previously proposed framework (Taeihagh et al., 2009 a). The results obtained from the analysis of policy measures and their relations are used in the formulation of policy alternatives (packages and clusters) through the application of agent-based modelling. The results have the potential to further promote the use of computational approaches in the formulation of polices through the development of software systems that can support the design of policies for different sectors and <b>geographical</b> <b>scopes...</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{the domain}} of cyber-physical systems, events are viewed as {{conditions}} of interest [30] within a cyber-physical system, or as the co-occurrence of {{two people in the}} same physical place [31]. In general, events are modeled according to the state of the objects in the system, considering attributes, time and location. The work presented by Tan et al. [30] bears certain similarities with our own, {{in the sense that they}} considered an event to encompasses multiple information about a condition of interest in the system (in our case in the online social network), including time and physical locations. In addition, the authors defined different kinds of temporal and <b>geographical</b> <b>scopes</b> for their events, which are similar to our definition of event impact. The main difference relies in that our approach aims to capture high-level information of how a complex exogenous event, such as a news event, is perceived by social network users in an aggregated way. Therefore, we focus on geopolitical divisions as units of aggregated spatial information and on representing geopolitical interactions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Existing {{approaches}} to service discovery {{have been developed}} primarily for environments with a fixed network backbone and typically rely on centralized components being accessible to potential service clients at any given time. The characteristic lack of a designated service infrastructure {{in combination with the}} highly dynamic nature of the underlying network topology renders such discovery mechanisms unsuitable for mobile ad hoc environments. This paper presents an approach to the discovery of ad hoc services that exploits the fact that the relevance of such services is often limited to specific <b>geographical</b> <b>scopes.</b> Service providers define the areas (proximities) in which their services are available. Clients register interest in specific services and are subsequently informed whenever they enter a proximity within which these services are available. Since ad hoc services can be stationary or may be moving with the location of their mobile providers our approach supports discovery of services with fixed locations as well as of those that migrate with their providers. Our approach has been implemented as a push-based proximity discovery service and its evaluation demonstrates that it is well suited for highly dynamic networks as it maintains neither routes nor overlay network topologies. ...|$|R

Development in this area has given rise to issues and challenges, including the overlapping of legal and <b>geographical</b> <b>scopes</b> of different air passenger protection instruments. Over the last decades, several air passenger protection regimes have developed across the world, in particular on international, European Union and national level. But does the patchwork work? The history of multilateral regulation in the field of international air transport with regard to air passenger rights could be said to have begun in 1929 when the Warsaw Convention was originally signed. The importance of the convention lies in unification of the rules concerning the documents of carriage and the liability of air carriers. In 1955 the Warsaw Convention was amended by the Hague Protocol, which substantially redrafted, modernized and simplified rules relating to the documents of carriage as well as doubled the limit of carrier liability with respect to persons. The Warsaw Convention's application was subsequently extended to the carriers actually performing the transport by air when a passenger [...] ...|$|R

500|$|The Court {{agreed with}} Malaysia that the Johor Sultanate had {{original}} title to Pedra Branca, rejecting Singapore's {{argument that the}} island was terra nullius. It found it was not disputed that Johor had established itself as a sovereign state with a certain territorial domain in Southeast Asia since it came into existence in 1512. As Pedra Branca had always been known as a navigational hazard in the Singapore Strait, which was a vital channel for international navigation in east-west trade between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, it was inconceivable that the island had remained undiscovered by the local community. It was therefore reasonable to infer that Pedra Branca lay within the general <b>geographical</b> <b>scope</b> of the Johor Sultanate. Further, during {{the existence of the}} old Johor Sultanate, {{there was no evidence of}} any competing claims over the islands in the Singapore Strait. It also agreed with Malaysia's submission that descriptions of the relationship between the Sultan of Johor and the Orang Laut in 19th-century official British reports proved that the Sultan exercised sovereign authority over the Orang Laut. Since the Orang Laut made the islands in the Singapore Strait their habitat, this confirmed the [...] "ancient original title" [...] of the Johor Sultanate to those islands, including Pedra Branca. As regards Singapore's argument that the traditional concept of Malay sovereignty was based on control over people rather than territory, the Court observed that sovereignty comprises control over both persons and territory. However, it was not necessary to deal with the point further as it had already found that Johor had territorial sovereignty over Pedra Branca.|$|E

40|$|Europe is {{severely}} affected by alien invasions, which impact biodiversity, ecosystem services, economy, and human health. A {{large number of}} national, regional, and global online databases provide information on the distribution, pathways of introduction, and impacts of alien species. The sufficiency and efficiency of the current online information systems to assist the European policy on alien species was investigated by a comparative analysis of occurrence data across 43 online databases. Large differences among databases were found which are partially explained by variations in their taxonomical, environmental, and <b>geographical</b> <b>scopes</b> {{but also by the}} variable efforts for continuous updates and by inconsistencies on the definition of ‘‘alien’’ or ‘‘invasive’’ species. No single database covered all European environments, countries, and taxonomic groups. In many European countries national databases do not exist, which greatly affects the quality of reported information. To be operational and useful to scientists, managers, and policy makers, online information systems need to be regularly updated through continuous monitoring on a country or regional level. We propose the creation of a network of online interoperable web services through which information in distributed resources can be accessed, aggregated and then used for reporting and further analysis at different geographical and political scales, as an efficient approach to increase the accessibility of information. Harmonization, standardization, conformity on international standards for nomenclature, and agreement on common definitions of alien and invasive species are among the necessary prerequisites. JRC.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} consumer intention to buy original brands and their counterfeits in the Indonesian fashion product market. Specifically, it examines the impact of past purchases (of original brands and their counterfeits), consumer attitudes (toward the economic benefits of counterfeit purchase and hedonic benefits of counterfeit purchase), and personal characteristics (i. e. self-image, materialism, and perceived future social status) on consumer intention to purchase original luxurious fashion brands and their counterfeits. Based on a preliminary study, five brands in five different fashion product items were selected and used for the study. About 170 females aged between 15 and 50 years old living in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY) province participated and filled in the self-administered questionnaires for the current survey. Multiple regression analyses were employed to test the research hypotheses. The results indicated that past purchases and personal characteristics were significant predictors of consumer intention to buy counterfeits, while consumer attitudes toward the hedonic benefits of counterfeit purchase were {{not related to the}} dependent variable. Most antecedents (except materialism and self-image) had significant influences on purchase intention of original brands. Meanwhile, consumer intention to buy counterfeits and consumer intention to purchase original brands have positive reciprocal influences. The main findings suggest that Indonesian consumers are simply willing to buy both originals and counterfeits. It seems that consumer affordability is a real issue to be solved.

2500|$|As a {{field of}} archaeology, Levantine Archaeology {{encompasses}} excavations, salvage, conservation and reconstruction efforts, as well as off-site research, interpretation, and other scholarship. The <b>geographical</b> <b>scope</b> of Levantine archaeology includes Syria, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, Cyprus, and the Hatay Province of Turkey. The terminology for archaeology in the Levant has been defined in various, often competing or overlapping ways. Prior to and {{during the period of}} the British Mandate in Palestine (1920–1948), archaeology of the region was typically described as Palestinian archaeology or Biblical archaeology. Under the influence of William F.

[...] "The archaeology of ancient Israel," [...] is described by Franken and Franken-Battershill as, [...] "but {{a small part of the}} far greater study of Palestinian archaeology [...] " [...] in A Primer of Old Testament Archaeology (1963).

In dealings with the Palestinian Arabs, the British negotiated with the elite rather than the middle or lower classes. They chose Hajj Amin al-Husseini to become Grand Mufti, although {{he was young and}} had received the fewest votes from Jerusalem's Islamic leaders. One of the mufti's rivals, Raghib Bey al-Nashashibi, had already been appointed mayor of Jerusalem in 1920, replacing Musa Kazim, whom the British removed after the Nabi Musa riots of 1920, during which he exhorted the crowd to give their blood for Palestine. During the entire Mandate period, but especially during the latter half, the rivalry between the mufti and al-Nashashibi dominated Palestinian politics. Khalidi ascribes the failure of the Palestinian leaders to enroll mass support, because of their experiences during the Ottoman Empire period, as they were then part of the ruling elite and accustomed to their commands being obeyed. The idea of mobilising the masses was thoroughly alien to them.|$|E
