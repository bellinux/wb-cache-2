30|$|Different {{models for}} {{matching}} grants exist. The Economic Empowerment of Adolescent Girls and Young Women project in Liberia (AGI Liberia) and the Vocational Training for Youths with Disabilities in Western Area and Kono Districts project of Sierra Leone provide <b>grants</b> <b>to</b> encourage <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> save; the programs match any savings the participants accrue during their participation with a seed <b>grant</b> <b>to</b> start their business. Other programs use matching <b>grants</b> <b>to</b> match any outside capital an entrepreneur can access. The Entrepreneurship Program for Innovation in the Caribbean (EPIC) {{is an example}} of this model. Still other programs require entrepreneurs to invest what they already have into the business as a show of commitment. The Congo—Support to Economic Diversification Project uses this model and requires <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> put up some 10 – 20 percent of the financing.|$|R

As the UK and the Netherlands have {{been at the forefront of}} the European activation turn that catalysed the introduction of workfare programmes in European welfare states, the first part of the paper maps the employment protection of workfare participants in these two countries. In the second part of the paper we critically assess the reasons why employment status or, at least, employment protection regardless of status, is not <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> workfare <b>participants</b> and <b>to</b> other persons who are fulfilling financial non-rewarding (at least for the worker herself) ‘work’, such as volunteer workers or persons who have been found guilty of an offence and are sentenced to community service.

50|$|Marikina River is on {{the verge}} of an {{ecological}} imbalance as a strange species of fish has dominated its ecosystem. Since the late 1990s, the Marikina River has been infestated by janitor fish. Before, the river was thriving with local species martiniko, ayungin and biya. The growing fish population has prompted the city government to launch a new program to control their number. The city issued Ordinance 004, series of 2007, launching Janitor Fish Eradication Drive in the City of Marikina, <b>granting</b> cash incentives <b>to</b> <b>participants,</b> appropriating annually fifty thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) for the purpose.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a set {{of three}} privacy-preserving smart {{metering}} data aggregation methods that combine {{the two types of}} approaches, namely, multi-resolution representation and (i) homomorphic encryption; (ii) masking; and (iii) differential privacy, is proposed. This improves the capabilities for managing privacy requirements, as the combination of “traditional” privacy-enhancing methods with multi-resolution representation significantly increases the choices available for both system operator and end-user. We further contribute the sketch of a protocol for distributing keys and for providing distinct resolutions to different parties. Access control does not relate to the aggregated signal as a whole anymore, but access can be granted on the aggregate on each resolution individually. This is an important feature, as it allows <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> access <b>to</b> <b>participants</b> in the smart grid system, based on their roles and the functions they have to fulfill. Each role can be assigned access to the aggregate on the minimum resolution necessary to fulfill the functions associated with this role.|$|R

30|$|Danish {{immigrant}} {{policy was}} progressively {{developed in the}} 1970 s by reforms in different policy areas. The main principle was equal rights in the welfare state with a few targeted measures, such as language training for migrant newcomers and mother-tongue instruction in schools (Vad Jönsson and Petersen, 2012). When refugees began to arrive in larger numbers in the 1980 s the government gave the NGO Danish Refugee Council responsibility for humanitarian migrant newcomers. Introduction activities were mainly {{carried out by the}} Danish Refugee Council, which was authorized <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> social benefits <b>to</b> <b>participants.</b> In 1986 Denmark introduced an 18 -month long integration programme for humanitarian migrants. This programme included language training and civic orientation, but no labour market activities to speak of. After this period responsibility was handed over to the municipalities.|$|R
40|$|Once {{knowledge}} can be analysed in terms of region, domain, implantation, displacement, transposition, one is able to capture the processes by which knowledge functions {{as a form of}} power (Foucault 1980, p. 69). [We] need an earth-wide network of connections, including the ability to partially translate knowledges among very different – and power differentiated – communities. We need the power of modern critical theories of how meanings and bodies get made, not in order to deny meanings and bodies, but in order to live in meanings and bodies that have a chance for a future (Haraway 1991, p. 187). The idea for a conference session on the geography of health knowledges first emerged from shared interests and conversations at the Department of Geography at UCL, in early summer 2002. The practical processes of locating these dialogues within wider academic debates, through organising an AAG conference session in New Orleans for March 2003, involved more conversations, adverts, abstracts, <b>grants,</b> invitations <b>to</b> <b>participants</b> and discussants, and of course, ultimately, presentations.

40|$|This grant {{provided}} partial {{support for}} the 29 th International Symposium on Free Radicals, held August 12 - 17, 2007 at the Big Sky Resort in Big Sky, Montana. This meeting dates back to 1956, and is thepremier international meeting focusing on the structure and dynamics of reactive free radicals. Free radicals and other reactive species remain topics of great interest today owing to the central role they play as reactive intermediates. Of particular relevance to the DOE mission in Basic Energy Sciences {{is the fact that}} nearly all combustion reactions are initiated by radicals, and a number of radical intermediates are important to almost any combusting system. The field has expanded to increasingly focus on the dynamics of radical reactions in addition to spectroscopy and kinetics. As we seek to understand complex environments in combustion, atmospheric chemistry, condensed phase phenomena and the interstellar medium in great detail, studies of free radicals remain essential. The meeting in Montana lived up to the long tradition of this meeting by bringing together leading researchers, including a large group of postdoctoral scholars and graduate students, from around the globe to advance this important area of science. The DOE <b>grant</b> helped <b>to</b> support <b>participant</b> costs (lodging and meals) for 24 invited speakers and 21 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows...|$|R
5000|$|Emperor Joseph II (ruled 1780-90), {{before his}} accession, {{witnessed}} the serfs' wretched existence during three tours of Transylvania. As emperor he launched an energetic reform program. Steeped in {{the teachings of}} the French Enlightenment, he practised [...] "enlightened despotism," [...] or reform from above designed to preempt revolution from below. He brought the empire under strict central control, launched an education program, and instituted religious tolerance, including full civil rights for Orthodox Christians. In 1784, Transylvanian serfs under Horea, Cloşca and Crişan, convinced they had the Emperor's support, rebelled against their feudal masters, sacked castles and manor houses, and murdered about 100 nobles. Joseph ordered the revolt repressed, but <b>granted</b> amnesty <b>to</b> all <b>participants</b> except their leaders, whom the nobles tortured and put to death in front of peasants brought to witness the execution. Joseph, aiming to strike at the rebellion's root causes, emancipated the serfs, annulled Transylvania's constitution, dissolved the Union of Three Nations, and decreed German as the official language of the empire. Hungary's nobles and Catholic clergy resisted Joseph's reforms, and the peasants soon grew dissatisfied with taxes, conscription, and forced requisition of military supplies. Faced with broad discontent, Joseph rescinded many of his initiatives {{toward the end of his}} life.|$|R
