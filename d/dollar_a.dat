5|$|Debs {{attended}} public school, {{dropping out}} of high school at age 14. He took a job with the Vandalia Railroad cleaning grease from the trucks of freight engines for fifty cents a day. He later became a painter and car cleaner in the railroad shops. In December 1871, when a drunken locomotive fireman failed to report for work, Debs was pressed into service as a night fireman. He decided to remain a fireman on the run between Terre Haute and Indianapolis, earning more than a <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> night for the next three and half years.|$|E
5|$|In August 1970, Les Solomon, {{his wife}} and {{daughter}} were on vacation in the southwest and arranged to visit Mims, Roberts and their families. At that time, Dan Meyer and Don Lancaster were among the most prolific authors in Popular Electronics. Meyer had built a million <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> year business that sold kits of parts to build the project that he and Lancaster wrote about. Mims and Roberts wanted to do the same and quizzed Solomon on the kit business. Solomon gave them some statistics but said there was no way of knowing how many kits an article would sell, maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Murphy was a loner with {{mood swings}} and an {{explosive}} temper. He {{grew up in}} Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school. His father drifted {{in and out of}} the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> day to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his oldest sister Corinne and her husband Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.|$|E

5|$|Duhalde, Alfonsín, their parties, {{the unions}} and the Church all agreed to promote {{policies}} {{to increase the}} industrial growth of the country. For this purpose, Duhalde created the ministry of production, with functions that used {{to belong to the}} ministries of economy and foreign relations. The new minister was José Ignacio de Mendiguren, head of the Argentine Industrial Union. Alfonsín negotiated with him, on Duhalde's behalf, while Congress was still voting for the new president. Duhalde announced at his inauguration that he would repeal the convertibility plan, considered the main cause of the economic crisis. Although Menem proposed a full dollarization of the Argentine economy, Duhalde preferred to instead stick to the peso and order a devaluation. Although it was initially expected to make a 40% devaluation, the exchange rate of 1 peso to 1 dollar jumped to 3 pesos to 1 <b>dollar,</b> <b>a</b> 200% devaluation. The higher dollar price allowed for more lucrative exports, increased economic activity and a growth in the employment rates, but at the cost of a higher cost of living.|$|E
25|$|EveryDollar is a {{budgeting}} {{tool that}} was created by Ramsey Solutions, available online, on iOS, and Android. Users list all sources of income and they give every <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> name for the month, based on zero-based budgeting.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of ethnicity, most cowboys {{came from}} lower social classes and the pay was poor.

25|$|One more {{attempt at}} {{reviving}} an old game show {{that was not}} his own originally resulted in an unsold pilot of the 1950s-era game <b>Dollar</b> <b>a</b> Second, hosted by Bob Eubanks. It {{had at least one}} showing on GSN, and has since become part of the collector/trader's circuit. Two more unsold pilots were called Bamboozle and Comedy Courtroom.|$|E
25|$|His {{father was}} a teamster, and {{struggled}} to earn enough money to support the family. In the winter, he ploughed the snow off outdoor skating rinks to earn additional money. Conacher left school after the eighth grade {{to go to work}} and help support his siblings. For ten hours a day, he hauled sod, earning an extra <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> week for his family.|$|E
25|$|Consumers {{were also}} {{unhappy with the}} system. Manipulated prices often forced them to pay {{unexpectedly}} high prices for staple foods. For example, in 1906 and 1907, the price of food skyrocketed mysteriously. Onion prices climbed from 10 cents a pound in 1906 to a <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> pound in 1907 (from US$0.10 to $1.00). By comparison, {{a pair of shoes}} cost $2.00 at the time.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s women's pay was {{one to three}} <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> week and much of that went to living expenses. In the 1900s female tobacco {{strippers}} earned five <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> week, half of what their male coworkers made and seamstresses made six to seven <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> week compared to a cutter's salary of $16.|$|R
5000|$|The Civil War {{program was}} {{transformed}} into a system of old-age pensions for Union veterans. His executive order of 1904 declared that old age itself constituted a disability: “When a claimant has passed the age of sixty-two years he is disabled one-half in ability to perform manual labor and is entitled to be rated at six <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> month; after sixty-five years at eight <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> month; after sixty-eight years at ten <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> month, and after seventy years at twelve <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> month.” This order provided tens of thousands of Union veterans with non-contributory old-age pensions.|$|R

He returned to Bent's Fort several times during his life to again provide meat for the fort's residents.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the main}} forces {{demanding}} the restructuring of management and Labour during this time were the rise of Japan as a major automotive force, and the general recession {{of the world economy}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Aided by the Auto Pact and the weakening Canadian dollar in relation to the United States <b>dollar,</b> <b>a</b> geographic difference developed which provided some relief to many Canadian auto-workers.|$|E
25|$|Absolute poverty {{refers to}} a set {{standard}} which is consistent over time and between countries. First introduced in 1990, the <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> day poverty line measured absolute poverty {{by the standards of}} the world's poorest countries. The World Bank defined the new international poverty line as $1.25 a day in 2008 for 2005 (equivalent to $1.00 a day in 1996 US prices). In October 2015, they reset it to $1.90 a day.|$|E

The Battle of Atlanta, July 22 to September 2, 1864, ended with the city's surrender. The U.S. Army under General William T.

25|$|The overall {{decline in}} food supplies, {{made worse by}} the {{inadequate}} transportation system, led to serious shortages and high prices in urban areas. When bacon reached a <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> pound in 1863, the poor women of Richmond, Atlanta and many other cities began to riot; they broke into shops and warehouses to seize food. The women expressed their anger at ineffective state relief efforts, speculators, and merchants. As wives and widows of soldiers they were hurt by the inadequate welfare system.|$|E

In 1945, Duke began a short-lived career as a foreign correspondent for the International News Service, reporting from different cities across the war-ravaged Europe. After the war, she moved to Paris and wrote for the magazine Harper's Bazaar.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} World War I, the Morse {{company had}} {{developed}} a relatively sophisticated labor relations culture. The company had its own simple health insurance scheme into which each employee paid 20 cents a week, which entitled him to pay of one <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> day when sick, and $100 to his family {{in the event of}} his death. The company also ran a shipfitters' school for those employees interested in improving their skills. In its first few months of operation, the school attracted some 68 attendees.|$|E

25|$|Codeine was {{discovered}} in 1832 by Pierre Jean Robiquet. In 2013 about 361,000 kilograms of codeine were produced while 249,000 kilograms were used.

The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 0.04 and 0.29 USD per dose as of 2014. In the United States it costs about one <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> dose.

Within the Bretton Woods System, Denmark devalued its currency with the pound in 1949 to a rate of 6.91 to the <b>dollar.</b> <b>A</b> further devaluation in 1967 resulted in rates of 7.5 kroner.|$|E
