5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

500|$|Although Southard {{expressed}} {{a great deal}} of interest in research, he was most inclined to work on the classification, nomenclature and definition of psychiatric and philosophical concepts. He said he realized that such work was ridiculed by many, but a [...] "psychiatric dictionary (to include definitions of every near-lying psychological and philosophical term also) would do more to push mental hygiene on than any other single thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of." [...] Southard proposed an eleven-category classification system for psychiatric diagnoses, which was not adopted.|$|E

500|$|Adam thought Petipa [...] "charming" [...] as both {{dancer and}} actor, {{and that he}} had [...] "rehabilitated" [...] male dancing with his performance. Of Dumilâtre he wrote, [...] "... in spite of her coldness, [...] {{deserved}} the success she achieved by the correctness and the 'mythological' quality of her poses: perhaps this word may seem a little pretentious, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of no other to express such cold and noble dancing as would suit Minerva in a merry mood, and in this respect [...] seems to bear a strong resemblance to that goddess." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Steinman, [...] "Good Girls Go to Heaven (Bad Girls Go Everywhere)" [...] is a [...] "teenage prayer". [...] "Lost Boys and Golden Girls" [...] is [...] "Steinman's {{interpretation}} {{of the story of}} Peter Pan." [...] The composer says that Peter Pan has [...] "always been about my favorite story and I've always looked at it from the perspective that it's a great rock and roll myth because it's about—when you get right down to it—it's about a gang of lost boys who never grow up, {{who are going to be}} young forever and that's about as perfect an image for rock'n'roll as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the death}} of Mao Zedong in 1976, Benn {{described}} Mao as [...] "one of the greatest – if not the greatest – figures of the twentieth century: a schoolteacher who transformed China, released it from civil war and foreign attack and constructed a new society there" [...] in his diaries, adding that [...] "he certainly towers above any twentieth-century figure <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of in his philosophical contribution and military genius". On his trip to the Chinese embassy after Mao's death, Benn recorded in an earlier volume of his diaries that he was [...] "a great admirer of Mao", while also admitting that [...] "he made mistakes, because everybody does".|$|E

500|$|Film analyst Lina Badley {{has written}} that the Alien's design, with strong Freudian sexual undertones, {{multiple}} phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an androgynous image conforming to archetypal mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines. O'Bannon himself later described the sexual imagery in Alien as overt and intentional: [...] "One thing that people are all disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually. And I'm {{not going to go}} after the women in the audience, I'm going to attack the men. I am going to put in every image <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of to make the men in the audience cross their legs. Homosexual oral rape, birth. The thing lays its eggs down your throat, the whole number.|$|E
500|$|The {{final scene}} wherein Doggett and his ex-wife scatter Luke's remains was called [...] "difficult" [...] by Robert Patrick. He later noted that Manners [...] "was there {{to guide us}} along; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of no worst [...] {{nightmare}} for a parent than to lose their child." [...] The episode was written to create closure to Doggett's story. Patrick later said that, if the series had continued for a tenth season, {{he would have liked}} to see his character develop a relationship with Reyes, because [...] "I think Doggett was very attracted to Reyes [...] I would have liked to see the relationship with Reyes explored more." [...] Gish agreed, noting that the show's ending never allowed the idea to be fleshed out, but that Reyes [...] "would have definitely gone further with their relationship." ...|$|E
500|$|VanDerWerff called Kurt {{opening his}} NYADA {{rejection}} letter [...] "as good a gut-punch as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of for this series", though John Kubicek of BuddyTV characterized it as [...] "the most unbelievable plot twist ever on this show". Bell hoped {{that this would}} extend his stay in Lima because it could give [...] "more screen time for Burt Hummel, who is arguably the best character on Glee". The scene where Burt gives Kurt his present {{was described as a}} [...] "gift" [...] by many reviewers. Kubicek wrote, [...] "Kudos to Glee for turning a sappy moment into a funny one", and Strecker noted how powerful scenes typically were between the Hummels before she added [...] "last night was no exception", and ended by quoting Kurt: [...] "Best. Graduation Gift. Ever." ...|$|E

Together, they debuted this song live at the 2017 Brit Awards with Chris Martin also performing a tribute song to the late George Michael. On 2 March, Chris Martin's birthday, the band announced the Kaleidoscope EP release date for 2 June 2017, and released a track from the EP, [...] "Hypnotised". The EP will include [...] "Hypnotised", a live remix of [...] "Something Just Like This" [...] recorded in Tokyo, and three new songs.

500|$|Off the field, Granderson {{has served}} as an {{ambassador}} for Major League Baseball International. He has traveled to England, Italy, the Netherlands, France, South Africa, China, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan to promote baseball. In appreciation for his efforts, Commissioner Bud Selig penned a thank-you letter to Granderson which read in part, [...] "There are so many fine young men playing Major League baseball today, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of no one who is better suited to represent our national pastime than you." [...] He has also served as something of an unofficial baseball ambassador to the African-American community, often participating in and initiating dialogue {{about the lack of}} black players {{at all levels of the}} sport. When he endorsed Nike, Inc., Louisville Slugger and Rawlings, he asked them to donate money to his foundation or equipment to inner-city baseball programs rather than pay him.|$|E
500|$|The Eisenhower Administration {{was caught}} by {{surprise}} as Sherman Adams, Eisenhower's Chief of Staff, thought an agreement had been reached with Bricker to delay introduction of his amendment until after the Administration had studied the issue. [...] "Bricker hoped to force the new administration's hand," [...] wrote Duane Tananbaum. [...] George E. Reedy, aide to Senate minority leader Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, said popular support for the measure made it [...] "apparent {{from the start that}} it could not be defeated on a straight-out vote. [...] No one could vote against the Bricker Amendment with impunity and very few could vote against it and survive at all [...] [...] [...] There was no hope of stopping it through direct opposition." [...] Johnson told his aide Bobby Baker it was [...] "the worst bill <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of" [...] and [...] "it will be the bane of every president we elect." ...|$|E

500|$|Cobain {{said the}} song was {{inspired}} by documentaries about children with cancer. He told biographer Michael Azerrad, [...] "Anytime I think about it, it makes me sadder than anything <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of." [...] Azerrad asserted in his biography [...] that despite Cobain's explanation, the song actually appeared to be about Courtney Love. Charles Cross wrote in his Kurt Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven that with the lyric [...] "I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black", the frontman [...] "sang in {{what has to be}} the most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say 'I love you'". After a performance of the song by singer Lana Del Rey in 2012, Courtney Love asserted on Twitter that the song is about her vagina. The tweets were deleted shortly after. Cobain said that the song's chorus of [...] "Hey/Wait/I've got a new complaint" [...] was him giving an example of how he was perceived by the media.|$|E
500|$|Woolfolk {{was named}} the Most Valuable Player in both of Michigan's two bowl game {{appearances}} in 1981. [...] During the January 1981 Rose Bowl, he gained 182 yards against Washington, and during the December 1981 Bluebonnet Bowl, in which he gained 186 yards against UCLA. The hotel where the Wolverines team was staying was evacuated {{the night before the}} 1981 Rose Bowl game when a fire alarm was triggered at 2:30a.m., and Woolfolk only had three hours of sleep that night. [...] He won the MVP award despite the lack of sleep, and after the game Woolfolk called the game his [...] "greatest thrill in football." [...] Commenting on the MVP trophy, Woolfolk said: [...] "If I could, I'd break this trophy into 95 pieces and hand it out to all the guys on the squad." [...] After winning his second MVP trophy in 1981's Bluebonnet Bowl, Woolfolk said: [...] "I might look back in later years and notice that, but right now all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> about is that I've worn a Michigan uniform for the last time." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i think would be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Los Angeles Times {{review of the}} album, critic Todd Martens wrote: [...] "The song's first guitar crush arrives after a lengthy ambient intro, and brings an electrifying jolt to the striking piano melody. Martin brings a booming confidence to his vocals that has been more evident in Coldplay's live shows than on record." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly wrote: [...] "'Violet Hill' opens with a thin synth wash that's very Music for Airports, and proceeds from there to some droning, stabbing guitar textures that sound cooler than most any Coldplay tunes <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of." [...] Kristina Feliciano of Paste magazine wrote: [...] "You know you're in for {{a different kind of}} Coldplay experience when Chris Martin ditches his anguished falsetto for a deep, doomy basso profundo, as he does on 'Violet Hill'". Mikael Wood of Spin magazine wrote: [...] "'Violet Hill' pulls a similar fake-out, bludgeoning a delicate Eno-style soundscape with big Black Sabbath guitars." [...] Darcie Stevens of the Austin Chronicle wrote: [...] "While the band's fourth LP begins light and pretty, its power breaks late-album with Old West tangent 'Violet Hill'". [...] The song appeared on Rolling Stones Hot List for May 2009, with the magazine calling it [...] "a (relatively) hard-rocking attack on Fox News' America".|$|E
500|$|ChicagoNow writer Andy Daglas {{said the}} fact that Andy and April's wedding was subdued, not overhyped in {{commercials}} to attract ratings, shows how much the writers understand and respect their characters. He also praised the episode's blend of [...] "humor and heart", of which he said: [...] "No show on the air, and few shows <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of ever, does it better." [...] Zap2it writer Rick Porter said he {{was surprised by the}} wedding twist, particularly by {{the fact that}} the wedding was not stopped at the last moment by a [...] "TV-style complication". He also praised the subplot with Ann and Donna, and said he hoped the two characters would continue to interact with each other throughout the season. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party" [...] showed how well the April and Andy characters have developed since their romantic story arc began in the second season episode [...] "Hunting Trip". Meslow said the episode [...] "couldn't have been better" [...] and was even effective during unabashed sentimental scenes, like the wedding itself and April voicing her appreciation for Leslie. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said the wedding felt appropriate for the two characters, and he enjoyed the progression of Leslie going from dreading the wedding to accepting it. Heisler wrote, [...] "Truly, I don't think I've ever watched an episode of Parks & Rec without feeling great at the end." ...|$|E

Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him a [...] "great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man". UEFA president Michel Platini said, [...] "He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being." [...] Gary Lineker said, [...] "It is a sad day and a great loss. He was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed by everybody in the country. I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game." [...] Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair described Robson as a [...] "real Geordie gentleman". According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson [...] "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, [...] "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones. By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion at what it had become, he made present day football look what it is – shabby by comparison. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of no more fitting epitaph." ...|$|E
