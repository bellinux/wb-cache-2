5|$|President Bartlet sneaks out to go {{shopping}} at a rare book store and refuses to take photographers along, much to Mandy's chagrin. Donna has at this point been pestering Josh about her Christmas gift all day. While he doesn't follow the list submitted, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> book for her at the shop and writes a message in it that leaves her tearful but happy.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproduction}} of octopuses {{has been studied}} {{in only a few}} species. One such species is the giant Pacific octopus, in which courtship is accompanied, especially in the male, by changes in skin texture and colour. The male may cling to the top or side of the female or position himself beside her. There is some speculation that he may first use his hectocotylus to remove any spermatophore or sperm already present in the female. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> spermatophore from his spermatophoric sac with the hectocotylus, inserts it into the female's mantle cavity, and deposits it in the correct location for the species, which in the giant Pacific octopus is the opening of the oviduct. Two spermatophores are transferred in this way; these are about one metre (yard) long, and the empty ends may protrude from the female's mantle. A complex hydraulic mechanism releases the sperm from the spermatophore, and it is stored internally by the female.|$|E

500|$|In the Fortress of Regrets, The Nameless One {{encounters}} {{three of}} his past incarnations: one practical, one good, and one paranoid. The Nameless One learns that the [...] "good" [...] incarnation is the original, who was made immortal by Ravel. The Nameless One had committed immeasurably terrible deeds in his lifetime, and when he realized there would be retribution on his soul when he died, he sought to postpone death {{as long as possible}} in order to atone. After meeting his past incarnations, The Nameless One confronts his mortality, which is embodied as a powerful being called The Transcendent One. The Transcendent One reveals that since being separated from The Nameless One, he has enjoyed his freedom and has been attempting to erase clues that might lead The Nameless One to discover the truth. Depending on the player's choice, The Nameless One either slays his mortality or convinces it to rejoin with him; either option finally ends his immortality and allows him to die. In the game's final scene, The Nameless One awakens near a battleground of the eternal Blood War between demons and devils; <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> mace and walks toward the conflict.|$|E
500|$|Jack asks Tracy {{to have a}} {{drink with}} him to {{celebrate}} his impending divorce, but Tracy has to leave early to celebrate Valentine's Day with his wife through [...] "role-play". As Jack gets more and more drunk, he reveals that he still has various fantasies about his wife from grabbing one of her breasts to her getting various terminal diseases with him by her bedside. Eventually, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> prostitute (Rachel Dratch), and the two interrupt Tracy and Angie's Valentine's Day at the Soho Grand Hotel. Angie, upset that their Valentine's Day is ruined, demands that Tracy get rid of Jack and the prostitute, so he calls Liz for help. Liz gets Jack and the drunk prostitute out of the hotel, and Liz tells Jack that his relationship with his wife is sick and presents him with a scenario of [...] "Marry, Boff, Kill", all with his wife, causing Jack to say that he wants to do all of the three but promises Liz that he will get over his wife, and the two leave the prostitute in the street. The next day, Jack and Bianca sign the divorce papers, and Bianca begs Jack not to sell the Arby's that he had gotten in their settlement. He promises not to do so, but will let the place shut down and become desolate. The two argue, and the sexual tension between the two escalate, until Bianca tears herself away from Jack and leaves.|$|E

Dominik Hašek said on Fedorov, [...] "I know his shot, and I'm not {{surprised}} that he won it. ... He can shoot from the blue line and he can score from the blue line." [...] After an October 25, 2002 game between Pittsburgh and Detroit, talking to reporters about Fedorov, Mario Lemieux said, [...] "He was awesome. The way he skates, he's just dominating out there.

6000|$|... "Not a soul," [...] {{the young}} man said doggedly; [...] "and yet, monsieur, I am not a bad fellow. What can a man do, when he has not a friend in the world? <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> living as he can, but {{everybody}} looks at him with suspicion. There is no friend to take his part, and so people vent their ill humours upon him, till the time comes when he revolts at the injustice and strikes back; and then he has to begin it all over again, somewhere else.|$|E
6000|$|To {{return to}} the {{starting}} point, the pleasures of riding do not flow exclusively from the agreeable sensations attendant on flight-like motion; there is also the knowledge, sweet in itself, that not a mere cunningly fashioned machine, like that fabled horse of brass [...] "on which the Tartar king did ride," [...] sustains us; but a something with life and thought, like ourselves, that feels what we feel, understands us, and keenly participates in our pleasures. Take, for example, the horse on which some quiet old country gentleman is accustomed to travel; how soberly and evenly he jogs along, picking his way over the ground. But let him {{fall into the hands of}} a lively youngster, and how soon <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> frisky spirit! Were horses less plastic, more the creatures of custom than they are, it would always be necessary, before buying one, to inquire into the disposition of its owner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ask my own father. Only {{think of}} it,--that a puling, puking idiot like that, from a mere freak, {{should be able}} to do a man such a mischief! He can rob me of my income, which he himself has brought me up to expect. That he can do by a stroke of his pen. He can {{threaten}} to have sons like Priam. All that is within his own bosom. But to justify himself to the world at large, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> scandalous story from a man like Augustus Scarborough, and immediately not a man in the county will speak to me. I say that that is enough to break a man's heart,--not the injury done which a man should bear, but the injustice of the doing. Who wants his beggarly allowance! He can do as he likes about his own money. I shall never ask him for his money. But that he should tell such a lie as this about the county is more than a man can endure." ...|$|E

60|$|I know Michael Finsbury personally; my business--I {{know the}} awkwardness of {{having such a}} man for a lawyer--still it's an old story now, and {{there is such a}} thing as gratitude, and, in short, my legal business, {{although}} now (I am thankful to say) of quite a placid character, remains entirely in Michael's hands. But the trouble is I have no natural talent for addresses; I learn one for every man--that is friendship's offering; and the friend who subsequently changes his residence is dead to me, memory refusing to pursue him. Thus it comes about that, as I always write to Michael at his office, I cannot swear to his number in the King's Road. Of course (like my neighbours), I have been to dinner there. Of late years, since his accession to wealth, neglect of business, and election to the club, these little festivals have become common. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> few fellows in the smoking-room--all men of Attic wit--myself, for instance, if he has the luck to find me disengaged; a string of hansoms may be observed (by Her Majesty) bowling gaily through St. James's Park; and in a quarter of an hour the party surrounds one of the best appointed boards in London.|$|E

[...] "'Bout 'leven days." [...] "Captain's name?" [...] "Flahy." [...] "That'll do. Next man: Jules Anderson." [...] Jules Anderson is a Dane. His statements tally with the discharge-certificate of the United States, as the Eagle attesteth. He is passed and falls back.
