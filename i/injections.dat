Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint <b>injections</b> and steroid <b>injections</b> into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid <b>injections</b> provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit.

30|$|Correct {{interpretation}} of real-time <b>injection</b> data requires some fundamental understanding of fracture growth within the <b>injection</b> zone. Hence, proactive monitoring is essential. Before any <b>injection</b> batch, 3 D fracture simulations are conducted under real reservoir conditions to predict fracture containment, geometry, and its correlations with <b>injection</b> parameters (Fig.  7). For example, the 3 D simulations show {{that for all}} possible <b>injection</b> scenarios, fractures are contained within targeted <b>injection</b> zone (Fig.  8). Fracture geometry is sensitive to slurry solid concentration and <b>injection</b> rate. Higher solid concentration leads to shorter fractures at a given <b>injection</b> rate, while higher <b>injection</b> rate results in longer fractures at a given solid concentration. The outcomes of the simulations are used to optimize <b>injection</b> parameters for next <b>injection.</b> They also help to optimize <b>injection</b> parameters during <b>injection</b> if undesirable <b>injection</b> data are observed. 3 D simulations are also conducted during <b>injection</b> through the web application whenever {{there is a need}} to evaluate special <b>injection</b> cases to help interpret puzzling <b>injection</b> data.|$|R

5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation. Lumbar provocative discography {{may be useful to}} identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of facet joint <b>injections,</b> transforminal epidural <b>injections</b> and sacroilliac <b>injections</b> as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E

30|$|Usually, the <b>injection</b> {{evaluation}} of chemical flooding is {{conducted by the}} variation of dynamic <b>injection</b> data such as {{the rise of the}} <b>injection</b> pressure and the drop of the <b>injection</b> rate. The increase in the flow resistance to the <b>injection</b> fluid indicates the increment of the chemical efficiency. After the chemical solution is injected into a reservoir, due to the high-molecular weight polymer dissolved in the <b>injection</b> fluid, the flow resistance increases, causing an increase in the <b>injection</b> pressure and a decline in the <b>injection</b> rate (Cheng et al. 2002; Li 2004). As a result, the variation of the <b>injection</b> pressure and the <b>injection</b> rate can be used to evaluate whether the chemical <b>injection</b> is effective.|$|R
40|$|We present large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) of a high-pressure air jet that is injecting into a quiescent inert environment.

On the other hand, the splitting timing is varied to investigate the effects of various <b>injection</b> splitting strategies on the mixture formation and the penetration length of the jet. Results show that the jet penetration length is not so sensitive to the splitting timing whereas the mixing quality can significantly change as a result of shifting the onset of <b>injection</b> splitting toward the end of <b>injection.</b> Especially, it is found that by adopting a post-injection strategy where a single <b>injection</b> splits into the main <b>injection</b> and late small <b>injection</b> near the end of <b>injection</b> period the mixing between the injected air and ambient is significantly improved.

5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous <b>injections</b> and 33% with intramuscular <b>injections).</b> Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E

30|$|Concerns about {{environmental}} pollution and energy shortages have increased worldwide. One approach to reduce CO 2 emissions from gasoline engines {{is to achieve}} stratified charge combustion with various <b>injection</b> ratios using port fuel <b>injection</b> (PFI) and direct <b>injection.</b> The combustion and emission characteristics of a 4 -valve direct <b>injection</b> spark ignition (DISI) engine equipped with a dual <b>injection</b> system were investigated while the <b>injection</b> ratio was varied. When the direct <b>injection</b> ratio increased, the lean limit A/F was extended. This suggests that the dual <b>injection</b> gasoline engine with both PFI and direct <b>injection</b> can meet severe vehicle emission and fuel economy requirements. The dual <b>injection</b> system had higher combustion pressure than that of either a conventional or direct <b>injection</b> systems. Therefore, the engine power of a dual <b>injection</b> DISI engine would be {{higher than that of}} a single <b>injection</b> DISI engine. However, NO emissions increased compared with the emission levels in both PFI and DISI systems.|$|R

40|$|International audienceCO 2 <b>injection</b> {{is a most}} {{promising}} method for enhancing oil recovery from petroleum reservoirs especiallyfrom depleted one. CO 2 <b>injection</b> can be employed as secondary and tertiary enhanced oil recovery(EOR) methods. The most prominent advantage of CO 2 <b>injection</b> is reducing greenhouse gases in theatmosphere and consequently reducing environmental problems. Different approaches have beenemployed to study the performance of CO 2 in increasing oil production including miscible/immiscibleinjection, carbonated water <b>injection</b> (CWI) and CO 2 <b>injection</b> into aquifer. In these methods differentparameters can effect such as minimum miscible pressure (MMP), <b>injection</b> rate and so forth.
