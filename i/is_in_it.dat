25|$|Pisces is {{classified}} as a short ascension sign; one which takes a shorter {{amount of time to}} ascend over the horizon than the other signs. It {{is also one of the}} six southern signs, because it is south of the celestial equator when the sun <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> (no longer true). This results in it being seen in the winter sky in the northern hemisphere. Pisces is also considered a bicorporeal or double-bodied sign, as the astrological sign is composed of two fishes.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the time}} the soul is liberated from the saṃsāra (cycle of {{repeated}} birth and death), it gets attached {{to one of these}} bodies based on the karma (actions) of the individual soul. Irrespective of which state the soul <b>is</b> <b>in,</b> <b>it</b> has got the same attributes and qualities. The difference between the liberated and non-liberated souls is that the qualities and attributes are manifested completely in case of siddha (liberated soul) as they have overcome all the karmic bondages whereas in case of non-liberated souls they are partially exhibited.|$|E
25|$|Queen Anne's Men {{stayed at}} the theatre until 1617. They {{employed}} prominent playwrights: most of Thomas Heywood's tremendous output was staged there, as were John Webster's The White Devil and The Devil's Law-case, Thomas Dekker's If This Be Not A Good Play, the Devil <b>Is</b> <b>in</b> <b>It,</b> and John Cooke's well-known Greene's Tu Quoque. It also came into possession of some older plays, including Christopher Marlowe's Edward II, and as the period progressed, the Red Bull companies, along with those at the Fortune were associated with old-fashioned plays performed for noisy, ignorant audiences. The audience appears to have booed The White Devil in 1611, and in later years it was the cause of, or scene of, numerous brawls violent enough to result in court cases.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} to assume that {{buildings}} are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies {{that there is little}} interaction between the triad of the building, what <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see {{the overwhelming majority of the}} mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. “Building ecology “ is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.|$|E

Bowers noted that the border of {{both sides of the}} coin consists of beads and pellets, [...] "an attractive substitute for denticles".|$|E

500|$|The printer, Richard Francklin, ran off 13,000 copies on 5–6 December, {{only one}} of which still survives. Although the true author of the {{pamphlet}} remains uncertain, it was believed {{at the time to}} be Fielding's work; later critics, such as Martin and Ruthe Battestin, cite a letter written on behalf of the Duke of Richmond that was used as evidence of Fielding's involvement. Dated 7 December 1749, the letter states: [...] "The enclosed is a paper generally given to Mr. Fielding, as the author. The humor that <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> is at least akin to his. It may possibly divert you & your company." [...] Fielding's authorship would have been limited to the paper's introduction, which was used to target prominent Tories such as Paul Whitehead: a minor poet who had pseudonymously attacked Fielding before and was vocal on political issues.|$|E

[...] When asked on Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, [...] "I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total." [...] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some use of second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was directing Batman Returns and in pre-production of Ed Wood.|$|E

500|$|The three Creation {{pictures}} show {{scenes from}} {{the first chapter of}} Genesis, which relates that God created the Earth and all that <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> in six days, resting on the seventh day. [...] In the first scene, the First Day of Creation, God creates light and separates light from darkness. Chronologically, the next scene takes place in the third panel, in which, on the Second Day, God divides the waters from the heavens. In the central panel, the largest of the three, there are two representations of God. On the [...] Third Day, God creates the Earth and makes it sprout plants. On the Fourth Day, God puts the Sun and the Moon in place to govern the night and the day, the time and the seasons of the year. According to Genesis, on the Fifth Day, God created the birds of the air and fish and creatures of the deep, but we are not shown this. Neither do we see God's creation of the creatures of the earth on the Sixth Day.|$|E
500|$|Nathan Drake {{has been}} {{compared}} to several other video game and film characters, most notably video game adventurer Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider franchise and film character Indiana Jones, due to the similarities between the characters and the narratives they appear in. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer and Lee Ferran of ABC News called these associations [...] "obvious" [...] and [...] "unavoidable". In fact, Drake has been called a mixture of the two characters. Drake was hailed as the [...] "new Lara Croft" [...] after the Uncharted series sold well, and his similarity to Croft has earned him the moniker [...] "bloke-" [...] or [...] "dude-raider". Michael Owen-Brown of The Advertiser remarked that Drake distinguished himself from Croft with his wit, while director of the Uncharted series Bruce Straley claimed that Drake had equaled Croft in popularity. CBS drew a strict distinction between Indiana Jones and Drake, pointing out that while Jones acts altruistically, Drake <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> for the profits. Avi Arad, producer of a planned Uncharted film, drew a similar conclusion, remarking that while Jones was always good, Drake is not necessarily the good guy. Designer Neil Druckmann stated that he believes Drake stands apart from Jones and Croft. Other reviewers have compared Drake to different characters, including Jack Colton from the film Romancing the Stone. North, who plays Drake, also voices The Prince in the 2008 video game Prince of Persia, and comparisons have been made between the two characters. The Prince {{has been described as a}} rougher, more abrasive form of Nathan Drake.|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1902–03, Bosanquet took part in another tour, this time with Lord Hawke's team which played matches in New Zealand and Australia and was captained by Warner. In New Zealand, he played two matches against a New Zealand {{representative}} side, and in all matches scored 148 runs {{at an average of}} 18.50 with one fifty, an innings of 82 against South Island. Bosanquet also took 18 wickets at an average of 22.61; his style of bowling attracted a great deal of attention. [...] In one game, Charles Bannerman, who played in Australia's first Test match in 1877, was umpire. He told Warner: [...] "When the next team goes to Australia, be sure that Mr Bosanquet <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> He bowls a lot of bad 'uns; but that ball of his that breaks the wrong way will be very useful on the hard Australian wickets." [...] However, the tour was more notable for an incident in the match against Canterbury. Bosanquet had taken an early wicket in the first innings, but bowled poorly afterwards. He was the fourth bowler used in the second innings and with his third ball, it {{looked as if he had}} bowled Walter Pearce behind his legs as he attempted a big hit. However, both umpires were unsighted and the non-striker Arthur Sims, who also had his view obscured, urged Pearce not to leave the middle. The tourists' wicket-keeper, Arthur Whatman, Bosanquet and other English players surrounded the umpire, who decided Pearce was not out. Bosanquet then turned to Sims and said: [...] "You're a nice cheat. I bowled him round his legs. Anybody could see that." [...] Sims responded that there was reasonable doubt, but Whatman began to swear and call him a cheat. Bosanquet later bowled Sims and Canterbury were easily defeated. However, the incident continued to attract attention. The English team were severely criticised in the press and Sims' employers refused to release him for any further matches unless Bosanquet apologised. Bosanquet wrote letters of apology to Sims and to the Canterbury Cricket Association, and Sims later told him to forget about it, but Sims' employers would not let him take part in the remaining games.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{day when}} Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah {{displaced}} Rabban Gamaliel II as Principal of the School, Rabbi Akiva expounded on the words of [...] "and every earthen vessel, into which any of them falls, whatsoever <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> shall be unclean." [...] Rabbi Akiva noted that [...] does not state [...] "is unclean" [...] but [...] "will make others unclean." [...] Rabbi Akiva deduced from this that a loaf that is unclean in the second degree (when, for example, the vessel becomes unclean first and then defiles the loaf in it), can make whatever it comes in contact with unclean in the third degree. Rabbi Joshua asked who would remove the dust from the eyes of Rabban Johanan ben Zakai (so that he might hear this wonderful proof), as Rabban Johanan ben Zakai said that another generation would pronounce clean a loaf that was unclean in the third degree {{on the ground that}} there is no text in the Torah according to which it would be unclean. Rabbi Joshua noted that Rabbi Akiva, the intellectual descendant of Rabban Johanan ben Zakai (as Rabbi Akiva was the pupil of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurcanus, a disciple of Rabban Johanan ben Zakai), adduced a text in the Torah — [...] — according to which such a loaf was unclean..

2500|$|Lisa Evans, an {{attorney}} for the environmental group Earthjustice (headquartered in Oakland, CA), spoke out against the government, accusing them of lax regulations on the issue. She also blamed the industry for ineffective safeguards, citing other similar cases. She stated that [...] "The saddest thing is this is entirely avoidable. These people in these communities don't have to be in harm's way. This is not some complicated problem like nuclear waste. This is something the utilities know how to do." [...] Thomas J. FitzGerald, the director of the environmental group Kentucky Resources Council and an expert on coal waste, told The New York Times that the ash should have been buried in lined landfills to prevent toxins leaching into the soil and groundwater (as recommended in a 2006 EPA report), and stated that [...] "I find it difficult to comprehend that the State of Tennessee would have approved that as a permanent disposal site." [...] Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen, on-site the week of the spill, acknowledged that the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which regulates coal disposal, may have relied too much on TVA’s own inspections and engineering studies about the ash ponds and dredge cells.“Believe me, there will be a full-bore look at this to understand the causes of this thing and to try to make sure it never happens again,” he said. Concern has also been expressed by environmental groups and local residents that no warnings were issued to residents living in the area about the potential dangers of the site. The site may be slated as a Superfund site, although no decision regarding this has yet been made. On December 27, 2008 the TVA issued a list of precautions to residents, but did not provide information about specific levels of toxic materials in the ash, although Stephen Smith of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Chris Irwin of United Mountain Defense told The Tennessean newspaper that they believe the TVA knows what <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> due to the TVA having tested it prior to the spill. The TVA released an inventory of the plant's byproducts on December 29, 2008; it included arsenic, lead, barium, chromium, and manganese. Because the pond contained decades worth of ash from coal of several different types, it is believed that the area of the spill may contain [...] "hot spots" [...] of higher toxicity.|$|E
