5000|$|In late 1967, {{when the}} {{remarkable}} <b>new</b> <b>Ro</b> 80 was introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show, {{it did not}} initially gain universal acceptance for its unconventional wedge-like design. However, sales proved to be strong, and {{by the spring of}} 1969, there were still waiting lists for the car. [...] Unfortunately the early engines suffered from heavy wear of the rotor tip seals in the innovative Wankel engine, causing severe financial losses for NSU. 37,204 Ro 80s were built by the time production finally ceased in 1977, but by that time the company had long been part of Audi, a Volkswagen subsidiary.|$|R
40|$|This article gives a brief {{overview}} of the place of religious observance (RO) within Scotland’s non-denominational state school sector, and the background to recent changes in educational thinking and government policy which led to new guidelines being introduced in 2005. The article reports on a study conducted in 2008 into the reception of the <b>new</b> <b>RO</b> guidelines and their implementation within three primary schools and one secondary school in a local authority area, together with empirical data from each of the four case studies and interview extracts from head teachers, RO practitioners and pupils. The article then highlights some problems arising from the new guidelines and suggests some areas for future empirical research...|$|R
30|$|Because the {{concentrations}} of antiepileptic drugs to be expected depend on the patients present during sampling time, a generally high variability will occur. As a result of regular plugging of the tubes due to toilet paper and feces, continuous control of the pump was necessary. The aim of this sampling was to get waste water highly loaded with antiepileptic drugs and not the description of representative mass flows of antiepileptic drugs from this hospital ward. Therefore, the sampling was done in 1 day. A total volume of ca. 320 -L raw waste water was collected in <b>new,</b> <b>RO</b> water cleaned low-density polyethylene (LD-PE) canisters (9 × 25 L, 3 × 30 L, filled above the nominal mark) and stored until treatment at 4 °C.|$|R
50|$|CHRO's first anchor team under NewNet {{consisted}} of Caroline Redekopp and former CKVR anchor Robert Maxwell, with Ken Evraire on sports, former Weather Channel anchor Elissa Lansdell on weather and entertainment, and weekend anchor James Hendricks covering traffic and crime from the assignment desk.

Reporter Sandra Blaikie, who joined CHRO in 2000, took over from Caroline Redekopp after her departure in 2002. James Hendricks - by now the 11 p.m. anchor - replaced Robert Maxwell after his resignation in autumn 2003.

40|$|A water pinch {{analysis}} of a coal-fired power station has been undertaken, {{with the objective of}} identifying the optimal role for an existing tubular reverse osmosis (TRO) plant in the water circuits. The analysis considered a simplified model based on the Lethabo Power Station in South Africa. It was found that the TRO plant was not needed at all if the power station was considered in isolation, but was required to prevent saline pollution if the power station and the associated coal mine were considered as a whole. The financial incentive required to justify operating the TRO was found to be of the same order as the cost to the national economy of salination of the Vaal river, from which the Lethabo Power Station draws its water. The optimal location of the power station was found to be dependent on its running costs and technical performance, so that a <b>new</b> <b>RO</b> plant would be used in a different way to the existing one...|$|R
50|$|According to Myers-Scotton, for any {{communicative}} {{situation there}} exists an unmarked, expected RO Set and a marked, differential one. In choosing a code the speaker evaluates the markedness {{of their potential}} choices, determined by the social forces at work in their community, and decides either to follow or reject the normative model. Making the marked choice is thus a conscious bid for a <b>new</b> <b>RO</b> Set. Speakers employ code choices rationally, {{as a way of}} establishing their social position according to the Negotiation Principle: “Choose the form of your conversational contribution such that it indexes the set of rights and obligations which you wish to be in force between the speaker and addressee for the current exchange”. Marked choices are often accompanied by prosodic features such as pauses, or metacommentary on the switch. When the unmarked choice is not clear, speakers use code-switching in an exploratory way to establish the favored social balance. Myers-Scotton has proposed that the markedness model is applicable to all language choices, beyond the limits of code-switching.|$|R
