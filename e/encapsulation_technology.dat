50|$|Glass frit bonding, also {{referred}} to as glass soldering or seal glass bonding, describes a wafer bonding technique with an intermediate glass layer. It is a widely used <b>encapsulation</b> <b>technology</b> for surface micro-machined structures, e.g., accelerometers or gyroscopes. This technique utilizes low melting glass ("glass solder") and therefore provides various advantages including that viscosity of glass decreases with an increase of temperature. The viscous flow of glass has effects to compensate and planarize surface irregularities, convenient for bonding wafers with a high roughness due to plasma etching or deposition. A low viscosity promotes hermetically sealed encapsulation of structures based on a better adaption of the structured shapes. Further, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the glass material is adapted to silicon. This results in low stress in the bonded wafer pair.|$|E

Apical buds isolated from shoot cultures of four ornamental species (Photinia × fraseri Dress., Polygala myrtifolia L., Metrosideros excelsa Soland. ex Gaertn., and Rosa) were encapsulated in 3 % sodium alginate. Effects of complexation time, sucrose concentration, and storage temperature on the regrowth ability of propagules were assessed. With the appropriate combination of sucrose concentration and polymerization time, the encapsulated explants proved to have a better regrowth (80 – 100 %) after sowing than the naked ones. In addition, medium-term storage of Metrosideros encapsulated explants promoted a high level of regrowth (74 %) after 4 months in the dark at 10 °C; while polygala beads were preserved up to 8 months regardless of storage temperatures.

This form of delivery system offers targeted delivery of vital compounds to the body. It has been in existence since the early 70 ’s. Liposomal <b>Encapsulation</b> <b>Technology</b> {{is a state of}} the art method of producing sub-microscopic bubbles called liposomes, which encapsulate various substances. These phospholipids or “liposomes” form a barrier around their contents that is resistant to enzymes in the mouth and stomach, digestive juices, alkaline solutions, bile salts, and intestinal flora, found in the human body as well as free radicals. The contents of the liposomes are therefore shielded from degradation and oxidation. This protective phospholipid shield or barrier remains unharmed until the contents of the liposome are delivered right to the target organ, gland, or system where the contents will be utilized. Natural extracts are generally degraded because of oxidation and other chemical reactions before they delivered to the target site.
