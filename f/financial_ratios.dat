Design/methodology/approach – An empirical positivist approach is utilised to explore the predictors of disclosure within the 2007 annual reports of 300 Australian listed companies. Findings – Overall, the extent of <b>financial</b> <b>ratio</b> disclosures is very low (5. 3 per cent) with more extensive disclosures within the sub-categories of share market measure, profitability and capital structure. A far lower liquidity and cash flow ratio information is reported. Larger firms with more dispersed share ownership provide more extensive <b>financial</b> <b>ratio</b> information than the others. Further, profit-making firms and Big 4 clients exhibit more extensive <b>financial</b> <b>ratio</b> disclosures. Resources firms present significantly lower incidents of <b>financial</b> <b>ratio</b> than the <b>financials</b> and services sector. Corporate governance and capital management initiatives do not have predictive properties. Originality/value – <b>Financial</b> <b>ratio</b> disclosure, although important, is under-researched. A comprehensive set of predictors are investigated. The findings highlight the need for Australian regulators to consider more explicit guidelines or mandatory requirements.
