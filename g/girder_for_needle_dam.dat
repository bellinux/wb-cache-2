50|$|The Chattaroi Railroad (now {{a part of}} CSX) {{connected}} to Louisa in 1881. The city is also served by US 23. The first <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> constructed in the United States was completed just north of town in 1896.|$|R
50|$|One early <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> {{maintains}} {{the level of}} Lake Lucerne in Lucerne, Switzerland by restricting {{the flow of the}} Reuss, several are still in operation on the Meuse, France and others were built in the United States in the 19th century.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> is a weir {{designed}} {{to maintain the}} level or flow of a river {{through the use of}} thin [...] "needles" [...] of wood. The needles are leaned against a solid frame and are not intended to be water-tight. Individual needles can be added or removed by hand to constrict the flow of the river, forming a sluice.|$|R
5000|$|A Barrage dam on the Saône {{was built}} in 1840 and {{operated}} for 170 years until April 2011 when a modern dam (with inflatable mechanical shutters) of a <b>Needle</b> <b>dam</b> type took over. It is over 200 metres long and is divided into four sections of 50 metres each {{with a total of}} 1,040 needles to manoeuvre depending on the fluctuating water levels.|$|R
50|$|The <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> was {{replaced}} with a modern segment weir during improvements carried out on Vienna’s defenses against flooding between 1971 and 1975. The new weir featured barriers that could be lowered {{to the bottom of}} the canal. Between 2004 and 2005, the Nussdorf power station was built downstream of the weir and lock without any visible changes to the historical appearance of the area. The power station’s 12 turbines produce around 28 gigawatt hours per year and thus provide electricity for approximately 10,000 households.|$|R
50|$|The {{breadth of}} these various {{sections}} of the lake is very variable, but is usually between one and two miles (3 km). The lake's surface, whose mean height above the sea is 434 metres, is the lowest point of the cantons of Uri, Obwalden and Nidwalden. Originally the lake was susceptible to variations in level and flooding along its shoreline. Between 1859 and 1860, {{the introduction of a}} <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> in the Reuss in the city of Lucerne, just upstream from the Spreuerbrücke, allowed the lake level to be stabilised.|$|R
40|$|Thin-walled {{corrugated}} webs provide {{several advantages}} <b>for</b> welded plate <b>girders,</b> which thus become very competitive. This paper {{deals with the}} buckling and postbuckling behaviour of such <b>girders</b> <b>for</b> buildings. The purpose is to study the behavior of these light-weight <b>girders</b> <b>for</b> different loading conditions, especially under shear load. Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations <b>for</b> different <b>girder</b> geometries are presented and discussed. The influences of interaction of buckling modes and of initial web imperfections on the buckling behaviour and load carrying capacity are typical topics...|$|R

50|$|The work {{consisted}} of {{construction of a}} 2060 m bridge having 55 spans of 33 m and 11 spans of 22 m. The foundation consists of four 1.2 m cast-in-situ R.C.C. bored piles for piers and eight 1.2-metre-diameter piles for abutments. The superstructure was with a single post-tensioned box <b>girder</b> <b>for</b> 33 m spans and three precast pretensioned I <b>girders</b> <b>for</b> 22 m spans. This bridge at Honnavar was awarded second prize in the competition for Most outstanding Bridge National Awards 1995 - Category I by Indian Institute of Bridge Engineers in 1995.|$|R
50|$|The Reuss leaves Lake Lucerne some 20 km to the north-west, at {{the city}} of Lucerne.Notable bridges in Lucerne are the Kapellbrücke, first built 1333, rebuilt 1993 and Spreuerbrücke, built 1408.A <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> just {{upstream}} from the Spreuerbrücke) maintains the water level.It receives the Kleine Emme from Entlebuch at Emmen (432 m).From here, it flows north-east through Buchrain, Root, Gisikon and Honau, and downstream of Honau (402 m) leaves the canton of Lucerne, now forming the border between Aargau and Zug, passing Dietwil (Aargau), Risch-Rotkreuz (Zug), Oberrüti (Aargau) and Sins (Aargau), Hünenberg (Zug) and Mühlau (Aargau). It receives the Lorze from Lake Zug downstream of Maschwanden.|$|R

5000|$|The {{selected}} design combined cable-stayed bridges with a truss <b>girder</b> <b>for</b> both bridges. This option, called partially cable-stayed, [...] "draws half of {{its support}} from the girders and half from a cable-stayed system that can rely on (shorter towers)." ...|$|R

In his research, he describes the procedure for trigger point or MTrP injection and dry needling by using a 27-gauge hypodermic needle 1 ¼-in long (Hong, 1994). Both Travell and Hong used hypodermic <b>needles</b> <b>for</b> dry <b>needling.</b> Dr. Hong, like Dr. Travell, did not use an acupuncture <b>needle</b> <b>for</b> dry <b>needling.</b>|$|R

50|$|Once the {{preliminary}} wool preparation steps are completed, knitting can begin. Early materials <b>for</b> <b>needles</b> included whale bone, deer bone, telephone wire, bamboo chopsticks, and wood.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the universal orientation-dependent interactions between non-spherical colloidal particles {{immersed in a}} critical solvent by studying the instructive paradigm of a needle embedded in bounded two-dimensional Ising models at bulk criticality. <b>For</b> a <b>needle</b> in an Ising strip the interaction on mesoscopic scales depends on {{the width of the}} strip and the length, position, and orientation of the needle. By lattice Monte Carlo simulations we evaluate the free energy difference between needle configurations being parallel and perpendicular to the strip. We concentrate on small but nonetheless mesoscopic <b>needle</b> lengths <b>for</b> which analytic predictions are available for comparison. All combinations of boundary conditions <b>for</b> the <b>needles</b> and boundaries are considered which belong to either the "normal" or the "ordinary" surface universality class, i. e., which induce local order or disorder, respectively. We also derive exact results <b>for</b> <b>needles</b> of arbitrary mesoscopic length, in particular <b>for</b> <b>needles</b> embedded in a half plane and oriented perpendicular to the corresponding boundary as well as <b>for</b> <b>needles</b> embedded at the center line of a symmetric strip with parallel orientation.
