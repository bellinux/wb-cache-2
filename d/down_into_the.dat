5|$|A more ancient {{dwelling}} on Shapinsay is the Iron Age Broch of Burroughston. Only {{the interior of}} this partially buried building has been excavated, allowing visitors to look <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> broch from the surrounding mound. The surviving drystone walls rise to about threemetres (10ft) and are more than fourmetres (13ft) thick in some places.|$|E
5|$|Investigations {{showed that}} the secret pipe had been active for ten years. A large area of wetland was {{contaminated}} with zinc oxide, lead, cadmium and other pollutants at several times the threshold for a public health hazard. Visible evidence of contamination extended five feet <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bed of Long Lake on property owned by Chemetco.|$|E
5|$|It {{could be}} {{possible}} to build a surface base that would produce fuel for further exploration of the Solar System. In 1997, the Artemis Project designed a plan to colonize Europa. According to this plan, explorers would drill <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Europan ice crust, entering the postulated subsurface ocean, where they would inhabit artificial air pockets.|$|E

5|$|Older trees {{sometimes}} grow epicormic shoots {{directly from}} their trunks after storm or ﬁre damage. Aerial rhizomes {{can also be}} produced from the trunk if it sustains damage or has become hollow, and grow <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> soil to regenerate the plant. Such regeneration can lead to trees of great age with multiple trunks.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 also {{supports}} pivoting-door type thrust reversers. This type {{is used on}} the CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft. They work by actuating a door that pivots <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bypass duct, both blocking the bypass air and deflecting the flow outward, creating the reverse thrust.|$|E

5|$|A {{squall line}} which moved {{offshore}} New York and southern New England formed a mesoscale convective vortex, which fired new thunderstorm activity each day {{as it moved}} within the westerlies across the northern Atlantic. Once it reached mid-ocean, an increasingly northerly steering flow dropped the system <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> subtropics {{to the east of}} Bermuda, and it maintained decent organization. By 2100UTC on July 24, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Two. In the first advisory on the depression, it was noted that the previous tropical depression was erroneously classified as Tropical Depression Two.|$|E
5|$|After the Gold Rush had concluded, gold {{recovery}} operations continued. The final stage to recover loose gold was to prospect for gold that had slowly washed <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flat river bottoms and sandbars of California's Central Valley and other gold-bearing areas of California (such as Scott Valley in Siskiyou County). By the late 1890s, dredging technology (also invented in California) had become economical, {{and it is}} estimated that more than 20million ounces (620t) were recovered by dredging (worth approximately US$28billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|Brian McCoy was {{the first}} to die, having been hit in the back by nine rounds from a 9mm Luger pistol in the initial volley of gunfire. Fran O'Toole {{attempted}} to run away, but was quickly chased down by the gunmen who had immediately jumped <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> field in pursuit. He was then machine-gunned 22 times, mostly in the face, as he lay supine on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Finn has enough, {{and knocks}} the king's clock from the wall. It crashes into the kingdom's huge stove, {{knocking}} over {{a pot of}} water. The water puts out the fire, which causes the warm updraft going into the chimney to cease; this updraft was actually holding Seven's barge in stasis all of this time. The barge comes crashing <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kingdom, and Jake uses his stretching powers to save Finn. Thence, Finn, Jake, and Seven escape.|$|E
5|$|Following the explosion, the {{remaining}} gunmen {{opened fire on}} the dazed band members, who had all been knocked <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> field {{below the level of}} the road from the force of the blast. The order to shoot was given by the patrol's apparent leader, James McDowell, to eliminate witnesses to the bogus checkpoint and subsequent bombing. Three of the musicians were killed: lead singer Fran O'Toole, trumpeter Brian McCoy, and guitarist Tony Geraghty.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{there was a}} formal {{ceremony}} of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied {{by the rest of}} the heralds, proceeded to St George's Chapel. While the Garter King of Arms read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a herald climbed up a ladder and removed the former knight's banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> quire. Then the rest of the heralds kicked them down the length of the chapel, out of the doors, and into the castle ditch. The last such formal degradation was that of James, Duke of Ormonde in 1716.|$|E

5|$|The alkali metals, due {{to their}} high reactivity, do not occur {{naturally}} in pure form in nature. They are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Earth's core. Potassium, rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements {{due to their}} large ionic radii.|$|E

5|$|The exhaust can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> colder mesosphere, which occupies {{the region of the}} atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism is the cause of individual noctilucent clouds, it is not thought to be a major contributor to the phenomenon as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
