As a result, they contribute significantly to the subgrid-scale fluxes in large-scale atmospheric models. Yet they are not considered in these models. To provide some insights into the possible parameterization of these fluxes in large-scale models, a state-of-the-art mesoscale numerical model was used to investigate the relationships between mesoscale <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> and atmospheric and land-surface characteristics that play a key role in the generation of mesoscale circulations. The distribution of land-surface wetness, the wavenumber and the wavelength of the land-surface discontinuities, and the large-scale wind speed have a significant impact on the mesoscale <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes.</b> Empirical functions were derived to characterize the relationships between mesoscale <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> and the spatial distribution of land-surface wetness.

5|$|The {{lack of an}} {{intrinsic}} magnetic field at Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size, and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core {{is thought to be}} electrically conductive and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo. This implies that the dynamo is missing {{because of a lack of}} convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much hotter than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> through the crust. This caused the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is being used to reheat the crust.|$|E

25|$|Stirling engines, {{especially}} those that run on small temperature differentials, are quite large {{for the amount of}} power that they produce (i.e., they have low specific power). This is primarily due to the heat transfer coefficient of gaseous convection, which limits the <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> that can be attained in a typical cold heat exchanger to about 500W/(m2·K), and in a hot heat exchanger to about 500–5000W/(m2·K). Compared with internal combustion engines, this makes it more challenging for the engine designer to transfer heat {{into and out of the}} working gas. Because of the thermal efficiency the required heat transfer grows with lower temperature difference, and the heat exchanger surface (and cost) for 1kW output grows with (1/ΔT)2. Therefore, the specific cost of very low temperature difference engines is very high. Increasing the temperature differential and/or pressure allows Stirling engines to produce more power, assuming the heat exchangers are designed for the increased heat load, and can deliver the convected <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> necessary.|$|E

The total diabatic heating is agreed to play the most dominant role, but whether the differential surface sensible <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> or the latent heat release have the strongest impact, is still an ongoing discussion. This study presents a synoptic comparison between intense surface sensible <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> and latent <b>heating</b> in the Gulf Stream region. During two winter seasons, 2008 - 2010, the findings show that intense latent heat release is strongly connected to the warm sector of extratropical cyclones. This study also shows that intense surface sensible <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> are highly influenced by a persistent anticyclonic pattern over the North American continent prior to their peak. The latter indicates that anticyclones also contribute to strong surface sensible <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> and possibly help to maintain baroclinicity in the Gulf Stream region. When using the slope of an isentropic surface as a proxy for baroclinicity, it is found that an increase in the surface sensible <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> is followed by a low tropospheric steepening of the net isentropic slope. The latent heat release does not influence the net isentropic slope in the same distinct way, but when investigating its tendency to increase the slope, the latent heat release shows positive contributions above 900 hPa.
