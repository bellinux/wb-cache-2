When he {{discovered}} in December 1927 that she was having a relationship with his chauffeur, Emil Maurice, he forced an end to the affair and dismissed Maurice from his personal service. After that he did not allow her to freely associate with friends and attempted to have himself or someone he trusted near <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times, accompanying her on shopping trips, to the movies, and to the opera.|$|E

Her daughter Sylvia later wrote: [...] "Beauty and appropriateness in her dress and household appointments seemed to <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times an indispensable setting to public work."

500|$|Minnie (like Emily) {{was often}} placed under {{considerable}} pressure to produce works. She was reportedly [...] "kidnapped" [...] by people [...] "keen {{to go to}} often quite bizarre lengths to acquire" [...] her work. Minnie's experience reflected broader issues in the industry surrounding artists, who were often older, had limited education or English language ability, and faced serious poverty both themselves and amongst their families. In addition to being pressured to paint by others, there were media reports suggesting {{that some of the}} vast number of paintings traded under Minnie's name were not created by <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
500|$|Schur {{said the}} writing staff had {{difficulty}} scripting {{the scene where}} Ann kisses Andy: [...] "We {{had a lot of}} discussions about this because we didn't want Ann to be too much of a jerk and kiss a guy who likes another girl, and we didn't want Andy to be too much of a jerk because he likes April. It was very delicate." [...] The episode marked a turning point for the romantic subplot between April and Andy, who shared their first kiss of the series in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti". Goor said filming of that scene, [...] "They nailed the kiss immediately." [...] While trying to get April to talk to him, Andy pretends he doesn't want to talk to <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> which he incorrectly calls [...] "reverse psychiatry" [...] instead of reverse psychology.

[...] "He begins with the jacket, a hoodie, and two t-shirts," [...] explains Johnston. One piece of Dakota Fanning's costume that takes on a special importance is her lavender horse purse: [...] "I wanted her to have something that made her feel safe, some little thing that she could sleep with and put over her face," [...] Johnston notes. [...] "That was the lavender horse purse. We tied it up on a ribbon and Dakota hung it on her body, so it was with <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times." [...] Johnston dressed Robbie for an unconscious emulation of his father, [...] "They're more alike than they realize, with great tension on the surface," [...] Johnston says.|$|E
500|$|Baeyertz {{agreed to}} marry Charles on the {{condition}} that he would never attempt to convert her to Christianity—indeed, that he would never mention his religion to <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> The couple married in secret at Christ Church in Hawthorn, Victoria on 16 October 1865. Soon after, the Baeyertz's family discovered the marriage and disowned her for marrying a non-Jewish man. They moved to Colac, Victoria where Charles found a new role as bank manager for the National Bank of Australasia, and they had two children, son [...] Charles Nalder who went on to be a journalist and establish a New Zealand magazine, and daughter Marion. Baeyertz started attending church with her husband, and she decided to convert to Christianity for her children's sake {{towards the end of the}} 1860s, when Marion was baptised. She didn't believe in the Christian tenets, so she had a friend fill in her baptism application to ensure that the answers were correct.|$|E
500|$|Burke is {{replaced}} by Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who immediately dislikes Yang for her trend of having affairs with famous surgeons, such as Burke, {{going so far as}} refusing to let her scrub in on cardiac surgeries. Eventually, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) moves in with Yang, and she still tries to earn Hahn's approval. Hahn reveals that she dislikes Yang because she reminds her of an early version of herself and continues to cut Yang out of cardio surgeries and neglects to teach her, before eventually quitting the hospital and leaving Seattle Grace without a head of cardio. [...] Without a teacher, Yang begins to seriously doubt the purpose of remaining in her place at Seattle Grace when the program falls to twelfth on a list of the best teaching hospitals, and Burke wins the Harper-Avery award without mentioning <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> despite her saving his career. Yang tells the Chief that her current existence in the hospital is [...] "unbearable" [...] and that she has turned into a ghost.|$|E

After being introduced to town officials, they took a train to Mainz, where they had breakfast, before taking a steamer along the Rhine to Gustavsburg. From there, they took a train to Darmstadt, where they were greeted with great enthusiasm. Alice wrote back to her mother that [...] "I believe the people never gave so hearty a welcome", while her sister Helena wrote that [...] "nothing {{could have been more}} enthusiastic than her entry into Darmstadt was″. Alice did not adapt immediately to her new surroundings. She was homesick, and could not believe that while she was so far away from England, her father was not still alive and comforting her mother. The Queen confided to her journal: Already nearly a fortnight since our dear Alice has left and strange to say – much as she has been to me – and dear and precious as a comfort and an assistance, I hardly miss <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> or felt her going – so utterly alone am I – by that one dreadful loss – that one thought, that everything passed by unheeded! ...|$|E
500|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in development, Todd Ciolek of Anime News Network was unimpressed by Lightning, whom {{he called}} a [...] "businesslike blank". Reviewing the {{finished}} game, Ciolek opined that Lightning is initially [...] "far too distant and cold, as though the writers were so intent on creating a tough, competent heroine that they forgot to make <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> compelling". However, he admitted that Lightning becomes a more appealing lead character by the game's end. Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com simply referred to Lightning as a female version of Cloud. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parrish commented that, barring scenes in which Lightning shows a thoughtful side, she is [...] "your typical, sullen [...] protagonist". Conversely, GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd called Lightning a [...] "likeable, strong-willed beauty". Martin Robinson of IGN UK said that Lightning [...] "instantly endears herself" [...] in comparison with Hope or Snow, but he found that, when Lightning's backstory [...] "gets bogged down in generic swash", Sazh becomes the more appealing character. GamesRadar's Carolyin Gudmundson was unenthusiastic: she opined that, while Lightning's narrative has its merits, it [...] "certainly isn't above and beyond what we'd typically expect". She commented that this lack of originality makes Lightning [...] "one-dimensional and boring". Gamasutra writer Christian Nutt believed that Lightning's relationships with the cast add humanity to the narrative.|$|E
500|$|Obsessed {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics. Based on 85 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film has}} a [...] "Rotten" [...] rating from critics, with 19% positive reviews and an average rating of 3.7 out of 10. The site's consensus reads [...] "The inevitable Fatal Attraction comparisons aside, Obsessed is a generic, toothless thriller both instantly predictable and instantly forgettable." [...] Another review aggreatator, Metacritic, gave the film a weighted mean score of 25 out of 100, based on ten reviews from mainstream critics. A common complaint about the film was that, unlike most [...] "deranged stalker"-themed films, Obsessed did not explain why Lisa was so determined to seduce Derek, who showed no interest in <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Variety John Anderson and The Hollywood Reporter Kirk Honeycutt criticized Lisa's lack of motive and backstory. Stella Papamichael of Digital Spy called the film predictable and blamed the well-defined morality of the characters. She wrote, [...] "Unlike the bunny-boiling '80s classic Fatal Attraction, the characters are drawn in 2D. They are either good or bad, and {{there is absolutely no}} attempt to understand what drives them either way." [...] Liz Braun from Jam! lambasted the lack of character development in Obsessed and called it [...] "a chemistry-free movie". Jason McKiernan of Filmcritic.com described the film as [...] "so steeped in the formula of the psycho-sexual suspense flick that it works as both a thriller and a comedy" [...] and [...] "very good trash".|$|E

500|$|One of {{the major}} criticisms of the game stemmed from a {{disparity}} between the emotional thrust {{of the story and}} the actions of the player, with GameTrailers' Justin Speer pointing out that while the story attempted to characterise Lara Croft as vulnerable and uncomfortable with killing, the player was encouraged to engage enemies aggressively and use brutal tactics to earn more experience points. Speer felt that this paradoxical approach ultimately let the game down as it undermined Lara's character {{to the point where he}} found it difficult to identify with <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> IGN's Keza MacDonald also highlighted the issue, but was less critical of it than Speer, pointing out that both Lara and the player had to adapt quickly to killing in order to survive. However, Game Informers Matt Miller noted that the game offered the player several options for progressing through its combat situations, and that the player could avoid open conflict entirely if they chose to do so. He also praised the behaviour and presence of the enemies for the way they felt like they had actual tasks to perform on the island, rather than being clusters of polygons whose only function was to be killed by the player in order for them to progress. While on the subject of character development, GamesRadar's Ryan Taljonick expressed that the supporting characters were underdeveloped relative to Lara Croft, describing them as [...] "pretty generic characters who, while rarely annoying, just aren't memorable".|$|E
500|$|Sarah Trimmer {{was born}} on 6 January 1741 in Ipswich, England to Joshua Kirby and Sarah (née Bell); {{her father was a}} noted artist and served as President of the Society of Artists of Great Britain. Trimmer had one younger brother, William; she was {{apparently}} the better writer, for she would sometimes compose his school essays for him. As a young girl, Trimmer attended Mrs. Justiner’s boarding school in Ipswich, an experience she always remembered fondly. In 1755, the family moved to London when her father, who had written several important works on perspective, became the tutor of perspective to the Prince of Wales. Because of her father's connections within the artistic community, Trimmer was able to meet the painters William Hogarth and Thomas Gainsborough as well as the by-then legendary writer and critic Samuel Johnson. She made a favourable impression on Johnson when she immediately produced her pocket copy of John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667) to help settle a dispute between her father and Johnson over a particular passage. Johnson, delighted that she admired Milton enough to carry his works with <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times, [...] "subsequently invited her to his house and presented her with a volume of his famous periodical The Rambler". In 1759, at the urging of his former pupil the Prince of Wales (soon to be George III), her father was made Clerk of the Works to the Royal Household at Kew Palace and the family moved to Kew. There she met James Trimmer, whom she married on 21 September 1762; after their marriage, the couple moved to Old Brentford.|$|E
500|$|Club member Finn (Cory Monteith) is {{concerned}} for his future, having {{been told by}} his girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron) that she is pregnant with his child. Emma suggests that instead of aiming to attend college on a football scholarship, Finn should utilize his musical talent. Believing Rachel's participation to be the glee club's only chance at success at Invitationals, Finn feigns romantic interest in Rachel and takes her on a date. Rachel, realizing she is unhappy performing in the school musical and excited over Finn's interest in her, returns to the glee club. Meanwhile, Kurt, Mercedes and Tina are informed of Quinn's pregnancy by Puck (Mark Salling), who pretends Finn fathered the child though he is the actual father. Finding out about Quinn, Rachel becomes furious with Finn and confronts him, asking if he is actually attracted to <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Finn insists the kiss they shared was honest, but Rachel is unconvinced and defects from glee club once again, returning to the school musical, where she is given full artistic control. At Invitationals, a drunk April, accompanied by the glee club, performs Carrie Underwood's [...] "Last Name" [...] for a packed auditorium and receives the standing ovation she always dreamed of. Because she had performed drunk, Will tells April during intermission that {{she is no longer}} in the glee club. She accepts, telling him that she has realized that it is the kids, not her, who are the ones that should get the spotlight. This leaves New Directions without a lead singer for their next number, but Rachel offers to go on in April's place—she has quit the musical, and wants to rejoin the club—and they all perform Queen's [...] "Somebody to Love".|$|E
