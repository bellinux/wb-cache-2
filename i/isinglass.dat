5|$|Ladas {{was then}} matched against <b>Isinglass,</b> the Triple Crown winner of 1893, in the £10,000 Princess of Wales's Stakes over one mile at Newmarket on 5 July. The race {{attracted}} {{a large crowd}} including the Prince of Wales (who supported <b>Isinglass)</b> and the Queen's cousin George, Duke of Cambridge (who favoured Ladas). The field also included Raeburn, the only horse to have beaten <b>Isinglass,</b> Ravensbury, who had won impressively at Royal Ascot, and Bullingdon, who had recovered from the bout of coughing that had reportedly affected him at Epsom. The early pace was slow, and Watts held Ladas up behind the leaders before moving into the lead just over a furlong out. He was immediately challenged, however, and overtaken inside the final furlong by both <b>Isinglass</b> and Bullingdon. <b>Isinglass</b> prevailed by a short head with Ladas, who was eased in the closing stages, finishing a well-beaten third. Ladas appeared to be perfectly sound after the race, and the only explanation offered (by The Sportsman) was that the slow pace (the winning time was 1:48.4) had produced a false result.|$|E
5|$|Some {{smaller and}} more {{colourful}} species serve as aquarium specimens and pets. Sea wolves {{are used in the}} leather industry. <b>Isinglass</b> is made from thread fish and drum fish.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} design {{completed by}} McDonnell Aircraft in 1965 is usually {{considered part of}} Project <b>Isinglass,</b> however some documents refer to the aircraft as having been codenamed Project Rheinberry. McDonnell's proposed boost-glide aircraft, submitted to the CIA independently of the Convair <b>Isinglass</b> proposals, featured a small, manned, rocket-powered craft with a high lift-to-drag ratio that would be air-launched by a B-52 bomber while flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft would ignite its rocket engine and adopt a trajectory that would take it over the Soviet Union at speeds of Mach 20 and {{at an altitude of}} over , before descending over the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, landing on the lake bed using a skid landing gear.|$|E
5|$|In Autumn La Fleche {{attempted}} {{to win a}} second Manchester Plate, but finished third to the three-year-colts Raeburn, and <b>Isinglass.</b> The race had been expected to lie between La Fleche and <b>Isinglass,</b> and their respective jockeys focused their attentions on each other, allowing Raeburn to emerge almost unseen to take the race in the closing stages. For this race, La Fleche carried a weight of 154 pounds. On 25 October she found a weight of 133 pound too much when finishing unplaced in the Cambridgeshire. She won the Lowther Stakes at Newmarket in October. On 10 November she ran in the Liverpool Autumn Cup, carrying a weight of 132 pounds and won in impressive style by one and a quarter lengths from The Prisoner. Later in November, she was beaten under 137 pounds in the Manchester November Handicap.|$|E
5|$|Ladas {{was kept}} in {{training}} as a four-year-old for the 1895 season. Rosebery issued a challenge to Isinglass's owner, Harry McCalmont, for a match race between Ladas and <b>Isinglass</b> to take place at Newmarket in May. McCalmont declined as {{he did not want}} to disrupt his horse's preparation for the Ascot Gold Cup.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are raised}} {{for a wide}} variety of products, principally meat, wool, milk, and eggs, but also {{including}} tallow, <b>isinglass</b> and rennet. Animals are also kept for more specialised purposes, such as to produce vaccines and antiserum (containing antibodies) for medical use. Where fodder or other crops are grown alongside animals, manure can serve as a fertiliser, returning minerals and organic matter to the soil in a semi-closed organic system.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1967, the US Air Force funded a study into {{advanced}} {{rocket propulsion}} systems for use during Project <b>Isinglass,</b> with Rocketdyne asked to investigate aerospike engines and Pratt & Whitney (P) to research more efficient conventional de Laval nozzle-type engines. At {{the conclusion of}} the study, P put forward a proposal for a 250,000lbf engine called the XLR-129, which used a two-position expanding nozzle to provide increased efficiency over a wide range of altitudes.|$|E
5|$|When the CIA {{failed to}} receive {{approval}} for funding, McDonnell approached the U.S. Air Force with the project; however the Air Force proved uninterested in adopting the CIA project, despite {{the support of}} General Bernard Schriever, chief of the Air Force Systems Command. Therefore, in late 1967 the <b>Isinglass</b> project was terminated, with a brief effort to revive the project in 1968 proving unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff {{determined}} that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting {{would soon be}} beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of <b>isinglass</b> adhesive and chalk was used to restore {{the surface of the}} painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added {{to the back of the}} painting, and the three layers were glued together.|$|E
5|$|Project <b>Isinglass</b> was {{developed}} {{as a result of}} the vulnerability of existing manned reconnaissance aircraft, such as the Lockheed U-2 and the Lockheed A-12, to Soviet air defenses in the early 1960s, catalysed by the shooting down in May 1960 of Francis Gary Powers. Although there were continuing plans to overfly the Soviet Union with the A-12 – referred to by the CIA as Project Oxcart – these failed to come to pass, and the CIA began plans for an aircraft with superior performance to replace Oxcart.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing as}} Headington United, orange and blue striped shirts were worn with navy shorts and socks. The {{design of the}} shirt changed regularly, with the stripes being changed every few seasons. After joining the Southern League, the blue stripes were lost for good and a lighter shade of orange {{was used for the}} shirt. The yellow kit was first worn during the 1957–58 season, with black shorts and yellow socks. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the black shorts were first {{replaced}} with yellow ones, and then with light blue shorts. Since the early 1990s, the strip has been composed of the yellow shirt and navy coloured shorts and socks. A large variety of away kits has been used over the years, ranging from red and black stripes on the shirts, to a fully white kit. The first sponsor to appear on the shirt was Sunday Journal, a local newspaper, in 1982. Between 1983 and 1985, there were three sponsors: BPCC, Pergamon and the Sunday People. Following those were Wang Laboratories (1985 to 1989), Pergamon (1989 to 1991), Unipart (1991 to 2000), Domino (2000 to 2001) and Buildbase (from the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001 to 2010). Following the return to the Football League, Bridle Insurance were announced as new shirt sponsors. The Bridle deal ended after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season. The home sponsor for the 2013–14 season was announced as Animalates, with the away kit being sponsored by <b>Isinglass</b> Consulting for that same season after winning an innovative prize draw. That one-year deal with <b>Isinglass</b> was extended for the 2014–15 season, again featuring on the away kits only.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of Guinness, {{as with many}} beers, also {{involves the use of}} <b>isinglass</b> made from fish. <b>Isinglass</b> is used as a fining agent for settling out suspended matter in the vat. The <b>isinglass</b> is retained in the floor of the vat but it is possible that minute quantities might be carried over into the beer.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe it}} is if {{properly}} prepared – {{it is the same}} substance as <b>Isinglass.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tannic acid (or gallotannic) C76-H52-O46 is {{used for}} the {{clarification}} of white wine, using casein, gelatin, or <b>Isinglass.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1795 Murdoch {{developed}} {{a replacement for}} <b>isinglass,</b> a precipitate made from sturgeon used in the clarifying of beer to remove impurities, {{which had to be}} imported from Russia at great expense. Murdoch's replacement was made from dried Cod and was much cheaper than the 25 shillings a pound which <b>isinglass</b> cost. This cost saving was so attractive that the Committee of London Brewers paid £2000 for the right to use his invention.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century {{gelatine}} and <b>isinglass</b> {{production was}} well established at a site on West Street, production continued until ceasing in the late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Before 1800, swim {{bladders}} of sturgeon (primarily Beluga sturgeon from Russia) {{were used}} {{as a source of}} <b>isinglass,</b> a form of collagen used historically for the clarification of wine and beer, as a predecessor for gelatin, and to preserve parchments.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{and other}} aquatic organisms are also {{processed}} into various food and non-food products, such as sharkskin leather, pigments {{made from the}} inky secretions of cuttlefish, <b>isinglass</b> used for the clarification of wine and beer, fish emulsion used as a fertilizer, fish glue, fish oil and fish meal.|$|E
25|$|In November 2015 it was {{announced}} that Guinness are planning to make their beer suitable for consumption by vegetarians and vegans by the end of 2016 through the introduction of a new filtration process at their existing Guinness Brewery that avoids the need to use <b>Isinglass</b> from fish bladders to filter out yeast particles.|$|E
25|$|Commercially {{valuable}} {{minerals and}} rocks {{are referred to}} as industrial minerals. For example, muscovite, a white mica, can be used for windows (sometimes referred to as <b>isinglass),</b> as a filler, or as an insulator. Ores are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element, typically a metal. Examples are cinnabar (HgS), an ore of mercury, sphalerite (ZnS), an ore of zinc, or cassiterite (SnO2), an ore of tin. Gems are minerals with an ornamental value, and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty, durability, and usually, rarity. There are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals, which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones. Gem minerals are often present in several varieties, and so one mineral can account for several different gemstones; for example, ruby and sapphire are both corundum, Al2O3.|$|E
25|$|The import {{and export}} of foreign wares, and the {{revenues}} derived from taxing their transit, was {{a hallmark of}} the Khazar economy, though it is said also to have produced <b>isinglass.</b> Distinctively among the nomadic steppe polities, the Khazar Qağanate developed a self-sufficient domestic Saltovo economy, a combination of traditional pastoralism – allowing sheep and cattle to be exported – extensive agriculture, abundant use of the Volga's rich fishing stocks, together with craft manufacture, with a diversification in lucrative returns from taxing international trade given its pivotal control of major trade routes. The Khazars constituted one of the two great furnishers of slaves to the Muslim market (the other being the Iranian Sâmânid amîrs), supplying it with captured Slavs and tribesmen from the Eurasian northlands. It was profits from the latter which enabled it to maintain a standing army of Khwarezm Muslim troops. The capital Atil reflected the division: Kharazān on the western bank where the king and his Khazar elite, with a retinue of some 4,000 attendants, dwelt, and Itil proper to the East, inhabited by Jews, Christians, Muslims and slaves and by craftsmen and foreign merchants. The ruling elite wintered in the city and spent from spring to late autumns in their fields. A large irrigated greenbelt, drawing on channels from the Volga river, lay outside the capital, where meadows and vineyards extended for some 20 farsakhs (ca. 60 miles?). While customs duties were imposed on traders, and tribute and tithes were exacted from 25–30 tribes, with a levy of one sable skin, squirrel pelt, sword, dirham per hearth or ploughshare, or hides, wax, honey and livestock, depending on the zone. Trade disputes were handled by a commercial tribunal in Atil consisting of seven judges, two for each of the monotheistic inhabitants (Jews, Muslims, Christians) and one for the pagans.|$|E
500|$|In the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on 20 July, Ladas met <b>Isinglass</b> again, {{this time}} over ten furlongs on soft ground. <b>Isinglass</b> started {{favourite}} at 4/5 (0.8/1) with Ladas on 13/8 (1.6/1) {{and the other}} runners, who included Raeburn, Ravensbury and a filly named Throstle virtually ignored. The outsider Priestholme set off at an unsustainably fast pace, followed by <b>Isinglass,</b> with Watts restraining Ladas towards the rear. Priestholme dropped away in the straight, leaving <b>Isinglass</b> in the lead with Watts moving Ladas up to challenge. The two Derby winners dominated the race in the closing stages {{but in spite of}} a [...] "game pursuit", Ladas was unable to overhaul <b>Isinglass,</b> who won by a length {{with the rest of the}} field, headed by Throstle, well beaten. There were no excuses for Ladas: Watts admitted that he had been beaten by a better horse.|$|E
500|$|Project <b>Isinglass</b> was {{the code}} name given to two heavily classified, manned {{reconnaissance}} aircraft studied by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as potential replacements for the Lockheed A-12 and SR-71 during the mid 1960s. The first proposal under the <b>Isinglass</b> name, a high-altitude plane to fly at , {{was considered an}} insufficient advancement over existing aircraft; the second, much more advanced design, {{sometimes referred to as}} Project Rheinberry, was an air-launched, [...] rocket-powered boost-glide aircraft that would use a very-high-altitude trajectory to avoid defenses. This aircraft was considered too costly for development, and the project was abandoned in 1967.|$|E
500|$|Examples of {{clarifying}} agents include <b>isinglass,</b> {{obtained from}} swimbladders of fish; Irish moss, a seaweed; kappa carrageenan, from the seaweed Kappaphycus cottonii; Polyclar (artificial); and gelatin. If a beer is marked [...] "suitable for Vegans", it was clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{development}} of the Isinglass/Rheinberry aircraft was conducted using McDonnell's own funding, the United States Air Force's Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory did fund {{the development}} of the aircraft's intended engine, the Pratt & Whitney XLR-129, intended to be a reusable rocket engine. To be powered by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and producing [...] thrust at full throttle, development of the XLR-129 continued even after the cancellation of Project <b>Isinglass,</b> and was considered for use by the Space Shuttle, but was cancelled in the early 1970s.|$|E
500|$|In {{a career}} that lasted from 1893 to 1894, Ladas ran eleven times and won seven races. He was the leading British two-year-old of 1893, being unbeaten in four starts {{including}} the Champagne Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes. In the following year, he won the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket and the Derby at Epsom to complete the first two legs of the English Triple Crown. He was beaten by the four-year-old colt <b>Isinglass</b> in his next two starts and failed in his bid for the Triple Crown when beaten in the St Leger at Doncaster.|$|E
500|$|On {{her final}} {{start of the}} year she met Ravensbury again in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 9 October. As the owners of <b>Isinglass</b> had turned down a {{challenge}} to run his horse against La Fleche, they were the only two runners and the mare, ridden by Watts started at odds of 1/3. La Fleche opened up a clear lead in the early stages and was never in danger of defeat, winning [...] "in a canter" [...] by eight lengths. As the mare galloped up the hill with her ears pricked, she was given an enthusiastic reception from the Newmarket crowd who knew they were witnessing her final race.|$|E
500|$|After the boil, the wort was cooled and {{fermented}} in open wooden vats at [...] [...] The two {{strains of}} yeast were added at the same time, and fermentation would proceed rapidly. [...] After one day of fermentation, the thick foam that formed {{on the top of}} the fermentation vat was skimmed off and discarded. After 60 hours, up to 50% of the available sugars would have been fermented by the yeast, and thick clumps of yeast were skimmed off of the surface and harvested for reuse. [...] The beer was then pumped with sterile air into clarification tanks. [...] <b>Isinglass</b> was added to clarify the beverage, and then it was bottled.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{aircraft}} proposed {{under the}} Project <b>Isinglass</b> name {{was developed by}} the Convair division of General Dynamics, and was developed from work done on the Super Hustler, FISH, and Kingfish programs, as well as leveraging off work done on the F-111 tactical bomber. Convair's design utilised avionics and hydraulics systems that had been developed for use by the F-111, and was intended to be capable of cruising at speeds of Mach 4 to Mach 5, at an altitude of [...] The feasibility study conducted by General Dynamics was completed in the fall of 1964; the aircraft was determined to be too costly, and was also still considered potentially vulnerable to projected Soviet air defense capabilities, so the project was halted.|$|E
500|$|Grodziskie is {{a highly}} carbonated, low-alcohol beer with a clear, pale yellow to golden color, low to {{moderate}} levels of hop bitterness, and a moderate to medium-high smoky aroma and flavor. [...] The bright, clear, and highly carbonated appearance of Grodziskie has caused the beer to be compared with Champagne, and it is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Polish Champagne". Most beers that are made from wheat appear cloudy, because the final product contains suspended yeast and proteins from the wheat. [...] During the production of Grodziskie, however, the beer is filtered before it is bottled, usually by adding <b>isinglass.</b> [...] The filtration removes the suspended yeast and proteins, leaving a bright, clear beer. [...] When poured into a glass, it produces a large, long-lasting, tight head with small bubbles. [...] It was traditionally served in tall, conical glasses that were designed to show off the clear, golden color, as well allow a wide, thick layer of foam to form when it was poured.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Isinglass,</b> {{from the}} swim {{bladders}} of fish, is still {{used as a}} fining agent for wine and beer. Besides hartshorn jelly, from deer antlers (hence the name [...] "hartshorn"), <b>isinglass</b> {{was one of the}} oldest sources of gelatin.|$|E
2500|$|Update: On the company's faq-page they say: [...] "Our new {{filtration}} {{process has}} removed {{the use of}} <b>isinglass</b> {{as a means of}} filtration and vegans can now enjoy a pint of Guinness. All Guinness Draught in keg format is brewed without using <b>isinglass.</b> Full distribution of bottle and can formats will be in place by the end of 2017, so until then, our advice to vegans is to consume the product from the keg format only for now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murdoch's <b>isinglass</b> {{replacement}} was {{so effective}} {{that in a}} court case brought by the British Customs and Excise Authorities, the noted chemist, Sir Humphry Davy in {{answer to a question}} on whether it was [...] "proper to be used for the purpose of fineing beer" [...] testified that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Wenlock (1869) [...] {{finished}} {{fourth in the}} Derby before winning the St. Leger later in the 1872 season. He sired several good horses including top juvenile Panzerschiff and Sussex Stakes winner Limestone and his Prince of Wales's Stakes winning brother Quicklime. However, he was better known as a broodmare sire, producing the dams of <b>Isinglass</b> and Sainfoin.|$|E
2500|$|To be {{considered}} kosher, a wine {{may only be}} handled by observant Jews {{from the time the}} grapes are crushed. If, however, the wine is boiled or pasteurized, it may subsequently be handled by anyone without losing its kosher status. [...] Additionally, kosher wine cannot contain any non-kosher ingredients or fining agents such as <b>isinglass,</b> gelatin or casein. [...] Although not all Israeli wine is kosher, virtually all of the large producers in Israel have kosher certification.|$|E
2500|$|Philosopher Gary Steiner {{argues that}} it is not {{possible}} to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are [...] "deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society". Animal products in common use include albumen, allantoin, beeswax, blood, bone char, bone china, carmine, casein, castoreum, cochineal, elastin, emu oil, gelatin, honey, <b>isinglass,</b> keratin, lactic acid, lanolin, lard, rennet, retinol, shellac, squalene, tallow/sodium tallowate, whey and yellow grease. Some of these are chemical compounds that can be derived from animal products, plants, or petrochemicals. Allantoin, lactic acid, retinol and squalene, for example, can be vegan. These products and their origins are not always included in the list of ingredients.|$|E
