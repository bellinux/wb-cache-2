And they are bound by the same covenant to produce all those books upon requisition, although they should be mixed with affairs concerning their own private negotiations and transactions of commerce, or their closest and most retired concerns in private life. But as the great corrective of all, they have contrived that every proceeding in public council shall be written,--no debates merely verbal. The arguments, first or last, are to be in writing, and recorded. All other bodies, the Houses of Lords, Commons, Privy Council, Cabinet Councils for secret state deliberations, enter only resolves, decisions, and final resolutions of affairs: the argument, the discussion, the dissent, does very rarely, if at all, appear. But the Company has proceeded much further, and done much more wisely, because they proceeded upon mercantile principles; and they have provided, either by orders or course of office, that all shall be written,--the proposition, the argument, the dissent. This {{is not confined to}} their great Council; but this order ought to be observed, as I conceive, (and I see considerable traces of it in practice,) in every Provincial Council, whilst the Provincial Councils existed, and even down to the minutest ramification of their service.

Under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 2 ̆ 2 parent unions, 2 ̆ 2 as parties to collective bargaining contracts, are subject to liability for damages in federal court for breach of no-strike agreements. A parent union, however, cannot be held liable to an employer for a work stoppage not authorized or ratified by it. Such unauthorized work stoppages are commonly referred to as wildcat strikes. Recently, the Supreme Court held in Carbon Fuel Co. v. United Mine Workers, that a no-strike clause implied no obligation on the part of the parent union to take affirmative steps to end wildcat strikes. In a subsequent decision, however, the Sixth Circuit in United Steelworkers of American v. Lorain held that a no-strike provision which included an express promise to 2 ̆ 2 actively discourage an endeavor to [...] . terminate 2 ̆ 2 all strikes did not create a duty on the part of the international union to attempt to end a wildcat strike. This Note will examine the legislative goals of Section 301 and the implementation of these goals by the courts. Further, it will be argued that the Sixth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s holding in Lorain diverges from these well-recognized goals. Specifically, it will be argued that 1) an <b>express</b> <b>covenant</b> creating a duty on the part of the parent union to take affirmative steps toward ending an unauthorized work stoppage should be enforced given the underlying policies of congressional labor legislation; 2) the Lorain court improperly construed the no-strike agreement, particularly in light of these congressional policies; and 3) enforcement of an affirmative duty to end wildcat strikes would not undermine the union 2 ̆ 7 s position as the representative of its membership...|$|E

The latter requires an understanding of the civil court system and the legal personnel of the law (solicitors, barristers and judges).

He went on, saying, 'A’s duty is a duty not to make a particular use of A’s land; and A’s duty enhances B’s Freehold or Lease (i.e. benefits B’s land); and A’s duty, when created, is not intended to impose only a personal duty on A.' ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Th. (New Testament)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus in {{association}} with Greenwich School of Theology, U. K., 2007. The covenant idea has received an abundance of attention via the investigation of Pauline writings in light of certain aspects of Palestinian Judaism. Assuming Luke's association with Paul, this makes all the more plausible an inquiry into the possibility of similar avenues of Judaic influence upon the covenant idea in the two-volume Lukan work. Examining {{the work of a}} representative group of influential scholars reveals that {{there seems to be a}} paucity of in-depth research on the covenant concept in the Lukan writings. Explicit references to the covenant idea do receive direct attention by scholarship; however, allusions to the covenant idea in Luke-Acts are not always noted. In the case of implicit references, usually but not always only aspects of the covenant concept are detected. Promise-fulfilment terminology is key to any meaningful investigation. Scholarship recognizes the basic presence of the covenant idea, which is derived from God's promissory grace expressed to the Patriarchs. To this general observation is added commentary on the new covenant established by Christ at the Lord's Supper. Only a few scholars indicate an awareness of the basic interrelation of the covenants in the continuum of redemptive history spanning the Old and New Testaments. Background to the covenant concept is supplied by the OT, the LXX and Palestinian Judaism. The OT presents a concept of the covenant governed by two aspects, the unilateral and the bilateral. However, at the heart of the OT covenant relationship is its unifying inviolability. The Septuagint consistently translates berit as diatheke, which simply demonstrates the LXX translators' understanding of the covenant as divinely established. Palestinian Judaism has inherited emphases from the post-exilic period and is much indebted to its intertestamental history as it embraces an understanding in which the covenant idea becomes enshrouded by an intellectual development on the torah. This, in effect, precipitated a curious bilateralism, exacting an emphasis that rivals the pre-eminence of the unilateral aspect of the covenant concept as regards promised blessings. Luke writes his two-volume work with this backdrop as he follows the LXX and <b>expresses</b> the <b>covenant</b> idea by using diatheke. The Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles contain five explicit references and sixteen implicit references to the covenant idea, Luke presents the covenant predominantly in its unilateral form. God is fulfilling in Jesus that which he promised and as a result is bringing about salvation. For Luke, the covenant concept gives reason for salvation of God in Jesus. Luke-Acts refers primarily to the Abrahamic and the Davidic covenants both in explicit and implicit references. The Davidic covenant is used to identify Jesus as the one anointed to dispense promised salvation. The Abrahamic covenant is referred to in order to identify those to whom the promised blessings of salvation and mercy are offered and will be given. That is to Jews as well as Gentiles, The Mosaic covenant is alluded to for the purpose of drawing attention to Israel's unfaithfulness and skewed understanding of how covenant blessings are conferred and is not a positive contributor to the scheme of salvation in Luke-Acts. This buffers Luke from the unmitigated influence of Palestinian Judaism in which the bilateral aspect of the covenant factors influentially in its soteriology. Also, Luke seems to be aware of the spiritual dimension of the covenant idea via allusion to the Isaianic eternal covenant. A comparison of Luke's presentation of the covenant idea with that of Paul's reveals a number of differentiating concerns. One of Paul's interests is the function of the covenant in justification. The Mosaic covenant is limited in its ability to justify. Therefore, covenant blessings can only be promised-based fulfilled in the sacrificial redemption of Christ. For Jews and Gentiles, the Abrahamic covenant provides access by faith to the covenant blessings, Luke differs in that the covenants in Christ relate ultimately to ecclesiological concerns. Luke, therefore, presents the covenant idea according to a Christianized Judaic hermeneutic, where the covenant is primarily instrumental in giving reason for the salvific work of God in Christ. He also uses it to evoke a unilaterally defined sense of covenant identity for the readers and to integrate them into faithful Israel. Master...|$|R
40|$|In this {{systematic}} theological Thesis, {{the focus was}} to look at Christian Faith as a personal relationship between God and man. Christian faith is not primarily about agreeing with truth statements but about living in fellowship with a personal God. My aim was to get insight {{into the nature of}} this personal relationship: should we interpret this relationship as (1) a relation between two individuals or (2) between two communal entities? As representatives of respectively individual faith and communal faith, I have chosen to analyse the theologies of Vincent Brümmer and John Zizioulas in depth. In Chapter 1, I have developed criteria for systematic theology: a proposal is acceptable {{to the extent that it}} is (1) consistent, (2) coherent, (3) consonant with the Christian tradition, (4) adequate for our context and (5) entails a personal understanding of God. Furthermore, we should consider that a model also claims to speak about reality. In Chapter 2, Vincent Brümmer’s model of love as a relationship of mutual fellowship is examined. He speaks of human love relationships, which are personal and which bestow value on the beloved one. By way of analogy, this is applied to the relationship between God and man. God is the one who loves us, by making our good His own. Choosing to live in fellowship with God means to do His will. The relation can be broken and restored. According to John Zizioulas (Chapter 3), the personal relationship between God and man should be perceived as a relation between two communal entities. On the one hand there is the triune God; on the other hand the human person. God the Father is the person to whom we relate, but person should be understood in a relational way. ‘Personhood’ can only exist in communion. This is the ultimate mode of being and therefore God, as ultimate communion (Father, Son and Spirit), is being par excellence. To become human beings without ontological limitations (ecclesial hypostases, or ‘persons’), we should live in communion with God. I have analysed Brümmer’s and Zizioulas’ understanding of personhood, the Trinity, and relationality. Chapter 4 thus has shown us the details and implications of their views. In Chapter 5, we have looked at the conceptual price that has to be paid if we adopt Brümmer’s or Zizioulas’ model. These prices were high, and therefore I inquired: is there a way of conceptualizing the personal relationship without becoming individualists or speculating wildly about intra-trinitarian postulates? With the metaphor of covenantal-relationship, I cover two important aspects: (1) it is a relation between to personal entities and (2) it offers a middle way between a communal and individual interpretation of the personal relationship between God and man. Both parties freely decide to maintain a relationship according to a certain agreement. In theology, the <b>covenant</b> <b>expresses</b> that God is faithful to man even though man estranges from God over and again. It is a personal relation because man is treated as a person (because he is free and loved intrinsically). Human freedom is thus respected. God’s sovereignty is guaranteed because He freely chooses to be a loving God who desires to live in fellowship with His people. Because man breaks the covenant over and again, God has sent His son to restore the relationship. With help of the Spirit, we can still live in the presence of God. Together we form the people of God which is the other party of the covenant of love. This does not lead an egalitarian or collective understanding but gives us space to be valued because of our personal identity. With help of the understanding of the church as a body, i. e. the Body of Christ, we can understand that each part (each individual and each Christian community) is valued by its identity. Without this dimension, Christian faith would become individualistic. The metaphor of covenant thus provides us with a perspective on the personal love-relationship between God and man which opens our horizon for the importance of the community...|$|R
40|$|The Westminster Assembly is {{a useful}} {{starting}} point for detailed discussions {{of the development of}} covenantal thought, particularly in view of the direction taken by recent studies which place a strong dichotomy between the early Reformers and their seventeenth-century successors, notably between John Calvin and those who have traditionally been designated 'Calvinists'. The most extreme, or virulent, of these is an unsparing attack upon the Westminster Confession as one of the principal reservoirs of 'a plague that had long infected the Reformed churches'. In seeking to overthrow what he described as 'the treasured confession of my mother church', the author made the astonishing claim, which puts this basic issue in a curious nutshell: 'It was Calvin who rescued me from the Calvinists". And the deadly virus identified as the cause of this plague was the Confession's covenantal statements, of which it was said, 'Calvin knew nothing, for these theological innovations were the work of his successors'. In order to set the scene, therefore, Part One of the thesis has been devoted to a consideration of the background to the Westminster Assembly and its documents, and examination of the sources and content of the theology of the <b>covenant</b> <b>expressed</b> in the standards, and also a critical survey of the historiography of the covenant from around the middle of the last century to the present time. The historical background to the Assembly as it relates to both the English and Scottish churches is designed to get the feel of the general ecclesiastical climate and theological orientation in which the divines and their immediate predecessors lived and moved, while the examination of sources and content more particularly indentifies the direction from which the doctrine of the covenant came to be embodied in the Confession and Catechisms, and also the issues which are emphasized in, and immediately related to, the chapters dealing specifically with the covenant. The scriptural origin of the Reformed doctrine of the covenant is indisputable, so that serious research in this area has never been considered necessary. The temptation to include a section on Scripture in this study has likewise been resisted, but its importance has been kept in mind throughout. In order to demonstrate that the idea of the covenant as held by the Reformed church, even in many of its particular aspects, was no new thing, Part Two picks up some of the threads offered by forerunners in the field. These include several of the church fathers, notably Augustine. The survival and use of the idea in both its political and theological applications during the medieval period has not been overlooked. It was found that the idea of the covenant had specific government, hermeneutical and sotcriological functions in medieval thought which were by no means despised or abandoned in the reaction of the Reformation against medieval scholasticism. Among the early reformers, Luther's theology held firmly to the basic concepts underlying covenantal theology, but it was in the Reformed camp that the importance of the doctrine was chiefly recognized and utilized in the controversies of the tome, first by Occolampadius and Zwingli and then more distinctly by Bullinger, whose little monograph De Testamento seu fordere tlei unico el aelerno was the first to appear on the subject. The findings of this research into Bullingcr's work interact strongly with those studies which regard Bullingcr's view of the covenant as strictly bilateral and consequently portray him as the founder of a separate Reformed tradition, distinct from that which emanated from Calvin and the Genevan school. Part Three is devoted entirely to Geneva, showing the seminal influence of Calvin's work in the development and transmission of covenantal though. In demonstrating that the covenant in both its unilateral and bilateral aspects was an essential part of Calvin's overall theological structure, the disputed questions as to whether Calvin was a 'convenant theologian', and whether he taught a covenant of works is carefully considered in its proper theological context and not merely with respect to the use of terms. For the first lime in any study of covenantal thought, detailed sttention has been given in this research to the work of Theodore Beza. Beza has been consistently singled out by those who oppose the Calvinists to Calvin, supralapsarian, scholastic orthodoxy which diverged manifestly from Calvin's warm, christocentric, humanistic, biblical theology. Just as consistently he has been denied any interest in the theology of the covencnt, with the result that 'covenant theology' has been interpreted as a reaction against Bezcan orthodoxy in an effort to recover a place for responsible man in the economy of salvation. The evidence, however, supplied by a wider consultation of Beza's works than his merely controversial writings, supports a contrary argument. Beza's basic fidelity to Calvin becomes apparent in controverted areas and the warm heart of a concerned pastor is heard to beat in his sermonic material. More importantly for this research Beza is found to have a keen interest in the covenant both unilaterally and bilaterally, particularly in relation to the doctrine of the union between Christ and his church, just as Calvin had before him and the Calvinists after him. In the final part of the thesis the issues and arguments already raised are followed through in representative writers from three main interrelated locations of post-reformation development in Reformed theology. One is the influence of the Heidelberg theologians, Ursinus and Olevianus, in the Palatinate Church of Germany. The others arc the English Puritan movement, dominated mainly by the influence of Willian Perkins, and the Scottish connection in the writings of Knox, Rollock anf Howie. It is the conclusion of this research that while covenantal theology inevitably underwent a process of refining and expansion, and was given fuller defination and varying emphases by later writers, that it nevertheless remained true to the central idea or ideas of the covenant as taught by the Reformers. Such a process cannot be constructed as constituting a fundamental shift or departure from the theology of the early Reformers. Rather there is a general agreement, a unity which makes the Westminster divines in this respect the worthy successors of Calvin and his colleagues...|$|R
