5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a Mediterranean climate. In the western United States, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland {{into the region}} due to a southward migration of the jet stream <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> season. This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather {{very similar to the}} western United States in this regard.|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War era, {{research}} on the Underground State was curtailed by Polish communist officials, who instead emphasized the role that communist partisans played in the anti-Nazi resistance.

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, {{its role}} in the event of war would have been as a medium {{reconnaissance}} unit for the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR).
