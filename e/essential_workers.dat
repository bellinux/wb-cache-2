25|$|Women {{also played}} an {{important}} role in British industrial production during the war, in areas such as metals, chemicals, munitions, shipbuilding and engineering. At the beginning of the war in 1939 17.8% of women made up employment in these industries and by 1943 they made up 38.2%. With the start of the war there was an urgent need to expand the country’s labour force and women were seen as a source of factory labour. Before the war women in industrial production were exclusively on assembly, which was seen as cheap and undemanding work but during the war women were needed in other areas in the production process that were previously done by men such as Lathe operators. The Ministry of Labour created training centres that gave an introduction to the engineering process, and by 1941 women were allowed entrance as the importance of the engineering industry grew and became a large source of female employment. Areas such as aircraft manufacture, light and heavy general engineering and motor vehicle manufacturing all saw an increase in female employment during the war. Aircraft production saw the largest rise in female employment as it rose from 7% in 1935 to 40% in 1944. At the start of the war men who were already in engineering were prevented from going to war because engineering was seen as an important industry to war production but in 1940 there became a need for more female workers to supply the necessary labour for factory expansion. By 1941 with the shortage of skilled labour the <b>Essential</b> <b>Workers</b> Order was introduced which required all skilled workers to register and prevented workers from quitting from jobs that were deemed essential to the war effort without agreement from a National Service Officer. The Registration for the Employment Order in 1941 and the Women of Employment Order in 1942 also attempted to get more women into the workforce. The Women of Employment Order required women ages 18–45 to register for labour exchanges and by 1943 the maximum age was raised to 50, which brought an additional 20,000 women into the workforce. Aircraft production was given the top labour priority and many women were diverted into it with some even being transferred from agricultural production.|$|E

50|$|In its review, GiveWell {{noted that}} ImmigrationWorks {{was one of}} the most {{prominent}} organizations advocating for freer migration of low-skilled workers to the United States. GiveWell argued that advocacy for low-skilled migration may be a better use of marginal funds, both because of the greater upside (there are more low-skilled workers, they are currently more heavily barred from entering, and they experience greater utility gains from migrating) and because there were fewer organizations focused on pushing for low-skilled migration, so there was more room for marginal additional impact. GiveWell mentioned two other groups that promote low-skilled migration to the United States: the Partnership for a New American Economy and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but noted that ImmigrationWorks was more focused on low-skilled migration. GiveWell also mentioned FWD.us (which does not promote low-skilled migration at all) and the <b>Essential</b> <b>Worker</b> Immigration Coalition (EWIC), a consortium that includes ImmigrationWorks and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but has no staff of its own.|$|R

50|$|Performing arts {{comprise}} dance, music, theatre, opera, mime, {{and other}} art forms {{in which a}} human performance is the principal product.

Products are broadly categorized as being either repeatable (for example, by script or score) or improvised for each performance. Artists who participate in these arts {{in front of an audience}} are called performers, including actors, magicians, comedians, dancers, musicians, and singers. Performing arts are also supported by the services of other artists or <b>essential</b> <b>workers,</b> such as songwriting and stagecraft.

50|$|When war was {{declared}} in 1939, Gamelin was France's commander in chief, with his headquarters at the Château de Vincennes. France saw little action during the Phoney War, {{apart from a}} few French divisions crossing the German border in the Saar Offensive, who advanced a mere 8 km. They stopped even before reaching Germany's unfinished Siegfried Line. According to General Siegfried Westphal, a German staff officer on the Western Front, if France had attacked in September 1939 German forces could not have held out {{for more than one}} or two weeks. Gamelin ordered his troops back behind the Maginot Line, but only after telling France's ally, Poland, that France had broken the Siegfried Line and that help was on its way. Gamelin's long-term strategy was to wait until France had fully rearmed and for the British and French armies to build up their forces, even though this would mean waiting until 1941. He prohibited any bombing of the industrial areas of the Ruhr, in case the Germans retaliated. The French mobilisation had called up many <b>essential</b> <b>workers,</b> which disrupted vital French industries in the first weeks of the campaign.|$|E
