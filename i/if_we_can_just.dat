5000|$|The excised Biblical quote {{possibly}} suggests {{good and}} evil cannot be known, or told apart. With the ape's study, the library of books and the caliper instruments, the suggestion is the statue is warning against the application of rationalism {{in the absence of}} morality. Furthermore, when a human is depicted holding a skull, it is usually a comment on mortality and the inevitability of death; famously, Hamlet bereaves Yorick in one instance, but is soon repulsed by this macabre souvenir as it brings him face-to-face with all life's grim destiny. But, for Hugo Rheinhold's ape, it is something quite different. The ape is engaged in assessment and measurement (confirmed by the calipers). That we should even consider this level of intelligence in another species is a bold examination of ourselves through eyes that bear witness to the disproportionate leverage historically awarded humankind. Hugo Rheinhold's original inscription [...] "eritis sicut deus" [...] (sometimes wrongly [...] "eritus …."), either suggests Darwinian understanding may lead to Frankenstinian abuse of life's essence, or a more inclusive innocence that recognises a place for other advanced life‑forms on our intellectual podium, <b>if</b> only <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> accommodate those guests.|$|R

40|$|Terms like “mean, ” “standard {{deviation}} ” and “correlation ” {{are used}} frequently in our industry, {{but how many}} really understand them? And how often are statistics misused, creating confusion and misunderstandings, when their main purpose is to communicate your results more accurately? This paper will include a review of pertinent statistics, how they are derived, and where and when to use them in performance and capacity planning. Statistics can be fun and increase your decision-making confidence. Now, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> get past the terminology and the math…and remember, it is often more art than science. “Statistics is a systematic method for getting the wrong conclusion with 95 % confidence. ” Background In a small, Welsh town, there was a. 95 correlation between the arrival of storks {{and the arrival of}} babies.

40|$|AbstractMuch of our {{everyday}} knowledge is risky. This not only includes personal judgments, {{but the results}} of measurement, data obtained from references or by report, the results of statistical testing, etc. There are two (often opposed) views in AI {{on how to handle}} risky empirical knowledge. One view, characterized often by modal or nonmonotonic logics, is that the structure of such knowledge should be captured by the formal logical properties of a set of sentences, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> get the logic right. The other view takes probability to be central to the characterization of risky knowledge, but often does not allow for the tentative or corrigible acceptance of a set of sentences. We examine a view, based on ε-acceptability that combines both probability and modality. A statement is ε-accepted if the probability of its denial is at most ε, where ε is taken to be a fixed small parameter as is customary in the practice of statistical testing. We show that given a body of evidence Γδ, the set of ε-accepted statements Γε has exactly the logical structure of a classical modal system EMN, the smallest classical modal logic E supplemented by the schemata M: □ε(⌜ φ ∧ ψ ⌝) → (□ε φ ∧ □ε ψ) and N: □ε⊤...|$|E
40|$|These notes {{consist of}} several {{computer}} graphics related problems and their solutions using techniques from linear algebra. The problems were worked {{out on the}} whiteboard in the review session and summarized here. These notes assume previous exposure to linear algebra and vector calculus and are meant more to jar the memory than to introduce these concepts. Here are some useful references: [1] and [2]. Vectors Vectors are everywhere in graphics. We use them to represent light rays bouncing around a room, surface normals, and much more. Two operations you’ll use all the time are the dot product and the cross product. Let’s illustrate these operations by solving a couple of graphics related problems. Generating perpendicular vectors Suppose you have a unit vector, u ∈ R 3, {{and you want to}} find two more vectors, v, and w to build an orthonormal basis for the space. You have an infinite number of choices for v as any vector in the plane normal to u works. How do we find just one? If you remember, the cross product of two vectors gives you a third vector that is perpendicular to both. If a × b = c, then c ⊥ a and c ⊥ b. The only caveat is that if a ‖ b, then c is the zero vector. In our case, we have our a. 1 It’s just u. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> find a good b we could use c as our v vector. Let’s just pick b to be (1 0 0). Then, v = det (⎝ i j k u 1 u 2 u 3 1 0 0 ⎠) = (0 u 3 −u 2 This will work great unless both u 3 and u 2 are really small numbers. If we could detect this, we could use b = (0 1 0) instead. We can detect this using the dot product. Remember, the dot product is a binary operator that takes two vectors and produces a scalar proportional to the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. The smaller in absolute value the dot product is the closer two vectors are to being perpendicular to each other. So we calculate the dot product of u with (1 0 0) an...|$|E
40|$|Working {{with young}} readers, aged 10 to 14, as theyresponded to {{narrative}} texts {{in a variety}} of media (Mackey, 2002), I observed a recurring phenomenon: In a vari-ety of ways they repeatedly stepped {{in and out of the}} fictional universe of their different stories. Some examples will perhaps give the flavor of this experience: • Two 14 -year-old girls playing Starship Titanic alter-nate between lively engagement in the narrative world of the story and stepping outside the fiction to console themselves, “Oh well, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> die, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> start again. ” • A 10 -year-old girl speaks of alternating between the novel and the computer game of My Teacher is an Alien, using the novel as a source of game-playing repertoire. • Two 10 -year-old boys look at the DVD of the film Contact, learning how the special effects of an explo-sion scene were composed, and commenting on how their new awareness of scene construction would affect how they view the film in the future. As I recorded and analyzed numerous examples of such behav-iors, I was struck by a common element of interpretive activity on the boundaries of the fictional universe. Sensitized to the topic, I began to notice, and then to collect, examples of con-temporary texts that foster various forms of such border cross-ing, in and out of the diegesis, the framework of events as narrated in the text. This article explores how an awareness of this aspect of contemporary texts may enhance our understand-ing of interpretive processes and expand what happens in liter-ature classes...|$|R

This is sufficient for hypercall-based attacks detection or forensics, but would lose the ability of real-time defense and prevention. Another time consuming work is resetting the monitoring events. When an #BP event happens, we should first remove the injected breakpoints and write back the original value where breakpoint is injected, then set a single step event to let the original instruction get executed and reset the breakpoint after it is executed. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> directly simulate the #BP when VMEXIT, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> avoid from repeatedly removing and resetting breakpoints.
