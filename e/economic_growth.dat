5|$|The {{collective}} leadership {{first set}} out to stabilize the Soviet Union and calm Soviet society, a task which {{they were able to}} accomplish. In addition, they attempted to speed up <b>economic</b> <b>growth,</b> which had slowed considerably during Khrushchev's last years as ruler. In 1965, Kosygin initiated several reforms to decentralize the Soviet economy. After initial success in creating <b>economic</b> <b>growth,</b> hard-liners within the Party halted the reforms, fearing that they would weaken the Party's prestige and power. No other radical economic reforms were carried out during the Brezhnev era, and <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> began to stagnate in the early-to-mid-1970s. By Brezhnev's death in 1982, Soviet <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> had, according to several historians, nearly come to a standstill.|$|E

5|$|There are {{conflicting}} views whether {{improvements in}} technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> from environmental degradation. On the one hand, {{it has been}} claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit GDP) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution. On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in {{the efficiency of the}} use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by <b>economic</b> <b>growth,</b> {{in large part because of}} the rebound effect (conservation) or Jevons Paradox resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution. Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., second law of thermodynamics) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions. Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution, i.e., <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by Herman Daly and others in the ecological economics community.|$|E

The current transport policies in China emphasize the importance of home-based working trips, while ignoring non-commuting trips and unemployed people. This analysis provides evidence that household composition is essential in deciding vehicle ownerships. Therefore, transport policy should focus on household rather than individuals.|$|R
