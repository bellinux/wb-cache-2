5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort.

It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as <b>frigate</b> <b>mackerel,</b> needlefishes, and pufferfishes.

40|$|A well {{planned and}} {{systematic}} Ichthyoplankton survey programme {{was carried out}} by the UNDP/ FAO Pelagic Fishery Project, Cochin (1971 - 79) along the southwest coast of India. These surveys were part of the Project's programmes for assessment of the Pelagic fish resources of the Project area extending from Ratnagiri to Tuticorin. Major part of the field work was conducted from 1971 to 1975 over the shelf and adjacent waters. The survey results indicated that all the dominant pelagic species spawned over the shelf in the entire range of their distribution in most months of the year. The peak of spawning in almost all cases was aligned to the Southwest Monsoon period with a secondary peak in the Northeast Monsoon in some species; including the mackerel. The larval distribution showed a southward drift and concentration in areas south of 12 ° N, spreading over oceanic waters in this sector. No consistent and positive relationship between the abundance of larvae of a particular species with the magnitude of its fishery in the area was evident. However in cases like the whitebaits the larval abundance gave corroborative evidence supporting the findings of simultaneous acoustic surveys on the very high potential of these fishes.

They likely use their long tails to stun their prey prior to capture, as they are often found hooked by their tails on longlines and with the bait fish in their stomachs. The shape of their eye sockets give them binocular vision in an upward direction to better aim their strikes. In the Mediterranean, they are strongly associated with schools of <b>frigate</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Auxis rochei), suggesting that these sharks follow concentrations of their prey from place to place.

40|$|In Spain, certain {{population-based}} {{studies have}} shown high blood mercury (Hg) levels due to the high consumption of fish. Some studies have stated {{that one of the}} most consumed fish in Spain is canned tuna. Different Spanish organisms consider that it is safe to consume canned tuna as it supposedly has a low mercury content, particularly in so-called light tuna. However, in Spain light tuna is mainly yellowfin and bigeye tuna, while in other countries it is mainly skipjack tuna. This study analyzed 36 cans of the most popular brands in Spain and examined the influence of the type of tuna, packaging medium (olive oil, sunflower seed oil, water or marinade), different brands, prices and expiration dates. Mercury concentrations (mg/kg) were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry and thermal decomposition amalgamation. The medians observed were (mg/kg) : light tuna: 0. 314; IQR: 0. 205 - 0. 594, white tuna: 0. 338; IQR: 0. 276 - 0. 558, skipjack: 0. 311; IQR: 0. 299 - 0. 322, frigate tuna: 0. 219; IQR 0. 182 - 0. 257 and mackerel: 0. 042; IQR 0. 029 -  0. 074. We found statistically significant differences between white tuna, light tuna and mackerel (p = 0. 004); light tuna and mackerel (p = 0. 002) and white tuna and mackerel (p = 0. 006). However, we found no differences between white tuna and light tuna, or among packaging medium, brands, prices or expiration dates.

Although the long- and short-corselerred Auxis are known {{from both sides of the}} Pacific, only the short-corseletted form has been reported heretofore from the central Pacific area. As is the case with some of the other scom-brids, the taxonomy of this genus is not very clear. Although the identity of the short-corseletted form has been well established as A. thazard (Lacepede 1802), the nomenclature of the long-corseletted form has been confused because of incomplete description and subse-quent misnaming by other workers. It is hoped that this paper will help to clarify the nomen-clature of this genus. The long-corseletted form of the western Pacific has been identified by various names. Kishinouye (1915 : 13 - 14) recognized two spe-cies of Auxis in Japanese waters, to which he ascribed the names A. hira and A. maru.

The authors made some trials of artificial fertilization of this fish aboard some professional fishing vessels during spawning season of the fish (May～July). The mature fish were caught on June 16, 24 and 25, 1972 by a trap net near the coast of Oshima Island near Cape Shionomisaki. About 40 thousand ripe eggs {{were obtained from the}} fish and fertilized in dry method. The fertilized eggs were buoyant, spherical in shape, measuring 0. 97 to 0. 99 mm in diameter. The fertilized eggs were then transported from Oshima to the Shirahama Fisheries Laboratory of the Kinki University, Wakayama Prefecture, and kept in cylindrical tanks of 0. 03 to 30 tons. The eggs hatched out in 38 to 52 hours at the water temperature ranging from 21. 4 to 23. 5 ℃. The newly hatched larvae measured 3. 3 ～ 3. 6 mm in total length. The hatched larvae were fed three days after hatching with a kind of rotifer previously cultivated, which was replaced 7 days after hatching by the second food, several kinds of marine zoo-plankton, and these were then replaced about 20 days after hatching by the third food, several kinds of minced fish. Under best conditions, the larvae grew up to 49 mm in total length in 18 days,. and to 157 mm in 52 days after hatching. Stages up to 157 mm in total length are shown in Plates 1 and 2. This demonstrates the very rapid gorwth of young Auxis tapeinosoma. [著者抄録] 1. 1972 年 5 月から 7 月までの間、和歌山県串本町大島樫野定置網から漁獲されるマルソウダから採卵･人工授精を試み、授精卵を得て同県白浜町の本学水産研究所へ輸送し、ふ化・仔魚の飼育実験を行なった。 2.. 紀伊半島南部の沿岸に 5 ～ 6 月(水温 18 ～ 22 ℃) に来遊するマルソウダから熟卵が採取され、人工授精･ふ化が可能なことが明らかとなった。 3. 卵は直径 00. 98 mm内外の分離浮性で 1 個の油球を持ち、水温 22. 5 ～ 23. 3 ℃では、授精後 35 時間から 44 時間までの間でふ化した。 4. 仔魚は培養したシオミズツボワムシ･天然海産プランクトン･小魚のミンチなどを摂取して成育し、ふ化当日全長 3. 49 mm内外の仔魚は、小型水槽ではふ化後 20 日 8. 5 ～ 11. 0 mm、 43 日 89. 0 ～ 95. 0 mmに成長したが、大型水槽ではふ化後 18 日 49. 0 mm、 40 日 140. 0 mm、 52 日 144. 0 ～ 157. 0 mmに成長した。 5. 本実験の結果、マルソウダの採卵･人工ふ化および仔魚から未成魚までの飼育が可能なことが実証され、マグロ頬の人工ふ化･仔魚飼育研究上参考となると思われる知見が得られた...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{confirmed}} that the body-resistance of a living fish in water is far {{less than that of}} any fish-like-formed rigid-body. And according to the hydro-dynamical calculations, between the co-efficient-values of their frictional resistances, {{there seems to be a}} difference of 1 / 10 order. In order to clarify the process of this resistance-reduction，various resistance-tests were carried out, with the use of a lot of models, by the author, basing on the hitherto ascertained view-points, namely: ‘Passive Fish-skin Effect’， ‘Slime Effect’，’Slotting Effect derived from the Gill-cover-holes’，’Active Fish-skin Effect’ and the ‘Caudal-fin Effect’. (I) The Effects of Passive-ski, Slime and Slotting on the resistance-reduction. Having got a hint from Kraemer 2 ̆ 7 s Dolphin-model, the author measured the hardness of the bodies of living Scombroid and <b>Frigate</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and made models of silicone rubber having the hardness similar to those of the two fishes. Some experiments were made, in order to make a resistance-comparison between the rigid and the flexible models, at the Kagoshima-University Circulating-water-channel, within the Reynolds number: 0. 5 × 10 ^ 5 9. 0 × 10 ^ 5. Consequently it was confirmed that generally there was little difference between the rigidly bodied model and the flexibly bodied one. As to the effect of oil coated on the surface of the fish-model, it was ascertained that the fish-oil which was used usually, for example, a whale-oil, rather increased the resistance than otherwise, with the author’ s failure in confirming the effect of slime-‘Toms effect’ by polymers. And concerning the effects coming from　the　opened　or　the　closed　mouth　of　the　fish, and from the opened or closed gill-cover of the fish, respectively; the expected slotting effect by jet-flow from gill-cover-holes was not recognized; conversely it was ascertained that the resistance was made rather larger by the effect coming from the opened mouth and the opened gill-cover. Basing on the view-point of respiratory movement of fish in sea-water, the calculated velocity of jet-flowing from the gill-cover-holes was found to be quitenegligible. Consequently, the effect of slotting due to the motion of the gill-cover holes on resistance reduction was fixed to be negative. [the rest omitted]...|$|E
