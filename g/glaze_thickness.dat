40|$|A general {{discussion}} on glaze—type coatings for fission product retention within BeO spheres fuelled with PuO 2 - ThO 2 particles is presented. From these considerations, a <b>glaze</b> <b>thickness</b> of 0. 004 inch {{was chosen as}} a basis for laboratory studies. Glaze development commenced with a conventional high temperature glaze; this was modified firstly by increasing the SiO 2 content and then by progressively replacing some of the SiO 2 by Ti 02, Zr 02. Ti 02 - Zr 02, BeO 2 and BeO plus Ti 02. Glaze structures varied from amorphous to predominantly crystalline. When applied to fuelled BeO cubes, some glazes failed to cover fuel particles and others tended to react with them, Two of the most promising glazes behaved poorly in fission product release experiments, probably because glaze—fuel interaction had allowed fuel migration to the glaze surface-It is concluded that glaze type coatings show little promise for the present applications...|$|E

Such improvements are attributed {{to the fact that}} after laser treatment, the microstructure of the Al 2 O 3 -based refractory was altered from a porous, randomly ordered structure, to a much more dense and consolidated structure that contained fewer cracks and porosities.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a new process for high {{precision}} hot forging of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V gas turbine blade. In this new process, the work-piece is hot formed and then is clamped between the dies at high pressure for a certain time in order to decrease the distortion and increase the geometric accuracy. The feasibility study of the new process has been carried out in this thesis by using experiments and finite element (FE) modelling, providing a scientific understanding of the process. From the experimental and modelling work, it has been demonstrated that the new process proposed in this thesis is an effective way to reduce distortion in gas turbine blade forging. The study can be divided into three parts: interfacial heat transfer coefficient determination, material modelling, and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V hot forming. A closed form method to determine an interfacial heat transfer coefficient (IHTC) was developed, and a one-dimensional heat transfer model was proposed and validated. Heat transfer tests were performed to study the heat transfer between Ti- 6 Al- 4 V work-pieces with an initial temperature of 920 °C and H 13 dies with an initial temperature of 150 °C. Temperature histories measured by thermocouples were obtained, and were used as an input for the closed form method. The effects of pressure, <b>glaze</b> <b>thickness</b> and surface roughness on IHTC between Ti- 6 Al- 4 V work-pieces and H 13 steel dies were studied. Thermo-mechanical properties of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V were investigated for a temperature range of 820 °C to 1120 °C and a strain rate range of 0. 1 s- 1 to 10. 0 s- 1, using a Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulator. The flow softening mechanisms of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V during hot forming were studied. A set of unified elastic-viscoplastic constitutive equations for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V during hot forming were developed. Plastic strain for alpha and beta phase, isotropic hardening, normalised dislocation density, adiabatic heating, phase transformation, and globularisation of alpha phase were described in the set of constitutive equations. The developed material constitutive model was determined by fitting with experimental strain-stress curves from uniaxial compression tests, using an Evolutionary Programming (EP) -based optimisation method. Good agreements between the experimental and computed results were obtained: the error of predicted stress is under 10...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of structural arrangement on long-duration blast loaded annealed <b>glazing</b> via variable <b>thickness,</b> area, aspect ratio and edge support conditions. Initially, the findings of eighteen full-scale air-blast trials employing 33 annealed glazing panels are reported where it is demonstrated that fracture mode and fragmentation are a strong function of edge supports. Rigidly clamped edges are shown to induce localised stress transmission, producing significant cracking and small fragments. In contrast, elastic edges are shown to produce large, angular fragments, demonstrating the importance of accurately modelling edge conditions when analysing fragment hazard.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{response}} of annealed (float) glazing during long-duration blast {{as a function of}} <b>glazing</b> <b>thickness,</b> area, aspect ratio and edge support conditions. With positive phase durations in excess of 100 ms, long-duration blasts produce substantial impulse and pronounced dynamic pressures. Transient dynamic response of annealed glazing during these events is a complex phenomenon dependent upon explosive proximity, structural arrangement and material properties. In particular, breakage time and initial fracture location are dictated by maximum principal stress exceedence at randomly distributed micro-flaws. As part of a larger research study, twelve full-scale air-blast trials employing 24 annealed glazing panels were conducted with ~ 14 kPa peak static overpressure and ~ 110 ms positive phase duration. Results are reported, where it is shown that notionally elastic edge supports can prevent glazing breakage versus rigidly clamped arrangements when suitable panel dimensions are employed. Fragmentation modes are also demonstrated to be a strong function of edge conditions with elastically supported panels producing large, angular fragments. In contrast, rigid arrangements are shown to induce localised impulsive stress transmission at clamped edges, leading to significant cracking and small fragments. Substantially different fragment masses and geometries demonstrate the need to accurately quantify edge supports when appraising fragment hazard. Quantification of peak panel deflection, breakage time and applied breakage impulse is then presented where results indicate the influence of edge supports and aspect ratio on glazing response to be dependent on proximity to the threshold area for a particular thickness...|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} dynamic {{response of}} annealed glazing to blast loading {{is a complex}} phenomenon dependent upon explosive proximity, glazing material properties and structural arrangement. With positive pressure durations in excess of 100 ms, long-duration blasts produce substantial impulse and dynamic pressures. Annealed glazing accounted for ~ 90 % of UK building glass {{at the end of}} 20 th century with similar levels of utilisation the world over. As a brittle material, it cannot undergo plastic deformation resulting in sudden failure under tension. As the minimum level of glazing resistance to blast, annealed glazing breakage introduces significant hazard to a building’s occupants and those in surrounding regions. The original contribution of this PhD has been to investigate and quantify annealed glazing response to long- duration blast with an emphasis on the influence of structural arrangement via variable <b>glazing</b> <b>thickness,</b> area, aspect ratio and edge support conditions. Eighteen full-scale blast trials were conducted where results have shown that notionally elastic supports can prevent glazing breakage versus rigidly clamped arrangements. Edge conditions were also found to exert an important influence on both fragmentation and potential fragment hazard with elastic supports shown to produce large, angular fragments versus rigid arrangements which generated significant cracking and smaller fragments. The quantification of peak panel deflection, breakage time and applied breakage impulse has demonstrated significant variability with the influence of edge supports and aspect ratio found to be dependent on proximity to a threshold area for a particular thickness. This research has also examined computational models of glazing response and blast wave propagation produced with the Applied Element Method (AEM) and CFD. Comparisons with experimental data have shown reasonable levels of agreement, indicating the potential to provide future predictive capacity. <br/...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNumerical and {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis has}} been carried out to understand the performance of solar flat plate collector (SFPC) so as to improve its performance. Though SFPCs’ are been using as solar thermal collectors over the few decades, their thermal efficiency is considerably low. The thermal efficiency can be improved either by changing the geometric parameters or by changing its working fluid. The gap between absorber plate and glass, <b>glazing</b> glass <b>thickness</b> and number of glazing glasses plays a vital role in the performance of the SFPC. Since nanofluids possesses higher heat transfer coefficients, now-a-days they are been widely using in different engineering fields.

Heat transfer phenomenon inside the risers of SFPC is analyzed numerically by developing a 3 D model in commercial CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 14. It is observed that that the proposed model is predicting the heat loss coefficients and fluid temperatures with good accuracy. The thermal efficiency obtained with this numerical model is validated against measured data. This paper also discusses about the heat transfer enhancement capabilities of nanofluid based SFPC...|$|R
40|$|The one {{dimensional}} heat transfer, thermal diode effect of heat pipes makes them ideal for passive solar applications. Gains in a heat pipe passive solar wall are not lost during cloud cover or periods of low irradiation. An experimental model {{was built to}} test {{the performance of a}} heat pipe passive solar wall in a laboratory setting. Experimental variations included varying fluid fill levels and the addition of insulation along the adiabatic section of the heat pipe. Filling the heat pipe to 120 % volume of the evaporator section and insulating the adiabatic section achieved efficiencies of 85 %. The average rate of water tank temperature change for 80 %, 100 %, 120 %, and 140 % fill levels was 1. 153 °C/hr, 1. 195 °C/hr, 1. 227 °C/hr, and 1. 203 °C/hr, respectively. The addition of fins along the condenser of the heat pipe did not significantly enhance the overall performance. A computer model was constructed to simulate the performance of direct gain, indirect gain, and integrated heat pipe passive solar systems in different climates. The locations selected include: Louisville, Kentucky; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Madison, Wisconsin; and Rock Springs, Wyoming. Integrated heat pipe systems performed better than their direct and indirect gain counterparts in all climates. The water wall indirect gain system outperformed concrete wall systems in all climates. The lowest solar fractions were achieved by the direct gain system in all climates except Albuquerque, New Mexico (sunny and cool). The mild temperatures and cloudiness of Louisville, Kentucky provided an excellent climate for passive solar systems. Passive solar systems in Louisville (cloudy and cool) performed better than Madison, Wisconsin (cloudy and cold) and Rock Springs Wyoming (sunny and cold). Integrated heat pipe wall design variations were analyzed to achieve the best overall performance. These variations included: <b>glazing</b> <b>thickness,</b> extinction coefficient, absorber plate and heat pipe material, selective surface, insulation thickness, and water tank size. Decreasing the <b>thickness</b> of the <b>glazing</b> by 7. 15 mm improved the solar fraction by 2. 69 %. Changing from a greenish cast glass to a low iron glass reduces the extinction coefficient and improves solar fraction by 8. 82 %. Switching absorber plate and heat pipe material from copper to aluminum reduces cost and decrease the solar fraction by 2. 23 %. Having the absorber plate electroplated with a black chrome surface opposed to painting the collector with flat black paint increase the solar fraction from 19. 28 % to 48. 36 %. Changing the insulation thickness around the collector improves the overall losses of the collector. Raising the R-value by a factor of 5 improved the solar fraction by 0. 12 %. Increased water tank size improves solar fraction but increases the units weight. Validation of the computer model was made by simulating the laboratory experiments and comparing the data. Temperatures across the system were matched by adjusting the calculated conductances. The computer simulation was able to graphically match the measured temperatures of the experiment. Conduction between the evaporator and condenser sections of the heat pipe was only 6 % of the calculated value. An economic assessment was then performed to analyze the overall cost of the unit, deliver design recommendations, optimize cost, complete life cycle costing and calculate payback period. The most cost effective design would incorporate an aluminum absorber plate with four heat pipes. The solar glazing would have one cover and be made with low iron glass (3 / 32 nd inch thick). For the city of Louisville with a load to collector ratio of 10 W/m 2 K the total cost of the unit would be $ 1825. 46 for a collector area of 2. 43 m 2 (26. 12 ft 2).

40|$|This work {{shows the}} first {{analytical}} results obtained by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) (conventional and 3 D) and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive System (SEM-EDS) on original Portuguese ceramic pieces produced between the 16 th and 18 th centuries in Coimbra and Lisbon. Experts distinguished these productions {{based only on}} the color, texture and brightness, which originates mislabeling in some cases. Thanks to lateral and spatial resolution in the micrometer regime, the results obtained with μ-XRF were essential in determining the <b>glaze</b> and pigment <b>thicknesses</b> by monitoring {{the profile of the}} most abundant element in each “layer”. Furthermore, the dissemination of these elements throughout the glaze is different depending on the glaze composition, firing temperature and on the pigment itself. Hence, the crucial point of this investigation was to analyze and understand the interfaces color/glaze and glaze/ceramic support. Together with the XRF results, images captured by SEM and the corresponding semi-quantitative EDS data revealed different manufacturing processes used by the two production centers.

30|$|Another {{interesting}} {{point in the}} quantitative EPMA data is that the actual total of the quantified elements of the blue glaze does not sum up to 100  wt% and is significantly low (86.26  wt%) (Table  1). This {{could be related to}} the manufacturing process of the blue glaze. According to the descriptions provided by Rochechouart [16], Ali Mohamed [11], Olmer [17] and Schindler [18], 19 th century Persian glaze-makers used to make a concentrated Co-bearing pigment from the cobalt ores of Qamsar by mixing and smelting the cobalt ores and borax. A tiny amount of this concentrated pigment was then added to an alkali frit to achieve a deep blue colour. Moreover, the analytical data provided on the raw materials used by Ali Mohamed (preserved at the Edinburg Museum of Science) confirm the presence of borax in the composition of Persian blue glazes in the 19 th century [18]. However, as boron cannot be measured with EPMA due to its low atomic weight, this can provide an explanation for the loss of total amount of composing elements of the blue glaze. However, this hypothesis needs to be proved with more relevant analytical approaches. Due {{to the fact that the}} blue glaze was diffused in the white <b>glaze</b> and its <b>thickness</b> was very small (Figure  2 b), it was not practically possible to remove any sample from the blue glaze without contaminating the sample with the white substrate glaze. Thus, the most appropriate technique, which could quantitatively measure boron from one hand and, on the other hand, did not require removing the blue glaze, was laser ablation-induced coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), which we did not have access to.|$|R
40|$|Insulation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} methods intended for reducing energy consumption in both heating and cooling of buildings. Selecting the right materials and determining the optimum insulation thickness in building insulation application is an important issue. In 2000, the "Thermal Insulation Requirements for Buildings" was enacted in Turkey, energy saving by limiting the energy amount used for heating in buildings being the target. In this study, the effect of the alteration of windows and exterior wall areas on the heating energy requirement of the building and on the optimum insulation thickness has been examined by using P 1 -P 2 method. The study has been carried out for four degree-day regions of Turkey for various insulation materials, glazing areas, and fuel types; the results have been presented in charts. In the rest of this study, effects of different insulation thicknesses and fuel on fuel consumption and thereby on emissions of pollutants such as CO 2 and SO 2 are evaluated. For example, in the building where XPS (extruded polystyrene foam) insulation material and natural gas are used and where the ratio of glazing area to exterior wall area is 0. 2 (glazing area percentage), energy saving for the four regions has been found to be 13. 996, 31. 680, 46. 613, and 63. 071 Â $/m 2, respectively, and the payback period of investment has been found to be 2. 023, 1. 836, 1. 498, and 1. 346 Â years, respectively. The emissions of CO 2 are decreased by 50. 91 % for the cases in which optimum insulation material (XPS) and natural gas are used. The emissions of CO 2 and SO 2 are decreased by 54. 67 % for the cases in which optimum insulation material (XPS) and fuel oil are used.

40|$|Regarding {{the thermal}} {{resistance}} of the external envelop of buildings, windows are the weakest places. This {{is especially true for}} historic windows with original single pane glazing in historic buildings. To reduce the energy consumption and to improve thermal comfort of historic buildings, replacing these windows by modern double glazed windows would be a logical choice. The authentic character of these buildings, however, would be affected too much. Therefore, special effort has to be given to this kind of windows. There are a number of ways to improve the thermal performance of these windows. One approach is to add a single glazing pane from the inside or outside to the existing single pane glazing, making use of a (ventilated) cavity. Apart from that, special glazing has been developed, e. g. vacuum glazing, to replace the single glazing pane, with a vacuum <b>glazing</b> with comparable <b>thickness.</b> To predict the thermal performance of these windows, a multi-physical simulation approach is necessary. The paper will deal with the modeling approach of these types of glazing. The typical total thermal transmittance of these windows will be calculated, making use of the three-dimensional thermal bridge coupling effects on the thermal performance of the glazing panes. COMSOL will be used to solve the multi-physical coupling of the differential equations for Heat, Air and Moisture (HAM). The results of the three-dimensional simulations are compared with relatively simple 1 -dimensional calculations by hand and measurements in a so-called hot-box measurement laboratory device and also with in-situ measurements. Generally, good results are obtained by numerical simulation, compared to measurement results. For a number of glazing types, 1 -dimensional calculations by hand give a good impression of the thermal performance of rather complex glazing configurations. Surface temperatures of the glazing panes, risks on condensation and energy losses can be estimated with a reasonable accuracy. If the boundary conditions are more complex and if ventilation of air in the cavity is introduced, calculations by hand are not sufficient or possible anymore and more complex computer simulations are necessary...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of indoor thermal environment {{has been carried}} out by computational fluid dynamics approach. The study focuses on the thermal comfort evaluation, particularly the flow and heat transfer effects due to conjugate natural convection, furniture arrangement and occupant number, and flow oscillations. Key physical features of thermo-fluid such as velocity and temperature distributions, thermal sensation maps, and oscillation frequency and its energy are quantified, analysed and compared. The benchmark case study of airflow and heat transfer showed that ANSYS Fluent RNG k - 5 turbulence model with temperature boundary condition on the heated boundary calculated the bestresults, compared with available data. It also showed that air velocity increased along the boundary walls and especially hot wall which led flow direction upwards. At the centre of the flow circulation, air momentum is very weak (e. g. almost zero velocity magnitude). The increase of complex features (6. g. a box with/without heat) in the domain would lead to flow separations causing recirculations above the box and in the rear space of the domain and swirls in the front space presenting three-dimensional flow, and a thermal plume, compared with a two-dimensional clockwise flow in an empty room. The flow recirculations and thermal buoyancy enhanced velocity magnitude and turbulence level in the domain. In fact, the highest frequency was obtained in the room with an unheated box, followed by the room with a heated box. The forrhation of thermal plume from the heated box stabilised the flow in the upper part and the sides of the heated box on a spanwise plane. The frequency of velocity oscillation was consistent with temperature at the location although the energy of the fluctuation is much higher in temperature. Moreover the dominant frequency depended on the orientation of the flow circulation, for example a high energy at a lower frequency on a spanwise plane while a low energy at a higher frequency on a streamwise plane. In an empty room, it was found that there is no direct relation in an empty room (case 3. 2. 1) between velocity and turbulent flow in power spectral density and frequency, and each of time-history velocity oscillations is independent and random. At the mid- height of the domain, the energy of the velocity fluctuation is relatively weak. The results from the study of conjugate natural convection heat transfer in a ventilated room with localised heat source and window glazing showed that the size of heat source and window <b>glazing,</b> the wall <b>thickness</b> and wall material property are important factors to temperature change and heat loss.
