A field experiment was conducted {{with the aim of}} estimating variation among maize cultivars grown in Ekiti State. Twenty maize cultivars obtained from various locations within the state was evaluated between April to August 2005 at the Teaching and Research Farm, University of Ado-Ekiti. The twenty cultivars constituted the treatment, which was lied out in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. Result shows that there were significant (p< 0. 05) difference for in day to first silking and anthesis, days to 50 % anthesis and silking, plant and <b>ear</b> <b>heights,</b> leaf blight and curvularia leaf spot and grain yield. Grain yield ranges from 3. 02 t ha for Ijelu and 4. 91 t ha for Ilupeju.

5000|$|European badgers are powerfully built {{animals with}} small heads, thick, short necks, stocky, {{wedge-shaped}} bodies and short tails. Their feet are plantigrade or semidigitigrade and short, with five toes on each foot. The limbs are short and massive, with naked lower surfaces on the feet. The claws are strong, elongated {{and have an}} obtuse end, which assists in digging. The claws are not retractable, and the hind claws wear with age. Old badgers sometimes have their hind claws almost completely worn away from constant use. Their snouts, which are used for digging and probing, are muscular and flexible. The eyes are small and the ears short and tipped with white. Whiskers are present on the snout and above the eyes. Boars typically have broader heads, thicker necks and narrower tails than sows, which are sleeker, have narrower, less domed heads and fluffier tails. The guts of badgers are longer than those of red foxes, reflecting their omnivorous diet. The small intestine has a mean length of 5.36 m and lacks a cecum. Both sexes have three pairs of nipples but these are more developed in females. European badgers cannot flex their backs as martens, s and wolverines can, nor can they stand fully erect like honey badgers, though they can move quickly at full gallop. Adults measure 25 - 30 cm in shoulder height, 60 - 90 cm in body length, 12 - 24 cm in tail length, 7.5 - 13 cm in hind foot length and 3.5 - 7 cm in <b>ear</b> <b>height.</b> Males (or boars) slightly exceed females (or sows) in measurements, but can weigh considerably more. Their weights vary seasonally, growing from spring to autumn and reaching a peak just before the winter. During the summer, they weigh 7 - 13 kg and 15 - 17 kg in autumn. Sows can attain a top weight of around 17.2 kg, while exceptionally large boars {{have been reported in}} autumn. The heaviest verified was 27.2 kg, though unverified specimens have been reported to 30.8 kg and even 34 kg (if so, the heaviest weight for any terrestrial mustelid). If average weights are used, the European badger ranks as the second largest terrestrial mustelid, behind only the wolverine. Although their sense of smell is acute, their eyesight is monochromatic as has been shown by their lack of reaction to red lanterns. Only moving objects attract their attention. Their hearing is no better than that of humans.European badger skulls are quite massive, heavy and elongated. Their braincases are oval in outline, while the facial part of their skulls is elongated and narrow. Adults have prominent sagittal crests which can reach 15 mm tall in old males, and are more strongly developed than those of honey badgers. Aside from anchoring the jaw muscles, the thickness of the crests protect their skulls from hard blows. Similar to martens, the dentition of European badgers is well-suited for their omnivorous diets. Their incisors are small and chisel-shaped, their canine teeth are prominent and their carnassials are not overly specialised. Their molars are flattened and adapted for grinding. Their jaws are powerful enough to crush most bones; a provoked badger was once reported as biting down on a man's wrist so severely that his hand had to be amputated. The dental formula is: ...|$|E

In pooled analysis of variability parameters revealed that the phenotypic coefficients of variation (PCV) were higher than genotypic coefficient of variation for all the characters studied indicating the role of experimental variance to the total variance. The magnitude of PCV and GCV was high for grain yield per plant followed by <b>ear</b> <b>height,</b> number of kernels per row, 100 -seed weight, ear length, plant height, ear girth and number of kernel rows per ear. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance as percentage of mean was observed for <b>ear</b> <b>height,</b> grain yield per plant, plant height, number of kernels per row and ear length.

40|$|AbstractFifteen elite yellow maize {{inbred lines}} were {{evaluated}} in a randomized complete block design experiment with three replicates in 2014. Data {{were collected on}} days to anthesis and silking, anthesis-silking interval, plant and <b>ear</b> <b>heights,</b> number of <b>ears</b> per plant, leaf area, ear weight and grain yield. Mean values {{were used to determine}} characters' phenotypic and genotypic variances, phenotypic, genotypic and environmental coefficients of variation. Broad sense heritability and genetic advance percentage of mean were estimated for each trait. Significant variation existed in all the characters. The coefficients of variation were low except for ear weight and grain yield that were relatively higher. The anthesis-silking interval was highest in lines TZEI 124 and TZEI 16, but least in lines BD 74 - 222, TZEI 11 and TZEI 13. Line BD 74 - 222 had the height plant height and BD 74 - 165 had the least. Line TZEI 124 produced highest maize grain yield whereas line TZEI 146 had the least. Coefficients of variation of phenotype and genotype were low for all the traits except number of ear per plant, ear and grain yield. The characters were less influenced by the environment thus the traits can be used for selection. Heritability was greater than 80 % for all characters studied whereas expected genetic advance ranged from low (8. 91) in days to silking to high (72. 03) in number of ear per plant. Days to anthesis and silking, plant height and number of leaf per plant were positively correlated. Grain yield was positively correlated with ASI, plant and <b>ear</b> <b>heights,</b> number of leaf per plant and leaf area. High heritability and high genetic advance for ASI indicated the presence of additive genes in the trait and suggested reliable maize improvement through selection of the traits.

By Griffing Method, general combining ability (GCA) was significant in plant height. Specific combining method (SCA) was highly significant in all three measurements. Average heterosis for the plant and ear heights were 33. 3 % and 61. 9 %, respectively. However, REPH showed 21. 6 % heterosis effect. The traits with low heterosis showed higher ratios of GCA/ SCA, while these ratios were smaller in traits with high heterosis. REPH could be used as one of valuable selection criteria over plant and ear heights in the breeding program for low <b>ear</b> <b>height.</b> Above mentioned two statistical methods produced some different results...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a synthetic variety of corn for the low lands of Colombia has been of major importance in the corn breeding program. This study reports on the initial phases of that development. Correlation studies of agronomic characteristics were also made using the materials available from this program. The variety cross Rocol V. 1 x Eto blanco was considered as a suitable start because of the desirable agronomic characteristics of Eto and the good grain yield of Rocol V. 1. Plant and <b>ear</b> <b>height,</b> ear length, kernel length and indentation were measured throughout the selection testing period. Correlations studied indicated that vigorous plants with longer ears, longer kernels and dent type of kernel tend to produce better yielding topcrosses. The undesirable characters of Rocol V. 1, such as plant and <b>ear</b> <b>height</b> and indentation were improved {{with the formation of}} a synthetic variety using the procedures of selection based upon topcross performance. The undesirable characters of Eto blanco, such as low yield grain production and kernel length were also improved. The realized improvement of plant and <b>ear</b> <b>height,</b> ear and kernel length, indentation and yield would indicate the presence of considerable additive genetic variability in the material used.

40|$|Six popcorn {{varieties}} were crossed in a diallel mating {{scheme to}} obtain 15 F 1 hybrids, {{with the purpose}} of analyzing the estimates of heterotic parametrization for agronomically important traits. The genitors and hybrids were evaluated in randomized block design with three replications in Viçosa and Visconde do Rio Branco, in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, in three growing seasons. Six traits were evaluated, including grain yield and popping expansion. There were highly significant effects for treatments, varieties and mean heterosis for plant and <b>ear</b> <b>heights,</b> and for the others traits the significance extended to all sources of variation. Amarela and Viçosa revealed superiority for grain yield in relation to performance per se, while Rosa Claro expressed the highest effect of varietal heterosis. The best combinations for grain yield were Roxa x Viçosa, Amarela x Rosa Claro, Rosa Claro x Beija-Flor and Branca x Beija-Flor. For popping expansion, there were positive and negative values for specific heterosis in all growing seasons evaluated, ratifying the influence of bidirectional dominance on this trait. Simultaneous genetic gains for grain yield and popping expansion may be obtained by using Viçosa in intrapopulational programs, while Amarela and Rosa Claro are recommended for using in interpopulational breeding.

40|$|A line x tester {{analysis}} involving forty eight test-crosses {{generated by}} crossing 24 elite maize inbred lines with two testers and four standard checks was conducted for agronomic traits such as grain yield, thousand kernel weight, {{number of rows}} per ear, number of ears per plant, number of days to anthesis and silking, plant and <b>ear</b> <b>heights</b> during 2010 cropping season at Melkassa Agricultural Research Center. The objective {{of the study was}} to estimate the amount of standard heterosis of the hybrids for grain yield and yield related traits. The genotypes were evaluated in 6 x 9 alpha lattice design replicated twice. From this study, Substantial standard heterosis was noticed for all studied traits. For grain yield, the highest standard heterosis was recorded for L 4 x T 2 (89. 24 %) followed by L 10 x T 2 (78. 53 %) over BHQPY- 545 and 131. 20 % and 118. 12 % over Melkassa- 2, respectively, indicating the presence of substantial heterotic potential that could be exploited in maize breeding program and possibility of developing desirable cross combinations and synthetic varieties through crossing and or recombination of inbred lines with desirable traits of interest...|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} thesis, initial blank shape {{optimization}} of a twin elliptical cup to reduce earring phenomenon in anisotropic sheet {{deep drawing process}} was studied. The {{purpose of this study}} is optimization of initial blank for reduction of the <b>ears</b> <b>height</b> value. The optimization process carried out using finite element method approach, which is coupled with Taguchi design of experiments and reduced basis technique methods. The deep drawing process was simulated in FEM software ABAQUS 6. 12. The results of optimization show earring height and, in addition, a number of design variables and time of process can be reduced by using this methods. After optimization process with the proposed method, the maximum reduction of the earring height would be from 21. 08 mm to 0. 07 mm and also it could be reduced to 0 in some of the directions. The proposed optimization design in this article allows the designers to select the practical basis shapes. This leads to obtain better results at the end of the optimization process, to reduce design variables, and also to prevent repeating the optimization steps for indirect shapes...|$|R
