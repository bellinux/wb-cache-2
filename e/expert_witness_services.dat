5000|$|Cooper struck on {{the idea}} using an internet-distributed reality TV format program called [...] "KopBusters" [...] that would muckrake abuses of drug {{enforcement}} organizations. In a typical KopBusters sting operation, Cooper and his associates would place fake drug evidence and cash and call the police to report the [...] "suspicious" [...] materials. Then they would videorecord the police activity {{to see if the}} officers took the cash and destroyed the other evidence, the latter being a felony offense, according to his lawyer. Cooper also lured Odessa, Texas police into raiding a fake marijuana hothouse and published the video of the event publicly via KopBusters. This last sting operation also helped to free Yolanda Madden, a mother of two sentenced to 8 years in prison after police planted methamphetamine in her car. (you can read the story as published in the Texas Observer or you can listen to the same story as told by National Public Radio, “This American Life.” by clicking this link) These activities quickly drew the ire of Williamson County police, who raided his house on March 3, 2010, and charged him with two counts of misdemeanor making a false report to a peace officer. Other consequences included several arrests, Child Protective Services investigations of Cooper's custody of his son, and a visit by the Texas Rangers to arrest Cooper's then wife Candi Cooper, over the Odessa charge, which was later dropped. It's widely reported the raid and arrests were retaliation for Cooper's activism. Due to concerns about further harassment and threats, Cooper fled the U.S. with his family to South America in 2013. Cooper remains active in the anti-drug-war movement via his website, which provides advice, video materials, and <b>expert</b> <b>witness</b> <b>services</b> to recreational drug users.|$|E
40|$|This project {{evaluated}} a pilot engaging six multi-disciplinary teams {{commissioned by}} the Legal Services Commission to provide <b>expert</b> <b>witness</b> <b>services</b> in proceedings under section 31 Children Act 1989. Pilot teams did not attract large numbers of cases, with two teams undertaking no cases under the pilot. Lack of awareness of the pilot, {{the duration of the}} pilot and concerns (particularly amongst lawyers) about the implications of team-based <b>expert</b> <b>witness</b> <b>services</b> all inhibited take-up. Judicial leadership assisted take-up. Requiring the pilot teams to only accept cases which required multi-disciplinary input also had a negative impact on referrals. The concept of multi-disciplinary working was highly regarded by clinicians, children‟s guardians, lawyers, judges and local authorities. The quality assurance provided through mutual support, the capacity of teams to identify the need for additional assessments (and also to resource those assessments), and the ability of teams to make informed recommendations about care planning specific to local resources, were all highly valued. Proper evaluation of the true costs of the <b>expert</b> <b>witness</b> <b>services</b> provided by multi-disciplinary teams was not possible given the number of cases, but participants generally reported the potential for improved value for money and reduced cost to the legal and care systems overall. The take-up under the pilot raises issues regarding the viability of multi-disciplinary teams. Resourcing such teams, and ensuring that they have the necessary capacity to provide <b>expert</b> <b>witness</b> <b>services,</b> requires more detailed planning and discussion with clinicians and their employers to establish whether (and in what form) teams are viable and able to contribute significantly to capacity within the system. This {{is likely to be a}} matter of financial incentives as well as persuading NHS providers that such work is consonant with the values of the NHS. In particular, ensuring expert reports are of high quality and delivered expeditiously is central not only to the legal system but to the well-being (and in some cases safety) of the parties. The NHS is also required to take a more active role in the provision of health expert witnesses in line with its duty under the Children Act 2004 to safeguard and promote the welfare of children...|$|E
40|$|A {{pilot study}} was performed, by questionnaire, on the {{strategies}} that expert witnesses use in calculating billing for travel on forensic cases. The authors tentatively conclude {{that as the}} complexity of the travel situation increases, a tendency toward redundant billing emerges. The results-the first of their kind-are presented with their implications for this and future studies. Experts who work in a single location or who consult on only local cases need not deal with the complexities of travel that burden those experts who travel to other locations to examine litigants, appear for depositions or testify at trial.
