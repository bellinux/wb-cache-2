50|$|After {{one line}} has been created {{on the screen and}} the beams are blanked, the {{magnetic}} field reaches its designed maximum. Relative to the time required for a <b>forward</b> <b>scan,</b> it then changes back relatively quickly to what's required to position the beam beyond the left edge of the visible (unblanked) area. This process occurs with all beams blanked, and is called the retrace. At the left edge, the field steadily decreases in magnitude to start another <b>forward</b> <b>scan,</b> and soon after the start, the beams unblank to start a new visible scan line.|$|E
5000|$|In raster scanning, {{the beam}} sweeps {{horizontally}} left-to-right {{at a steady}} rate, then blanks and rapidly moves back to the left, where it turns back on and sweeps out the next line. During this time, the vertical position is also steadily increasing (downward), but much more slowly - there is one vertical sweep per image frame, but one horizontal sweep per line of resolution. Thus each scan line is sloped slightly [...] "downhill" [...] (towards the lower right), with a slope of approximately -1/horizontal resolution, while the sweep back to the left (retrace) is significantly faster than the <b>forward</b> <b>scan,</b> and essentially horizontal. The resulting tilt in the scan lines is very small, and is dwarfed in effect by screen convexity and other modest geometrical imperfections.|$|E
50|$|Potential sweep {{reversals}} {{as used in}} {{cyclic voltammetry}} are different for a RDE system, since {{the products of the}} potential sweep are continually swept away from the electrode. A reversal would produce a similar i-E curve, which would closely match the <b>forward</b> <b>scan,</b> except for capacitive charging current. A RDE cannot be used to observe the behavior of the electrode reaction products, since they are continually swept away from the electrode. However, the rotating ring-disk electrode is well suited to investigate this further reactivity. The peak current in a cyclic voltammogram for a RDE is a plateau like region, governed by the Levich Equation. The limiting current is typically much higher than the peak current of a stationary electrode, being that the mass transport of reactants is actively stimulated by the rotating disk, and not just governed by diffusion, as is the case for a stationary electrode. Any rotating disk electrode can, of course, also be used as a stationary electrode by using it with the rotator turned off.|$|E

50|$|In cyclic voltammetry, the {{electrode}} potential ramps linearly versus time in cyclical phases (Figure 2). The rate of voltage {{change over time}} during each of these phases {{is known as the}} experiment's scan rate (V/s). The potential is measured between the working electrode and the reference electrode, while the current is measured between the working electrode and the counter electrode. These data are plotted as current (i) versus applied potential (E, often referred to as just 'potential'). In Figure 2, during the initial <b>forward</b> <b>scan</b> (from t0 to t1) an increasingly reducing potential is applied; thus the cathodic current will, at least initially, increase over this time period assuming that there are reducible analytes in the system. At some point after the reduction potential of the analyte is reached, the cathodic current will decrease as the concentration of reducible analyte is depleted. If the redox couple is reversible then during the reverse scan (from t1 to t2) the reduced analyte will start to be re-oxidized, giving rise to a current of reverse polarity (anodic current) to before. The more reversible the redox couple is, the more similar the oxidation peak will be in shape to the reduction peak. Hence, CV data can provide information about redox potentials and electrochemical reaction rates.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} of ML(n-1)+ in the reaction above by the [...] "following" [...] chemical reaction produces a species {{directly at the}} electrode that could display redox chemistry anywhere in a CV plot or none at all. The change in coordination from MLn+ to ML(n-1)+ often prevents the observation of [...] "reversible" [...] behavior during electrochemical experiments like cyclic voltammetry. On the <b>forward</b> <b>scan</b> the expected diffusion wave is observed, in example above the reduction of MLn2+ to MLn1+. However, on the return scan the corresponding wave is not observed, in the example above {{this would be the}} wave corresponding to the oxidation of MLn1+ to MLn2+. In our example there is no MLn1+ to oxidize since it has been converted to ML(n-1)+ through ligand loss. The return wave can sometimes be observed by increasing the scan rates so the following chemical reaction can be observed before the chemical reaction takes place. This often requires the use of ultramicroelectrodes (UME) capable of very high scan rates of 0.5 to 5.0 V/s. Plots of forward and reverse peak ratios against modified forms of the scan rate often identify the rate of the chemical reaction. It has become a common practice to model such plots with electrochemical simulations. The results of such studies are of disputed practical relevance since simulation requires excellent experimental data, better than that routinely obtained and reported. Furthermore, the parameters of such studies are rarely reported and often include an unreasonably high variable to data ratio (ref?). A better practice is to look for a simple, well documented relationship between observed results and implied phenomena; or to investigate a specific physical phenomenon using an alternative technique such as chronoamperometry or those involving a rotating electrode.|$|E

Correlation between formic acid oxidation and oxide species on Pt(Bi) /GC electrode with increases of <b>forward</b> potential <b>scan</b> limit is based on the dependency of the backward peak potential from backward peak current. The obtained dependency reveals Bi influence for the scan limits up to 0. 8 [*]V. Since the Pt(Bi) /GC electrode is composed of Bi core occluded by Pt and Bi-oxide surface layer, the observed behavior is explained through the influence of surface metal oxide on easier formation of OHad species. Nevertheless, the influence of electronic modification of Pt surface atoms by underlying Bi is present and leads to the stronger adsorption of OH on Pt.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of {{constraints}} on pre-ejection dynamical states which cause differential resolution in resonance ejection experiments using Paul traps with stretched geometry. Both analytical and numerical computations are carried out to elucidate the role of damping and scan rate in influencing coherence in ion motion associated with the forward and reverse scan. Adopting the Dehmelt approximation, our analytical study is carried out on a damped, driven Duffing oscillator with positive octopole nonlinearity. Using the method of multiple scales, we derive approximate slow flow equations which describe the ion motion. The phase portraits generated from the slow flow equations, {{in the vicinity of}} the jump, display two stable equilibria (centers) and an unstable fixed point (saddle). Numerical studies on the original equation are used to understand the influence of damping and scan rate in causing coherent ion ejection in these experiments. In the <b>forward</b> <b>scan</b> experiments, for a given damping, low scan rates result in coherent motion of ions of a given mass at the jump point. At this point, the amplitude and phase of ions of a given mass, starting at different initial conditions, become effectively identical. As the scan rate is increased, coherence is destroyed. For a given scan rate, increasing damping introduces coherence in ion motion, while decreasing damping destroys this coherence. In reverse scan experiments, for a given damping, very low scan rates will cause coherent ion motion. Increasing the scan rate destroys this coherence. The effect of damping in reverse scan experiments is qualitatively similar to that in the <b>forward</b> <b>scan</b> experiments, but settling times in the <b>forward</b> <b>scan</b> are shorter, leading to improved coherence and resolution. For mass spectrometrically relevant scan rates and damping values, significantly greater coherence is obtained in the <b>forward</b> <b>scan...</b>|$|E

40|$|We give {{algorithms}} {{to accelerate}} the computation of deterministic finite automata (DFA) by calculating the state of a DFA n positions ahead utilizing a reverse scan of the next n characters. Often this requires scanning fewer than n characters resulting in {{a fraction of the}} input being skipped and a commensurate increase in processing speed. The skipped fraction is > 80 % in several of our examples. We introduce offsetting finite automata (OFA) to encode the accelerated computation. OFA generalize DFA by adding an integer offset to the current input index at each state transition. We give algorithms for constructing an OFA that accepts the same language as a DFA while possibly skipping input, and for matching with an OFA.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxidation of SO 2 on polycrystalline gold electrodes {{has been studied}} by means of cyclic voltammetry and in situ vibrational techniques. On bare gold electrodes, SO 2 is irreversibly oxidised on <b>forward</b> <b>scans</b> at ~ 0. 6 V/RHE, featuring a diffusion-limited peak. Oxidation is inhibited by the formation of chemisorbed oxygen. A SO 2 anodic current rise occurs on the reverse scan in parallel with {{the reduction of the}} metal oxide layers. As shown by FT-IR, oxidation proceeds to yield a mixture of soluble S(VI) species as stable reaction products. From vibrational spectra and results from the irreversible adsorption method, it follows that no strongly adsorbed S–O-like residues are present onto the gold surface in the region 0. 3 – 0. 5 V/RHE. On sulphur-modified electrodes improved electrocatalysis is manifested by the shift of the diffusion-limited peak to lower potentials. The best performance is observed at a sulphur coverage of 0. 5. At higher coverage, sulphur adlayers impart lower catalytic efficiency and eventually show strong poisoning properties. This behaviour is exhibited by sulphur adlayers generated either in situ by SO 2 reduction or ex situ by sulphide adsorption/oxidation in acidic or alkaline media.
