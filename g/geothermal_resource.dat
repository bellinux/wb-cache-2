40|$|Growing {{awareness}} {{and interest in}} renewable resources has raised the need to homogenise the reporting requirements for <b>geothermal</b> <b>resources</b> {{so that they can}} be applied worldwide. As no globally agreed standards, guidelines or codes exist, there remains too much latitude in geothermal assessment, which leads to increased resource uncertainty, more investment risk and less confidence in development. Reconciling the various reporting of <b>geothermal</b> <b>resources</b> is a major challenge as it is difficult to define what the target actually is: the source, the reservoir, the fluids, the stored heat, the recoverable volume, the recoverable heat, the recoverable power, or the net profit. Formulating an agreed procedure to classify <b>geothermal</b> <b>resources</b> is further complicated by changing environmental, policy and regulatory constraints around the globe. Present day techniques of computing <b>geothermal</b> <b>resources</b> provide only ballpark estimates at best. This paper addresses the existing gaps in standardising <b>geothermal</b> <b>resources</b> assessment and reporting by capturing: current methods used to identify potential geothermal projects; current practices in classifying and reporting <b>geothermal</b> <b>resources</b> and reserves; key decision parameters for operators, investors, governments and insurance companies; and current obstacles to a common and transparent way to secure investment in geothermal energy...|$|R

5000|$|The {{government}} of Iceland states: [...] "It should be {{stressed that the}} <b>geothermal</b> <b>resource</b> is not strictly renewable {{in the same sense}} as the hydro resource."

Geothermal power in Iceland is developed in a stepwise development method to ensure that it is sustainable instead of excessive, which would deplete the resource.|$|E

5000|$|Klamath Falls {{is located}} in a known <b>geothermal</b> <b>resource</b> area. Geothermal power has been used {{directly}} for geothermal heating in the area since the early 1900s. A downtown district heating system was constructed in 1981 and extended in 1982. There was public opposition to the scheme. Many homes were heated by private geothermal wells, and owners were concerned that the city system could lower the water level and/or reduce water temperatures. System operation was delayed until 1984 following an aquifer study. Full operational testing showed no negative impact on the private wells. The system was shut down again in 1986 after multiple distribution piping failures were discovered. By 1991, the distribution piping had been reconstructed, and the system was again operating. The system has been expanded since then, and according to the Oregon Institute of Technology, the operation is [...] "at or near operational break-even". The system is used to provide direct heat for homes, city schools, greenhouses, government and commercial buildings, geothermally heated snowmelt systems for sidewalks and roads, and process heat for the wastewater treatment plant.|$|E
