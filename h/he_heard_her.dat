25|$|On October 29, 1945 at 7 p.m., 9-year-old Joseph Vitolo (March 25, 1936 – December 17, 2014) {{was one of}} a {{group of}} {{children}} playing outside his home near The Bronx's Grand Concourse. The children saw something floating above a hill behind the house, and when Joseph recited a Hail Mary he immediately saw a young woman whom he identified as the Virgin. <b>He</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> ask him to come back at the same hour for sixteen nights and to pray for world peace. Joseph did so, accompanied by his mother and numerous onlookers. Within a few days, the visitations were receiving worldwide attention and up to 20,000 people attended the nightly vigil. Among those who flocked to the Vitolo residence were Frank Sinatra and Cardinal Francis Spellman. Revered as a saint by the pilgrims, Joseph was frequently asked to cure the sick and injured and would respond by praying with them. The place where Joseph saw the visions was bought by a devotee who created a shrine there, but there was never any official investigation or attempt to confirm the reported visitations as legitimate. Joseph struggled throughout his life, taking various menial jobs to support his family. He continued to visit the shrine at 7 p.m. each evening until age and poor health prevented him from climbing the hill. The apparitions were never officially approved, but the nearby St. Philip Neri church holds special Masses at the shrine on the anniversaries of the first and last reported visitations.|$|E
500|$|When Milian {{moved to}} Los Angeles {{at the age}} of 13, she {{wanted to be in the}} record business, but did not know how to obtain a {{recording}} contract. After living in Los Angeles for six months, Milian moved into the same apartment complex as songwriter and producer Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins. Jerkins heard about Milian from a boy band he was working with and once <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> sing, they began working together. For a year and a half, Milian went into a studio everyday and worked with Jerkins, which is where she started meeting people in the record business.|$|E
500|$|Despite this success, the Shaughnessy {{connection}} {{was not the}} breakthrough she had hoped for. Schuur failed to impress bandleader Doc Severinsen, who turned her down when she auditioned for a guest spot on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Some {{people in the industry}} dubbed her [...] "Lady Overkill" [...] because she had a tendency to oversing or tried to put everything she knew into a brief space. For the next three years, Shuur performed in clubs and sharpened her skills. Jazz saxophonist Stan Getz, who had been impressed when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> sing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] at Monterey in 1979, did not give up on her. He became her advisor and coach. Discussing Getz in this role, Schuur stated, [...] "he really was a mentor of mine. He taught me that less is more." ...|$|E
60|$|Ursula {{slipped past}} the woman. His door opened. <b>He</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> voice.|$|R
60|$|He {{mechanically}} {{repeated the}} last words. He seemed to doubt whether <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> aright.|$|R
60|$|A {{man came}} up, and she {{recognised}} him as Gallwey. <b>He</b> apparently <b>heard</b> <b>her,</b> for <b>he</b> beckoned to them.|$|R
500|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Poulenc {{produced}} {{a range of}} compositions, from songs to chamber music and another ballet, Aubade. Hell suggests that Koechlin's influence occasionally inhibited Poulenc's natural simple style, and that Auric offered useful guidance to help him appear in his true colours. At a concert of music by the two friends in 1926, Poulenc's songs were sung {{for the first time}} by the baritone Pierre Bernac, from whom, in Hell's phrase, [...] "the name of Poulenc was soon to be inseparable." [...] Another performer with whom the composer came to be closely associated was the harpsichordist Wanda Landowska. <b>He</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> as the soloist in Falla's El retablo de maese Pedro (1923), an early example of the use of a harpsichord in a modern work, and was immediately taken with the sound. At Landowska's request he wrote a concerto, the Concert champêtre, which she premiered in 1929 with the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris conducted by Pierre Monteux.|$|E
500|$|When Milian {{moved to}} Los Angeles, her only desire {{was to be}} an actress. She {{always wanted to be}} in the record business, but did not know how to obtain a {{recording}} contract. During this time, she was also a host for Disney Channel. After living in Los Angeles for six months, Milian moved into the same apartment complex as songwriter and producer Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins. Jerkins heard about Milian from a boy band he was working with and once <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> sing, they began working together. For a year and a half, Milian went into a studio every day and worked with Jerkins, which is where she started meeting people in the record business. She began writing songs at the age of 17 because she needed a demo to help her obtain a recording contract. According to Milian, every time she recorded a song, the producer would refuse to give her the demo, or would write lyrics that she did not agree with. She felt that she had to write a song, record a demo, and send it out on her own.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Edwin Dagenett, for example, {{called her}} [...] "a visionary full of schemes but not practical." [...] Arthur C. Parker admired her intellect but found the {{intimidation}} of her rhetoric, [...] "go my way or I will ruin you," [...] unmanageable. Carlos Montezuma described {{her as a}} [...] "cyclone", moving from one issue to another, wanting to do everything [...] "without considering the consequences." [...] However, Rev. Sherman Coolidge remembered her differently. Recalling the first time <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> speak, Coolidge said, [...] "tears came to his eyes {{to realize that we}} had a woman of brilliance among us and to think of the great good she could do for the Indian people." ...|$|E
60|$|That was {{the first}} time <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> name, and when he wanted his bill he called her by it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Staniford," [...] she began. It was {{the second}} time <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> {{pronounce}} his name; he distinctly remembered the first.|$|R
6000|$|He {{bestowed}} {{her a look}} of mingling {{wonder and}} anger. Had <b>he,</b> indeed, <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> aright? Did her words imply that she disdained the honour? ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{reflecting}} {{before a}} statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> distinct voice telling him to [...] "go to Detroit".. He then applied to the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin in that city, and was received into it on January 14, 1897. He was given the religious name of [...] "Solanus" [...] after Saint Francis Solanus; both men shared a love of the violin. He made his vows on July 21, 1898. He struggled through his studies, but received ordination to the priesthood on July 24, 1904 from Archbishop Sebastian Messmer at Saint Francis of Assisi Church in Milwaukee. Because he had not performed well enough in his studies, he was indeed ordained as a [...] "simplex" [...] priest. He celebrated his first Mass on July 31, 1904 in Appleton, with his family present.|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{was born}} in 1933, on the South Side of Chicago, to Sarah Frances (née Wells) (1903–1999) and Quincy Delightt Jones Sr (1895–1971). The elder Jones was a semi-pro {{baseball}} player and carpenter from Kentucky; his paternal grandmother was an ex-slave in Louisville. They had gone to Chicago {{as part of the}} Great Migration out of the South. Sarah was a bank officer and apartment complex manager. Jones later discovered that his paternal grandfather, Jones, was Welsh. [...] Quincy had a younger brother, Lloyd, who later became an engineer for the Seattle television station KOMO-TV. Lloyd Jones died in 1998. Quincy was introduced to music by his mother, who always sang religious songs; and by his next-door neighbor, Lucy Jackson. When Jones was five or six, Jackson played stride piano next door, and he would always listen through the walls. Lucy Jackson recalled that after <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> that one day, she could not get him off her piano if she tried.|$|E
2500|$|Blackwell was smitten by Lucy Stone when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> {{speak at}} an antislavery meeting in New York in May 1853, moving her {{audience}} to tears with {{what became known}} as her [...] "fugitive mother" [...] speech. He followed her to Massachusetts and obtained a formal letter of introduction from William Lloyd Garrison. Although Stone gladly accepted him as a friend, she rejected him as a suitor because she believed marriage would require her to surrender control over her self and prevent her from pursuing her chosen work. But Blackwell, not having been rejected personally, determined to convince Stone that marriage to him would require sacrifice of neither individuality nor career. He maintained that a marriage based on equality would enable each of them to accomplish more than they could alone. He, too, wanted to work for the good of humanity, but believed he must wait until he had attained the freedom to command his own time and action-- [...] "pecuniary independence," [...] which he expected to achieve in three years.|$|E
6000|$|One scarlet {{word was}} before Carol's eyes while she listened. She fled to Kennicott's office. <b>He</b> gravely <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> out; nodded, said, [...] "Be right over." ...|$|R
60|$|He sat quite still, {{like a man}} who {{is stunned}} by some sudden and {{unexpected}} blow. He seemed dazed. She wondered, even, whether <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
50|$|Claude Debussy <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> sing Yniold in Pelléas et Mélisande at the Covent Garden in London, England. He was {{enthusiastic}} and inscribed a photo to mon toute petite Yniold. <b>He</b> also <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> sing in Proseperine by Camille Saint-Saëns.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{after a while}} <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> voice {{speaking}} inside, harshly, with an agitated abruptness of tone; and {{in answer}} there were groans and broken murmurs of exhaustion. She spoke louder. <b>He</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> saying violently--"No! No! Never!" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{time there}} was no doubt of what the sound implied. <b>He</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> hurried footsteps; <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> dreadful cry. Hester Dethridge had woke in her chair in the pallor, and had {{discovered}} that the Confession was no longer in her own hands.|$|E
60|$|He stood {{perfectly}} motionless. <b>He</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> {{touch the}} match-box, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> fingers in their movement. Then {{he saw her}} {{in the light of}} a match, which she held to the candle. The light rose in the room, then sank to a small dimness, as the flame sank down on the candle, before it mounted again.|$|E
6000|$|Still Kirk made no {{sign that}} <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>her.</b> It was discouraging, but Lora Delane Porter was not made {{of the stuff that}} yields readily to discouragement. She resumed: ...|$|R
60|$|That same afternoon, by Mary's direction, the aerophone {{was brought}} back {{to him in a}} dog-cart, and three days later <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>her</b> mother, Mrs. Porson, was dead.|$|R
6000|$|Strangely {{moved by}} this, the first wish <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> express since the tragedy, Winton took her hand, and, {{looking at it}} as if for answer to his question, said: ...|$|R
60|$|Presently his {{thoughts}} were {{brought back to}} his family by the sounds of Eleanor's return. <b>He</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> key in the outer door; <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> move about {{in the hall and}} then slip lightly up to bed. He did not go out to speak to her, and she did not note the light under his door.|$|E
60|$|But {{from his}} cot on the sleeping-porch <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> weeping, slowly, without hope.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> out, {{watching}} her with those keen {{eyes of his}} the while.|$|E
60|$|But Kurt {{could not}} trust {{his ears and}} he had to make haste to {{terminate}} the confession into which his folly and emotion had betrayed him. <b>He</b> scarcely <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> words.|$|R
60|$|As if <b>he</b> had not <b>heard</b> <b>her,</b> <b>he</b> went on wearily {{loosening}} a pack.|$|R
50|$|Donia's talents {{appeared}} {{when she}} was a child, participating in school plays and shows. Her father cried when <b>he</b> first <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> sing for Fayrouz, and her mom encouraged her acting career from an early age.|$|R
60|$|At last <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> moving about. He rushed {{downstairs and}} {{waited on the}} stoop.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> turn quickly, {{and felt}} her eyes upon him. He went on doggedly.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a long}} silence. Then {{the door}} closed gently and <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> go upstairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Was {{it because}} you like me personally?" [...] Nick pursued as if <b>he</b> hadn't <b>heard</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "You may think that an odd or {{positively}} an odious question; but isn't it natural, my wanting to know?" ...|$|R
60|$|The Duke {{remained}} as though <b>he</b> had not <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> speech. <b>He</b> laid his hand upon Cecil's shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your grandfather!" [...] said Sir Mungo,--after doubting if <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> aright,--"Said she her grandfather! The lassie is distraught!--I ken nae wench on {{this side}} of Temple Bar that is derived from so distant a relation." ...|$|R
