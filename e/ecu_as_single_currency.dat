40|$|Adapting the {{euro-currency}} implies transmitting {{the national}} monetary policy to European Central Bank. This implies that a nation {{can no longer}} use the monetary policy to dampen or to stimulate the economy. A high rate of inflation is destructive to an economy while a low rate of inflation can be beneficial to a limited extent. EMU has a task to ensure the stable rate of inflation at two percent; hence the inflation levels of its member states have to converge. If the inflation of the EMU member state is at target level then the credibility of ECB will be achieved. And the inflation expectations will be low. But since the adaption of euro <b>as</b> the <b>single</b> <b>currency,</b> inflation levels have diverged from each other. And this is worsened by the financial crisis in 2008.   Aside from that, what other factors affect the differences in inflation level and {{what might be the}} economic consequences waiting for the future of Euro-countries?

The effect of this on countries with high level of inflation might be a strict fiscal policy, meaning budget cuts and increased tax rate. ...|$|R

The dispersion of these costs was analysed using the coefficient of variation. The results show little evidence of price convergence for non-residential construction for either country group.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} simultaneously the potential effects of European Union's Association Agreement with Morocco and the adoption of the Euro <b>as</b> a <b>single</b> <b>currency</b> on exchange rate regime of Moroccan Dirham. Since Morocco depends heavily on EU as a market for its exports and a source for its imports, limited variability of the DH against the Euro seems à priori, to be an appropriate policy option. This option may even be strengthened within the FTA. However, the nature and the composition of Moroccan exports are typical of North-South trade with little diversification and high concentration on textiles and agricultural products. From this perspective, the risk of asymmetric shocks is more likely, which reduces the expected gains from nominal anchorage. This paper aims at contributing to the future exchange rate regime in Morocco and focuses on three main issues. The first issue is to investigate the potential effects of the FTA on trade structure and industrial specialization in Morocco. To this end, a computable general equilibrium model is used to simulate macroeconomic and sectoral effects of the implementation of the FTA on industrial sector. The second issue is to estimate the real exchange rate equilibrium based on macroeconomic fundamentals and assess the degree of misalignment of the actual value of the Dirham. Finally, the question of exchange rate arrangement is examined by combining the expected effects of free trade area between Morocco and the European Union, the existing degree of misalignment of the Dirham, and considering the adoption of the Euro <b>as</b> a <b>single</b> <b>currency</b> in 12 European countries. Our results seem to suggest that the implementation of a FTA may lead to a reallocation of industrial production toward an even more specialization in labor-intensive products. Under such circumstances, the symmetry of shocks, as an important condition for anchoring the DH to the Euro, is not satisfied making this option non-desirable. ...|$|R
40|$|Powerful {{obstacles}} to the further integration of repo, bond and equity markets remain the still fragmented securities settlement industry in Europe, which charges much higher fees for cross-border transactions than for domestic transactions, {{and differences in}} legal systems. This paper investigates the main developments in the euro area financial markets {{before and after the}} introduction of the <b>single</b> <b>currency.</b> It looks at the evolution of the euro area financial structure in the last few years. Interestingly, in various dimensions the financial structure of euro-area countries seems to become more diverse over time. We assess the progress towards financial integration in the most important euro-area financial segments, namely money and equity markets, as well as banking. The available data suggest that the unsecured money market strongly integrated with the introduction of the euro, <b>as</b> the <b>single</b> <b>currency</b> and related euro-area-wide large-value payment systems link the different countries well. Also, some progress occurred in the integration of euro-area equity markets, as stock exchanges in a few countries merged to form Euronext and professional asset managers replaced country allocation by sector allocation strategies. Overall, while asset holdings have become more international in the euro area since the introduction of the <b>single</b> <b>currency,</b> securities markets are still much less integrated than in the US. In the area of retail banking the increased homogeneity of interest rates seems to be driven more by macroeconomic convergence than by market integration...|$|R

The euro area is comparable in size to the US with respect to GDP and even exceeds the US regarding the share in world trade. Thus questions arise of whether the international monetary system turns out to be bipolar in the long run or whether the yen can also play its part. It turns out that real activity, size and sophistication of financial markets, monetary and financial stability and inertia are the most prominent characteristics making a currency to be preferred on a world-wide level. We thus conclude that the integration and the development of European financial markets are of special importance for a stronger international role of the dollar, but that the historical experience of only gradually changing supremacy of international currencies still applies. ...|$|R

Using a sample of 76 listed firms over the period 1995 - 2008, we found convincing evidence that the euro contributed to a decrease on the value relevance of accounting information and also increased the conservatism of financial statements, verifying previous arguments that the induction of Greece in the EMU resulted to less competitiveness and more financial instability.

They concern the transformation and the evolution, in times of crisis, of the role of national central banks (NCBs) within the Eurosystem and the difficulty of insertion of the euro area into the global system. The concept of the ‘Eurosystem’ was introduced by Article 282, paragraph 1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), formerly the Treaty on the European Community, as modified by the so-called Lisbon Treaty, which entered into force on 1 December 2009. From the start of the final stage of the EMU, on 1 January 1999, this denomination of Eurosystem has identified, within the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), the group formed by the NCBs that have adopted the euro <b>as</b> a <b>single</b> <b>currency</b> and the European Central Bank (ECB).

Daily activity levels were then quantified using locomotor activity monitors during both light and dark phases.
