25|$|N.B.: With {{the past}} {{conditional}} (would have) this negative form is {{used with the}} main verb. Example: لوكان عرفت راني ما جيتش lūkān ɛṛaft rānī mā jītš, If I knew <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> come.|$|E
25|$|It {{is certain}} that John Paul <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{reversed}} Paul VI's teaching, namely on contraception, {{since it was a}} question of sexual ethics and Church doctrine, rather than one of personal opinion. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that John Paul <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> insisted upon the negative judgment in Humanae vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did. Luciani had mixed feelings in regards to the traditional stance on contraception. In 1968, as Bishop of Vittorio Veneto, he submitted a report to his predecessor as the Patriarch of Venice, Giovanni Urbani, that argued that the contraceptive pill should be permitted. It was agreed on by fellow Veneto bishops and was later submitted to Pope Paul VI. When Humanae vitae was released, Luciani defended that document. But he seemed to contradict that defence in a letter he wrote to his diocese four days after the release of the encyclical. In May 1978, Cardinal Luciani was invited to speak at a Milanese conference to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the encyclical. He refused to speak at the event or even attend it.|$|E

25|$|As {{men have}} said often, {{it seemed as}} if there was in this war a God of Battles who held His mighty hand before the Americans. As I looked at Sergeant Quick wig-wagging there against the sky, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> given a tin tobacco-tag for his life. Escape for him seemed impossible. It seemed absurd to hope {{that he would not be}} hit; I only hoped that he would be hit just a little, in the arm, the shoulder, or the leg.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} or four camps {{under the name of}} Camp Farouk at that time in Afghanistan. I {{attended}} the open mainstream camp, not terrorist camps. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been there if there was any suggestion of terrorist activity or the targeting of civilians. How would a white boy new to Islam, not understanding local customs or languages, largely uneducated in the ways of the world, get access to such supposedly secret camps planning acts of terror? The camps I attended were not al-Qaeda. I did not hear about such an organisation until my arrival in Guantanamo Bay.|$|E
25|$|I confess that, as {{a student}} unaware {{of the history of}} the subject and unaware of the {{connection}} with cyclotomy, I did not find the law or its so-called elementary proofs appealing. I suppose, although <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> (and could not have) expressed myself in this way that I saw it as little more than a mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become. It was only in Hermann Weyl's book on the algebraic theory of numbers that I appreciated it as anything more.|$|E

500|$|At Oxford, Tarwater {{found a new}} {{perspective}} on life: [...] "I {{used to be in the}} sport for Davis Tarwater. [...] Going to Oxford and seeing the selflessness and ambition of the students transitioned me to being in the sport as a mechanism to do good." [...] The Oxford swim team encouraged him to join its ranks, and he subsequently earned most valuable player honors and a Blue jacket, the British equivalent of a varsity letter. On his newfound perspective, Tarwater said, [...] "Missing the Olympics in 2008 was the best thing that's ever happened in my whole life... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> gone to Oxford; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> invested in my own personhood... being able to chase an Olympic dream is a gift... I made it a misery. [...] It doesn't have to be a misery." [...] He graduated from Oxford in 2010 with a master's degree in Latin American studies. He described the year at Oxford as the best time of his life.|$|E
500|$|... "Timodemus of Aphidnae, {{who was one}} of Themistocles' enemies but not a man of note, was crazed {{with envy}} and spoke bitterly to Themistocles of his visit to Lacedaemon, saying that the honors he had from the Lacedaemonians were paid him for Athens' sake and not for his own. This he kept saying until Themistocles replied, 'This is the truth of the matter: if I had been a man of Belbina <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been honored in this way by the Spartans, nor would you, sir, for all you are a man of Athens.' Such was the end of that business." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to her onscreen debut, Francis {{appeared}} on the CBS talk show The Talk and stated that she [...] "would not have this job without Oprah Winfrey", saying: [...] "I must thank Oprah Winfrey here and now. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> this job without her. She made my dream come true as well." [...] In August 2011, Francis began experiencing lack of screen-time, leading viewers to speculate she had been let go from the soap opera and possibly returning to her General Hospital role. However, a spokesperson for The Young and the Restless confirmed that Francis was simply taking a brief hiatus to film a sequel to her Hallmark Channel film The Note.|$|E

500|$|Whitlam {{was delayed}} in leaving Parliament House, while Fraser left {{slightly}} early, {{with the result}} that Fraser arrived at Yarralumla first. He was taken into an anteroom, and his car was moved. Whitlam maintained that the purpose in moving Fraser's car was to ensure that the Prime Minister was not tipped off by seeing it, stating, [...] "Had I known Mr. Fraser was already there, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> set foot in Yarralumla." [...] Kelly doubted Whitlam would have recognised Fraser's car, which was an ordinary Ford LTD from the car pool. According to Fraser biographer Philip Ayres, [...] "A white car pulled up at the front would signify nothing in particular—it would simply be in the way".|$|E
500|$|Atlético de Kolkata {{head coach}} Habas lauded his players after the final: [...] "I must thank my players for {{they have been}} magnificent. I cannot ask them for {{anything}} more, for they have given me the ultimate gift." [...] He also praised his backroom staff: [...] "I must thank my entire support staff, for without them, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to function. The owners have been fantastic and have supported us through thick and thin. This title is for the fans {{as they have been}} our strength." [...] Habas was also delighted that the match was won from a goal scored by an Indian player, saying, [...] "I think it is marvellous that Rafique got the winning goal. It is fantastic that an Indian player settled the contest." ...|$|E
500|$|PedroII {{regarded}} {{the death of}} his son as [...] "the most fatal blow that I could ever receive, and certainly <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> survived were it not that I still have a wife and two children". The Emperor wrote to his brother-in-law Dom FernandoII, King-consort of Portugal: [...] "By the time you receive this, you will certainly have learnt of the grievous loss I have undergone... God who has made me pass though so hard a testing, will in his mercy give me grounds to console my sorrows." [...] PedroII had already lost another son, Dom Afonso, almost three years earlier. He revealed his inner turmoil in a sonnet: [...] "Twice already I have suffered death, for the father dies who sees his son is dead." [...] Except for brief inspection visits, the Emperor avoided Santa Cruz thereafter.|$|E
6000|$|Then outspoke Mr. Dockwrath, [...] "Under these circumstances, Mr. Mason, if I were you, I should {{withdraw}} from the house at once. <b>I</b> certainly <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> my case blown upon." ...|$|R

500|$|When Arsène Wenger joined Arsenal in October 1996, he {{attempted}} to organise an extra training session at the club's University College London Union (UCLU) Shenley Sports grounds, {{for the benefit of}} getting to know his players. Wenger was told that the ground – owned by UCL, was reserved for its students, which left him not knowing “whether to laugh or cry”. A few weeks after, a fire partially burnt down the training centre, costing £50,000 in damages. Arsenal temporarily rehoused their training base to Sopwell House Hotel in St Albans. Wenger, dismayed by the arrangement, campaigned for a purpose-built, Arsenal-owned ground that housed the latest training equipment. This was one of the [...] "important decisions" [...] he wanted to make for the club – [...] "Without an assurance of that freedom and control <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> stayed." ...|$|E
500|$|After an {{adjournment}} {{for lunch}} Gordon-Cumming {{returned to the}} witness box, where he was cross-examined by Russell. During the session Russell provided {{a model of the}} table used and a photograph of the room, and questioned Gordon-Cumming about the bets where cheating had been suspected. Russell also asked him about why he had signed the document agreeing not to play cards: Gordon-Cumming stated that he had [...] "lost my head... on that occasion. If I had not lost my head <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> signed that document". Gordon-Cumming's cross-examination ran into the second day, after which he was then re-examined by Clarke; his time in the witness box lasted until 1pm. The Illustrated London News considered that [...] "Gordon-Cumming made an admirable witness... leaning easily on the rail, his grey-gloved left hand resting easily on the bare right, perfectly dressed, his tones equable, firm, neither over-hurried nor over-deliberate, cool, but not too cool".|$|E
500|$|A hadith records that, {{when the}} second Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (580–644) came to kiss the stone, he said {{in front of all}} assembled: [...] "No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither harm anyone nor benefit anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Messenger [...] kissing you, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> kissed you." [...] However, in the hadith {{collection}} Kanz al-Ummal, it is recorded that Ali responded to Umar, saying, [...] "This stone (Hajar Aswad) can indeed benefit and harm. ... Allah says in Quran that he created human beings from the progeny of Adam and made them witness over themselves and asked them, 'Am I not your creator?' Upon this, all of them confirmed it. Thus Allah wrote this confirmation. And this stone has a pair of eyes, ears and a tongue and it opened its mouth upon the order of Allah, who put that confirmation in it and ordered to witness it to all those worshippers who come for Hajj." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{offer you}} no bribe, Mr. Bellairs; I give you alms," [...] I returned. [...] "I {{will do nothing}} to forward you in your hateful business; yet <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> willingly <b>have</b> you starve." ...|$|R

500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I got tired of working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.|$|E
500|$|Johnson opposes {{federal and}} state gun control {{legislation}}, saying: [...] "I'm {{a firm believer in}} the Second Amendment and so <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> signed legislation banning assault weapons or automatic weapons." [...] Johnson says that the Second Amendment [...] "was designed to protect us against a government that could be very intrusive. And in this country, we have a growing police state - if people can own assault rifles or automatic rifles, I think leads to a more civil government." [...] Johnson would, however, limit weapons such as rocket launchers. Johnson believes that allowing concealed carrying of guns reduces crime and gun violence. He opposes barring gun sales to individuals on the no-fly list, because he claims that such lists have a high error rate. Johnson has called for a [...] "thousand-person taskforce" [...] or [...] "hot line" [...] to prevent terrorists from obtaining guns, and has questioned why the perpetrator of the Orlando nightclub shooting was not [...] "deprived of his guns" [...] after being interviewed three times.|$|E
500|$|Several James Turner Street {{residents}} have claimed they were tricked into {{appearing in the}} series by Love Productions, who they say told them it would be about community spirit. One resident told the Birmingham Mail, [...] "They {{told me it was}} about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn't show any of that. If they had said it was about benefits and making the street look bad <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> taken part. They tricked us." [...] Responding to allegations the residents were duped, Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began, and that process continued afterwards: [...] "Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were given the opportunity to comment on them. Both Love and Channel 4 listened to any concerns raised, and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them." [...] Dierdre Kelly, however, subsequently told ITV's This Morning that she believed the programme had provided a one-sided view of her community, and that the residents [...] "went into the show naively". Gareth Price of The Guardian suggested the show's producers [...] "adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience".|$|E
50|$|The tone is grim. It is {{marred by}} gloom and sadness. Dubus, of course, needed {{to let the}} reader know the mental anguish Mitchell feels. To do this, he reiterates the fact that Mitchell feels older and {{the details of the}} rape that he witnessed. The tone is {{absolutely}} perfect for the story, as it is a gloomy, regretful reflection of past events. <b>Is</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> worked if Dubus described everything in a cheerful manner or with joy in his prose, it has to be grim. This helps play a role into the theme of guilt.|$|R
6000|$|Queen Aoife had a {{son that}} was red haired and pale faced like herself, [...] and {{everyone}} {{said that he would}} kill Cuchullain some day, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> [...] <b>not</b> <b>have</b> that spoken of.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will get}} used to him, papa. He seemed {{exceedingly}} tall to me at first--like a tower when I looked up at him; but, on the whole, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>not</b> <b>have</b> him otherwise." ...|$|R
