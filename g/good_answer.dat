500|$|In a 2014 {{article in}} the [...] "Spiritual Matters" [...] section of the Australian {{newspaper}} The Daily Examiner, Reverend Chris Sparks calls What's So Amazing About Grace? [...] "masterful" [...] and writes that Yancey provides a <b>good</b> <b>answer</b> to the question raised by its title. In his 2015 book Unoffendable: How Just One Change Can Make All of Life Better, Christian radio personality Brant Hansen calls What's So Amazing About Grace? life-changing and writes that Yancey's discussion of [...] "Babette's Feast" [...] inspired {{him to see the}} film. U.S. Catholic reviewer Mary Lynn Hendrickson also praised Yancey's retelling of Karen Blixen's story.|$|E
2500|$|The {{renormalization}} group concept {{associated with}} the first question predates the concept {{associated with the}} second question. Certainly, if one were {{in possession of a}} <b>good</b> <b>answer</b> to the second question, the first question could also be answered.

2500|$|Frequently, the {{audience}} responded appropriately as Rayburn critiqued the contestant's answer. (For the [...] "world's biggest" [...] question, Rayburn might show disdain to an answer such as [...] "fingers" [...] or [...] "bag" [...] and compliment an answer such as [...] "rear end" [...] or [...] "boobs", often also commenting on {{the audience}}'s approving or disapproving response.) The audience usually groaned or booed when a contestant or celebrity gave a bad or inappropriate answer, whereas they cheered and applauded in approval of a <b>good</b> <b>answer.</b> Sometimes, they howled at a risque answer.|$|E

60|$|I {{might tell}} Mark Twain that in France {{a man who}} was seen tipsy in his club would {{immediately}} see his name canceled from membership. A man who had settled his fortune on his wife to avoid meeting his creditors would be refused admission into any decent society. Many a Frenchman has blown his brains out rather than declare himself a bankrupt. Now would Mark Twain remark to this: 'An American is not such a fool: when a creditor stands in his way he closes his doors, and reopens them the following day. When he has been a bankrupt three times he can retire from business?']--It is a <b>good</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E

50|$|There {{are five}} {{possible}} grades awarded. From best to worst, these are ‘S’ (Outstanding), ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, and ‘U’ (Unclassified). The {{rule of thumb}} is that four <b>good</b> <b>answers</b> (to a reasonable level of completion) will gain a grade 1; more may gain an S, and fewer will gain a correspondingly lower grade. However, the grade boundaries can shift from year to year, and the boundaries for STEP 3 are generally a small but appreciable margin lower.|$|R
40|$|Version: Accepted for {{publication}} in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM), 2013, IEEE Computer Society. Doi: [URL] Q&A sites have become popular to share and look for valuable knowledge. Users can easily and quickly access high quality answers to common questions. The main mechanism to label <b>good</b> <b>answers</b> is to count the votes per answer. This mechanism, however, does not consider whether other answers were present {{at the time when}} a vote is given. Consequently, <b>good</b> <b>answers</b> that were given later are likely to receive less votes than they would have received if given earlier. In this paper we present a Weighted Votes (WV) metric that gives different weights to the votes depending on how many answers were present when the vote is performed. The idea behind WV is to emphasize the answer that receives most of the votes when most of the answers were already posted. Mining the Stack Overflow data dump we show that the WV metric is able to highlight between 4. 07 % and 10. 82 % answers that differ from the most voted ones.

60|$|My Lords, we have done, on our part; we {{have made}} out our case; and it only remains {{for me to make}} a few {{observations}} upon what Mr. Hastings has thought proper to put forward in his defence. Does he meet our case with anything but these general attestations, upon which I must first remark, that there is not one single matter of fact touched upon in them? Your Lordships will observe, and you may hunt them out through the whole body of your minutes, that you do not find a single fact mentioned in any of them. But there is an abundance of panegyric; and if we were doing nothing but making satires, as the newspapers charge us with doing, against Mr. Hastings, panegyric would be a <b>good</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Lincoln continued: That was not {{the case}} he was making. What motive would tempt any set of men to go into an {{extensive}} survey of a railroad which they did not intend to make? What good would it do? Did men act without motive? Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money which could be of no account to them? He generally found that men who have money were disposed to hold on to it, unless they could see something to be made by its investment. He could not see what motive of advantage to the new States could be subserved by merely keeping the public lands out of market, and preventing their settlement. As far as he could see, the new States were wholly without any motive to do such a thing. This, then, he took to be a <b>good</b> <b>answer</b> to the first objection.|$|E
6000|$|The Attorney-General {{supported}} Mr. Walpole in affirmance of this principle.

I would take notice that we are upon an impeachment, not upon an indictment. The courts below have set forms to themselves, which have prevailed for a long course of time, and thereby are become the forms by which those courts are to govern themselves; but it never was thought that the forms of those courts had any influence on the proceedings of Parliament. In Richard II.'s time, it is said in the records of Parliament, that proceedings in Parliament are not to be governed by the forms of Westminster Hall. We are {{in the case of an}} impeachment, and in the Court of Parliament. Your Lordships have already given judgment against six upon this impeachment, and it is warranted by the precedents in Parliament; therefore we insist that the articles are good in substance." ...|$|E
