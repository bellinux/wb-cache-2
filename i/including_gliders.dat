50|$|The Powerful Owl (Nonox strenua) is {{the largest}} species of owl in Australia {{measuring}} 60-65 cm from head to tail, and is listed as vulnerable in Victoria.

50|$|The US FAA {{recommends}} that aircraft (<b>including</b> <b>gliders)</b> stay at least 20 nautical {{miles away from}} a severe thunderstorm, while a glider pilot could be tempted to use the updraughts below and inside the cloud. There are two sorts of danger {{for this type of}} aircraft. One is related to the shear effects between updraughts and downdraughts inside the cloud - effects that can smash the glider. This shear creates a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that can generate extremely violent sub-vortices. The second danger is more insidious: the strong updraughts below a supercell cumulonimbus can cover a large area and contain little or no turbulence as explained below. In this case, the glider can be sucked into the cloud, where the pilot can quickly lose visual reference to the ground, causing conditions to quickly become IMC.In these conditions, the aircraft (if not equipped for IMC flight and flown by a pilot experienced in IMC flight) is likely to enter a graveyard spiral and eventually break up by exceeding the wing load limit. In this scenario, the cause of the disintegration of the aircraft is not atmospheric turbulence but is the inability of the pilot to control the aircraft following the loss of visual reference to the ground. In the case of an instrument flight, cumulonimbus can catch a pilot by surprise when embedded in a more benign cloud mass. For example, nimbostratus can originate from the spreading of a cumulonimbus (nimbostratus cumulonimbogenitus), making the presence of active convective cells likely. Small private airplanes are generally not equipped with on-board weather radars; and during an IFR approach, they can be sent accidentally by air traffic control to non-obvious active cells.|$|E
40|$|My honors thesis {{deals with}} Conway's Game of Life. Conway's Game of Life {{is not so}} much a game as a study of states and how to move from one state to another by {{following}} a set of rules. Conway's version of life was originally a two-dimensional game but some studies have been done in a three-dimensional realm. Do characteristics found in a two-dimensional game also appear in a three-dimensional realm? I explore the occurrence of several characteristics, <b>including</b> <b>gliders</b> (a reoccurring state that translates), stable states, and cyclical states using various sets of rules. I also explore how this game can be applicable to real world situations. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of rule 54 one-dimensional two-state cellular automaton (CA) are a discrete analog of a space-time {{dynamics of}} excitations in nonlinear active medium with mutual inhibition. A cell switches its state 0 to state 1 {{if one of}} its two neighbors is in state 1 (propagation of a perturbation) and a cell remains in state 1 only if its two neighbors are in state 0. A lateral inhibition is because a 1 -state neighbor causes a 1 -state cell to switch to state 0. The rule produces a rich spectrum of space-time dynamics, <b>including</b> <b>gliders</b> and glider guns just from four primitive gliders. We construct a catalogue of gliders and describe them by tiles. We calculate a subset of regular expressions Ψ_R 54 to encode gliders. The regular expressions are derived from de Bruijn diagrams, tile-based representation of gliders, and cycle diagrams sometimes. We construct an abstract machine that recognizes regular expressions of gliders in rule 54 and validate Ψ_R 54. We also propose a way to code initial configurations of gliders to depict any type of collision between the gliders and explore self-organization of gliders, formation of larger tiles, and soliton-like interactions of gliders and computable devices.

40|$|This project aims to {{construct}} logical circuits in models of chemical media, including two cellular automata models: the 2 + -medium and the spiral rule, {{as well as}} a numerical simulation model of the light-sensitive Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) medium. The 2 + -medium is a two-dimensional three-state cellular automaton model of the excitable medium. Each cell takes one of the three possible states: excited, refractory and resting. All cells update their states simultaneously in discrete time depending on the states of its eight neighbours. A resting cell becomes excited if it has exactly two excited neighbours, and the transitions from excited state to refractory state, and from refractory state to resting state are unconditional. Binary adders and multipliers are implemented in the 2 + -medium. The spiral rule is a three-state k-totalistic cellular automaton on a two-dimensional lattice with hexagonal tiling. Each cell has three possible states: 0, 1 and 2, and a 7 - cell neighbourhood consisting of the cell itself as well as its six closest neighbours. The spiral rule can also be interpreted as a model of reaction-diffusion chemical system. Many structures emerge while evolving the spiral rule, <b>including</b> <b>gliders,</b> stationary eaters and glider guns. Binary counters and adders are implemented in the spiral rule. The light-sensitive ruthenium-catalysed BZ medium has a feature that its excitability can be controlled by adjusting the light intensity. While the excitability is in the sub-excitable state, wave-fragments can be initiated, providing a means to perform collision-based computing in real chemical media. In this project, a two-variable Oregonator model is used to simulate such a medium. A 1 -bit half adder is implemented in the simulated medium with wave-fragments constrained by channels.
