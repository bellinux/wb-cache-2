2500|$|Some {{austenitic}} stainless steels and nickel-based alloys are prone to <b>intergranular</b> corrosion. When subjected to temperatures around [...] for too long a time, chromium reacts with carbon in the material, forming chromium carbide and depleting the crystal edges of chromium, impairing their corrosion resistance in a process called sensitization. Such sensitized steel undergoes corrosion in the areas near the welds where the temperature-time was favorable for forming the carbide. This kind of corrosion is often termed weld decay.|$|E
2500|$|Glass-ceramic {{materials}} {{share many}} properties with both non-crystalline glass and crystalline ceramics. They are {{formed as a}} glass, and then partially crystallized by heat treatment. For example, the microstructure of whiteware ceramics frequently contains both amorphous and crystalline phases. Crystalline grains are often embedded within a non-crystalline <b>intergranular</b> phase of grain boundaries. When applied to whiteware ceramics, [...] means the material has an extremely low permeability to liquids, often but not always water, when determined by a specified test regime.|$|E
2500|$|To {{understand}} {{the mechanics of}} soils {{it is necessary to}} understand how normal stresses and shear stresses are shared by the different phases. Neither gas nor liquid provide significant resistance to shear stress. The shear resistance of soil is provided by friction and interlocking of the particles. The friction depends on the <b>intergranular</b> contact stresses between solid particles. The normal stresses, on the other hand, are shared by the fluid and the particles. [...] Although the pore air is relatively compressible, and hence takes little normal stress in most geotechnical problems, liquid water is relatively incompressible and if the voids are saturated with water, the pore water must be squeezed out in order to pack the particles closer together.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coefficient}} of lateral earth pressure, K, {{is defined as}} the ratio of the horizontal effective stress, σ’h, to the vertical effective stress, σ’v. The effective stress is the <b>intergranular</b> stress calculated by subtracting the pore pressure from the total stress as described in soil mechanics. K for a particular soil deposit {{is a function of the}} soil properties and the stress history. The minimum stable value of K is called the active earth pressure coefficient, Ka; the active earth pressure is obtained, for example,when a retaining wall moves away from the soil. [...] The maximum stable value of K is called the passive earth pressure coefficient, Kp; the passive earth pressure would develop, for example against a vertical plow that is pushing soil horizontally. For a level ground deposit with zero lateral strain in the soil, the [...] "at-rest" [...] {{coefficient of}} lateral earth pressure, K0 is obtained.|$|E

50|$|<b>Intergranular</b> {{corrosion}} {{is generally}} considered to be caused by the segregation of impurities at the grain boundaries or by enrichment or depletion of one of the alloying elements in the grain boundary areas. Thus in certain aluminium alloys, small amounts of iron have been shown to segregate in the grain boundaries and cause <b>intergranular</b> corrosion. Also, {{it has been shown that}} the zinc content of a brass is higher at the grain boundaries and subject to such corrosion. High-strength aluminium alloys such as the Duralumin-type alloys (Al-Cu) which depend upon precipitated phases for strengthening are susceptible to <b>intergranular</b> corrosion following sensitization at temperatures of about 120 °C. Nickel-rich alloys such as Inconel 600 and Incoloy 800 show similar susceptibility. Die-cast zinc alloys containing aluminum exhibit <b>intergranular</b> corrosion by steam in a marine atmosphere. Cr-Mn and Cr-Mn-Ni steels are also susceptible to <b>intergranular</b> corrosion following sensitization in the temperature range of 420°-850 °C. In the case of the austenitic stainless steels, when these steels are sensitized by being heated in the temperature range of about 520° to 800 °C, depletion of chromium in the grain boundary region occurs, resulting in susceptibility to <b>intergranular</b> corrosion. Such sensitization of austenitic stainless steels can readily occur because of temperature service requirements, as in steam generators, or as a result of subsequent welding of the formed structure.|$|E

50|$|During {{the process}} of {{fractional}} crystallization, melts become enriched in incompatible elements. Hence, knowledge of the crystallization sequence is critical in understanding how melt compositions evolve. Textures of rocks provide insights, as documented in the early 1900s by Bowen's reaction series. An example of such texture, related to fractioned crystallization, is <b>intergranular</b> (also known as intercumulus) textures that develop wherever a mineral crystallizes later than the surrounding matrix, hence filling the left-over interstitial space. A variety of Cr, Fe, and Ti oxides show such textures, like <b>intergranular</b> chromite in a siliceous matrix. Experimentally-determined phase diagrams for simple mixtures provide insights into general principles. Numerical calculations with special software have become increasingly able to simulate natural processes accurately.|$|E

50|$|While the <b>intergranular</b> failure {{problems}} {{noted above}} are sometimes severe, {{they are rarely}} the cause of major service failures (in structural steels, for example), as suitable safety margins {{are included in the}} designs. Perhaps the greater concern is that with the development of new technologies and materials with new and more extensive mechanical property requirements, and with the increasing impurity contents {{as a result of the}} increased recycling of materials, we may see <b>intergranular</b> failure in materials and situations not seen currently. Thus, a greater understanding of all of the mechanisms surrounding segregation might lead to being able to control these effects in the future. Modeling potentials, experimental work, and related theories are still being developed to explain these segregation mechanisms for increasingly complex systems.|$|E

50|$|Recently, a newer {{method has}} been {{developed}} by Mouzon, which relies on the methods of glass-encapsulation, combined with vacuum sintering at 1600 °C followed by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at 1500 °C of a highly agglomerated commercial powder. The use of evacuated glass capsules to perform HIP treatment allowed samples that showed open porosity after vacuum sintering to be sintered to transparency. The sintering response of the investigated powder was studied by careful microstructural observations using scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy both in reflection and transmission. The key to this method is to keep porosity <b>intergranular</b> during pre-sintering, {{so that it can}} be removed subsequently by HIP treatment. It was found that agglomerates of closely packed particles are helpful to reach that purpose, since they densify fully and leave only <b>intergranular</b> porosity.|$|E

50|$|A spring may be {{the result}} of karst {{topography}} where surface water has infiltrated the Earth's surface (recharge area), becoming part of the area groundwater.

50|$|There are {{two aspects}} to surface integrity: {{topography}} characteristics and surface layer characteristics.

The surface layer characteristics that can change through processing are: plastic deformation, residual stresses, cracks, hardness, overaging, phase changes, recrystallization, <b>intergranular</b> attack, and hydrogen embrittlement. When a traditional manufacturing process is used, such as machining, the surface layer sustains local plastic deformation.|$|E
