5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of what he {{considered to be an}} unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of <b>his</b> <b>adventures</b> and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Wallace {{returned}} to England, where {{he moved in}} with his sister Fanny Sims and her husband Thomas. While recovering from his travels, Wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about <b>his</b> <b>adventures</b> and discoveries to scientific societies such as the Zoological Society of London. Later that year, he visited Darwin at Down House, and became friendly with both Charles Lyell and Herbert Spencer. During the 1860s, Wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection. He also corresponded with Darwin about a variety of topics, including sexual selection, warning colouration, and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species. In 1865, he began investigating spiritualism.|$|E

5|$|In Greek {{literature}} {{he first}} {{appears as a}} great hunter in Homer's epic the Odyssey, where Odysseus sees his shade in the underworld. The bare bones of Orion's story are told by the Hellenistic and Roman collectors of myths, {{but there is no}} extant literary version of <b>his</b> <b>adventures</b> comparable, for example, to that of Jason in Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica or Euripides' Medea; the entry in Ovid's Fasti for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth.|$|E
5|$|In the Soviet Union, Soyuzmultfilm {{released}} a 16-minute stop-motion animation Adventures of Baron Munchausen in 1967, directed by Anatoly Karanovich. Another Soviet animated version was produced {{as a series}} of short films, Munchausen's Adventures, in 1973 and 1974. The French animator Jean Image filmed The Fabulous Adventures of the Legendary Baron Munchausen in 1979, and followed it with a 1984 sequel, Moon Madness. Oleg Yankovsky appeared as the Baron in the 1980 Russian television film That Same Munchausen, directed by Mark Zakharov from Grigori Gorin's play. The film, a commentary on Soviet censorship and social mores, imagines an ostracized Baron attempting to prove the truth of <b>his</b> <b>adventures</b> in a disbelieving and conformity-driven world.|$|E
5|$|Iron Arm, Golden Sabre {{was written}} by Wang Yun Heng and Xiao Yun Long and {{published}} in 1986.

It follows {{his life as a}} young martial arts instructor in the Song army's Imperial guard, his struggles against the Xixia and Liao Tartar barbarian tribes and his tutelage of Water Margin outlaws. The last few chapters incorporate the storyline from the four chapters that he appears in The Story of Yue Fei.

5|$|Shortly after Beebe's {{return from}} this expedition, Anthony Kuser {{requested}} that Beebe produce a condensed, popular {{version of his}} pheasant monograph. The book which resulted from this, titled Pheasants: their Lives and Homes (also known by the title Pheasants of the World), was released in 1926 and received the John Burroughs Medal. During the course of writing this book, Beebe was reminded of many experiences during the pheasant expedition which he had not included in his original monograph, and wrote an additional book titled Pheasant Jungles about <b>his</b> <b>adventures</b> during this expedition. While A Monograph of the Pheasants had been a factual account of this expedition, Pheasant Jungles was a somewhat fictionalized account, in which Beebe altered some aspects of his experience in order {{to appeal to a}} wider audience.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons: Bart's House of Weirdness is a {{platform}} video game published by Konami on January 1, 1992 for MS-DOS. Developed by Distinctive Software, {{it is based}} on the Simpsons franchise and features many aspects from the series. In the game, the player controls Bart as he escapes from the Simpsons' house after being grounded by his parents. On <b>his</b> <b>adventures</b> throughout town, Bart is equipped with various weapons that are used to fend off enemies and animals. Bart's House of Weirdness does not have a wide fan base because it was only released for DOS, but the early reviews of the game were positive, at least in terms of graphics and sound. A 2009 1UP.com review heavily criticized the gameplay of the game.|$|E

5|$|In May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as World War II {{broke out}} across Europe. Although Hergé briefly fled to France and {{considered}} a self-imposed exile, he ultimately {{decided to return}} to his occupied homeland. For political reasons, the Nazi authorities closed down Le Vingtième Siècle, leaving Hergé unemployed. In search of employment, he got a job as an illustrator at Belgium's leading newspaper, Le Soir (The Evening), which was allowed to continue publication under German management. On 17 October 1940, he was made editor of the children's supplement, Le Soir Jeunesse, in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures. In this new, more repressive political climate of German-occupied Belgium, Hergé could no longer explore political themes in <b>his</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tintin lest he be arrested by the Gestapo. As Harry Thompson noted, Tintin's role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his new role as an explorer.|$|E
5|$|Sparrow's {{weapons are}} genuine 18th century pieces: his sword {{dates to the}} 1740s and his pistol is from the 1760s. Both were made in London. Depp used two pistols on set, one of rubber. Both survived {{production}} of the first film. Sparrow's magic compass also survived into the sequels, though director Gore Verbinski had a red arrow added to the dial as it became a more prominent prop. As it does not act like a normal compass, a magnet was used to make it spin. Sparrow wears four rings, two of which belong to Depp. Depp bought the green ring in 1989 and the gold ring is a replica of a 2400-year-old ring Depp gave to the crew, though the original was later stolen. The other two are props to which Depp gave backstories: the gold-and-black ring is stolen from a Spanish widow Sparrow seduced and the green dragon ring recalls <b>his</b> <b>adventures</b> in the Far East. Among Depp's additional ideas was the necklace made of human toes that Sparrow wears as the Pelegosto prepare to eat him, and the sceptre was based on one a friend of Depp's owned.|$|E

5|$|The series {{revolves}} around Kirby, the series' protagonist, and <b>his</b> <b>adventures</b> in {{the fictional world}} of Pop Star. A common gameplay element is Kirby's ability to copy enemy skills, allowing him {{to use them to}} progress through levels. This and other changes in gameplay from traditional platform games distinguish the series from other entries in the genre. Currently, the series contains twenty games. A one-hundred episode anime series based on the video games, , was created in Japan and formerly distributed by 4Kids TV in North America. A special 101st episode was created for the now retired Nintendo Video service, and was not in the anime style of the original 100 episodes. The Kirby series is among the best-selling video game franchises with over twenty million games sold worldwide. The franchise was conceived by Masahiro Sakurai as a game series for beginners, for which he partially attributes the series' success.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} set in Persia during the 9th century AD, and begins with the Prince narrating to an unseen {{listener}} about <b>his</b> <b>adventures.</b> The Prince and the army of his father Shahraman are passing through India to visit the Sultan of Azad. The Vizier of a local Maharaja, wanting to prevent his death using a substance known as the Sands of Time, entices them into attacking the Maharaja's palace, where the Sands are stored. During the fight, the Prince loots an artefact called the Dagger of Time, and the Maharaja's daughter Farah is taken {{as a gift for}} the Sultan of Azad. Visiting Azad, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, turning everyone but the Prince, the Vizier and Farah (protected by the Dagger, a staff and an amulet respectively) into sand creatures. The Vizier attempts to seize the Dagger from the Prince, but he escapes and eventually allies with Farah to undo the damage he has caused and prevent the Sands from covering the world, even though he has doubts about her loyalties and motives.|$|E
5|$|Zhou has {{appeared}} in various forms of media such as novels, comic books, and movies. His rare 20th century biography, Iron Arm, Golden Sabre, serves as a sequel to The Story of Yue Fei because it details <b>his</b> <b>adventures</b> decades prior to taking Yue as his pupil. This was later adapted into a ten volume Lianhuanhua comic book. He also appears in a novel concerning one of his fictional martial arts brothers. He was portrayed by three different actors {{in a string of}} black and white Yue Fei films produced in the 1940s and 1960s, one of which featured a ten-year-old Sammo Hung as the lead. Veteran martial arts actor Yu Chenghui, who played the sword-wielding antagonist in Jet Li's Shaolin Temple, stated in a 2005 interview that he has always wanted to portray Zhou in a film.|$|E
