30|$|A week characterised by {{recurrent}} {{episodes of}} Alerta ambiental (set at 195  μg/m 3) {{is expected to}} see women work an additional 4.3 fewer hours than men.

50|$|Cattle {{are often}} raised by {{allowing}} herds to graze on the grasses of {{large tracts of}} rangeland called ranches. Raising cattle in this manner allows the productive use of land that might be unsuitable for growing crops. The most common interactions with cattle involve daily feeding, cleaning and milking. Many routine husbandry practices involve ear tagging, dehorning, loading, medical operations, vaccinations and hoof care, as well as training for agricultural shows and preparations. There are also some cultural <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> with cattle - the cattle husbandry of Fulani men rests on behavioural techniques, whereas in Europe cattle are controlled primarily by physical means like fences.|$|E
50|$|Articulating the {{differential}} function of brain regions involved in working memory {{is dependent on}} tasks able to distinguish these functions. Most brain imaging studies of working memory have used recognition tasks such as delayed recognition of one or several stimuli, or the n-back task, in which each new stimulus in a long series must {{be compared to the}} one presented n steps back in the series. The advantage of recognition tasks is that they require minimal movement (just pressing one of two keys), making fixation of the head in the scanner easier. Experimental research and research on individual <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> memory, however, has used largely recall tasks (e.g., the reading span task, see below). It is not clear to what degree recognition and recall tasks reflect the same processes and the same capacity limitations.|$|E
50|$|In an {{experimental}} study done by Eder, Fiedler and Hamm-Eder (2011), {{the effects of}} working-memory capacity on illusory correlations were investigated. They first looked at the individual <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> memory, and then looked {{to see if that}} had any effect on the formation of illusory correlations. They found that individuals with higher working memory capacity viewed minority group members more positively than individuals with lower working memory capacity. In a second experiment, the authors looked into the effects of memory load in working memory on illusory correlations. They found that increased memory load in working memory led to an increase in the prevalence of illusory correlations. The experiment was designed to specifically test working memory and not substantial stimulus memory. This means that the development of illusory correlations was caused by deficiencies in central cognitive resources caused by the load in working memory, not selective recall.|$|E
40|$|Background: As the {{proportion}} of women in medicine draws towards parity, long-standing questions about gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the way that doctors work become more pertinent. Gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> medical <b>working</b> patterns and career choices are well documented; {{but there is a}} lack of understanding of everyday <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the <b>working</b> lives of male and female doctors, particularly in UK hospital medicine. In this thesis, potential sources of gender variations in activity rates, previously reported in the literature, are identified. Methods: Multiple methods were employed to explore potential gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> doctors’ <b>working</b> lives. Systematic review methods synthesised existing literature on gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the communication style, content and length of medical consultations. Qualitative methods were used to develop in-depth and contextualised understanding of potential gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> UK hospital consultants’ working lives, using observation and interviews. Potential variations in clinic length data were analysed quantitatively and synthesised with the existing literature using meta-analysis. Finally, a pilot questionnaire was designed and tested to build on qualitative findings and investigate variations in a wider sample. Results: Doctors’ gender appears to influence their working lives, and the interface between home and work, and these influences may partly explain variations in activity rates. Specifically, female doctors appear to spend longer on consultations; adopt different styles of communication such as lowered dominance and greater use of psychosocial communication; experience greater barriers in their careers such as gender discrimination and problems with work-family conflict; and may experience lower levels of cooperation from colleagues. Conclusions: This research provides important and timely understanding about the sources of gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the <b>working</b> lives of hospital consultants, which may affect both the quality and quantity of care provided by male and female doctors...|$|R

The manipulable objects were objects that required either a precision grip (i. e., small items) or a power grip (i. e., large items) to use. A concurrent motor task that could be congruent or incongruent with the manipulable objects caused no <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> memory performance relative to nonmanipulable objects.

50|$|Working memory also {{contributes}} to inattentional blindness. Cognitive psychologists have {{examined the relationship between}} working memory and inattention, but evidence is inconclusive. The rate of this phenomenon can be impacted by a number of factors. Researchers have found evidence for a number of components that may play a role. These include features of the object and the current task, where an individual's attention lies relative to the object, and mental workload as mentioned above. Researchers Kreitz, Furley, and Memmery in 2015, asserted that working memory capacity is not an indicator of susceptibility to inattentional blindness. Instead, it is a combination of what stimulus the attention is directed to as well as the individual's personal expectations. There are individual differences that can play a role, but some argue those disparities are separate from capacity for working memory. On the other hand, there are researchers who consider differences between individuals and their working memory capacity to be a stronger determinant of inattentional blindness. Seegmiller, Watson, and Strayer in 2011 for example, studied individual <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> memory capacity and how that overall impacted their attention on a given task. They utilized the same Invisible Gorilla video Simons and Chabris did (as mentioned above), but they additionally had participants complete a mathematics test to measure their capacity. From their results, they were able to find a high correlation between an individual's working memory capacity and their susceptibility to inattentional blindness. Those who were calculated to have a lower capacity, more often experienced the blindness.|$|E
50|$|There {{are usually}} no sex {{differences}} in overall working memory except those involving spatial information such as space and object. A 2004 {{study published in the}} journal of Applied Cognitive Psychology found significantly higher male performance on four visuo-spatial working memory. Another 2010 study published in the journal Brain and Cognition found a male advantage in spatial and object working memory on an n-back test but not for verbal working memory. Similarly another study published in the journal Human Brain Mapping found no {{sex differences in}} a verbal n-back working memory task among adults from ages 18-58 years old. There was also no sex differences in verbal working memory among a study of university students published in the Journal of Dental and Medical Sciences. However, they still found greater male spatial working memory in studies published in the journals Brain Cognition and Intelligence. Also, even though they found no sex differences in verbal working memory, researchers have found lower brain activity or hermodynamics in the prefrontal cortex of women which suggested greater neural efficiency and less effort for the same performance. Researchers indicate women might have greater working memory on tasks that only relies on the prefrontal cortex. A 2013 study published in the journal Current Research in Psychology also found a female advantage in one visual-working memory task among university students. A 2006 review and study on working memory published in the journal European Journal of Cognitive Psychology also found no gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> memory processes except in a double-span task where women outperformed men. There have also been no sex differences found in a popular working memory task known as n-back among a large number of studies.|$|E

30|$|Under {{the first}} {{scenario}} in which the economy is hit by a short temporary reduction in GDP, the employment impact associated with STW appears to be relatively small compared with its impact on working time. While the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> time associated with STW is 0.25 % (up to t = 1), the cumulative <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> employment is only 0.07 % (up to t = 8). This suggests that the deadweight loss associated with short-time work {{in the context of}} a very short downturn may be over 70 % ((0.25 - 0.07)/ 0.25). The relatively small impact of STW on employment reflects the fact that employment tends to respond to output shocks with a time lag. As a result, a relatively large fraction of jobs is supported that would be preserved anyway. The net impact of STW on employment is zero after four quarters.|$|R

Material and Methods: Forty extracted maxillary molars were selected and divided onto two parallel groups. The working lengths of the mesiobuccal root canals were estimated. The teeth were fixed in a phantom head. The root canal preparation was carried out group 1 (n= 20) with hand K-files, (VDW, Munich, Germany) and group 2 (n= 20) with Mtwo instruments (VDW, Munich, Germany). Vestibulo-oral and mesio-distal directional x-ray images were taken before the preparation with # 10 K-file, inserted into the mesiobuccal root canal to the working length, and after preparation with # 25, # 30 and # 40 files. Working lenght changes were detected with measurements between the radiological apex and the instrument tips. Results: In the Mtwo group a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the <b>working</b> competency (p < 0. 05) could be noticed only in the vestibulo- oral direction from # 10 to # 40 file. The hand instrument group showed a significant <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> length competency for each larger file size (p < 0. 05) (ANOVA).

40|$|Studies {{examining}} individual <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> {{memory capacity}} {{have suggested that}} individuals with low working memory capacities demonstrate impaired performance {{on a variety of}} attention and memory tasks compared with individuals with high working memory capacities. This working memory limitation can be conceived of as arising from 2 components: a dynamic attention component (primary memory) and a probabilistic cue-dependent search component (secondary memory). This framework is used to examine previous individual differences studies of working memory capacity, and new evidence is examined on the basis of predictions of the framework to performance on immediate free recall.

30|$|Another {{contributing}} factor {{seems to be}} individual <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> memory, the neurocognitive system for temporary retention and processing, limited in capacity (Baddeley, 2010). With printed materials, individual <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> memory {{have been associated with}} differences in text comprehension (Daneman & Merikle, 1996), because working memory constrains inferential processing and model construction (Barreyro, Cevasco, Burin, & Molinari, 2012). In hypertext comprehension, more demanding interfaces affect particularly low working memory participants (DeStefano & LeFevre, 2007; Gwizdka, 2009; Lee & Tedder, 2003; Naumann, Richter, Christmann, & Groeben, 2008). For example, Naumann et al. (2008) taught students strategies for learning with hypertexts, and found different outcomes for high and low working memory participants. Whereas high working memory students benefitted from training, low capacity ones were negatively impacted both in comprehension and navigation, as shown by the number of visits to task relevant content pages. This suggested that learning a new strategy loaded working memory beyond comprehension and navigation requirements, and this increased load was difficult to handle for low working memory students.|$|E

40|$|Several models {{assume that}} working memory {{development}} depends on age-related increases in {{efficiency and speed}} of processing.

Third- and sixth-grade children performed a complex span task in which they maintained series of letters while adding numbers to series of digits. When we equated processing and restoration times between ages, the developmental <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> memory span was reduced but remained significant.

30|$|Air {{pollution}} affects workers’ {{ability to}} work by damaging their own health, but also by damaging the health of their dependents. This paper draws on 20  years of air pollution and employment data from Santiago, Chile, a highly polluted metropolis, particularly in fall and winter months. The paper finds that though air pollution is not associated {{to a reduction in}} overall hours worked, it does so for women and particularly for women with children. Weeks with pollution at 100  μg/m 3, common for Santiago, see double the gender <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours. It is hypothesised that children, unable to go to school, must stay home and cared for. These findings suggest that air pollution may contribute to gender inequality through the gendered-biased distribution of care responsibilities. Pollution brings to evidence gender inequalities in care and, given the gendered nature of care and the geographic distribution of pollution, may contribute to enhance gender and geographic labour market inequalities. Environmental policy may serve to enhance gender equality as well.|$|R
