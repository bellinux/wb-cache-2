5|$|Four shipbuilders {{submitted}} bids: the Italian Gio. Ansaldo & C. led a {{group that}} also included the Austro-Hungarian Škoda Works and the French Marrel Freres <b>Forges</b> de La Loire et du Midi; the French Schneider-Creusot firm partnered with Société Nouvelle des <b>Forges</b> et Chantiers de la Méditerranée and <b>Forges</b> et Chantiers de la Gironde; the Spanish Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval (SECN), which was formed by Vickers, Armstrong Whitworth, and John Brown & Company; {{and a group of}} Spanish industrialists backed by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company and William Beardmore and Company. Only the first three proposals were seriously considered, as the fourth was considered to be too vague. The Junta Superior de la Armada (the Navy Staff) and the Navy Minister were responsible for reviewing the three proposals. Ansaldo prepared two design variants; the first called for four twin gun turrets for the main battery, with one forward, one aft, and two offset amidships. The second proposal had two triple turrets, fore and aft, with a twin turret on the centerline amidships. Artillery experts in the Navy rejected the second variant. The SECN and Schneider designs also featured the same arrangement as the first Ansaldo proposal.|$|E

50|$|<b>Forged</b> {{magnesium}} {{wheels are}} manufactured by mechanically deforming (<b>forging)</b> a prefabricated rod using a powerful <b>forging</b> press. Several somewhat different <b>forging</b> techniques exist, {{all of them}} comprising a multi-step process/operation. The resultant <b>forging</b> is subsequently machined (lathe-turned and milled) into the final shape of a wheel by removing excess metal from the <b>forged</b> blank. A <b>forged</b> magnesium wheel is 25 percent lighter than cast wheel. The main disadvantage of <b>forged</b> wheels is the high manufacturing cost. And due to the typically high costs of finished wheels, <b>forged</b> wheels are still rarely purchased by non-professional drivers for regular road use. But since <b>forged</b> wheels can be designed to be lighter than cast wheels for a given load, <b>forged</b> wheels do offer fuel economy and other distinct advantages. The <b>forging</b> process allows alignment of the metal fibers and optimization of the directional pattern arrangement along the spokes of a wheel. This, along with the smaller grain size, results in superior mechanical properties and performance characteristics that make <b>forged</b> magnesium wheels widely popular both for motor racing and with knowledgeable driving enthusiasts.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Forging</b> {{temperature}} is usually around 1000 ℃ in free <b>forging</b> scene. Manual measurement leads to large measurement errors. Adopting the non-contact 3 D scanning technology, make the laser beam sweep across the <b>forging</b> surface to get three-dimensional coordinates {{of the points}} on the <b>forging</b> surface in space. Neighboring scan points separate by less than 0. 25 mm. The measurement error is less than 6 mm. The coordinate s data are sent to the LabVIEW procedure.

The procedure can also reconstruct the image of the large-size <b>forging.</b> These make us detect the real-time changes of the <b>forging</b> far from the free <b>forging</b> scene.

40|$|Characteristics of {{open die}} <b>forging</b> in an AZ 31 Mg alloy and a {{relation}} between microstructure and mechanical {{properties of the}} <b>forged</b> alloy have been investigated for an as-received specimen and an extruded specimen, where the as-received specimen consisted of both elongated coarse grains and equiaxed small grains, and the extruded specimen consisted of only equiaxed small grains.

In addition, tensile tests of the <b>forged</b> specimens were carried out at room temperature and the microstructure was observed using an optical microscope. In the <b>forging</b> tests, the specimens could be <b>forged</b> from 18 mm to 2. 5 mm in thickness at <b>forging</b> temperatures of more than 423 K.

25|$|<b>Forging</b> is a {{manufacturing}} process involving {{the shaping of}} metal using localized compressive forces.
