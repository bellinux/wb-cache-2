30|$|Cu-SiO 2 {{coatings}} were {{deposited on}} 1  mm borosilicate glass (Dow Corning) using flame assisted {{chemical vapour deposition}} (FACVD). The FACVD system was of in-house design and construction and consisted of a brass burner head above a translational stage and a precursor delivery system of ultrasonic nebuliser, bubbler and mass flow controllers (Cook et al., 2011). Tetraethylorthosilicate was carried to the burner head using a nitrogen flow rate of 0.5 lmin- 1 <b>from</b> a <b>heated</b> <b>and</b> <b>stirred</b> bubbler (75 °C[*]±[*] 3 °C, stirred at 120  rpm). An aqueous solution of copper sulphate (0.25  M) {{was used as the}} copper precursor and simultaneously delivered to the burner head by ultrasonically nebulising the aqueous solution prior to carriage by nitrogen at 0.6 lmin- 1. The number of passes under the burner head was 6 equating to a residence time in the flame of approximately 12  sec and gave a film approx 25  nm thick.|$|R
30|$|The silver {{nanoparticle}} samples {{have been}} prepared by using chemical reduction method. All solutions of reacting materials {{have been prepared}} in distilled water. Silver nitrate AgNO 3 and trisodium citrate C 2 H 5 O 7 Na 3 of analytical grade purity were used as starting materials without further purification. In the present procedure 150  mL of 1  mM AgNO 3 was <b>heated</b> to boiling <b>and</b> 15  mL of 1 % trisodium citrate was added drop by drop to the solution until its color change to pale yellow. Then it was removed <b>from</b> the <b>heating</b> plate <b>and</b> <b>stirred</b> until cooled to room temperature and it kept in dark place.

30|$|Potassium hexachloroplatinate (IV) and {{trisodium}} citrate of analytical grade purity {{were used as}} starting materials without further purification. Platinum nanoparticles were obtained by chemical reduction of K 2 PtCl 6 (approximately % 38 Pt, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) with {{trisodium citrate}} (Sigma-Aldrich). All solutions of reacting materials were prepared in distilled water. In typical experiment, 50 ml of 0.001 M K 2 PtCl 6 was heated to boiling point. To this solution, 5 ml of 1 % trisodium citrate was added drop by drop. The solution was stirred by magnetic stirrer (RH-KT/C, IKA, Selangor, Malaysia) during the experiment. The temperature was controlled using a water bath (Ultratemp FP 35 -HC, Julabo GmbH, Seelbach, Germany). The solution was heated until color change is evident (bright yellow to black). Then, it was removed <b>from</b> the <b>heating</b> element <b>and</b> <b>stirred</b> until cooled to room temperature. Platinum precipitate was separated by centrifuge (NF 615, Nuve, Ankara, Turkey) at 3, 000 rpm for 5 min. The precipitate formed by the metallic nanoparticles was washed several times [23] with deionized water and acetone, then put in acetone as a suspension. Then, the acetone and water in liquid phase was vaporized in an oven at 110 °C.|$|R

50|$|Skim milk is held until {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} acidify and coagulate its proteins. The curdled milk is <b>stirred</b> <b>and</b> <b>heated</b> to a temperature as high as 80 °C (175 °F), then the whey is drained off and the curd is gathered in bags and pressed. The curd is placed in flat pans, broken up, and washed with warm skim milk, to form a mixture consisting of two parts milk to one part curd. This mixture is <b>stirred</b> <b>and</b> <b>heated,</b> as before, until the casein in the milk curdles and adheres to the mass of curd.

30|$|The {{miscibility}} and/or solubility of {{the diesel}} samples is tested by mass {{and because of}} the apolar nature of both fluids, dissolution is not a problem. Since there are no functional groups and the molecular structure is similar, there are no chemical reactions between the two products.

The conclusion is that for combustion assays using mixtures of animal fats and diesel, it is important to <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>stir</b> the (animal fat-diesel) mixture before it is fed into the burner for subsequent use as fuel. During heating, the mixture must reach a temperature of above 30 °C and the stirring must be constant to ensure that the mixture is homogeneously balanced.|$|R
