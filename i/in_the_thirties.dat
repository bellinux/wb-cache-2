5|$|In February 2013, Gavyn Davies for The Financial Times {{emphasized}} that a key {{difference between the}} 1930s and the 21st century outbreaks is that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirties</b> some of the retaliations between countries were carried out not by devaluations, but by increases in import tariffs, {{which tend to be}} much more disruptive to international trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{last round}} of matches, {{featuring}} {{all three of}} the teams that had qualified for finals day, determined who went directly to the final, and who would face off first in the semi-final. The Southern Vipers faced the Loughborough Lightning, and batting first a team effort saw them reach 156 for 4; Bates scored 38, Sara McGlashan got 34* and Lydia Greenway 29. Despite scores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirties</b> from Perry and Evelyn Jones, a strong bowling performance from the Vipers, in which Linsey Smith and Brindle each took three wickets, saw them to victory by 59 runs. That victory guaranteed the Vipers a place in the final, while the Loughborough Lightning had to face Western Storm in a semi-final. The result of the other match that day was of no consequence to the tournament; Beth Mooney scored 56 runs for the Yorkshire Diamonds, who scored 118 runs. Anya Shrubsole finished the match with five wickets for the Western Storm, taking a four–wicket maiden in the final over of the match. Storm opening batsmen Taylor and Priest shared a 101-run partnership to take their side to the brink of victory before being dismissed from subsequent deliveries, but despite two further wickets, the Storm won by six wickets with 21 balls remaining.|$|E

The singers (introduced after {{the introduction of}} the sung danzón, known as the danzonete) were, at two different times, Fernando Collazo and Barbarito Díez. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirties</b> it had become a big band, and included two brass instruments.|$|E
25|$|Eritrea {{was chosen}} by the Italian {{government}} to be the industrial center of the Italian East Africa. The Italian government continued to implement agricultural reforms but primarily on farms owned by Italian colonists (exports of coffee boomed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirties).</b> In the area of Asmara there were in 1940 more than 2000 small and medium-sized industrial companies, concentrated {{in the areas of}} construction, mechanics, textiles, electricity and food processing. Consequently, the living standard of life in Eritrea in 1939 was considered one of the best of Africa for the Italian colonists and for the Eritreans.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, Machen and {{his family}} moved away from London to Amersham in Buckinghamshire, but they still faced {{financial}} hardship. He received some recognition for his literary work when he received a Civil List pension of ₤100 per annum in 1932, but the loss of work from Benn's a year later made things difficult once more. A few more collections of Machen's shorter works were published <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirties,</b> partially {{as a result of}} the championing of Machen by John Gawsworth, who also began work on a biography of Machen that was only published in 2005 thanks to the Friends of Arthur Machen.|$|E

25|$|Due to the City Council’s {{decision}} to zone {{the grounds of}} ‘t Ploegske as a residential area {{and the city of}} Breda had no new grounds available, NAC were forced to move out Breda. The town of Princenhage offered NAC a terrain, where NAC built a state-of-the-art stadium with a capacity of 5,500. The main disadvantage was that the stadium was located far from Breda’s city centre. Nevertheless, NAC’s golden decennium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirties,</b> when NAC was considered {{to be one of the}} top clubs in the Netherlands, took place in the stadium at the Heuvelstraat. In 1939 the city of Breda offered NAC a new terrain at the Beatrixstraat.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 19th century the northern portico was built, in 1823 the cemetery and stone fence around the church was removed. In the years 1903-1904 church tower was rebuilt in Neo - Gothic style by the architect F. Schulek. Interior modifications in 1914 and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirties</b> were focused on exchanging the floor. That time the monochrome painting of architectural stone elements were mechanically removed. In the fifties windows of the south nave and presbytery were filed with new stained glass windows. The floor was paved with travertine tiles, the phonics and the new Cross Way lit from behind from stained glass was installed. In the years 1981-1989 last major repair of the church took place.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Depression the Public Works Administration {{often used}} Art Deco {{elements}} in a primarily classical and monumental framework. The Visalia Town Center US Post Office thus presages the style and aesthetic of much subsequent government architecture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirties.</b> This style of architecture was commonly used in private projects in the 1920s and {{is often associated with}} decadently luxurious shops and hotels, though by the time the Town Center Post Office was built the Depression had halted most of these private projects. Although the Visalia Post Office uses Art Deco ornamental motifs, the structure is more of a monolithic monument than a pretty piece of art, a characteristic typical of Government construction in the period in which it was built.|$|E

25|$|Hampshire Hawks got {{the four}} points from a closely fought match at New Road. Worcestershire Royals {{had won the}} toss and chosen to bat, and their innings was {{shortened}} to 34 overs out of a scheduled 45 due to rain. Wickets fell regularly, four batsmen being dismissed with scores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirties,</b> and the final score of 185 for 7 did not look too threatening. John Crawley and Shane Watson put Hampshire back on track after two early wickets from Kabir Ali shook them, but an economical spell from Ray Price which yielded two wickets was nearly enough. However, the other spinner Gareth Batty {{was not nearly as}} economical, and Greg Lamb took him for runs to end with 16 not out and win the game for Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, he was {{an honorary}} adviser to the British Ministry of Supply and did {{research}} on synthetic rubber and high-octane gasoline. After the war, and the continual settlement of Palestine became an in international question, he was appointed to head the Jewish Agency. Apart from a short break <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirties,</b> Weizmann continued in the post through the latter war, with his deputy, David Ben Gurion playing a bellicose role as a liberationist. His eclipse led {{to the collapse of}} British rule, and the inundation by illegal immigrants. In 1949 the Sieff Institute was renamed the Weizmann Institute of Science in his honour, in agreement with the Sieff family. Weizmann's success as a scientist and the success of the Institute he founded make him an iconic figure in the heritage of the Israeli scientific community today.|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{defeated}} Canada in {{the first}} semi-final. Winning the toss and bowling, the Irish – weakened by Ed Joyce's return to Middlesex – struggled initially, John Davison hitting eight fours and a run single in his 15-ball 33. However, five Canadian batsmen were out with scores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirties,</b> as Canada eventually crept to 238 for 9 – Andre Botha taking four for 47. Ireland's reply started cautiously, yet Sanjayan Thuraisingam and Kevin Sandher shared wickets, and after fifteen overs Ireland were only 60 for 3. With ten overs to go, and Trent Johnston having been caught by Sunil Dhaniram, Ireland needed 68 runs to win. However, Peter Gillespie and Northamptonshire player Andrew White hit out well, Gillespie scoring a career-best score in the ICC Trophy with 64 – and Ireland squeezed home with four balls and four wickets to spare.|$|E
