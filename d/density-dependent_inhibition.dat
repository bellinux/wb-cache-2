5000|$|The mitotic {{phase is}} a {{relatively}} short period of the cell cycle. It alternates with the much longer interphase, where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division. Interphase is divided into three phases: G1 (first gap), S (synthesis), and G2 (second gap). During all three parts of interphase, the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are replicated only during the S phase. Thus, a cell grows (G1), continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes (S), grows more and prepares for mitosis (G2), and finally divides (M) before restarting the cycle. All these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and other cell cycle proteins. The phases follow one another in strict order and there are [...] "checkpoints" [...] that give the cell cues to proceed from one phase to another. Cells may also temporarily or permanently leave the cell cycle and enter G0 phase to stop dividing. This can occur when cells become overcrowded (<b>density-dependent</b> <b>inhibition)</b> or when they differentiate to carry out specific functions for the organism, as is the case for human heart muscle cells and neurons. Some G0 cells have the ability to re-enter the cell cycle.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, it {{has been}} shown that cell-cell {{adhesion}} formation not only restricts growth and proliferation by imposing physical constraints such as cell area, but also by triggering signaling pathways that downregulate proliferation. One such pathway is the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, which is largely responsible for inhibiting cell growth in mammals. This pathway consists primarily of a phosphorylation cascade involving serine kinases and is mediated by regulatory proteins, which regulate cell growth by binding to growth-controlling genes. The serine/threonine kinase Hippo (Mst1/Mst2 in mammals) activates a secondary kinase (Lats1/Lats2), which phosphorylates YAP, a transcriptional activator of growth genes. The phosphorylation of YAP serves to export it from the nucleus and prevent it from activating growth-promoting genes; this is how the Hippo-YAP pathway inhibits cell growth. More importantly, the Hippo-YAP pathway uses upstream elements to act in response to cell-cell contact and controls <b>density-dependent</b> <b>inhibition</b> of proliferation. For example, cadherins are transmembrane proteins that form cellular junctions via homophilic binding and thus act as detectors for cell-cell contact. Cadherin-mediated activation of the inhibitory pathway involves the transmembrane E-cadherin forming a homophilic bond in order to activate α- and β-catenin, which then stimulate downstream components of the Hippo-YAP pathway to ultimately downregulate cell growth. This is consistent with the finding that E-cadherin overexpression hinders metastasis and tumorigenesis. Because YAP is shown to be associated with mitogenic growth factor signaling and thus cell proliferation, it is likely that future studies will focus on the Hippo-YAP pathway’s role in cancer cells.|$|E

Swiss 3 T 3 cells displayed strong requirements for both PDGF and insulin. Both of these requirements were significantly diminished in simian virus 40 -transformed 3 T 3 cells. Analysis of the PDGF and insulin {{requirements of the}} revertants indicated {{that the loss of}} either of these two growth factor requirements was not necessarily linked to the other; rather, the growth factor requirements were specifically associated with other parameters of transformation. The reacquisition of a PDGF requirement cosegregated with reversion to <b>density-dependent</b> growth <b>inhibition,</b> whereas reacquisition of a normal insulin requirement cosegregated with reversion to a normal growth dependence on calf serum. Anchorage dependence was dissociable from both growth factor requirements.

We developed a new assay to measure growth rates at different starting parasitaemias in a 96 -well format and applied it to characterise the growth of Plasmodium falciparum lines 3 D 7 -A and 3 D 7 -B, previously shown to have different invasion rates and to use different invasion pathways. Using this simple and accurate assay we found that 3 D 7 -B is more sensitive to high initial parasitaemia than 3 D 7 -A. This result indicates that different parasite lines show variation in their levels of <b>density-dependent</b> growth <b>inhibition.</b> We also developed a new assay to compare {{the duration of the}} asexual blood cycle between different parasite lines.

Using this assay we observed differences in the duration of the asexual blood cycle between parasite lines 3 D 7 and HB 3. These two new assays will be useful to characterise variation in growth-related parameters and to identify growth phenotypes associated with the targeted deletion of specific genes or with particular genomic, transcriptomic or proteomic patterns.

In confluent normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblasts, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor levels decline, ultimately rendering these cells irresponsive to EGF. Using an activator protein (AP) - 1 sensitive reporter construct, we show that AP- 1 activity is strongly decreased in density-arrested NRK cells, but is restored after relaxation of densitydependent growth inhibition by removing neighboring cells. EGF could not induce AP- 1 activity or S-phase entry in density-arrested cells, but could do so after pretreatment with retinoic acid, which enhances EGF receptor expression.

If this protocol results in the introduction into the SV 3 T 3 cell membrane of 3 T 3 plasma membrane components responsible for <b>density-dependent</b> <b>inhibition</b> of growth, then the SV 3 T 3 cell cultures would be expected to show decreased rates of DNA synthesis as they approach confluence. Results of these experiments indicate that rates of DNA synthesis in SV 3 T 3 cultures so treated were as much as 63 % less than in untreated controls. This effect could not be attributed to the fusogens or to the 3 T 3 plasma membranes alone. This growth-inhibitory effect is specific for 3 T 3 membranes and is not observed when SV 3 T 3 plasma membranes are fused with SV 3 T 3 cell cultures. These data support the hypothesis that one aspect of the loss of densitydependent inhibition of growth in SV 3 T 3 cells is a deletion or alteration in plasma membrane components and, further, that <b>density-dependent</b> <b>inhibition</b> of growth can be in part restored to SV 3 T 3 cell cultures by fusing the cells with 3 T 3 plasma membranes.

40|$|I {{found that}} SV 40 {{transformation}} induced {{the loss of}} several specific growth factor requirements. In particular, SV 40 transformed 3 T 3 fibroblasts had a significantly reduced growth requirement for insulin. A reduced insulin requirement was also observed in several other transformed cell lines. Dose response studies with insulin and insulin-like growth factors indicated that the mitogenic response to insulin is in all probability mediated by IGF-I receptors, and that the reduced insulin requirement observed in transformed fibroblasts actually reflects {{the loss of a}} strong IGF-I requirement. IGF-I is under strict pituitary-growth hormone control in vivo, and mediates many if not all of the growth promoting effects of growth hormone. A reduced IGF-I requirement may allow transformed fibroblasts to escape from this major humoral regulatory system. SV 40 transformed cells also displayed a significantly diminished requirement for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The loss of this particular growth factor requirement was found to be closely associated with the loss of <b>density-dependent</b> growth <b>inhibition.</b> Cell lines transformed by temperature sensitive mutants of SV 40 exhibited a temperature sensitive loss of the PDGF requirement, indicating that SV 40 T-antigen mediates this effect. Results pertaining to the temperature sensitivity of the insulin requirement were inconclusive. I found that SV 40 could directly reduce the insulin requirement of 3 T 3 cells in a transformation assay based upon the stringent insulin requirement of 3 T 3 cells for colony formation. Several such insulin-transformants were isolated and characterized. Although all of these transformants expressed SV 40 T-antigen, some of them retained anchorage-dependence and/or a partial PDGF requirement, unlike transformants obtained in the standard density of anchorage assays. A revertant of SV 40 transformed 3 T 3 cells was found to have regained a very strong dependence upon insulin. This dependence was not overcome by re-transformation with Kirsten Murine Sarcoma virus, although retransformation did obviate both its <b>density-dependent</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> and PDGF requirement.

40|$|Aberrant {{activation}} of β-catenin {{contributes to the}} onset {{of a variety of}} tumors. We report that a tumor-derived β-catenin mutant induces accumulation and {{activation of}} the p 53 tumor suppressor protein. Induction is mediated through ARF, an alternative reading frame product of the INK 4 A tumor suppressor locus, in a manner partially dependent on the transcription factor E 2 F 1. In wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts, mutant β-catenin inhibits cell proliferation and imposes a senescence-like phenotype. This does not occur in cells lacking either ARF or p 53, where deregulated β-catenin actually overrides <b>density-dependent</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> and cooperates with activated Ras in transformation. Thus, the oncogenic activity of deregulated β-catenin is curtailed by concurrent activation of the p 53 pathway, thereby providing a protective mechanism against cancer.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{research}} into the mechanisms of tumour cell invasiveness has highlighted the parallels between carcinogen-esis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), originally described as a developmental transdifferentiation program but also implicated in fibrosis and cancer. In a model system for mammary carcinogenesis, we previously observed that induced signalling from a homodimer of the c-erbB 2 (HER 2) receptor tyrosine kinase in an initially non-malignant mammary cell line caused EMT where i) cell scattering occurred before downregulation of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and ii) the progress of EMT was dramatically delayed when cells were grown at high density. Here, we have further analysed these phenomena. Ectopic expression of E-cadherin concomitant with c-erbB 2 signalling was unable to impede the progression of EMT, suggesting that E-cadherin downregula-tion is not required for EMT. Furthermore, fibroblast-like cells isolated after EMT induced in {{the presence or absence}} of ectopic E-cadherin expression showed highly similar morphology and vimentin expression. E-cadherin expressed in these fibro-blastic cells had a subcellular localisation similar to that found in epithelial cells, but it exhibited a much weaker attachment to the cytoskeleton, suggesting cytoskeletal rearrangements as an important mechanism in EMT-associated cell scattering. We also investigated whether <b>density-dependent</b> <b>inhibition</b> of EMT is mediated by E-cadherin as a sensor for cell-cell contact, by expressing dominant-negative E-cadherin. While expression of this mutant weakened cell-cell adhesion, it failed to facilitate EMT at high cell densities. These results indicate that loss of E-cadherin expression is a consequence rather than a cause of c-erbB 2 -induced EMT and that <b>density-dependent</b> <b>inhibition</b> of EMT is not mediated by E-cadherin signalling...|$|E

Although cell contact has long been thought to play {{a fundamental role in}} cell cycling regulation, and negative regulators have long been suspected to exist, their isolation and purification has been complicated by a variety of technical difficulties. Nevertheless, over recent years an ever-expanding list of putative negative regulators have emerged. In many cases, their biological inhibitory activities are consistent with <b>density-dependent</b> growth <b>inhibition.</b> Most likely their interactions with mitogenic agents, at an intracellular level, are responsible for either mitotic arrest or continued cell cycling. A review of naturally occurring cell growth inhibitors is presented with an emphasis on those factors shown to be residents of the cell surface membrane.

40|$|E-cadherin {{function}} {{leads to}} the <b>density-dependent</b> contact <b>inhibition</b> of cell growth. Because cadherins control the overall state of cell contact, cytoskeletal organization, {{and the establishment of}} many other kinds of cell interactions, it remains unknown whether E-cadherin directly transduces growth inhibitory signals. To address this question, we have selectively formed E-cadherin homophilic bonds at the cell surface of isolated epithelial cells by using functionally active recombinant E-cadherin protein attached to microspheres. We find that E-cadherin ligation alone reduces the frequency of cells entering the S phase, demonstrating that E-cadherin ligation directly transduces growth inhibitory signals. E-cadherin binding to -catenin is required for cell growth inhibition, but -catenin/T-cell factor transcriptional activity is not involved in growth inhibition resulting from homophilic binding. Neither E-cadherin binding to p 120 -catenin nor -catenin binding to -catenin, and thereby the actin cytoskeleton, is required for growth inhibition. E-cadherin ligation also inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-mediated growth signaling by a -catenin–dependent mechanism. It does not affect EGF receptor autophosphorylation or activation of ERK, but it inhibits transphosphorylation of Tyr 845 and activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 5. Thus, E-cadherin homophilic binding independent of other cell contacts directly transduces growth inhibition by a -catenin–dependent mechanism that inhibits selective signaling functions of growth factor receptors...|$|R

To investigate the possible mechanisms by which CeReS- 18 exerts its inhibitory action, the effect of the inhibitor on the posttranslational regulation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (RB), a tumor suppressor gene, has been examined. It is shown that CeReS- 18 mediated cell cycle arrest of both human diploid fibroblasts (HSBP) and mouse fibroblasts (Swiss 3 T 3) results in the maintenance of the RB protein in the hypophosphorylated state, consistent with a late G 1 arrest site. Although their normal nontransformed counterparts are sensitive to cell cycle arrest mediated by CeReS- 18, cell lines lacking a functional RB protein, through either genetic mutation or DNA tumor virus oncoprotein interaction, are less sensitive. The refractory nature of these cells is shown to be independent of specific surface receptors for the inhibitor, and another tumor suppressor gene (p 53) does not appear to be involved in the CeReS- 18 inhibition of cell proliferation.

Whereas physiological substrates for LAR have not been identified unequivocally, beta-catenin associates with LAR and is a substrate in vitro. With the implication that LAR {{may play a role}} in regulating E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell communication and contact inhibition, the relationship of LAR with E-cadherin was investigated. LAR expression increased with cell density in the human breast cancer cell line MCF- 7 and in Ln 3 cells derived from the 13762 NF rat mammary adenocarcinoma. LAR protein levels decreased rapidly when cells were replated at a low density after attaining high expression of LAR at high cell density. COS- 7 cells displayed comparable density-dependent regulation of LAR expression when transiently expressing exogenous LAR under the control of a constitutively active promoter, indicating that the regulation of expression is not at the level of gene regulation. Disrupting homophilic E-cadherin complexes by chelating extracellular calcium caused a marked decrease in LAR protein levels. Similarly, blocking E-cadherin interactions with saturating amounts of E-cadherin antibody (HECD- 1) also led to a rapid and pronounced loss of cellular LAR. In contrast, mimicking cell-surface E-cadherin engagement by plating cells at low density on to dishes coated with HECD- 1 resulted in a 2 -fold increase in LAR expression compared with controls. These results suggest that density-dependent regulation of LAR expression is mediated by functional E-cadherin and {{may play a role in}} <b>density-dependent</b> contact <b>inhibition</b> by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation in E-cadherin complexes...|$|R

However, the mechanistic details underlying its function are poorly understood because its primary physiological substrate(s) have not been firmly established. To {{shed light on the}} mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative role of this phosphatase, we set out to identify new DEP- 1 substrates by a novel approach based on screening of high density peptide arrays. The results of the array experiment were combined with a bioinformatics filter to identify eight potential DEP- 1 targets among the proteins annotated in the MAPK pathway. In this study we show that one of these potential targets, the ERK 1 / 2, is indeed a direct DEP- 1 substrate in vivo. Pulldown and in vitro dephosphorylation assays confirmed our prediction and demonstrated an overall specificity of DEP- 1 in targeting the phosphorylated tyrosine 204 of ERK 1 / 2. After epidermal growth factor stimulation, the phosphorylation of the activation loop of ERK 1 / 2 can be modulated by changing the concentration of DEP- 1, without affecting the activity of the upstream kinase MEK. In addition, we show that DEP- 1 contains a KIM-like motif to recruit ERK 1 / 2 proteins by a docking mechanism mediated by the common docking domain in ERK 1 / 2. ERK proteins that are mutated in the conserved docking domain become insensitive to DEP- 1 de-phosphorylation.

40|$|During {{development}} {{and also in}} the adult organism cellular growth is strictly regulated by various control mechanisms that ensure cells to start and stop dividing at the proper time and place. Dysfunction of these intricate regulatory mechanisms may result in uncontrolled proliferation of cells and can be the basis for a large diversity of pathogenic conditions including cancer. In our studies we have used normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblasts as a cellular model system for studying the mechanisms of <b>density-dependent</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> and alterations upon phenotypic transformation, and focused on the biophysical aspects of NRK cells including membrane potential, intracellular calcium dynamics and GJIC, in relation to their growth regulation. Since fibroblasts are considered as classical examples of non-excitable cells, it was rather surprising that NRK fibroblasts repetitively fired calcium action potentials when they were cultured to density-arrest. We have elucidated the excitability mechanism of NRK cells and demonstrated how an L-type calcium conductance, a calcium-activated chloride conductance, an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance, and gap junctional intercellular communication contribute to action potential firing and propagation. Moreover, we have shown that the cytosolic calcium concentration can oscillate in these cells by an intricate interplay between internal calcium stores and plasma membrane ion channels, thereby providing NRK cells with a timing mechanism. During our studies we discovered a novel property of fenamates and 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2 -APB), namely their ability to block gap junctions. The uncoupling action of 2 -APB is unique, since 2 -APB appears to be the first gap junction blocker that does not affect plasma membrane channels. Thus, {{it can be used to}} study ion channel properties in single cells in undissociated tissues.

40|$|SUMMARY-We {{distinguished}} btweenoncogenesisin vitro {{and cell}} transformation and suggestedthatthe term "trans-formed " {{be restricted to}} those cells demonstrated to grow as malignant neoplasms in vivo or be qualified to indicate the type of change observed. We have selected, from the many responses of cells to oncogenic viruses and car-cinogens, those {{that appear to be}} associated with acquisi-tion of neoplastic potential. These include alterations in cell and colony morphology and changes in growth prop-erties. The changes in growth pmperties include the capac-ity for growth in fluid or agar suspension, loss of <b>density-dependent</b> <b>inhibition</b> of growth, and enhanced growth under conditions of reduced serum concentration. These criteria of neoplastic transtormatlen must be used cau-tiously and cannot completely replace the in vivo assay fo...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough contact {{inhibition}} {{is a fundamental}} process for multicellular organisms, how proliferation is inhibited at high cellular densities remains poorly characterized. Here we show that 4 E-BP 1, one major repressor of cap-dependent translation, plays {{a critical role in}} density-mediated cell cycle arrest. 4 E-BP 1 promoter is activated and 4 E-BP 1 protein amount increases as cells reach confluence. Conversely, a much less marked <b>density-dependent</b> <b>inhibition</b> of cell proliferation is observed upon 4 E-BP 1 silencing. We further show that at high density, progression through the G(1) phase of the cell cycle is faster and Cyclin D 1 protein is induced in different cell types where 4 E-BP 1 has been either downregulated (stable shRNA expression or transient siRNA transfection) or removed (knockout). Thus 4 E-BP 1 appears as an important mediator of {{contact inhibition}}...|$|E
40|$|The {{inoculum}} effect (IE) is {{an increase}} in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic {{as a function of the}} initial size of a microbial population. The IE has been observed in a wide range of bacteria, implying that antibiotic efficacy may depend on population density. Such density dependence could have dramatic effects on bacterial population dynamics and potential treatment strategies, but explicit measures of per capita growth as a function of density are generally not available. Instead, the IE measures MIC as a function of initial population size, and population density changes by many orders of magnitude on the timescale of the experiment. Therefore, the functional relationship between population density and antibiotic inhibition is generally not known, leaving many questions about the impact of the IE on different treatment strategies unanswered. To address these questions, here we directly measured real-time per capita growth of Enterococcus faecalis populations exposed to antibiotic at fixed population densities using multiplexed computer-automated culture devices. We show that <b>density-dependent</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> is pervasive for commonly used antibiotics, with some drugs showing increased inhibition and others decreased inhibition at high densities. For several drugs, the density dependence is mediated by changes in extracellular pH, a community-level phenomenon not previously linked with the IE. Using a simple mathematical model, we demonstrate how this density dependence can modulate population dynamics in constant drug environments. Then, we illustrate how time-dependent dosing strategies can mitigate the negative effects of density-dependence. Finally, we show that these density effects lead to bistable treatment outcomes for a wide range of antibiotic concentrations in a pharmacological model of antibiotic treatment. As a result, infections exceeding a critical density often survive otherwise effective treatments...|$|R
40|$|Mouse 3 T 3 {{cells and}} their Simian Virus 40 -transformed {{derivatives}} (3 T 3 SV) {{were used to}} assess the relationship of transfromation, cell density, and growth control to the cellular distribution of newly synthesized glycosaminoglycan (GAG). Glucosamine- and galactosamine- containing GAG were labeled equivalently by [3 H=A 1 -glucose regardless of culture type, allowing incorporation into the various GAG to be compared under all conditions studied. Three components of each culture type were examined: the cells, which contain the bulk of newly synthesized GAG and are enriched in chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate; cell surface materials released by trypsin, which contain predominantly hyaluronic acid; and the media, which contain predominantly hyaluronic acid and undersulfated chondroitin sulfate. Increased cell density and viral transformation reduce incorporation into GAG relative to the incorporation into other polysaccharides. Transformation, however, does not substantially alter the type or distribution of newly synthesized GAG; the relative amounts and cellular distributions were very similar in 3 T 3 and 3 T 3 SV cultures growing at similar rates at low densities. On the other hand, increased cell density as well as <b>density-dependent</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> modified the type and distribution of newly synthesized GAG. At high cell densities both cell types showed reduced incorporation into hyaluronate and an increase in cellular GAG due to enhanced labeling of chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate. These changes were more marked in confluent 3 T 3 cultures which also differed in showing substantially more GAG label in the medium and in chondroitin- 6 -sulfate and heparan sulfate at the cell surface. Since cell density and possibly density- dependent inhibition of growth but not viral transformation are major factors controlling the cellular distribution and type of newly synthesized GAG, differences due to GAG's in the culture behavior of normal and transformed cells may occur only at high cell density. The density-induced GAG alterations most likely involved are increased condroitin- 6 -sulfate and heparan sulfate and decreased hyaluronic acid at the cell surface...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{reasons for}} annual {{variability}} {{in the composition of}} phytoplankton assemblages are poorly understood but may include competition for resources and allelopathic interactions [1 – 4]. We show that domination by the patch-forming dinoflagellate, Peridinium gatunense, or, alternatively, a bloom of a toxic cyanobacterium, Microcystis sp., in the Sea of Galilee [5] may be accounted for by mutual density-dependent allelopathic interactions. Over the last 11 years, the abundance of these species in the lake displayed strong negative correlation. Laboratory experiments showed reciprocal, <b>density-dependent,</b> but nutrient-independent, <b>inhibition</b> of growth. Application of spent P. gatunense medium induced sedimentation and, subsequently, massive lysis of Microcystis cells within 24 hr, and sedimentation and lysis were concomitant with a large rise in the level of McyB, which is involved in toxin biosynthesis by Microcystis[6]. P. gatunense responded to the presence of Microcystis by a species-specific pathway that involved a biphasic oxidative burst and activation of certain protein kinases. Blocking this recognition by MAP-kinase inhibitors abolished the biphasic oxidative burst and affected the fate (death or cell division) of the P. gatunense cells. We propose that patchy growth habits may confer enhanced defense capabilities, providing ecological advantages that compensate for the aggravated limitation of resources in the patch. Cross-talk via allelochemicals may explain the phytoplankton assemblage in the Sea of Galilee...|$|R
