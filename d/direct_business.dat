25|$|Despite {{having won}} the Colombian League {{three more times}} from 2000 to 2002, América has entered the {{millennium}} in economic hardship and unable to match the successful team of the 1980s. In 1995, Corporación Deportiva América was placed under watch by Executive Order 12978, commonly known in Colombia as the Clinton List. Because of its past connections with drug cartels, the United States froze the team's assets in the U.S. (valued around $1million), and ordered other companies not to conduct <b>direct</b> <b>business</b> with América. Also, according to club president Carlos Puente, the club never received the prize money of $200,000 from the Copa Merconorte championship. Since then, América's economic crisis has been severe. At one point in time, it was immersed in nearly $10million worth of debt. América had survived {{the past few years}} without a major sponsor, depending mostly on ticket sales for attendance at the Pascual Guerrero and the sales of soccer jerseys. The monthly salaries of its players has been below league average and América has seen itself forced to make money by selling its most recognized players.|$|E

2500|$|The Fugger {{family were}} the first German trading house in a <b>direct</b> <b>business</b> {{relationship}} with the Roman Curia. Following the death of Pope Alexander VI in August 1503 Jakob Fugger intensified his contacts to the Vatican in Rome. For the new Pope Julius II Fugger financed the recruitment of the Swiss Guard in 1505/1506, which still exists today. Early dealings in Rome are attributed to the cleric Markus Fugger in 1473. In 1477 the Fugger business was responsible for transferring church revenues from Sweden to Rome. Between 1508 and 1524, the company leased the Roman mint, the Zecca, manufacturing 66 types of coins for four different popes. After this the Fugger family was only represented by one manufactory in Rome, mostly due to the [...] "Sacco di Roma" [...] and the less German-friendly Medici Pope Clement VII.|$|E

2500|$|Screenwriter Bragi F. Schut wrote Season of the Witch as a spec {{script that}} {{was placed on}} the open market in 2000. Numerous studios bid on the script, and {{producers}} Charles Roven and Alex Gartner collaborated with the studio MGM to place a winning bid. MGM could not find traction to produce the film, and in 2003–2004 the studio [...] "was essentially obtained by a number of concerns". Columbia Pictures earmarked several properties for themselves, including Season of the Witch. The producers worked with director Dominic Sena to perform location shooting throughout Europe. They sought a 14th-century castle to use as a setting for the story; castles visited in Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic could not fit the period. With the film yet to be produced, the project eventually moved to Relativity Media, and Sena was officially attached to <b>direct.</b> <b>Business</b> and creative discussions led to avoiding too much violence or gore in the film so a broader audience could see it. Actor Nicolas Cage was considered for the starring role but was unavailable {{during the time of the}} location shooting. Cage eventually became available in 2008 and was cast in the role. He explained his interest, [...] "I wanted to make movies that celebrated actors like Christopher Lee and Vincent Price, and the great Roger Corman classics that are unafraid to explore the paranormal and the supernatural." ...|$|E

60|$|Then came some further {{conversation}} about Mr Cheekey, which, however, {{did not take}} an official form. What questions Mr Cheekey might ask would be between Mr Cheekey and the other attorney, and formed no part of Mr Apjohn's <b>direct</b> <b>business.</b> He had intended to imbue his client with something of the horror with which his clerk had been before him in creating, believing {{that the cause of}} truth would be assisted by reducing the man to the lowest condition of mean terror. But this new story somewhat changed his purpose. If the man were innocent,--if there were but some small probability of his innocence,--was it not his duty to defend him as a client from ill-usage on the part of Cheekey? That Cheekey must have his way with him was a matter of course,--that is, if Cousin Henry appeared at all; but a word or two of warning might be of service.|$|E
60|$|But it {{is equally}} true, though only of late and slowly {{beginning}} to be acknowledged, that a numerous assembly is as little fitted for the <b>direct</b> <b>business</b> of legislation as for that of administration. There is hardly any kind of intellectual work which so much {{needs to be done}} not only by experienced and exercised minds, but by minds trained to the task through long and laborious study, as the business of making laws. This is a sufficient reason, were there no other, why they can never be well made but by a committee of very few persons. A reason no less conclusive is, that every provision of a law requires to be framed with the most accurate and long-sighted perception of its effect on all the other provisions; and the law when made should be capable of fitting into a consistent whole with the previously existing laws. It is impossible that these conditions should be in any degree fulfilled when laws are voted clause by clause in a miscellaneous assembly. The incongruity of such a mode of legislating would strike all minds, were it not that our laws are already, as to form and construction, such a chaos, that the confusion and contradiction seem incapable of being made greater by any addition to the mass. Yet even now, the utter unfitness of our legislative machinery for its purpose is making itself practically felt every year more and more. The mere time necessarily occupied in getting through bills, renders Parliament more and more incapable of passing any, except on detached and narrow points. If a bill is prepared which even attempts to deal with the whole of any subject (and it is impossible to legislate properly on any part without having the whole present to the mind), it hangs over from session to session through sheer impossibility of finding time to dispose of it. It matters not though the bill may have been deliberately drawn up by the authority deemed the best qualified, with all appliances and means to boot; or by a select commission, chosen for their conversancy with the subject, and having employed years in considering and digesting the particular measure: it can not be passed, because the House of Commons will not forego the precious privilege of tinkering it with their clumsy hands. The custom has of late been to some extent introduced, when the principle of a bill has been affirmed on the second reading, of referring it for consideration in detail to a select committee; but it has not been found that this practice causes much less time to be lost afterwards in carrying it through the committee of the whole House: the opinions or private crotchets which have been overruled by knowledge always insist on giving themselves a second chance before the tribunal of ignorance. Indeed, the practice itself has been adopted principally by the House of Lords, the members of which are less busy and fond of meddling, and less jealous of the importance of their individual voices, than those of the elective House. And when a bill of many clauses does succeed in getting itself discussed in detail, what can depict the state in which it comes out of committee! Clauses omitted which are essential to the working of the rest; incongruous ones inserted to conciliate some private interest, or some crotchety member who threatens to delay the bill; articles foisted in on the motion of some sciolist with a mere smattering of the subject, leading to consequences which the member who introduced or those who supported the bill did not at the moment foresee, and which need an amending act in the next session to correct their mischiefs. It is one of the evils of the present mode of managing these things, that the explaining and defending of a bill, and of its various provisions, is scarcely ever performed by the person from whose mind they emanated, who probably has not a seat in the House. Their defense rests upon some minister or member of Parliament who did not frame them, who is dependent on cramming for all his arguments but those which are perfectly obvious, who does not know the full strength of his case, nor the best reasons by which to support it, and is wholly incapable of meeting unforeseen objections. This evil, as far as government bills are concerned, admits of remedy, and has been remedied in some representative constitutions, by allowing the government to be represented in either House by persons in its confidence, having a right to speak, though not to vote.|$|E
