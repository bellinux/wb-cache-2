This mechanism provides a low profile when collapsed, for easy maneuvering underneath the vehicle, while allowing considerable extension.|$|E

50|$|A jack, {{screwjack}} or jackscrew is {{a mechanical}} device {{used as a}} lifting device to lift heavy loads or to apply great forces. A mechanical jack employs a screw thread for lifting heavy equipment. A hydraulic jack uses hydraulic power. The most common form is a car jack, <b>floor</b> <b>jack</b> or garage jack, which lifts vehicles so that maintenance can be performed. Jacks are usually rated for a maximum lifting capacity (for example, 1.5 tons or 3 tons). Industrial jacks can be rated for many tons of load.|$|E

50|$|The green jack is a gregarious species, forming {{moderately}} large {{schools of}} fish in the marine environment. Smaller shoals are formed by juveniles when entering shallower waters including bays and estuaries. The species is predatory in nature, taking small fish, cephalopods, crabs, shrimps and other crustaceans, either in midwater or on the sea <b>floor.</b> Green <b>jack</b> are also known to consume zooplankton, especially in deeper waters around islands and seamounts where the plankton is aggregated. Throughout its range, the species {{is one of the}} most abundant species, making it an important part of the ecology, not only as a predator but as prey. It is known to be taken by larger fish such as marlin and sharks, as well a variety of other animals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{classrooms}} {{are located}} {{on the first two}} floors of Brennan Hall. Two of the nine classrooms are two tiered case-study rooms equipped for video teleconferencing. Two other classrooms are computers rooms, while the rest are traditional classrooms. Each of the nine classrooms contains a principal teaching station, or the [...] "control center for the classroom." [...] The workstation allows teachers to control the classroom's lighting, display screens and computers. Teachers will be able to connect to The university's video library and access satellite television. Additionally, the building possesses a self-contained network accessible from each classroom seat. In 2008, the university dedicated one of Brennan Hall’s classrooms. The Jack and Jean Blackledge Sweeney Classroom on the first <b>floor</b> honors <b>Jack</b> Sweeney '61, the retired president and co-founder of Special Defense Systems in Dunmore, a member of the Pride, Passion, Promise Campaign Executive Committee, and an active University of Scranton alumni.|$|R
40|$|The New Faliron steam-electric station, {{the first}} one in Greece, is a listed {{historical}} building. The initial structure was constructed {{at the start of the}} 20 th century but a number of interventions followed until the 1960 s. The structure was built with natural stone masonry, steel trusses and <b>floors</b> (with <b>jack</b> arches and joist fillers) and concrete floors reinforced with twisted cold formed rebars. The 12. 5 m high masonries practically lack any lateral restraints while large openings (doors, windows) exist. This paper presents brief information on the history of the structure, phases of construction, description of structure (dimensions, types of structural systems, etc), material properties and pathology. In addition, detailed information is presented regarding the assessment performed in accordance with the current code specifications (Eurocodes), including seismic actions. Especially for the masonry, a detailed finite element model was developed, whereas the seismic forces were evaluated through alternative methodologies (modal response spectrum analysis per EC 8 and time history analyses). For the assessment of the RC part a displacement based methodology was applied as it is restrained by the surrounding masonry walls. From the assessment analysis, useful conclusions are drawn regarding the seismic performance of high masonry structures without lateral restraints and the behaviour of similar industrial structures under seismic effects...|$|R

Old Orchard Beach {{was home to}} the first carousel in the United States, Noah's Ark, a kid-friendly, boat-shaped funhouse with hand-carved figures of Noah and his family, was designed to provide an exciting but not frightening experience for a 5-year-old. The entire structure would rock back and forth while guests meandered through dark passages. Colored lights would flash, loud klaxons would sound, and compressed air would shoot from the <b>floor.</b> On the <b>Jack</b> and Jill slide, two people would be placed on a large hemp mat in a wooden bucket, which would {{take them to the}} top of a 50 ft tall tower and dump them onto a metal slide for a quick ride down.|$|R

They file into the control room as the Doctor is about to fire the delta wave. The Emperor again taunts the Doctor, who cannot bring himself to kill so many {{innocent}} people just to destroy the Daleks. The Emperor declares the Doctor a coward and orders him to be exterminated, but before the Daleks can kill him, the TARDIS materialises. The TARDIS doors swing open and Rose appears, wrapped {{in the glow of}} the time vortex. She reveals that she is the Bad Wolf, and that she spreads the words throughout time and space as a message to lead her there. The Daleks attempt to exterminate Rose, but she easily stops them, disintegrating the Emperor and the entire fleet. The Doctor begs her to relinquish her new power, but instead she brings Jack back to life. As Rose begins to burn up from the power, the Doctor kisses her, taking the entire power of the vortex into his own body. He releases it back into the TARDIS and carries an unconscious Rose back inside. They leave in the TARDIS before a reanimated Jack can get back to them, trapping him on the Game Station.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, Wood {{and two of}} his brothers, Glen and Delano, {{purchased}} a 1940 Ford, which was later modified and used in NASCAR, and the team made its first start in a Lincoln at Martinsville Speedway on May 17, 1953. Wood was the team's engine builder, and the team's pit crew, originally composed of family and friends, became the first team in NASCAR history to record a 25-second four tire pit stop. Wood stated that in 1960 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, he noticed that Fireball Roberts', at the lead at the time, pit crew took 45 seconds to change two tires and fuel; Roberts' team was using a four-prong lug wrench, so Wood's team decided to use power wrenches, which cut down the time to 25 seconds. Wood later modernized the <b>floor</b> jack; originally, <b>jacks</b> weighed between 70 and 80 pounds, and required at least ten pumps for tire clearance. Wood disassembled the jacks and installed larger pistons, leading to only two to three pumps to clear. In 1965, Wood's team was hired by Jim Clark to pit for him in the 1965 Indianapolis 500, which went on to win. The team used a modified fuel can to make the gas flow faster.|$|R
