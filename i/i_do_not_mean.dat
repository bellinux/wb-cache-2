5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> to {{say that}} Mr. Ainsworth, when writing this novel, did not {{introduce}} {{some of his own}} ideas; but as the first idea and all the principal points and characters emanated from me, I think it will be allowed that the title of originator of The Miser's Daughter should be conferred upon, Sir, Your obedient servant, George Cruikshank.|$|E
500|$|But here I {{would not}} be misunderstood. By the love of our country, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> loyalty to our King, for that is a duty of another nature, and a man may be very loyal, in the common sense of the word, without one grain of public good in his heart. Witness this very kingdom we live in. I verily believe, that since the {{beginning}} of the world, no nation upon earth ever shewed (all circumstances considered), such high constant marks of loyalty in all their action and behaviour as we have done; and at the same time, no people ever appeared more utterly void of what is called public spirit ... therefore, I shall think my time not ill-spent if I can persuade most and all of you who hear me, to shew the love you have for your country by endeavouring in your several situations to do all the public good you can. For I am certain persuaded that all our misfortunes arise from no other original cause than that general disregard among us to the public welfare.|$|E

2500|$|... when I {{speak of}} a Disarmament Convention <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> {{disarmament}} {{on the part of}} this country and not on the part of any other. I mean the limitation of armaments as a real limitation...and if we find ourselves on some lower rating and that some other country has higher figures, that country has to come down and we have to go up until we meet.|$|E
2500|$|... "From {{the point}} of view of both {{language}} and contents, I conclude that the Pali inscriptions of Burma and Siam give firm evidence for a Theravadin presence in the Irrawaddy and Chao Phraya basins, from about the 5th century CE onwards. From the extent and richness of the evidence it seems that the Theravada was the predominant school, and that it enjoyed the patronage of ruling and economic elites. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> to suggest that religious society was monolithic: other schools may well have been present, or have come and gone, and there is ample evidence ...|$|E
2500|$|.....I {{want our}} nation {{to be the}} most {{beautiful}} in the world. By this <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> the most powerful nation. Because I have felt the pain of being invaded by another nation, I do not want my nation to invade others. It is sufficient that our wealth makes our lives abundant; it is sufficient that our strength is able to prevent foreign invasions. The only thing that I desire in infinite quantity is the power of a noble culture. This is because the power of culture both makes ourselves happy and gives happiness to others.|$|E

"True, Jack," [...] I replied, seriously, [...] "I {{confess that}} I have lied; but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> to. <b>I</b> assure you I had no {{notion of what}} I was saying. I think I was bewitched. All your {{nonsense}} rolled out, as it were, without my will. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> to tell lies. Yet I confess, to my shame, that <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> There is some mystery here, which I can by no means fathom." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1977, at the First International UFO Congress in Chicago, Hynek {{presented}} his thoughts {{in his speech}} [...] "What I Really Believe About UFOs". [...] "I do believe", he said, [...] "that the UFO phenomenon {{as a whole is}} real, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> necessarily that it's just one thing. We must ask whether the diversity of observed UFOs ... all spring from the same basic source, as do weather phenomena, which all originate in the atmosphere", or whether they differ [...] "as a rain shower differs from a meteor, which in turn differs from a cosmic-ray shower." [...] We must not ask, Hynek said, simply which hypothesis can explain the most facts, but rather which hypothesis can explain the most puzzling facts.|$|E
