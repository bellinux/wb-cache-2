50|$|Three-point bending is a newer {{process that}} uses a die with an adjustable-height bottom tool, moved by a servo motor. The height can be set within 0.01 mm. Adjustments between the ram and the upper tool are made using a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cushion,</b> which {{accommodates}} deviations in sheet thickness. Three-point bending can achieve bend angles with 0.25 deg. precision. While three-point bending permits high flexibility and precision, it also entails high costs and there are fewer tools readily available. It is being used mostly in high-value niche markets.|$|E
50|$|On February 27, {{the flow}} to the {{spillway}} was temporarily shut off, allowing crews to begin removing debris in the river in preparation to restart the power plant. After the spillway was shut off, it appeared that headward erosion along the spillway channel had mostly stabilized, reducing the immediate threat of a gate failure and uncontrolled water release. The bedrock under {{the upper half of}} the spillway appears to be much stronger than the rock which was washed out under the midsection of the spillway. In addition, the force of the falling water had excavated the original crater into a deep plunge pool which acts as a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cushion,</b> dissipating much of the energy that otherwise might have caused additional damage to the spillway.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the initial measured performance {{results of the}} previously documented NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) Cockpit Motion Facility (CMF) motion base hardware safety devices. These safety systems are required to prevent excessive accelerations that could injure personnel and damage simulator cockpits or the motion base structure. Excessive accelerations {{may be caused by}} erroneous commands or hardware failures driving an actuator to the end of its travel at high velocity, stepping a servo valve, or instantly reversing servo direction. Such commands may result from single order failures of electrical or hydraulic components within the control system itself, or from aggressive or improper cueing commands from the host simulation computer. The safety systems must mitigate these high acceleration events while minimizing the negative performance impacts. The system accomplishes this by controlling the rate of change of valve signals to limit excessive commanded accelerations. It also aids <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cushion</b> performance by limiting valve command authority as the actuator approaches its end of travel. The design takes advantage of inherent motion base hydraulic characteristics to implement all safety features using hardware only solutions...|$|E
40|$|Retrofits of {{hydraulic}} {{and mechanical}} deep drawing presses often {{stop with the}} exchange of the electrical and the hydraulic parts. But that is only half the job. The use of high definition control electronics, faster CPUs and more dynamic hydraulic actuators, offers the opportunity of redesigning the already existing control concepts of the press. In this paper we present how {{the performance of the}} press, i. e. the control quality, can be increased for hydraulic ram and cushion axes. The improvement in control quality is achieved through the use of intelligent closed-loop and open-loopcontrol algorithms. Therefore, creasing and crack formation can be reduced, since enhancements in control quality have direct influence {{on the quality of the}} forming process. Results will be shown for hydraulic drawing cushion control, i. e. pressure control, as well as for hydraulic ram control, i. e. position, velocity and parallelism control. We present findings for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cushion</b> control of a mechanical press type Arisa S- 4 - 1600 - 470 - 230 -LDE (link-drive press with 10 hydraulic cushions) and for ram- / cushion-control of hydraulic press type MÃ¼ller-Weingarten ZE 2100 (multi-curve press with 8 -point cushion) ...|$|E
