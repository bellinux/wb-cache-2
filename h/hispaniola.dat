5|$|In 1508, the Caribbean {{coast of}} Honduras was superficially {{explored}} by Spanish navigators Juan Díaz de Solís and Vicente Yáñez, but {{the focus of}} their expeditions lay further to the north. In the 1510s, expeditions from the Spanish settlements on Cuba and <b>Hispaniola</b> reported that the Bay Islands were inhabited. The first efforts to conquer Honduras were launched from several {{different areas of the}} Spanish Indies, including <b>Hispaniola,</b> Mexico, and Panama. This resulted in jurisdictional disputes over the territory that delayed the progress of the conquest.|$|E
5|$|With his father, Las Casas {{immigrated to}} the island of <b>Hispaniola</b> in 1502 on the {{expedition}} of Nicolás de Ovando. Las Casas became a hacendado and slave owner, receiving {{a piece of land}} in the province of Cibao.

5|$|Alpha dumped torrential rain on {{the island}} of <b>Hispaniola,</b> making it the eighth wettest storm to impact poverty-stricken Haiti. It caused 26deaths, 17 of them in Haiti and all of them caused by floods and rain-related landslides. Roads were blocked for weeks and {{hundreds}} of houses were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Due to high winds, {{two cars}} were crushed by falling trees, causing {{the deaths of}} two men and one 12-year-old boy. <b>Hispaniola</b> {{received}} heavy rain and 35mph (56km/h) winds but no deaths or damage was reported. In the Bahamas, the storm brought winds of 35mph (56km/h) but left no damage.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{introduced}} throughout the temperate world, and is established as a weed in Australia, New Zealand, tropical Asia, La Réunion, North America, Hawaii, Chile, <b>Hispaniola</b> and Argentina. It has also been reported in Japan.|$|E

50|$|The Dominican Republic is {{now home}} to only two living species of Lutzomyia, L. cayennensis <b>hispaniolae</b> and L. christophei and both species are placed in the Verrucarum species group. none of the {{described}} Verrucarum group species possess the forked Sc vein that distinguishes L. adiketis from the modern species.|$|R
5|$|Overall, Hurricane Inez killed about 1,000people, {{mostly on}} <b>Hispaniola,</b> and caused over $200million in damage. Crop damage {{was less than}} other storms of similar magnitude, due to Inez's small size and its {{occurrence}} late in the season.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} also {{occurred}} as a vagrant to Greenland, Jamaica, <b>Hispaniola,</b> Puerto Rico and Belize. Vagrants to Europe, where identified to subspecies, are nominate T. m. migratorius, but the Greenland birds also included T. m. nigrideus, {{and some of}} the southern overshots may have been T. m. achrusterus.|$|E
5|$|Zombia is a {{monotypic}} genus of fan palms {{which is}} endemic to <b>Hispaniola.</b> Individuals {{are up to}} 3m (10ft) tall and grow in dry, hilly regions. It is restricted to serpentine soils, {{at least in the}} Dominican Republic.|$|E
50|$|When Jim goes to Bristol {{and visits}} Long John Silver at the Spy Glass tavern, recovered, Silver intends to murder the <b>Hispaniola's</b> {{officers}} {{and keep the}} loot {{for himself and his}} men. When the pirates have gone back to their berths, Jim warns Smollett, Trelawney, and Livesey of the impending mutiny.|$|R
5000|$|Tom Fisher as Abraham Gray, the <b>Hispaniola's</b> coxswain and {{the only}} {{survivor}} among the seamen who refuse to join the mutineers. In the book, Gray (the carpenter's mate, not the coxswain, as Hands holds that position) initially joins the mutineers, but then defects after Captain Smollett appeals to his better nature.|$|R
50|$|Conservation International {{recognizes the}} region {{as one of the}} most conservation-urgent in the world in which 13 of <b>Hispaniola's</b> most {{critically}} endangered species (all amphibians) occur. Among the most critically endangered frog species are Eleutherodactylus chlorophenax and Eleutherodactylus parapelates, two frog species endemic to Haiti. The Hispaniolan trogon has a recognized presence in the region.|$|R
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 20th century, malaria {{remained}} endemic in more than 100 countries throughout the tropical and subtropical zones, including large areas of Central and South America, <b>Hispaniola</b> (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Resistance of Plasmodium to anti-malaria drugs, as well as resistance of mosquitos to insecticides and the discovery of zoonotic species of the parasite have complicated control measures.|$|E
5|$|Coccothrinax is a genus of fan palms found {{throughout}} the Caribbean and in adjacent parts of southern Florida and Mexico. Most species are small to medium-sized, with maximum heights between 5 and 15 metres (17 and 49ft). Only one of the 53 species, C. readii, is absent from the insular Caribbean. Two species, C. argentata and C. barbadensis, are widespread, {{while most of the}} others are restricted to Cuba and <b>Hispaniola.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early in Lenny's duration, a {{tropical}} storm warning and hurricane watch were issued for Jamaica. Later, a hurricane watch was issued for the southern coast of <b>Hispaniola,</b> and {{a tropical}} storm warning was also issued for the Dominican Republic. Haitian officials {{declared a state of}} alert in three southern provinces and allocated about $1million (1999USD) in hurricane funds. Residents in flood-prone areas were advised to evacuate in southern Haiti and in the neighboring Dominican Republic.|$|E
5000|$|Barnaby Kay as Tom Morgan, {{a former}} member of Flint's crew and later of <b>Hispaniola's</b> and a mutineer. He is {{described}} in the book, in which he was also a member of Flint's crew, as elderly and [...] "mahogany-faced" [...] (although it is not specified whether this means he is heavily tanned or black).|$|R
50|$|The Petite Rivière de Jacmel {{takes its}} {{source in the}} foothills of the {{mountain}} range called Chaîne de la Selle, and set in <b>Hispaniola's</b> Tiburon Peninsula. Over approximately 10 kilometers long, the river then runs Eastwards, to meet South with the Caribbean Sea at the level of its mouth in the bay of the port-city of Jacmel.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the island's {{endemic species}} exist within the 'de la Hotte Biosphere. Rising to a peak level of {{approximately}} 7700 ft (2347 m) in Pic Macaya; Haiti's second highest peak, the Massif's high and fluctuating elevations supports some of <b>Hispaniola’s</b> {{highest levels of}} biological diversity and endemism. Much of the region lies within the Pic Macaya National Park.|$|R
5|$|Early in its {{formative}} stages, Elena triggered rainshowers and thunderstorms over {{parts of}} Cuba, The Bahamas, and <b>Hispaniola.</b> Later, the mature hurricane generated strong rip currents {{as far away}} as South Padre Island, Texas, where two swimmers drowned in separate incidents over the Labor Day weekend. Both victims were male Texas residents.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere {{along its}} path, heavy {{rainfall}} {{was reported in}} Jamaica, <b>Hispaniola,</b> and southern Florida. In Haiti, the rainfall caused 13deaths and left thousands of livestock killed. In Florida, the precipitation peaked at 9.99inches (25.4cm) in Canal Point near Lake Okeechobee. Another high total was 9.4inches (23.9cm) in Tavernier, and the precipitation as a whole alleviated drought conditions.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kyle was the {{eleventh}} tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed from a strong tropical disturbance that tracked across the northeastern Caribbean Sea {{in the third}} week of September. As a low pressure area, it moved slowly across Puerto Rico and <b>Hispaniola,</b> dumping torrential rains across those islands.|$|E
5000|$|Clinton Blake as Freddie Arrow, the <b>Hispaniola's</b> first mate. In {{the book}} {{he is the only}} mate, an appalling officer who disappears one night (presumably fallen {{overboard}} while drunk), but in this adaptation (in which he is portrayed as Jamaican) he dies after being keel-hauled by Trelawney after striking him (also while drunk). He is not given a first name in the book.|$|R
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{organized into}} Tropical Depression Twenty-five {{in the eastern}} Caribbean on October 22. Later that day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Alpha as it moved west-northwestward. On the morning of October 23, it made landfall with 50mph (85km/h) winds {{near the city of}} Barahona in the Dominican Republic, then moved over Haiti. Alpha weakened to a tropical depression over <b>Hispaniola's</b> steep mountains. Alpha reentered the Atlantic Ocean where it was absorbed by Hurricane Wilma.|$|R
25|$|Haiti's most {{important}} valley {{in terms of}} crops is the Plaine de l'Artibonite, which is oriented south of the Montagnes Noires. This region supports the country's (also <b>Hispaniola's)</b> longest river, the Riviere l'Artibonite, which begins in the western region of the Dominican Republic and continues most of its length through central Haiti and onward where it empties into the Golfe de la Gonâve. The eastern and central region of the island is a large elevated plateau.|$|R
