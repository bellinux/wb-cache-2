According to Coach Stoops, Johnson would not play against Baylor, but he returned for the regular season finale.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} the lines [...] "Way back in time / Someone said try some, I tried some / Now buy some, I bought some..." [...] before Harrison states that <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> [...] "and I saw you". According to Christian theologian Dale Allison, the lyrics are a [...] "reflection {{on some sort of}} {{conversion}} experience", in which Harrison provides [...] "before and after" [...] comparisons. Before his spiritual awakening, Harrison sings of variously possessing, seeing, feeling and knowing [...] "ot a thing" [...] until, Allison writes, [...] "he called upon God's love, which then came into him." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to this angle, the IWA began hinting that Colón would be joining a heel stable known as [...] "Capitol Sports" [...] (borrowing the name that WWC used during the 1970s-90s), which in storyline was being covertly operated by González in cooperation with his [...] "business partners" [...] (a reference to Colón, Sr. and Jovica) {{with the intention of}} taking over the promotion. In a segment of their television show, the company ran a script where a surprise arrival was announced, which was promoted as [...] "a young wrestler [...] with a tremendous future in the United States [...] who has Capitol flowing through veins" [...] and with whom González had differences in the past that were overcome when <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> (in reference to WWC's heel turn) so that he could [...] "complete" [...] an unspecified task in the invasion. The IWA further mocked Colón in a skit where Savio Vega dismissed this revelation, citing that he had video evidence of a match where Flash Flanagan (who was active in the promotion performing as [...] "Slash Venom") pinned him at OVW. This angle was concluded in a segment where González berated an unknown individual during a call for being unable to appear in a card, claiming that [...] "he [...] as mediocre as [...] father and brother".|$|E

500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E
