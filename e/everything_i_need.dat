500|$|Squidward's {{voice has}} been {{compared}} to that of Jack Benny's. Kenny said, [...] "To me, there's something just so funny about that Jack-Benny-loyal-to-nobody character that Rodger Bumpass does such a great job of playing [...] Squidward". Arthur Brown, author of <b>Everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!, said that Squidward [...] "sounds a lot like Jack Benny". Bumpass repudiated the relationship, saying [...] "Jack Benny, no. Although he does have this observational sarcasm he occasionally brought out." ...|$|E

She sings the introduction {{in a low}} register, {{and the power of}} her voice gradually increases as the song progresses. In the pre-chorus, she chants, [...] "Everywhere I'm looking now, I'm surrounded by your embrace, baby I can see your halo, you know you're my saving grace, you're <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> and more, it's written all over your face". Beyoncé then echoes the word [...] "halo" [...] in the chorus; the third and final one is preceded by a 1980s drum breakdown, and is complemented by sweeping strings and percussion.|$|E
500|$|Squidward Tentacles is {{voiced by}} Rodger Bumpass, who {{describes}} Squidward as [...] "a very nasally, monotone kind of guy." [...] He {{said that the}} character [...] "became a very interesting character to do" [...] because of [...] "his sarcasm, and then his frustration, and then his apoplexy, and so he became {{a wide spectrum of}} emotions". Arthur Brown, author of <b>Everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!, has compared Squidward's voice to that of Jack Benny's, a similarity Bumpass says is mostly unintentional. Voice acting veteran Clancy Brown voices Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob's boss at the Krusty Krab. Hillenburg modeled Mr. Krabs after his former manager at a seafood restaurant, whose strong Maine accent reminded Hillenburg of a pirate. For the character, Brown decided to use a [...] "piratey" [...] voice with [...] "a little Scottish brogue" [...] after hearing Hillenburg's description of his boss. According to Brown, his Mr. Krabs voice was mostly improvised during his audition and it was not challenging for him to find the correct voice.|$|E

500|$|On June 25, 2009, American {{entertainer}} Michael Jackson {{died while}} Beyoncé was touring.

During the tribute, an image of Jackson was shown on the main screen. As Beyoncé sang an emotional rendition of [...] "Halo", she changed the lyrics to [...] "Michael I can see your Halo / I pray your music won't fade away". On January 12, 2010, Haiti was struck by an earthquake. A charity telethon called [...] took place on January 22, 2010, in which many artists, including Beyoncé, participated. She performed an acoustic version of [...] "Halo" [...] with Coldplay's lead vocalist Chris Martin playing the piano.

2500|$|The Toronto-based Downchild Blues Band, co-founded in 1969 by two brothers, Donnie and Richard [...] "Hock" [...] Walsh, {{served as}} an {{inspiration}} for the two Blues Brothers characters. [...] Aykroyd initially modeled Elwood Blues in part on Donnie Walsh, a harmonica player and guitarist, while Belushi's Jake Blues character was modeled in part on Hock Walsh, Downchild's lead singer. In their first album as the Blues Brothers, Briefcase Full of Blues (1978), Aykroyd and Belushi featured three well-known Downchild songs closely associated with Hock Walsh's vocal style: [...] "I've Got <b>Everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> (Almost)," [...] written by Donnie Walsh, [...] "Shotgun Blues," [...] co-written by Donnie and Hock Walsh, and [...] "Flip, Flop and Fly," [...] co-written and originally popularized by Big Joe Turner. [...] All three songs were contained in Downchild's second album, Straight Up (1973), with [...] "Flip, Flop and Fly" [...] becoming the band's most successful single, in 1974.|$|E
6000|$|Now here, on {{the other}} hand, is a dress which, being founded on principles, can serve us as an {{excellent}} guide and model; it has been drawn for me, most kindly, by Mr. Godwin from the Duke of Newcastle's delightful book on horsemanship, a book {{which is one of}} our best authorities on our best era of costume. I do not of course propose it necessarily for absolute imitation; that is not the way in which one should regard it; it is not, I mean, a revival of a dead costume, but a realization of living laws. I give it {{as an example of a}} particular application of principles which are universally right. This rationally dressed young man can turn his hat brim down if it rains, and his loose trousers and boots down if he is tired--that is, he can adapt his costume to circumstances; then he enjoys perfect freedom, the arms and legs are not made awkward or uncomfortable by the excessive tightness of narrow sleeves and knee-breeches, and the hips are left quite untrammelled, always an important point; and as regards comfort, his jacket is not too loose for warmth, nor too close for respiration; his neck is well protected without being strangled, and even his ostrich feathers, if any Philistine should object to them, are not merely dandyism, but fan him very pleasantly, I am sure, in summer, and when the weather is bad they are no doubt left at home, and his cloak taken out. THE VALUE OF THE DRESS IS SIMPLY THAT EVERY SEPARATE ARTICLE OF IT EXPRESSES A LAW. My young man is consequently apparelled with ideas, while Mr. Huyshe's young man is stiffened with facts; the latter teaches one nothing; from the former one learns <b>everything.</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> hardly say that this dress is good, not because it is seventeenth century, but because it is constructed on the true principles of costume, just as a square lintel or pointed arch is good, not because one may be Greek and the other Gothic, but because each of them is the best method of spanning a certain-sized opening, or resisting a certain weight. The fact, however, that this dress was generally worn in England two centuries and a half ago shows at least this, that the right laws of dress have been understood and realized in our country, and so in our country may be realized and understood again. As regards the absolute beauty of this dress and its meaning, I should like to say a few words more. Mr. Wentworth Huyshe solemnly announces that [...] "he and those who think with him" [...] cannot permit this question of beauty to be imported into the question of dress; that he and those who think with him take [...] "practical views on the subject," [...] and so on. Well, I will not enter here into a discussion as to how far any one who does not take beauty and the value of beauty into account can claim to be practical at all. The word practical is nearly always the last refuge of the uncivilized. Of all misused words it is the most evilly treated. But what I want to point out is that beauty is essentially organic; that is, it comes, not from without, but from within, not from any added prettiness, but from the perfection of its own being; and that consequently, as the body is beautiful, so all apparel that rightly clothes it must be beautiful also in its construction and in its lines.|$|E
