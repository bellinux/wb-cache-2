5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors {{increase the risk of}} <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Fitzgerald {{suffered}} {{a third and}} final <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> <b>and</b> died believing his work forgotten. His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby as evidence of great potential that was never reached. However, a strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it and John O'Hara showed the book's influence. The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment, with the general consensus expressing the sentiment that the book was an enduring work of fiction.|$|E
5|$|In June 2005, he {{suffered}} a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> was treated in the United Arab Emirates. A PPP spokesman stated he underwent angioplasty in the United States.

His lawyers stated he could not come because he was recovering from his treatment. Following a request by the Rawalpindi court, Interpol issued a red notice in January 2006 against the couple which called on member nations to decide on the couple's extradition.|$|E

5|$|O'Reilly's {{later years}} were troubled with poor health, {{including}} {{the loss of}} a leg. In late 1988, he suffered a major <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> was hospitalised for two months. He died in hospital in Sutherland in 1992, aged 86. O'Reilly lamented the decline of spin during his twilight years, and in the 1980s he was often derided by younger people who felt that his advocacy of spin bowling—which they deemed to be obsolete—was misplaced. He died just months before Shane Warne revived the art of leg spin on the international stage.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 2016, {{a prison}} officer (Adrian Ismay) had a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> {{died in a}} hospital. He had {{received}} serious wounds following a booby-trap bomb detonating under his van on Hillsborough Drive, East Belfast 11 days earlier. The wounds he received from the bombing were directly responsible for the heart attack that killed him. The 'New' IRA claimed responsibility {{and said it was}} a response to the alleged mistreatment of republican prisoners at Maghaberry Prison. It added that the officer was targeted because he trained prison officers at Maghaberry.|$|E

The funeral procession carried his coffin from the city, along Magill and Old Norton Summit Roads where thousands turned out to pay their respects, to the Norton Summit cemetery where his forebears had been buried.

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} band {{embarked}} on a European tour {{in the summer of}} 1998, Ward suffered a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> was temporarily replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice.

Following the Ozzfest appearances, the band was put on hiatus while members worked on solo material. Tony Iommi released his first official solo album, Iommi, in 2000, while Osbourne continued work on his next solo release, Down to Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy showed {{the need for}} a clear way for determining presidential disability {{in the context of the}} Cold War. The new President, Lyndon B. Johnson, had once suffered a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> – with the office of Vice President to remain vacant until the next term began on January 20, 1965 – the next two people in the line of succession were the 71-year-old Speaker of the House John McCormack and the 86-year-old Senate President pro tempore Carl Hayden. Senator Birch Bayh succeeded Kefauver as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments and set about advocating for a detailed amendment dealing with presidential disability.|$|E
