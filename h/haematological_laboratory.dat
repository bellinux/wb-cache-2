A primary infection that occurs in adolescence or adulthood is usually clinically presented as infectious mononucleosis with a triad of symptoms: fever, lymphadenopathy and pharyngitis. Our retrospective study included 51 patients with a median age of 17 (9 - 23) years and serologically confirmed infectious mononucleosis. All patients with infectious mononucleosis were treated at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases at the Clinical Center in Kragujevac during 2013. We analysed the clinical, <b>haematological</b> and <b>laboratory</b> parameters of patients. The aspartate-aminotransferase levels were increased in 40 patients, with a mean value of 116. 24 (± 93. 22); the alanine-aminotransferase levels were increased in 44 patients, with a mean value of 189. 24 (± 196. 69). Lymphadenopathy {{was the most common}} clinical feature upon admission in 49 patients (96 %); 38 patients (74. 5 %) had splenomegaly, and 20 (39 %) had hepatomegaly.

40|$|Evaluation {{of blood}} count with {{differential}} leukocyte budget {{is a basic}} haematological test. From a diagnostic {{point of view is}} the information about the exact number of leukocytes and their percentage representation in the patient's blood very valuable as well as a range of informations on the effect of disease states. In my bachelor´s thesis I devote to instrumentative and microscopic examination of the differential leukocyte budget and their comparing in terms of difficulty and obtaining the most accurate results. Nowadays, with the development of science and technology are used to determine differential leukocyte budget modern haematological analyzers, but the manual setting by using a microscope remains the basis of good work in <b>haematological</b> <b>laboratory.</b> The goal of each laboratory determination is to produce accurate results for clinical use. The analyzes are mostly automatic and their advantages are faster pace of analysis, accuracy, reliability and need of small volume of sample. The main objective of my thesis is to evaluate the distinction by using two different methods, microscopical and instrumentative. The thesis is traditionally divided into theoretical and practical part. The theoretic part of the thesis explains the meaning of the differential leukocyte count, there is a detailed morfology description of different leukocyte types. I mentioned the non-neoplastic and neoplastic changes in the number of leukocytes. Last but not least, there is an overview of laboratory methods that are used for blood counts in routine <b>haematological</b> <b>laboratory.</b> To determine differential leukocyte budget is used optical method, electrical impedance method, cytochemical method or digital morphology. The practical part describes the examination methodology of the differential leukocyte budget, which I have used in this work. I made a blood smear by microscopic assessment, which I dyed according the instructions. Preparates are viewed with oil immersion under a light microscope. To record different leukocyte types are used recording devices - leucomats. I made automatic assessment of differential leukocyte budget in 5 - population haematological analyzer Sysmex XE - 2100 based on the principle of flow cytometry with sample measurements from the feeder closed or open way. Examination of differential leukocyte budgets was realized in biochemical and <b>haematological</b> <b>laboratory</b> synlab czech s. r. o in Czech Budweis. Here I investigated 100 randomly selected patient samples of venous blood under the proffesional supervision and I compared the differential leukocyte budgets and differences between methods. I investigated samples in April and May of 2012. Results obtained by microscopic examination and by measurements on analyzer were statistically compiled into tables and graphs in a computer program. In the graphical representation comparing the differential cell counts in 100 samples of the budget of the analyzer under a microscope. I set the hypothesis that the numbers of microscopic differentials equal to those of the automatic analyzer. Laboratory results were obtained by the measurement and that results were interpreted after consultation with the supervisor. Based on the results, I rejected the hypothesis. Own laboratory investigation showed that classic microscopic assessment has essential importance in the analysis of pathological cells. It also depends on the experience of the laboratory worker. The advantages of the haematologic analyzer are particularly rapid analysis, accuracy and need of small volume of biological sample. During the practical part of the thesis I gained practical skills in working with biological material and I embraced the principles of laboratory methods. The results of my work can be used widely in clinical laboratories in assessing {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} relationships between monitored by analytical methods...|$|E

Physiological variations corresponding to age and sex were studied {{as the most important}} factors affecting biological variation in haematological constituents of blood. In our study erythrocytes, haemoglobin and haematocrit values were not sex dependent until the age of 13 after which the values were higher in men than in women. Sedimentation rate showed sex and age related differences in the adult age with higher values in women especially after 50 years. Total leukocyte count declined with age and in adults the values were slightly lower in women. Segmented neutrophil granulocytes showed the upward trend with age whereas the lymphocyte and monocyte counts declined. Women showed slightly higher platelet count in the adult age.

40|$|Abstract: Malaria {{remains a}} major cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in India. Plasmodium falciparum remains the main culprit although cases with vivax malaria are on the rise. Severe malaria as defined by the WHO criteria has high rate of complications and mortality. In our study we recruited microscopy positive falciparum and vivax malaria patients. <b>Haematological</b> and biochemical <b>laboratory</b> investigations were carried out in recruited patients. Both parameters were found to be significantly derailed in falciparum cases as compared to vivax. A direct correlation has been observed between kidney function tests (serum creatinine,serum urea) and direct bilirubin levels across all cases of malaria. Hence these parameters can be used to identify and monitor the progress of cases of severe malaria as significant proportion of patients fulfilled the criteria of severe malaria in the cohort. ...|$|R

40|$|Molecular genetic assays for the {{detection}} of the JAK 2 V 617 F (c. 1849 G>T) and other pathogenetic mutations within JAK 2 exon 12 and MPL exon 10 are part of the routine diagnostic workup for patients presenting with erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis or otherwise suspected to have a myeloproliferative neoplasm. A wide choice of techniques are available for {{the detection}} of these mutations, leading to potential difficulties for clinical laboratories in deciding upon the most appropriate assay, which can lead to problems with inter-laboratory standardization. Here, we discuss the most important issues for a clinical diagnostic laboratory in choosing a technique, particularly for detection of the JAK 2 V 617 F mutation at diagnosis. The JAK 2 V 617 F detection assay should be both specific and sensitive enough to detect a mutant allele burden as low as 1 - 3 %. Indeed, the use of sensitive assays increases the detection rate of the JAK 2 V 617 F mutation within myeloproliferative neoplasms. Given their diagnostic relevance, it is also beneficial and relatively straightforward to screen JAK 2 V 617 F negative patients for JAK 2 exon 12 mutations (in the case of erythrocytosis) or MPL exon 10 mutations (thrombocytosis or myelofibrosis) using appropriate assays.

Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate changes in clinical chemistry and <b>haematological</b> <b>laboratory</b> test results during pregnancies of type 1 diabetics and to compare the results with changes during normal pregnancies. Methods: We studied 25 type 1 diabetic women with standard clinical chemistry and haematological blood-tests during pregnancy. Results: Haemoglobin, haematocrit, and erythrocyte number decreased until the 3 rd trimester and leucocytes and platelets did not change significantly. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate increased by over 200 %. Protein and albumin decreased until the 3 rd trimester to below the reference range. Urea did not change, creatinine decreased and uric acid increased within the reference range. AST and ALT remained within the reference range. Alkaline phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase increased until above the reference range. Cholesterol and triglycerides increased until the third trimester above results from normal pregnancies. Conclusion: A wide range of biochemistry and haematology laboratory values changed during diabetic pregnancy comparable to physiological pregnancies.

Method: A total of 261 healthy participants comprising 126 men (48 %) and 135 (52 %) women were enrolled in the southern part of Botswana, and immunological and <b>haematological</b> <b>laboratory</b> parameters were measured. Results: The mean age was 28. 8 (95 % Confidence Interval [CI] 27. 7 – 29. 8) years, with a median of 27 years and a range 18 – 66 years. The mean haemoglobin level was significantly lower for women (12. 4 g/dL; 95 % CI 12. 1 % – 12. 7 %) than men (15. 1 g/dL; 95 % CI 14. 9 % – 15. 3 %). The women’s haemoglobin reference values (9. 0 g/dL – 15. 0 g/dL) levels were lower than observed in predominantly White populations (12. 0 g/dL – 16. 0 g/dL), but comparable with regional consensus reference intervals (9. 5 g/dL – 15. 8 g/dL) recently defined for East and Southern Africa.

Patients and methods Gemcitabine 1, 000 mg/m 2 was given as a 30 min intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, 15 of a 28 -day cycle, cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 on day 1, and etoposide 100 mg/m 2 on days 1 (following cisplatin), 2 and 3. Major eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed non-small-cell lung cancer, measurable disease, Zubrod PS 0 - 2; no prior chemotherapy, no prior radiation of the measured lesion, and no CNS metastases. Results 146 patients were enrolled, 71 patients on gemcitabine and 75 patients on cisplatin-etoposide. Patient characteristics were well matched across both arms. Sixty-six gemcitabine patients and 72 cisplatin-etoposide patients were evaluable. Partial responses were seen in 12 gemcitabine patients (18. 2 %; 95 % CI: 9. 8 - 30) and 11 cisplatin-etoposide patients (15. 3 %; 95 % CI: 7. 9 - 25. 7). Early indications show no statistical differences between the two treatments with respect to time to disease progression or survival. <b>Haematological</b> and <b>laboratory</b> toxicity were moderate and manageable. However, hospitalisation because of neutropenic fever was required for 6 (8 %) cisplatin-etoposide patients but not for any gemcitabine patients.

This is a comparative cross-sectional study of newborn babies born to blood group 0 rhesus positive mothers in labour room of HUSM from October, 2000 to June, 2001. Specimens from cord blood of suitable babies were collected and investigated for haemoglobin, bilirubin, reticulocytes count, DAT, spherocytes count and NRBC per 100 WC. The results were analysed statistically. The clinical features and management data of ABO incompatible babies were taken from management file and correlation made with the cord's blood findings. The incidence and severity of ABO HDN were also estimated from the data. Altogether 85 babies ie 34 ABO incompatible and 51 ABO compatible. The haemoglobin, spherocytes count and DA T showed a statistically significant difference between ABO incompatible and ABO compatible babies. Clinically five babies of ABO incompatible noted to be jaundice with two of them received phototherapy but exchange transfusion was not needed in any of them. The incidence of ABO incompatible infants in HUSM is 15. 6 %. The incidence of ABO HDN is 2. 3 %. The incidence of ABO incompatible infants requiring phototherapy due to ABO HDN is 6. 7 % and the incidence of all infants requiring phototherapy due to ABO HDN is 0. 92 %. There is poor correlation between the cl inical features and laboratory findings. The cord blood tests therefore can not be recommended as method of early diagnosis of ABO HDN. The cord blood tests were not sensitive and specific probably due to mildness of ABO HDN in HUSM.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis was to explore the use of FT-IR spectroscopy, as a complementary clinical tool for <b>haematological</b> <b>laboratory</b> analysis. FT-IR spectra were measured from air-dried and frozen cell lines derived from lymphoma, lymphoid, myeloid leukaemia and normal and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia blood samples. Multivariate statistical {{analysis was used to}} extract important spectral information with the greatest discriminative power. Principal component fed linear discriminant spectral models have been tested with leave one out cross validation procedures. A preliminary unfiltered classification model using 50 frozen and air-dried samples correctly classified 54 % of 18556 spectra. The performance improved with the three cell line group datasets, with 71 % of 19903 spectra correctly classified. Furthermore, the use of the frozen spectra improved the performance of the three cell line group classification model considerably. Findings showed that 73. 3 % of 9920 spectra were correctly classified in the frozen datasets, whereas in the air-dried only 41. 5 % of 9983 spectra are correctly classified. Optimisation of the spectral models by selection of principal components, application of Savitsky-Golay filters and selecting spectra using standard deviation and absorption filter tool was investigated. Using the first 25 significant PCs, a 0 th derivative Savitsky-Golay filter and the absorbance filter tool on the frozen five cell line spectral dataset were shown to be the optimal parameters for constructing a classification model. When tested with leave one batch out cross validation 90 % of the spectra were correctly classified for the five cell line model. Blood component classification models tested with leave one batch out cross validation performed well. The whole blood model correctly classified 70 % of 1736 spectra, measured on 22 samples. The plasma model correctly classified 80. 6 % of 331 spectra and the buffy coat model correctly classified 99. 5 % of 1438 spectra. This demonstrated that the buffy coat (containing white blood cells) holds the key biochemical information for discrimination between the pathology of the blood samples. Partial least squares analysis has been demonstrated as a method to support whole blood count tests for real time prediction of cellular constituents. These findings demonstrate the potential of FT- IR spectroscopy as a clinical tool although more work is needed {{if it is to be}} applied in clinical practice.

40|$|Thesis (M. Med. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2008. Background: The homeopathic preparation, Traumeel S, {{has been}} used as a {{valuable}} alternative to conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for over 30 years. This antihomotoxic, anti-phlogistic drug has been widely used by sportsmen and women in the treatment of lesions and inflammatory processes which result from exercise-induced skeletal muscle microtrauma. Although numerous randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials have confirmed the efficacy of Traumeel S as an anti-inflammatory agent, there are few in vivo studies which have specifically investigated the mechanism by which Traumeel S is effective in reducing inflammatory response to exercise-induced muscle cell damage. Aim: To establish whether the administration of Traumeel S during the five days before participation and three days following participation, significantly attenuates the systemic markers of the inflammatory response, following a 90 -minute downhill running trial. Method: Twenty-four healthy athletes (14 men and 10 women), aged 20 - 50 years, were recruited for this study. Following baseline laboratory testing and familiarisation with the treadmill as well as a field test, subjects were matched according to gender, BMI, training age, training status, peak performance and foot strike patterns and randomised into Traumeel (TRS) and Control (PLAC) groups in a placebo-controlled, double-blind design. One Traumeel S or Placebo tablet was ingested three times per day for five days prior to and three days following a 90 -minute exercise trial on a downhill (- 6 % gradient) at 75 % V 02 max- Blood samples were collected prior to the 90 -minute trial (PRE), immediately after the trial (IPE) and 24 hours (24 PE), 48 hours (48 PE) and 72 hours (72 PE) following the trial. Each subject was also requested to complete a training record prior to the trial and keep a record of the daily symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) both at rest (general pain) and during walking (daily living). Full blood counts (FBC), serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Cortisol concentrations were measured using standard <b>haematological</b> <b>laboratory</b> procedures and serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was determined by immunoturbidimetric assay. Sandwich ELISA's were used to determine myeloperoxidase (MPO) and plasma interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) concentrations. All results obtained were adjusted for changes in plasma volume as calculated from the red blood cell indices. Results: Mean ± SD characteristics of the gender-matched subjects in the experimental (TRS) and placebo-control (PLAC) groups did not differ significantly in terms of BMI, age, % body fat, FVC, FEVi, training age and status, foot strike pattern or peak running performance, maximal Heart Rate, VE, V 02 peak> RER, RPE during the maximal exercise test (p > 0. 05). This indicated that the randomised pairs were well matched. The 90 -minute downhill running protocol resulted in significant elevations in total circulating white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil, CK, LDH, Cortisol, CPR, MPO and IL- 6 concentrations (p 0. 05) over the 5 time points. At 24 PE, MPO concentrations were significantly higher in the TRS group than in the PLAC group (p = 0. 03). The lower mean ± SD post-trial DOMS scores reported by the TRS group were not significantly different from those reported by the PLAC group (p > 0. 05). Conclusion: Although the findings of this study did not identify differences in circulating CK, LDH, Cortisol, CPR and IL- 6 concentrations between the TRS and PLAC groups, the elevated MPO concentration at 24 PE did provide preliminary novel evidence of enhanced activation of neutrophil oxidative burst activity following exercise-induced muscle damage which is hypothesized to accelerate the recovery process...|$|E
40|$|Dysfunctional uterine bleedings (DUB) are {{all these}} {{abnormal}} uterine bleedings (AUB) after exclusion ofanatomical and organic lesions as well as systemic and iatrogenic changes and pregnancy. In the presented paperspecial {{attention was paid to}} the diagnostic and therapeutic treatment in an outpatient clinic, including thepatient interaction in the process. State-of the-art knowledge on the menstrual cycle pathophysiology and DUBhas been presented basing on the angiogenesis model. The participation of many biologically active substances(including among others: kinins, endothelins, coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, prostanoids and platelet factors) in breakdown and regenerative processes within functional layers of the endometrium has been described. The regulative role of steroid hormones (estrogens, progesterone, activin-follistatin) was taken into consideration. The carefully taken medical history, the proper selection of diagnostic tools followed by the discussionwith the patient on the pharmacological or, if desired, surgical options constitutes the whole treatment processin the case of troublesome DUB. In the paper new diagnostic and therapeutic methods including a wide rangeof scanning techniques, endometrial sampling and endometrial resection as well as ablation techniques havebeen presented. Special attention was paid to outpatient clinic methods (e. g. Pipella, minihysteroscopy, thermalablation, photodynamic ablation and cryoablation). The pharmaceutical treatment depends on the intensity ofbleeding (acute or chronic) and consists of estrogens, oral, transdermal and vaginal contraceptives, IUD system,progestin-oestrogen injections, Danazol and GnRH.

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates {{the effects of}} oral {{administration}} of taurine on haematological parameters in normal wistar rats. Tissue oxidative stress is implicated in pathogenesis of various clinical disorders and antioxidant taurine is emerging as prophylactic and therapeutic agent. However, studies on effects of taurine on normal physiology are not reported in literature. Normal saline (Group I) or 5 % taurine in normal saline was administered in dose of 50 mg (Group II), 250 mg (Group III) or 500 mg kg - 1 of b. wt. (Group IV) through intragastric intubation for 60 days. The blood cell counts, haemoglobin content, packed cell volume, blood indices, bleeding time and clotting time were estimated using routine <b>laboratory</b> <b>haematological</b> techniques. Neutrophil’s phagocytic activity was determined by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test; serum lysozyme activity was estimated colorimetrically by the degree to lyse bacterial cell suspension and serum taurine levels were estimated by HPLC fluorimetric technique. Platelet count showed a decrease in Group III and IV when compared with Group I and II (p< 0. 001). Mean corpuscular haemoglobin of Group III and IV are significantly lowered when compared to Group I (p< 0. 001). A statistically significant decrease was observed in the {{mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration}} between Group I and Group IV (p< 0. 001). The neutrophil percentage of Group II, Group III and Group IV showed a significant increase over Group I (p< 0. 001). The percentage of lymphocytes showed a significant decrease in Group II, III and Group IV when compared to Group I (p< 0. 001). Neutrophil’s phagocytic activity is significantly lowered in Group III and IV when compared to Group I (p< 0. 001). The serum lysozyme activity of Group III and IV showed a significant increase over Group I (at p< 0. 001). From the present study it may be concluded that long term oral administration of taurine affects normal haematological functions...|$|R
40|$|Orgaaniset- eli eloperäiset pölyt ovat tavallisia elintarviketeollisuuden ja maatalouden altisteita. Ne aiheuttavat yleisesti hengitysteiden ja ihon ärsytystä ja allergioita. Näiden pölyjen aiheuttamaa pitkäaikaista tulehdusta ei ilmeisesti kuitenkaan seuraa lisääntynyt riski sairastua syöpään, vaan ne saattavat jopa suojata joiltakin syöviltä. Altistuminen orgaanisille pölyille ei näyttäisi olevan merkittävä syövän riskitekijä. Eläin- ja kasviperäisille pölyille altistuminen saattaa jopa suojata keuhkosyövältä ja mahdollisesti joiltakin muilta syöviltä. Maanviljelijöillä todettiin alentunut riski sairastua keuhkopussin, maksan, kurkunpään, keuhkojen, nenän, ruokatorven ja virtsarakon syöpään. Home- ja bakteeripölylle altistumisen todettiin olevan yhteydessä alentuneeseen riskiin sairastua keuhkosyöpään. Eri ammatteja tarkasteltaessa todettiin viitteellisesti lisääntyneitä syöpäriskejä seuraavasti: keuhkosyöpä leipureilla, kurkunpäänsyöpä mylläreillä ja huulisyöpä maanviljelijöillä. Eri orgaanisia pölyjä tutkittaessa todettiin lisääntyneitä syöpäriskejä seuraavasti: puupöly ja nenäsyöpä, keuhkosyöpä ja keuhkopussinsyöpä; kasvipöly ja kurkunpääsyöpä, home- ja bakteeripöly ja kohdunkaulansyöpä ja huulisyöpä. Työterveyslaitoksen ja Suomen Syöpärekisterin hankkeen Työperäinen altistuminen ja syöpävaara Suomessa osana selvitettiin Suomen Syöpärekisterin syöpätietokannasta elintarviketeollisuuden työntekijöiden ja maanviljelijöiden kaikkien syöpien esiintyvyys, jota verrattiin koko väestön syövän esiintyvyyteen. Hankkeen tarkoituksena on löytää työperäisen syövän riskiammatteja ja syövälle altistavia tekijöitä, jotta työskentelyolosuhteiden parantamista voidaan kohdentaa oikein. Tarkastelun kohteena oli altistuminen seuraaville orgaanisille pölyille: eläinpöly, kasvipöly, jauhopöly, puupöly, paperipöly, tekstiilipöly, nahkapöly, synteettinen polymeeripöly, homepöly ja bakteeripöly. Tässä tarkastelussa mukaan tuli myös muita ammatteja mm. tekstiili- ja rakennusalalta. Työterveyslaitoksen työaltistematriisia (FINJEM) käyttäen arvioitiin näille orgaanisille pölyille altistuneiden työntekijöiden määrää ja altistumisen tasoa eri ammateissa ja altistumisen vaikutusta eri syöpien esiintyvyyteen.

Organic dusts of vegetable, {{animal or}} {{microbial}} origin are major causes of occupational {{diseases of the}} respiratory tract. There is inconclusive evidence concerning the risk of cancer from organic dusts, and only limited knowledge on inhalatory exposure to some organic dusts and cancer, e. g., bacteria and moulds. The food industry and agriculture have significant occupational organic dust exposure. The aims {{of the present study}} were: 1. To study the risk of respiratory cancer among workers in the food industry and agriculture, whose exposure is mainly inhalatory. 2. To generate a hypothesis concerning other cancers among food industry workers and agricultural workers, and to discover new associations between occupational agents and cancer. 3. To describe the cancer risk pattern of Finnish farmers and to define the type of farm as a potential determinant of the observed risk ratios. 4. To study whether changes in the type of farm account for alterations in lung cancer risk. A low prevalence of cancer has been associated especially with dairy farming; discontinuing dairy farming might thus increase the risk of lung cancer. 5. To assess the association between cancer and occupational exposure to bacteria and moulds in Finland. The presumption was that exposure to biological dust dominated by moulds and Gram-positive bacteria increases the risk of respiratory cancer due to mycotoxin and bacterial exotoxin, and that, conversely, exposure dominated by Gram-negative bacteria decreases respiratory cancer risk due to the presence of endotoxin. 6. To study whether inhalatory exposure to moulds increases the risk of cancers of the liver, oesophagus, upper respiratory tract, and urinary tract. The computerized registries of Statistics Finland (census, occupations, and death certificates), Finnish Cancer Registry (cancer cases), Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (Finnish job-exposure matrix (FINJEM)), Finnish National Public Health Institute (life-style data) and Farm Registry of Finland (farm data) were linked based on either individual or group level key variables. The cohort in the studies utilizing FINJEM comprised all economically active Finns born between 1 January 1906 and 31 December 1945 who participated in the national population census on 31 December 1970 (667, 121 men; 513, 110 women). Statistics Finland maintains and updates the census files for vital status to allow exact person-year calculation. Data on the main occupation in 1970 were obtained from the Population Census records (Statistics Finland 1974). The socioeconomic status (SES) of each subject was based on the subject's occupation. In our analyses, the SES was categorized as follows: farmers, higher white-collar, clerical, skilled blue-collar, and unskilled workers. The occupational exposures of the cohort were estimated by using a job-exposure matrix, FINJEM. FINJEM covers the major occupational exposures in Finland from 1945 onwards by occupation and calendar time. FINJEM characterizes exposure by the proportion of exposed persons (P) and the average level of exposure (L) among the exposed persons in each occupation. The estimates are based on exposure measurements, hazard surveys, and the assessments of occupational hygienists. P and L are assessed in FINJEM quantitatively for chemical, biological and physical agents. Major changes in exposure over time are taken into account enabling estimations of cumulative exposure (CE). FINJEM also includes estimates of alcohol consumption and smoking prevalence by occupation. The Finnish Cancer Registry (FCR) has collected data on cancer cases diagnosed in Finland since 1953. All physicians, hospitals and other institutions, and all pathologic, cytological and <b>haematological</b> <b>laboratories</b> in the country must notify the FCR of all cancer cases that come to their attention. In addition, Statistics Finland annually provides a computerized file on all death certificates in which cancer is mentioned. The expected number of cancer cases was calculated by multiplying the number of person-years lived by persons in that occupation (or in exposure) with the cancer incidence rate of the referent population (or un-exposed population). Exposure for each birth cohort was assumed to start in the year when {{the average age of the}} birth cohort was 20, and to end in the mid-year of the observation period, or at 65 years of age, whichever came first. In internal comparison within an occupation, the employees within an occupation were divided into groups of cumulative exposure of un-exposed (none) and exposed (low, medium, high) using time, and P and L data as the base for grouping. In selected cancers, regression analysis was performed adjusting for smoking, social class, and alcohol consumption (laryngeal cancer), asbestos and quartz dust (lung cancer). A total of 2, 526 incident cancer cases were found among Finnish food industry workers. Among male food industry workers, elevated risks were observed for pancreatic cancer (standardized incidence ratio (SIR) 1. 5, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 1 - 2. 0) and kidney cancer (SIR 1. 5, CI 1. 2 - 1. 9). There was an excess of lung cancer among female bakers (SIR 1. 4, CI 1. 0 - 1. 9) and laryngeal cancer among male grain millers (SIR 2. 6, CI 1. 1 - 5. 4). A total of 20, 426 incident cases of respiratory cancer were found among employees exposed to one or more types of eight organic dusts. A slightly elevated risk of nasal cancer (SIR 1. 4, CI 0. 8 - 2. 4) was observed among men exposed to wood dust. Men exposed to plant dust (mainly grain millers) had an elevated SIR of laryngeal cancer in the high exposure class (SIR 3. 6, CI 1. 3 - 7. 7). Men exposed to wood dust had an elevated SIR for lung cancer, but only in the low exposure class (SIR 1. 1, CI 1. 0 - 1. 2). Women exposed to wood dust had an elevated SIR for mesotheliomas in the low exposure class (SIR 4. 6, CI 1. 3 - 11. 7) and some excess in the medium exposure category. Men with the highest occupational exposure to moulds and bacteria had a reduced relative risk for lung cancer (risk ratio (RR) 0. 7, 95 % confidence interval 0. 6 - 0. 9 for moulds and RR 0. 9 (CI 0. 8 - 1. 0) for bacteria) as compared with non-exposed men. Women in the highest mould and bacteria exposure category had RRs of 3. 1 (CI 1. 0 - 9. 2) and 2. 6 (CI 1. 5 - 4. 7) for cervical cancer, respectively. The respective RRs for lip cancer in the highest mould and bacteria exposure category among men and women combined were 2. 4 (CI 1. 2 - 5. 1) and 1. 6 (CI 1. 2 - 2. 2). The farmer study cohort comprised all farmers on 31 December 1978, who were included in the Finnish Farm Registry. The continuation of farming activity was checked from the 1990 and 1994 Farm Registry data. The overall cancer incidence among farmers was lower than in the general population. The only significantly elevated SIR was that for lip cancer. The lowest rates among farmers who continued farming were in mesothelioma and cancers of the liver, larynx, lung, nose, oesophagus and urinary bladder. Permanent beef and dairy farmers had the lowest SIRs for overall cancer. In 1978 those dairy farmers who had changed over to crop farming had a slightly higher overall cancer incidence than those who continued dairy farming. Occupational exposure is unlikely to be a major risk factor for cancer among Finnish food industry workers. Exposure to organic dusts is unlikely to be a major risk factor of respiratory cancer, with the possible exception of wood dust in the causation of nasal cancer. We found some evidence that exposure to grain dust might elevate the risk of laryngeal cancer. Exposure to either moulds or bacteria is unlikely to be a major risk factor of cancer, even though increased risk was observed for some cancer types. The cancer incidence of Finnish farmers was significantly below the national average. The hypothesis that exposure to textile dust and plant and animal dust might decrease the risk of lung cancer was supported. The finding that lung cancer risk was low among dairy farmers but increased along with a change to other types of farming offers some support to the hypothesis that endotoxin exposure may decrease cancer risk. Both the present results as well as earlier ones related to lung cancer need to be interpreted with caution, because even after adjustment for the strongest confounding factor, i. e., smoking, there is a possibility of residual confounding...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Med. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2008. Background: Downhill running {{involves}} eccentric contractions of the gluteal, quadriceps, hamstring and calf {{muscles and}} the lengthening of muscle fibres as they contract. Several {{studies have demonstrated}} that this type of prolonged eccentrically biased exercise induces tissue damage and subsequent enhancement of an inflammatory response. Traumeel® S (Heel GmbH, Baden-Baden, Germany) is a homeopathic-complex used to treat trauma and inflammatory processes that is sold as an over the counter remedy in pharmacies. Although the antiinflammatory and analgesic effects of Traumeel® S have been demonstrated in selected clinical trials as well as in in vitro experimental models, little is known of its scientific mechanisms of action. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} establish whether administration of Traumeel® S five days before and three days after a 90 -minute downhill treadmill run at 75 % V 02 peak significantly changes systemic markers of the inflammatory response. These are to include blood-borne concentrations of Cortisol and examples of selected T-helperrcell cytokines, T-helper 2 -cell cytokines, chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines during the three days following the 90 -minute downhill run. Method: This study was designed as a double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which matched subjects were randomised to Traumeel (TRAU) and Placebo (PLAC) pairs and exposed to two 90 -minute downhill running trials. Twenty subjects (12 men, 8 women) aged between 20 and 50 years, fully complied with all inclusion criteria set for the study. Following baseline laboratory and field testing, they were matched according to gender, body mass index (BMI), training age, training status, peak running performance and foot-strike patterns and randomized into TRAU and PLAC groups. One Traumeel® S tablet was ingested three times per day for five days prior to and three days following a 90 -minute downhill run on a treadmill at a - 6 % gradient and at a speed eliciting 75 % V 02 peak on a level gradient. Blood samples were obtained immediately before the 90 -minute trial (PRE), immediately after the trial (IPE) and 24 hours (24 PE), 48 hours (48 PE) and 72 hours (72 PE) following the trial. Each subject was also requested to complete a training record prior to the trial and keep a record of the daily symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) both at rest (general pain) and while walking (daily living). Full blood counts, serum creatine kinase (CK) and Cortisol concentrations were determined using standard <b>haematological</b> <b>laboratory</b> procedures. A sandwich ELISA was used to determine plasma interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) concentrations. A commercial bead-array kit was used to conduct flow cytometric analysis of Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), Interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFa), and Interleukin- 12 p 70 (IL- 12 p 70) concentrations. Results: Paired student Mests indicate that the mean ± SEM of the two groups was not significantly different (p 0. 05). Blood creatine kinase was, however, significantly higher in the TRAU group at 24 PE (p < 0. 05). The post-trial DOMS scores reported by the TRAU group over the 3 -day post-exercise recovery period were also significantly lower in the TRAU group at 24 PE (p = 0. 03). Conclusion: Despite a faster running speed and higher post trial CK concentration in the TRAU group following the 90 -minute downhill run, statistically significant differences in circulating stress hormone, and cytokine concentrations (IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, TNFa and IL- 12 p 70) between the TRAU and PLAC groups, were not identified. Delayed onset muscle soreness was also significantly lower in the TRAU group at 24 hours post trial (p = 0. 03). While these findings would support attenuation of the post-exercise inflammatory response by Traumeel® S, further work is required to verify this possibility...|$|E
40|$|My Bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} the {{examination}} of celiac disease in connection to osteoporosis. The aim of the thesis was to specify the level of antidotes against tissue transglutaminase in the class IgA and IgG in the serum with osteoporosis diagnosed patients, to interpret, {{based on the results}} of the study, possible link between osteoporosis and celiac disease as well as to compare the outcome with scientific data. I focused on the present knowledge of osteoporosis and celiac disease in the first part. As for celiac disease, I described its history and characteristics. I also paid attention to diagnostics of celiac disease with the assistance of laboratory serological tests ELISA. I mentioned the free-gluten diet treatment after that. As regards osteoporosis, I described its history, symptoms, forms, perils and complications which the disease causes. I conducted the methodical part of my work in the biochemical <b>haematological</b> <b>laboratory</b> Stafila where I work, with its seat in České Budějovice. As for measurements, I took them in the department of microbiology, where immunologic tests are also taken. I carried out the screening of celiac disease from serum, namely the determination of antidotes against tissue transglutaminase in the class IgA and IgG, with the aid of ELISA - a sandwich method. I took measurements with 58 osteoporosis diagnosed patients. I obtained the sera thanks to the supervisor of my thesis Mrs. Marie Ládová, who is at the head of an osteological outpatient department in České Budějovice. I stated the serological markers of celiac disease with the assistance of enzymatic immunoanalysis conducted on automatic analyzer Nexgen Four, which was provided by the firm Test-Line. I describe the analyzer, its specification, checking and calibration of the gadget together with determination checks in this part of the thesis. Additionally, there is described the principle of the method ELISA- sandwich, which is non-competitive enzymatic immunoanalysis. At the end of the section there is depicted the methodical procedure of my work, the preparation of working solutions and checks, the preparation and dilution of samples for analysis and working procedure for semiquantitative interpretation with positivity index and for quantitative interpretation U/ml. I continued with my own measurements. while respecting standard operations procedures of the laboratory Stafila, a limited liability company. The results of my measurements are processed in the third part of the thesis. The acquired results are given in a table: quantitative interpretation of the antidote against tTg IgA and IgG (U/ml) level in the sera of the osteoporosis diagnosed patients. Then I presented a graph interpreting the proportional relation of the antidote against tTg IgA and IgG levels in the sera of the osteoporosis diagnosed patients. There are included calibration graphs for tissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG and tables of the obtained data of checks for the methods in the results. 3 out of the 58 examined samples of osteoporotic patients were positive, they had the level of antibodies higher than 22 U/ml. One of the samples had marginal figures, which means it had the antidotes against tTg IgA an IgG between 18 and 22 U/ml. Positive results were found with patients born in 1976 and 1978. A patient born in 1962 appeared to have a marginal result. The acquired antidote figures against tissue transglutaminase in the class IgA and IgG are presented proportionally in the graph 1. 3 out of the 58 measured samples were positive, which represents 5 %, and 1 sample was marginal, which is 2 %. My analysis is based on the availability of the examined material and the potential of our laboratory. Celiac disease is an illness which was not paid much attention to in the past.

40|$|Published in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2004; Issue 4 at www. interscience. wiley. comBackground: Postpartum anaemia is {{associated}} with breathlessness, tiredness, palpitations and maternal infections. Blood transfusions or iron supplementation {{have been used in}} the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia. Recently other anaemia treatments, in particular erythropoietin therapy, have also been used. Objectives: To assess the clinical effects of treatments for postpartum anaemia, including oral, intravenous or subcutaneous iron/folate supplementation and erythropoietin administration, and blood transfusion. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (30 May 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2003), EMBASE (1980 to March 2003), Current Contents and ACP Journal Club (from inception to March 2003). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing therapy for postpartum iron deficiency anaemia (oral, intravenous or subcutaneous administration of iron, folate, erythropoietin or blood transfusion) with placebo, another treatment or no treatment. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results: Six included RCTs involving 411 women described treatment with erythropoietin or iron as their primary interventions. No RCTs were identified that assessed treatment with blood transfusion. Few outcomes relating to clinical maternal and neonatal factors were reported: studies focused largely on surrogate outcomes such as haematological indices. Overall, the methodological quality of the included RCTs was reasonable; however, their usefulness in this review is restricted by the interventions and outcomes reported. When compared with iron therapy only, erythropoietin increased the likelihood of lactation at discharge from hospital (1 RCT, n = 40; relative risk (RR) 1. 90, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 21 to 2. 98). No apparent effect on need for blood transfusions was found, when erythropoietin plus iron was compared to treatment with iron only (2 RCTs, n = 100; RR 0. 20, 95 % CI 0. 01 to 3. 92), although the RCTs may have been of insufficient size to rule out important clinical differences. Haematological indices (haemoglobin and haemocrit) showed some increases when erythropoietin was compared to iron only, iron and folate, but not when compared with placebo. Authors' conclusions: There is some limited evidence of favourable outcomes for treatment of postpartum anaemia with erythropoietin. However, most of the available literature focuses on <b>laboratory</b> <b>haematological</b> indices, rather than clinical outcomes. Further high-quality trials assessing the treatment of postpartum anaemia with iron supplementation and blood transfusions are required. Future trials may also examine the significance of the severity of anaemia in relation to treatment, and an iron-rich diet as an intervention. Plain language summary: Erythropoietin, a hormone, may help to treat women who develop anaemia after giving birth, but there may be rare adverse events. Women with anaemia after childbirth may feel tired and breathless and are at risk of infection. Traditional treatments include iron supplementation and blood transfusion for severe anaemia. A hormone, erythropoietin, may help improve iron levels in the blood and the woman's ability to lactate. However, rare adverse events (damage to red blood cells) have been reported. No studies examined the effects of oral iron supplementation alone, the most common treatment for this type of anaemia, or blood transfusions as treatments for women with anaemia after childbirth. More research, particularly of simple interventions such as oral iron supplementation, is required...|$|R
40|$|Aim  Papp et al. (N Engl J Med 2012; 366 : 1181 - 9) and Leonardi et al. (N Engl J Med 2012; 366 : 1190 - 9) {{respectively}} {{assessed the}} efficacy {{and safety of}} brodalumab (AMG 827), a human monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin (IL) - 17 RA, the receptor of IL- 17 A and ixekizumab (LY 2439821), a humanized anti-IL- 17 monoclonal antibody {{for the treatment of}} moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Setting and design  In these phase II, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging studies, 198 patients with severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis [Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)  ≥  12, body surface area (BSA)  ≥  10] were enrolled in Papp et al. between December 2009 and April 2010 and 142 patients in Leonardi et al. between April 2010 and March 2011. Study exposure  In Papp et al., patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis were randomly assigned to receive placebo or brodalumab at a dose of 70, 140 or 210  mg, administered subcutaneously on day 1 and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, or at a dose of 280  mg administered subcutaneously on day 1 and at weeks 4 and 8. In Leonardi et al., patients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous injections of placebo or 10, 25, 75 or 150  mg of ixekizumab at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16  weeks, followed by a 4 -week follow-up period. Outcomes  In both studies the PASI, static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), adverse events, and routine <b>haematological</b> and <b>laboratory</b> values were analysed. Additionally in Papp et al. the BSA and Medical Outcomes Study 36 -item short-form health survey, and in Leonardi et al. the joint pain visual analogue scale (VAS), itch severity VAS, Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) and the Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) were also measured. Primary outcome measures  At week 12, in Papp et al. and Leonardi et al. : (A) The percentage improvement in PASI. In Leonardi et al. (and in Papp et al. as one of the secondary outcomes) : (B) The percentage of patients who achieved a reduction in the PASI by at least 75 % (PASI 75) over baseline. Results  Primary endpoints: (A) At week 12 in Papp et al., the mean improvements in PASI were significantly greater in the 140, 210 and 280  mg brodalumab groups than in the 70  mg brodalumab group (85 · 9 %, 86 · 3 % and 76 · 0 %, respectively, vs. 45 · 0 %; P  <  0 · 001); in addition, the mean improvement in PASI was significantly greater in each brodalumab group than in the placebo group (16 · 0 %; P  <  0 · 001). (At week 16 lower but still significant percentages compared with placebo were seen). In Leonardi et al., the mean improvements in PASI of the 10, 25, 75 and 150  mg ixekizumab groups are not reported. Significant differences between the two highest dose groups and the placebo group were seen as early as 1  week in PASI. (B) At week 12 in Papp et al., the percentages of patients with PASI 75 were 33 % in the 70  mg, 77 % in the 140  mg, 82 % in the 210  mg and 67 % in the 280  mg brodalumab group. The percentages of patients with a 50 %, 75 %, 90 % or 100 % improvement in PASI at week 12 were significantly higher among patients who received brodalumab (taking into account all doses) than among patients who received placebo. The authors do not give an explanation for the lower improvements at week 16. In Leonardi et al., the PASI 75 occurred in significantly more patients in the 25  mg (76 · 7 %), 75  mg (82 · 8 %) and 150  mg (82 · 1 %) ixekizumab groups vs. placebo (7 · 7 %; P  <  0 · 001). No significant difference was seen for the 10  mg group. Significant differences between the 150  mg group and the placebo group were seen as early as 2  weeks in PASI 75. Differences were sustained through 20  weeks for all clinical measures in the ixekizumab study. Secondary endpoints: At week 12, in Papp et al., significant decreases of BSA, sPGA and DLQI were also seen. In Leonardi et al., significantly higher percentages of patients in the three highest ixekizumab dose groups had an sPGA score of 0 (clear of disease) or of 0 or 1 (minimal disease) for each dose and score group vs. placebo (P  <  0 · 05). Significant reductions in the mean ± SD DLQI scores were detected at 8  weeks in the 150  mg ixekizumab group (- 7 · 8  ±  5 · 7), the 75  mg ixekizumab group (- 8 · 5  ±  5 · 1) and the 25  mg ixekizumab group (- 7 · 1  ±  6 · 5) as compared with placebo (- 2 · 4  ±  4 · 4) for all comparisons (P  <  0 · 001). In addition, at 16  weeks, significantly more patients had a DLQI score of 0 in the 150, 75 and 25  mg ixekizumab groups (39 · 3 %, 37 · 9 % and 31 · 0 %, respectively) as compared with placebo (0 %) for all comparisons (P  <  0 · 05). In Leonardi et al., significant reductions were seen in the PSSI, in the NAPSI and in the itch severity (VAS scores). Significant reductions from baseline of the joint pain VAS were also observed in the 150  mg ixekizumab group at 12  weeks, and this reduction was sustained through 20  weeks. At week 16 : with respect to the other secondary efficacy endpoints and patient-reported outcomes, significant improvements in scores were seen compared with placebo, but some of these differences were lower than observed at week 12. Safety  Papp et al. summarized that during the first 12  weeks of the trial, 68 % of the patients in the 70  mg brodalumab group, 69 % (140  mg), 82 % (210  mg), 73 % (280  mg) and 62 % in the placebo group had at least one adverse event. Although the authors mentioned only three serious adverse events, four were reported during the study: renal colic (70  mg brodalumab group), two patients with grade 3 asymptomatic neutropenia (210  mg brodalumab group; Papp et al. clarified that only one of these episodes was a serious adverse event) and an ectopic pregnancy in one patient in the placebo group. Leonardi et al. reported that there were no serious adverse events in any group. The frequency of adverse events was similar between the combined ixekizumab groups and the placebo group. A few patients were withdrawn from the trial due to adverse events including hypertriglyceridaemia (placebo group), peripheral oedema (10  mg ixekizumab), hypersensitivity (10  mg ixekizumab) and urticaria (25  mg ixekizumab). Conclusions  Papp et al. and Leonardi et al. concluded that brodalumab and ixekizumab, respectively, significantly improved plaque psoriasis in 12 -week, phase II studies. For difficult-to-treat areas such as the scalp and nails, significant differences from placebo were observed with ixekizumab treatment. These trials were not large enough or of long enough duration to ascertain uncommon adverse events or to assess the risk of infection or cardiovascular event...|$|R
