[...] "I realize now that I was in a sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of keeping my sanity intact while waiting <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> to grow up and the freedom door to open", she recalled. Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University. She was an English professor at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences—later the College of Arts and Letters.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{was unsure}} {{if he was}} mature {{enough to make a}} film about the Holocaust, and the project {{remained}} [...] "on [...] guilty conscience". Spielberg tried to pass the project to director Roman Polanski, who turned it down. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Kraków Ghetto. Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama The Pianist (2002). Spielberg also offered the film to Sydney Pollack and Martin Scorsese, who was attached to direct Schindler's List in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as [...] "I'd given away a chance to do something <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> and family about the Holocaust." [...] Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the 1991 remake of Cape Fear instead. Billy Wilder expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom died in the Holocaust.|$|E
500|$|Mike Thompson {{discovered}} in a poll taken in March 1977 that women in Dade County opposed repealing the measure two to one; they saw their gay friends as relatively harmless. Save Our Children's strategy, therefore, worked to prove that homosexuals were amoral, promiscuous, and defiant of traditional gender roles, {{and that they were}} a specific danger to children. Bryant took this strategy as a crusade, delivering speeches that intoned that Dade County's passing of the ordinance [...] "guts the law {{on the side of the}} unrighteous. If homosexuals are allowed to change the law in their favor, why not prostitutes, thieves, or murderers?" [...] She specifically connected homosexuals with child molesters, saying [...] "Some of the stories I could tell you of child recruitment and child abuse by homosexuals would turn your stomach." [...] Bryant resented the media depiction of her as hateful, saying that her inspiration came [...] "out of love—not only love for God's commandment and His word, but love <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> and yours. Yes, and even love for all sinners—even homosexuals." ...|$|E

In June 1993, Mallya married his current wife Rekha, whom he had known since childhood, and together they have two daughters, Leanna and Tanya. Rekha was previously married twice, and also has a daughter and son, Leila and Kabir, from a previous marriage. Mallya adopted Rekha's daughter Leila. On the subject of raising his children, Mallya said [...] "My children are very dear to me. I am responsible as a father to play an active role in determining their future." [...] However, he also said [...] "I wasn't a hands-on father. I hired good nannies <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> and left it to their expertise." [...] In contrast with Vijay Mallya's flamboyant lifestyle, his wife Rekha has maintained a relatively private personal life and has said she just prefers to spend her time with her daughters.|$|E
2500|$|During his career, he starred as a voice {{actor in}} several {{animated}} films. His voice {{role as the}} Genie in the animated, musical fantasy film, Aladdin (1992) was written specifically for Williams. The film's directors stated that they took a risk by writing the role, and successfully convinced him to take it. Through approximately 30 hours of tape, Williams was able to improvise much of his dialogue and impersonated dozens of celebrity voices, including Ed Sullivan, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Groucho Marx, Rodney Dangerfield, William F. Buckley, Peter Lorre, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Arsenio Hall. At first, Williams refused to take the role {{since it was a}} Disney movie, and he did not want the studio profiting by selling toys and novelty items based on the movie. He accepted the role with certain conditions: [...] "I'm doing it basically because I {{want to be part of}} this animation tradition. I want something <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>children.</b> One deal is, I just don't want to sell anything — as in Burger King, as in toys, as in stuff." [...] The film went on to become one of his most recognized and best loved roles, and was the highest-grossing film of 1992, winning numerous awards, including a Golden Globe for Williams; his performance as the Genie led the way for other animated films to incorporate actors with more star power for voice acting roles.|$|E

2500|$|The Liberals {{lost the}} federal {{election}} of May 1979 to a minority Conservative government led by Joe Clark. When Pierre Trudeau regained power in February 1980, he appointed Chrétien Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. In this role, he was {{a major force in}} the 1980 Quebec referendum, being one of the main federal representatives [...] "on the ground" [...] during the campaign. His fiery and emotional speeches would enthrall federalist crowds with his blunt warnings of the consequences of separation. During the 1980 referendum, Chrétien fiercely fought behind the scenes with the leader of the Quebec Liberals, Claude Ryan, who served as the chairman of the non committee about the best course to follow, with Ryan favoring a more Quebec nationalist message as opposed to Chrétien's unabashed Canadian nationalist message. In his speeches, Chrétien boosted the first white men to see the Prairies and the Rocky mountains had been the French-Canadian voyaguers and Coureur des bois in the 17th and 18th centuries, saying the Rockies and the Great Plains were part of French Canada's heritage, and asked how could the Québécois ever give up their heritage. Chrétien praised the great French fur traders like Pierre-Esprit Radisson, Médard des Groseilliers, and La Vérendrye who ventured west, saying what they had found belonged to all of French Canada, and often ended his speeches with the remark [...] "I want them [...] <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> and grandchildren!", which frequently brought his audiences to tears. Chrétien delivered an average of 6 or 7 speeches a day during the 1980 referendum all across Quebec and always managed to work in a local reference in every speech.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{alleged that}} Jackson showed pornography to children at Neverland, including the accuser and his brother. [...] The raids on Neverland produced {{an accumulation of}} ten years' worth of heterosexual adult magazines such as Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler along with various heterosexual pornographic videos and websites on his computer. The prosecution alleged these were used for grooming young victims. [...] Brett Barnes and Wade Robson, two {{men who had been}} friends with Jackson since childhood, testified that they had not been [...] "aware that [...] possessed sexually explicit material" [...] until the trial. There were also a few books seized (from a library of thousands) that the prosecution suggested were evidence of homosexuality and/or pedophilia. [...] Boys Will Be Boys included pictures of boys, many naked, in various non-sexual activities such as climbing a tree or sitting on a bench. The book had an inscription reading, [...] "To Michael: From your fan. Love XXXOOO Rhonda – 1983, Chicago." [...] Wade Robson testified he considered Boys Will Be Boys [...] "not a pornographic book," [...] and said he would not be concerned about its owner being in the same bed with a 12-year-old. Another book, The Boy: A Photographic Essay, was inscribed, [...] "Look at the true spirit of happiness and joy in these boys' faces. This is the spirit of boyhood, a life I never had and will always dream of. This is the life I want <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>children.</b> MJ." [...] The book contained pictures of boys in various situations by different photographers, including pictures taken during the filming of the 1963 Lord of the Flies film and showed the boys on the set, usually clothed but sometimes nude, playing in the sand, reading comic books, and having pillow fights. The only book depicting male sex acts was a rare, out-of-print book called A Sexual Study of Man which featured many images of adult men engaged in all kinds of homosexual intercourse. [...] Robson said he would be concerned if the book's owner were to share his bed with a boy, but amended that he would not mind if he considered the total picture of all the material in question. [...] Robson testified that he believed Jackson had a [...] "sexual interest in women," [...] and that he had never seen [...] "anything that suggested pedophilia" [...] at Neverland. [...] Jackson's multiple residences were searched numerous times by various agencies over a period of days, without any child pornography ever being found. The FBI analyzed sixteen computers and found [...] "nothing notable" [...] contained in their files.|$|E
