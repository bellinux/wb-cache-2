40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of fresh mortars {{is a key}} characteristic since it determines the material’s workability, having as well a great inﬂuence on the hardened product’s ﬁnal characteristics. Portland cement substitution with lamp glass waste (DRL – mercury vapour lamps and LB – fluorescent tubes) in concrete has {{a significant effect on}} strength performance and workability. In the present study an experimental program aiming {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} lamp glass waste ground from 10 min to 60 min and used as a cement component in cement paste mix, has been completed. Viscosity, electrical conductivity and compressive strength of cement paste samples with Portland cement substitution at a level of 30 % with <b>ground</b> <b>lamp</b> glass waste and bottom wood/coal ash were determined. The results showed a significant increase of the workability for cement paste mixes with LB and wood ash, and an increase of compressive strength for DRL and coal ash mixes. ...|$|E

30|$|Considering the {{complicated}} physical {{conditions such as}} road cracks in the transportation channel and <b>ground</b> <b>lamps,</b> it is often impossible to accurately detect foreign objects based on a single two-dimensional image processing method [10]. To this end, this study {{is based on the}} traditional vehicle-mounted camera monitoring technology, first to make the system adapt to changes in weather conditions, using image enhancement and other pre-processing methods {{to improve the quality of}} video images. Secondly, based on the binocular stereo vision model, this study uses polar line constraints and epipolar correction to quickly match the common field of view of the binocular camera and calculate the depth information progressively. At the same time, the depth information obtained by comparative analysis can effectively exclude the influence of complex conditions on the channel on the detection results, so as to achieve accurate positioning of foreign objects in the transportation channel [11].|$|R

40|$|Portland cement {{substitution}} with {{waste glass}} (special glass and container glass) in concrete has {{significant effect on}} performance characteristics of eco-concrete (Kara et al., 2012). The packing density of cementious materials is an important property governing the rheological and strength performance of the cement paste. A higher packing density demands less water to fill the voids between the solid particles {{and at the same}} time water/cementious materials ratio releases more excess water for increasing the flowability of cement paste. One of commonly used filler to increase packing density is condensed silica fume which is relatively high cost material. Therefore, in present study is investigated the usage of fluorescent lamp waste glass and ashes as fillers. An experimental program aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of <b>ground</b> fluorescent <b>lamp</b> waste glass and ash as filler in cement paste has been completed. Rheological properties and cube strength of cement paste samples containing different amounts of <b>ground</b> fluorescent <b>lamp</b> waste glass and ash were measured.

The proposed method firstly generates multi-scale supervoxels from 3 D point clouds using colors, intensities and spatial distances. Then, a graph-based segmentation method {{is applied to}} segment the supervoxels by integrating their colors, intensities, normal vectors, and principal directions. Then, the saliency of each segment is calculated and the most salient segment is selected as a seed to cluster for objects clustering. Hence, the objects are classified and the constraint conditions of object's category are included to re-clustering for more accurate extraction of objects.

40|$|Lamp glass {{rational}} utilization {{problem is}} actual over the world. The main {{aim of the}} work is to develop technology for utilizing waste of lamp bore-silicate glass as micro-filler for traditional and self-compacting concrete. Ground glass effect is investigated and compared to traditional micro fillers of concrete. The best compressive strength results are achieved by using silica fume combination with additionally ground glass as complex admixture. Concrete mixes containing silica fume and ground bore-silicate glass perform long-term hard-ening effect, which may be explained by puzzolanic reactions with cement components. The experimental program has been elaborated for investigation of ground glass material as micro filler for self-compacting concrete.

40|$|Nonrecyclable {{waste glass}} {{constitutes}} {{a problem for}} solid waste disposal in many municipalities. Most of the nonrecyclable glass is landfilled {{but that does not}} provide an environment- friendly solution since glass is not biodegradable material. With the increasing use of fluorescent lightning systems for energy efficiency more nonrecyclable waste glass is accumulated from the fluorescent lamp recycling business. The application of fluorescent lamp waste glass as an extra finely ground mineral additive in cement is promising direction for waste glass recycling. Present study examines the effect of fluorescent waste glass on the microstructure and strength of cement paste specimens containing different amounts of extra finely <b>ground</b> fluorescent <b>lamp</b> waste glass.

40|$|Lamp {{glass is}} waste product {{which can not}} be {{utilized}} by traditional way. The possibilities for use lamp bore-silicate glass powder as cement replacing admixture in conventional concrete have been investigated in this work. Experimental work provides preparation of standard concrete samples and sample testing after the 7 and 28 day ageing period in standard condition. The following glass materials were used for cement replacement: rough ground glass powder, glass dust from filters (both materials were obtained from glass treatment plant) and additionally ground glass powder. The effect of glass powder on cement setting time was investigated. The experimental results indicate that cement replacing by rough glass powder decrease compressive strength. Fine glass particles make possible to replace up to 20 of cement without loss in strength characteristics. Fine glass powder performs long-term hardening effect. The best compressive strength results were achieved by using 60 minutes ground glass, glass dust obtained from filters gives smaller effect.

2500|$|The second revised {{design was}} {{submitted}} to the CFA in November 2006. This new design moved the five-pointed star-shaped basin to {{the northern tip of}} the site. The eternal flame remained {{at the center of the}} basin. To provide an unobstructed view of the Capitol, no trees would line the northern half of the northeastern side of the site. [...] The stone walls were reduced so that they now only occurred in two long sections on the western side of the site, and a pedestrian walkway was added in the much-expanded southern grove of trees to allow office workers to move through the site. To maintain handicapped-accessibility, the new plan widened 2nd Street NW and added a lane nearest the memorial for bus and special-needs parking. The range of quotations on the stone wall were now limited only to expressions of loss and the nation's gratitude. Because of the diminution of the screening walls and a more limited number of trees, which reduced traffic noise, the star-shaped basin was now raised to a height of about [...] A cascade of water [...] high led from the basin to the tree-lined reflecting pool. This cascade, it was hoped, would make white noise which would reduce the intrusiveness of the traffic noises. The reflecting pool was now capable of being drained quickly to be used as a platform for events, rallies, or commemorations. Changes were made to the glass walls as well, which were now scattered in the larger grove of trees on the southern portion of the site. Vergason said that the glass panels (confirmed to be [...] high) would reflect the trees and visitors reading their inscriptions. The bronze panels were reduced in number to four, each one depicting the silhouette of a veteran with missing body parts. Addressing landscape concerns, Vergason said the large, southern grove of trees would consist of ginkgo, with bald cypress along 2nd Street. Disease-resistant American elms would be planted in a double-row along Washington Avenue. Vergason confirmed that grey granite would be used for the plaza, and black granite for the bottom of the basin and pool. Lighting would be provided by standard CFA-approved single-globe or double-globe lighting standards. Spotlights on poles would illuminate the bronze sculptural panels, and the glass panels would be lit from behind and below by <b>ground</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R

50|$|Some {{preservation}} {{has already}} been necessary, after a destructive accident in February 1994. A runaway front-end loader came barreling {{down the road and}} smashed into the front corner, taking out about one-fourth of the building. After clean up, both floors were left exposed and needing to be closed off. It was determined that the building was still safe and structurally sound, since the floors and structural beams ran parallel to the collision, which ultimately saved it from demolition. After several months of reconstruction, the Flatiron was completed with new elements included. The front façade of the building featured new arched windows on both floors, and a front door framed with windows. Green awnings were added to the doorways along the <b>ground</b> floor, and <b>lamps</b> were placed in the walls.

40|$|Most {{products}} {{have the potential}} to negatively impact the environment during all life-cycle stages. However, most environmental impact assessment methods focus on a single product life-cycle and on a specific lifecycle stage. In addition, consumer products can potentially amplify these impacts with their larger production volumes, wide dispersion, and miniaturization trends. The main objective of this project is to develop a design optimization framework that allows for estimating the environmental impact of design decisions (e. g. materials choice, etc.) across all life-cycle stages in consumer products. This work incorporates into one framework customer preferences (including preference for environmental friendliness), consumer adoption translated into utility for the producers, and environmental impact quantification of design options. The methodology relies on QFD, multi-attribute utility theory, non-linear mathematical programming, and Lifecycle Assessment tools to estimate the utility of the design options to the customer, the producer, and the environment. A function that depicts the utility of design perceived by the environment is introduced. Also a “Global Utility” equation is introduced. It incorporates the utilities of all three stakeholders and reflects the overall utility of the design alternatives. A case study is developed considering two design options of outdoor lighting: solar and low voltage powered lamps. The Global Utility (overall utility of product) is calculated for the two alternatives. Then, the model is flexed to illustrate the response of the model with different design orientations (environmental conscious and environmental oblivious design tendency). Also, a redesign application is exemplified by performing a material substitution in the solar <b>lamp</b> <b>ground</b> pole. Finally, a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis is performed to demonstrate the robustness of the framework...|$|R
