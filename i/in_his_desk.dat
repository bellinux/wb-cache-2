5|$|William Legrand has {{relocated}} from New Orleans to Sullivan's Island in South Carolina {{after losing}} his family fortune, and has brought his African-American servant Jupiter with him. The story's narrator, {{a friend of}} Legrand, visits him one evening to see an unusual scarab-like bug he has found. The bug's weight and lustrous appearance convince Jupiter that it is made of pure gold. Legrand has lent it to an officer stationed at a nearby fort, but he draws a sketch of it for the narrator, with markings on the carapace that resemble a skull. As they discuss the bug, Legrand becomes particularly focused on the sketch and carefully locks it <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> for safekeeping. Confused, the narrator takes his leave for the night.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) pranking {{has caused}} Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to ask Andy {{to move her}} to a {{different}} desk. In turn, Andy orders Dwight and Jim to quit their childish behavior. He tells them that the next one to pull a prank will lose their Christmas bonus, and {{the target of the}} prank will get the prankster's share. Wanting to double their bonuses, both Dwight and Jim attempt to frame the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 bouquet of flowers for Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). Dwight then puts a porcupine <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> and blames Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter CeCe, and blames Dwight. After Andy says such vandalism is grounds for termination, Jim admits he staged the crime. Acknowledging that his plan has backfired, Andy tells Jim that he will not touch their bonuses, and just wants their behavior to not interfere with their job performances. Jim assures him he will tell Dwight, but purposefully neglects to do so. Dwight thus continues to pull pranks on himself, to Jim's amusement.|$|E

500|$|Around this time, Abra began a {{relationship}} with Acting Sister Kyla Tyson. [...] When Ric departed for Uganda, Abra confessed the xenotransplantation secret to Kyla, who helped cover for him upon the arrival of new General Surgical Consultant Daniel Clifford. It was revealed that Abra had been stealing returned anti-retroviral drugs from the hospital pharmacy to ship to African countries in need for some weeks. [...] When Kyla discovered a small supply <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> drawer, she assumed he was HIV positive, and after failing to extract a confession from Abra, terminated their relationship. The misunderstanding was resolved several episodes later, when Abra was able to win her back by serenading her in a grand romantic gesture in the hospital car park.|$|E
500|$|Mayhew {{alludes to}} [...] "the story of Solomon's mammy", a {{reference}} to Bathsheba, who gave birth to Solomon after her lover David had her husband Uriah killed. Although Audrey cuts Mayhew off by praising his book (which Audrey herself may have written), the reference foreshadows the love triangle which evolves among the three characters of Barton Fink. Rowell points out that Mayhew is murdered (presumably by Charlie) soon after Barton and Audrey have sex. Another Biblical reference comes when Barton flips {{to the front of}} the Bible <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> drawer and sees his own words transposed into the Book of Genesis. This is seen as a representation of his hubris as self-conceived omnipotent master of creation, or alternatively, as a playful juxtaposition demonstrating Barton's hallucinatory state of mind.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were critical. WhatCulture {{reviewer}} Joseph Kratzer {{awarded the}} episode {{four out of}} five stars and wrote, [...] "Now that's what I'm talking about – few things are better in art than having your expectations overturned and 'The Pool Party' pleasantly surprised me with the efficacy of its execution." [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave gave the episode a 9/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I think 'Pool Party' is my favorite episode so far this season. The Robert California and Erin/Dwight/Andy story lines were rock solid. Previous excursions out of the office have been blah, but the pool party setting really complimented the ensemble – and the sharp writing." [...] Michael Tedder from New York Magazine called the episode the season's second best, after [...] "Trivia." [...] In addition, many critics wrote positively of the characters and their actions. Jill Mader from InsidePulse wrote that while, [...] " [...] storyline itself was just OK... Ellie Kemper was hilarious." [...] Many reviewers, including McNutt and Forcella, found Kevin's lines and actions to be particularly memorable, most notably, his declaration that Val was racist after she asked if Darryl could swim. A variety of reviewers found the cold-opening, featuring Jim pranking Dwight by placing meatballs <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> in an attempt to make Stanley laugh, funny.|$|E

2500|$|An {{additional}} recording showed Siminovsky in the judge's robing room on March 10, 2003. He handed Garson {{an envelope}} containing a $1,000 cash [...] "referral fee". The cash had been supplied to Siminovsky by the DA's Office, {{as part of}} the sting operation. Garson initially refused to accept the money. He then tried to return it, suggesting that Siminovsky contribute it to Garson's wife's judicial campaign instead. But Siminovsky threw the money back on the judge's desk, saying he would make a campaign contribution as well, but telling the judge to keep the cash. Garson picked up the money, and tried to hand it to Siminovsky once again, saying [...] "I appreciate it. No, no, no... No." [...] But then, sighing, he put the money <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> drawer. Siminovsky was instructed by the DA to duck Garson's repeated calls that day and the next, anticipating Garson's attempts to return the money. When Garson was arrested a few days later on his way to work, the envelope containing the sting money was in his pocket. The box of cigars, purchased by the DA's office {{as part of the}} [...] sting operation, had been placed in Garson's desk drawer in his robing room by Siminovsky, where they remained unopened and untouched until months later when the DA asked Garson's attorney to retrieve them. The explanation for this was not revealed in court.|$|E
2500|$|La Tosca had its US premiere {{within four}} months of its Paris opening, {{performed}} in English translation with Fanny Davenport {{in the title role}} and her husband, Willet Melbourne MacDowell, as Cavaradossi. The [...] "Davenport Tosca" [...] opened in New York City on 3 March 1888 and inaugurated the luxurious new Broadway Theatre on 41st Street. Davenport had previously bought the rights to the American premiere of Sardou's Féodora, and had made a fortune from it. She bought the rights to the American premiere of La Tosca for 100,0000 francs, before it had even premiered in Paris. As had happened at the Paris premiere, a charge of plagiarism was soon brought. Maurice Barrymore claimed that his 1884 play, Nadjezda, had been plagiarised by Sardou and sought an injunction to stop Davenport putting on further performances of La Tosca. According to Barrymore, he had given a copy of his play to Sarah Bernhardt in 1885, and she had then given it to Sardou. In affidavits read out in court Bernhardt said that she had never seen the play and knew nothing about it, and Sardou said that preliminary material for the play had been <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> for fifteen years. In fact, Nadjezdas only resemblance to La Tosca comes from the unholy bargain the heroine makes to save her husband's life, similar to that of Tosca and Baron Scarpia. As Sardou pointed out in his affidavit, this plot device is a common one and had been notably used by Shakespeare in Measure for Measure. Davenport herself was in the courtroom on 27 April 1888 when the judge found in her favour. Following the New York run, she toured the play throughout the US with her company.|$|E
