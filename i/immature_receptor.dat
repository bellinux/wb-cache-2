40|$|AbstractThe kinase {{activity}} of the thanatophoric dysplasia type II–fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 mutant (TDII–FGFR 3) hampers its maturation. As a consequence, the <b>immature</b> <b>receptor</b> activates extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which leads to apoptosis. On the other hand, in stable TDII–FGFR 3 cells receptor biosynthesis is restored and ERKs are activated from the cell surface. To identify potential mediators of cell adaptation to the activated receptor we investigated gene products that are differently regulated in TDII and wild-type FGFR 3 cells. cDNA representational difference analysis reveals Sprouty 4 up regulation in the TDII–FGFR 3 cells. Interestingly, Sprouty 4 inhibits the TDII–FGFR 3 -mediated ERKs activation from the ER, but fails to suppress ERKs activation from cell surface. We conclude that cell adaptation to activated FGFR 3 include Sprouty 4 activity, which silences the premature receptor signaling and suppress apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|SummaryHow the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) folding machinery coordinates general and specialized chaperones during protein translation and folding remains an important unanswered question. Here, we show two structural domains in MESD, a specialized chaperone for LRP 5 / 6, carry out dual functions. The chaperone domain forms a complex with the <b>immature</b> <b>receptor,</b> maintaining the β-propeller (BP) domain in an interaction competent state for epidermal growth factor-repeat binding. This promotes proper folding of the BP domain, causing a binding switch from the chaperone domain to the escort domain. The escort complex ensures LRP 5 / 6 safe-trafficking from the ER to the Golgi by preventing premature ligand-binding. Inside the Golgi, the BP domain may contain a histidine switch, regulating MESD dissociation and retrieval. Together, we generate a plausible cell biology {{picture of the}} MESD/LRP 5 / 6 pathway, suggesting {{that it is the}} specialized chaperones, MESD, that serves as the folding template to drive proper folding and safe trafficking of large multidomain proteins LRP 5 / 6...|$|E
40|$|The neurobiologic {{mechanisms}} underlying autism are {{in place}} before birth. Neuroanatomic studies of postmortem autism brain have documented abnormalities in structures that are well estab-lished by the second trimester of gestation, 1 – 4 {{and high levels of}} sev-eral neuropeptides have been found in blood collected at birth in children who later developed symptoms of autism. 5 In addition to the unknown molecular and genetic pathways underlying autism, there might also be gestational influences that affect brain devel-opment. In our clinical experience, we observed children with autism spectrum disorders whose mothers had been treated with terbutaline to arrest premature labor. Terbutaline, a selective 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist, easily crosses the placental and blood–brain barriers 6, 7 and is often used to arrest premature labor during the second or third trimester, 8 although its use is no longer officially recommended. 9 In this report, we investigate the possi-bility that aberrant in utero activation of 2 -adrenergic receptor sig-naling contributes to the development of autism. The 2 -adrenergic receptor {{is an essential part of}} the cate-cholamine system. Stimulation of this receptor by its ligands, nor-epinephrine and epinephrine, generates cyclic adenosine monophosphate and protein kinase A 10 as second messengers and increases intracellular calcium. 11 Continued stimulation of the mature 2 -adrenergic receptor (but not the <b>immature</b> <b>receptor)</b> results in decreased signaling (desensitization) and decreased receptor numbers on the cell surface (down-regulation) ...|$|E

Recordings of nerve volleys in whole dorsal or ventral roots in response to muscle nerve stimulation showed that conduction velocity for afferent and motor fibres was similar and increased from 9 m s- 1 in a 2 -day-old animal to 33 m s- 1 in a 23 -day-old animal. Of a total of 215 single functional axons isolated from 28 animals, 82 showed responses typical of tendon organs and 103 resembled muscle spindles, leaving 30 unidentified units. Both muscle spindles and tendon organs were characterized by having an over-all low firing rate compared with responses of adult <b>receptors.</b> The most <b>immature</b> <b>receptors</b> also lacked a maintained response to the hold phase of a ramp-and-hold stretch.

40|$|Abstract Background The human {{prostacyclin}} receptor (hIP) undergoes agonist-induced phosphorylation, desensitisation and internalisation and may {{be recycled}} to the plasma membrane or targeted for degradation by, as yet, unknown mechanism(s). Results Herein it was sought to investigate the turnover of the hIP under basal conditions {{and in response to}} cicaprost stimulation. It was established that the hIP is subject to low-level basal degradation but, following agonist stimulation, degradation is substantially enhanced. Inhibition of the lysosomal pathway prevented basal and agonist-induced degradation of the mature species of the hIP (46 - 66 kDa). Conversely, inhibition of the proteasomal pathway had no effect on levels of the mature hIP but led to time-dependent accumulation of four newly synthesised immature species (38 - 44 kDa). It was established that both the mature and immature species of the hIP may be polyubiquitinated and this modification may be required for lysosomal sorting of the mature, internalised receptors and for degradation of the <b>immature</b> <b>receptors</b> by the 26 S proteasomes through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process, respectively. Moreover, these data substantially advance knowledge of the factors regulating processing and maturation of the hIP, a complex receptor subject to multiple post-translational modifications including N-glycosylation, phosphorylation, isoprenylation, palmitoylation, in addition to polyubiquitination, as determined herein. Conclusion These findings indicate that the hIP is post-translationally modified by ubiquitination, which targets the immature species to the 26 S proteasomal degradation pathway and the mature species to the lysosomal degradation pathway. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the olfactory epithelium from the 10 th day of gestation of postnatal life has been examined electron miscroscopically in the mouse. At 10 days' gestation the epithelium is already differentiated into dark and pale cells, the former representing embryonic stem cells and the latter the developing receptors. Axons are also visible at this stage. At 11 days {{the first signs of}} dendrite formation appear, and at 12 days spheroidal terminal swellings containing numerous microtubules are present at the apices of receptor dendrites. Centriole clusters also appear in the receptor cell bodies and dendrites. From the 12 th to the 16 th day of gestation a few cilia are formed on the receptor endings. Final steps in the maturation of differentiating receptors begin on the 17 th day of gestation, when membranous organelles and lysosomes increase greatly in numbers. However, <b>immature</b> <b>receptors</b> can still be found in the base of the epithelium in postnatal life. Supporting cells are first recognizable on the 17 th day of gestation, derived apparently from the remaining stem cells. At the same time differentiated basal cells and glands of Bowman begin to appear. In the early develoment of the olfactory nerve bundles the axons have large and varying diameters, but later on axonal sizes are progressively reduced and the adult size range is achieved at about 18 days of gestation. The significance of these findings is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The factors {{controlling}} neurogenesis and {{differentiation of}} olfactory receptor cells in adults are poorly understood, {{although it is}} often stated that these cells undergo continual turnover after a pre-determined lifespan. An interesting model in which to study mechanisms which control olfactory receptor neurogenesis and cell turnover is the tiger salamander, since basal cell mitosis varies with epithelial thickness and location in the nasal cavity. This paper presents a quantitative light-microscopic study of the different cell types within the ventral olfactory epithelium of the tiger salamander using a computer-assisted morphometric analysis of 2 μm sections. The {{results show that the}} surface density of olfactory vesicles remained constant throughout most of the epithelium and was independent of nasal cavity location, epithelial thickness and the total number of nuclei per unit epithelial surface area. Histological classification of nuclei into different cell types indicated that the increase in total cell number with epithelial thickness was mainly due to {{an increase in the number}} of <b>immature</b> <b>receptor</b> cells since the number of supporting cells varied only slightly and the numbers of basal cells and mature receptor cells remained constant except in the thinnest, most caudally located epithelium. It is concluded that the rate of maturation of receptor cells may be limited by an optimal surface density of olfactory vesicles. That is, when this density reaches 4. 5 × 10 vesicles per mm there is a physical or chemical mechanism which prevents the final maturation of newly developing receptor cells, leading to their accumulation. This mechanism may also account for the variations in basal cell mitosis in this species...|$|E
40|$|The TSH {{receptor}} (TSHR), {{a member}} of the large family of G protein-coupled receptors, controls both function and growth of thyroid cells; hence, mutations of this receptor result in thyroid dysfunction. Here, we took advantage of the description of a new inactivating TSHR mutation (Q 489 H) in two brothers with hypothyroidism, to precise maturation, intracellular trafficking, exporting pathways, and activation mechanisms of this receptor. Functional characterization of the Q 489 H-TSHR in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells showed cell surface expression, normal TSH binding affinity, and its inability to generate intracellular cAMP in response to TSH stimulation. Western blot analysis of the whole membrane proteins or proteins expressed at the cell surface showed that Q 489 H-TSHR expressed in HEK 293 transfected cells are restricted to mannose-rich uncleaved receptor. Analysis of the export pathway toward cell surface indicated that both Q 489 H and wild-type receptors followed the same intracellular route to cell surface throughout endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This study shows that Q 489 H substitution impedes complete glycosylation of TSHR extracellular domain within the Golgi apparatus and that Q 489 H-TSHR expressed at the cell surface is unable to undergo intramolecular cleavage as well as to switch toward an active conformation under TSH stimulation. Altogether, our results show that 1) Q 489 H substitution within the first extracellular loop induces a misfolding of TSHR, blocking it into an inactive conformation and impeding complete glycosylation and intramolecular cleavage, and 2) a misfolded G protein-coupled receptor can bypass endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus quality control and reach the cell surface as an <b>immature</b> <b>receptor...</b>|$|E
40|$|Based on {{in vitro}} {{experiments}} measuring daily secretion {{rates in the}} culture media of rat hepatocytes and in vivo experiments using pulse labeling of intracellular precursors, the present study examines the ontogenic expression of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor and secretory component by hepatocytes during growth. Our data indicate that hepatocytes from infant and suckling rats (day 5, 15) cultured in serum-free and hormone-free conditions only secreted trace amounts of secretory component. Beginning on day 20, basal secretion rate showed a marked upsurge with a 10 -fold increase by day 35. The addition of dexamethasone (10 (- 7) mol/L) to the culture media enhanced by 2. 5 -fold the basal secretion of secretory component by hepatocytes from 20 -, 25 -, and 35 -day-old rats, while addition of insulin to the media had no effect. The response to dexamethasone was dose-dependent (10 (- 5), 10 (- 6), 10 (- 7) mol/L) and specific. In vivo pulse labeling of receptor precursors in hepatocytes from 40 -day-old rats allowed the identification of three intracellular forms: a 105 -kilodalton peptide and a 116 - 120 -kilodalton mature doublet. In 13 -day-old rats, three immature precursors were detected: a 105 -kilodalton peptide and a high molecular weight doublet of 185 - 190 kilodaltons. Sucklings (13 days) treated with corticosterone showed a pattern of precursors similar to controls. These findings support the following conclusions: (a) hepatocytes from infant and suckling rats synthesize and process <b>immature</b> <b>receptor</b> precursors whose expression is unaffected by corticosterone treatment, and (b) active secretion of secretory component is initiated at weaning independently from humoral and hormonal factors while the magnitude of its production by the liver is {{under the control of}} glucocorticoids...|$|E
40|$|We showed {{previously}} {{that the}} beta receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is constitutively activated in fibroblasts {{transformed by the}} 44 -amino-acid bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV) E 5 protein and that the E 5 protein and the PDGF receptor exist in a stable complex in E 5 -transformed fibroblasts. On {{the basis of these}} results, we proposed that activation of the PDGF receptor by the BPV E 5 protein generates a sustained proliferative signal, resulting in fibroblast transformation. In this study, we used a gene transfer approach to provide functional evidence that the PDGF receptor can mediate transformation by the E 5 protein. We show that normal mouse mammary gland (NMuMG) cells, a murine mammary epithelial cell line that does not express PDGF receptors, are not susceptible to transformation by the E 5 protein. Coexpression of the PDGF beta receptor and E 5 genes in these cells results in markedly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of an <b>immature</b> PDGF <b>receptor</b> species and the formation of a stable complex between the E 5 protein and this <b>immature</b> PDGF <b>receptor</b> form. Importantly, introduction of the PDGF receptor gene into NMuMG cells renders them highly susceptible to E 5 -mediated tumorigenic transformation. In contrast, the E 5 protein does not induce transformation via the endogenous epidermal growth factor receptor pathway in these cells. These results demonstrate that the PDGF receptor, a cellular protein with a well-characterized role in the positive control of cell proliferation, can mediate transformation by a DNA virus transforming protein...|$|R
40|$|The {{luteinizing hormone}} {{receptor}} (LHR) is a G protein–coupled receptor that {{is expressed in}} multiple RNA messenger forms. The common rat ectodomain splice variant is expressed concomitantly with the full-length LHR in tissues and is a truncated transcript corresponding to the partial ectodomain with a unique C-terminal end. Here we demonstrate that the variant alters {{the behavior of the}} full-length receptor by misrouting it away from the normal secretory pathway in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The variant was expressed as two soluble forms of Mr 52, 000 and Mr 54, 000, but although the protein contains a cleavable signal sequence, no secretion to the medium was observed. Only a very small fraction of the protein was able to gain hormone-binding ability, suggesting that it is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by its quality control due to misfolding. This was supported by the finding that the variant was found to interact with calnexin and calreticulin and accumulated together with these ER chaperones in a specialized juxtanuclear subcompartment of the ER. Only proteasomal blockade with lactacystin led to accumulation of the variant in the cytosol. Importantly, coexpression of the variant with the full-length LHR resulted in {{reduction in the number of}} receptors that were capable of hormone binding and were expressed at the cell surface and in targeting of <b>immature</b> <b>receptors</b> to the juxtanuclear ER subcompartment. Thus, the variant mediated misrouting of the newly synthesized full-length LHRs may provide a way to regulate the number of cell surface receptors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that seven transmembrane receptors (7 TM-Rs) can associate with various chaperones to control their maturation and export. It has been shown for a few years now that 7 TM-Rs can form homo or heterooligomeric complexes. Due to the difficulty to study heterooligomers in a context devoid of homooligomers signaling, very little is known on heterooligomerization. β 2 AR-AT 1 R receptor complexes have been found on cells and ligand activation of one receptor affects signaling of the partner. Yet, very {{little is known about the}} mechanisms linking those receptors together. We propose to examine the role of chaperones in the maturation of homo- and heterodimers of the β 2 AR and AT 1 R. It would not be surprising that strict cellular mechanisms exist to ensure that only properly folded receptors are inserted into the plasma membrane. Results Our goal is to understand the process whereby the adrenergic and angiotensin receptors attain their proper mature conformation. We determined whether any of the common chaperones are physically associated with the fully and/or immature β 2 AR and AT 1 R receptors forms and if they play any role in the selective recruitment of G proteins subunits to receptor complexes. Our results suggest that when a pair of receptors is expressed in such way that one is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), this <b>immature</b> <b>receptor</b> will dictate the chaperones interacting with the receptor complex. We showed that ERp 57 is important for receptor dimerization of AT 1 R homo and β 2 AR/AT 1 R receptor dimers, but plays no role in the β 2 AR homodimerization. Then, we verified if some of those chaperones could play a role in the assembly of the heterotrimeric G protein subunits with the receptor complex, but none appeared to be essential. Conclusions Overall, our results suggest that variations among receptor oligomers occur early in the synthesis/maturation processes, and that chaperones will interact more specifically with some receptor pairs than others to allow the formation of certain receptor pairs, while others will contribute to the folding and maturation of receptors without any effect on receptor assembly within a signaling complex. </p...|$|E
40|$|The corticotropin-releasing factor {{receptor}} type 2 a (CRF 2 aR) {{belongs to}} the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Previous work showed that the CRF 2 aR possesses an N-terminal pseudo signal peptide that remains uncleaved in contrast to conventional signal peptides. The pseudo signal peptide is neither capable to direct the nascent polypeptide to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) {{during the course of the}} early steps of receptor biogenesis, nor to open the protein conducting channel in the translocon (Rutz et al., J. Biol Chem. 281, 24910 - 2492, 2006). Hence, the pseudo signal peptide of the CRF 2 aR is a unique protein domain in the GPCR family. The present study addresses the functional significance of the pseudo signal peptide. Specifically, it was investigated whether this receptor domain affects the internalization, the cell surface expression and the signal transduction. The homologous CRF 1 R, that possesses a conventional cleavable signal peptide, was used as control. Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM) experiments showed that CRF 2 aR, in contrast to CRF 1 R, did not lead to β-arrestin recruitment to the plasma membrane in agonist-induced internalization. This led to the assumption that the pseudo signal peptide might have an influence on the internalization mechanism. However, it turned out that the internalization kinetics of CRF 2 aR and CRF 1 R do not differ significantly. The lack of β-arrestin recruitment by CRF 2 aR is most likely due to a detection problem since the CRF 2 aR displayed a significantly reduced surface expression. Subsequently, it was investigated whether and at what stage of intracellular receptor transport the presence of the pseudo signal peptide influences the plasma membrane expression. Signal peptide exchange experiments between CRF 1 R and CRF 2 aRs, showed that the presence of the pseudo signal peptide indeed results in a very low receptor expression on the cell surface. The presence of the pseudo signal peptide results in an increased expression of <b>immature</b> <b>receptor</b> proteins in the ER, and consequently in an increased interaction of the receptor with the chaperone protein calnexin. Thus, the pseudo signal peptide causes an enhanced retention of the receptor by the quality control system in the early secretory pathway. The presence of the signal peptide apparently impairs the proper folding of the receptor. These data explain the decreased expression at the plasma membrane. All specified characteristics mediated by the pseudo signal peptide were entirely transferable to the CRF 1 R in signal peptide exchange experiments. Accordingly, the transfer of the conventional signal peptide of CRF 1 R to CRF 2 aR caused improved folding of the receptor and led to an increase in receptor expression in the plasma membrane. Whether the low CRF 2 aR expression in the plasma membrane induced by the pseudo signal peptide does play a physiological role is still unclear. Signal transduction studies showed that activation of CRF 2 aR leads to a sigmoidal cAMP-concentration-response curve through the exclusive activation of Gαs. In contrast to this, the activation of CRF 1 R, leads to a bell-shaped concentration-response curve. CRF 1 R couples to Gαs at low agonist concentration and to both Gαs and Gαi at high agonist concentration. These results for CRF 2 aR and CRF 1 R were independent of plasma membrane expression and applied agonist. Again, these effects could be shifted between the two receptor subtypes by signal peptide exchange experiments, i. e. the changes in coupling characteristics are due to the signal peptides. In other words, the presence of the pseudo signal peptide prevents the coupling of the receptor to Gαi, meaning that only an interaction with Gαs is possible. Taken together, these studies indicate that the signal peptide of the pseudo CRF 2 aR does not only affect the early receptor biogenesis in the ER, and thus the receptor expression in the plasma membrane, but also determines the G-protein selectivity of the receptor. Thus, unique functions could be assigned to this novel GPCR domain...|$|E

Mutations in MPL can drastically impair its function and be a contributing factor in multiple hematologic malignancies, including congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT). CAMT is characterized by severe thrombocytopenia at birth, which progresses to bone marrow failure and pancytopenia. Here we report unique familial cases of CAMT that presented with a previously unreported MPL mutation: T 814 C (W 272 R) {{in the background of}} the activating MPL G 117 T (K 39 N or Baltimore) mutation. Confocal microscopy, proliferation and surface biotinylation assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and western blotting analysis were used to elucidate the function and trafficking of Mpl mutants. Results showed that Mpl protein bearing the W 272 R mutation, alone or together with the K 39 N mutation, lacks detectable surface expression while being strongly colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker calreticulin. Both WT and K 39 N-mutated Mpl were found to be signaling competent, but single or double mutants bearing W 272 R were unresponsive to Tpo. Function of the deficient Mpl receptor could be rescued by using 2 separate approaches: (1) GRASP 55 overexpression, which partially restored Tpo-induced signaling of mutant Mpl by activating an autophagy-dependent secretory pathway and thus forcing ER-trapped <b>immature</b> <b>receptors</b> to traffic to the cell surface; and (2) CRISPR-Cas 9 gene editing used to repair MPL T 814 C mutation in transfected cell lines and primary umbilical cord blood–derived CD 34 + cells.

40|$|Abstract The {{luteinizing hormone}} {{receptor}} (LHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) {{that has a}} large N-terminal ligand binding ectodomain. The LHR ectodomain splice variant, expressed concomitantly with the full-length LHR in tissues, has an unknown biological function. GPCRs are a major pharmacological target, however, very {{little is known about}} the intracellular regulation of these receptors. In the present work, expression and maturation of the rat LHR and its variant were elucidated using both tissues and heterologous expression systems. A special effort was made to identify the role of developmental stage and tissue type on the LHR maturation and to find out about the molecular role of the ectodomain splice variant. We found two sites of localization for the receptor, namely the sensory system and urogenital tissues. This was demonstrated at mRNA and protein level and by rat LHR promoter-driven β-galactosidase (β-Gal) expression in the mice. In neurons, the β-Gal co-localized with the cytochrome P 450 side chain cleavage enzyme, which may indicate a novel role in the neurosteroid synthesis. The neuronal LHR was expressed in the mature and immature protein forms in both developing and adult tissues, being able to bind hormone with similar high-affinity as gonadal receptors. In contrast, only <b>immature</b> <b>receptors</b> were detected in the fetal rat urogenital structures. A significant novel finding was substantial upregulation of the LHR in pregnant female rat adrenal glands and kidneys at a time that coincides with the differentiation of the fetal urogenital tissues. The mice overexpressing the ectodomain splice variant showed interference in pituitary-gonadal functions and morphological changes in the urogenital tissues. The studies showed that the variant was an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -retained soluble protein. It accumulated in juxtanuclear regions of the ER together with ER folding chaperones and was a substrate for ER associated degradation (ERAD). The co-expression of the variant with the full-length receptor decreased the amount of receptors and misrouted them to the juxtanuclear ER subcompartment. Taken together, we suggest that the maturation of the LHR protein is developmentally and physiologically regulated at the post-translational level in tissues. The LHR ectodomain splice variant possibly modulates post-translationally the number of full-length receptors through physiological signals. Our observation of the chaperone and protein accumulation into a specific ER subcompartment may represent a protein quality control holding compartment for inefficiently/misfolded ERAD substrates...|$|R

OFA-iLRP– specific CTLs lysed HLA-A 2 OFA-iLRP tumor cells, including several lymphoma and leukemia cell lines, as well as fresh leukemic targets from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lym-phatic leukemia (CLL), indicating that OFA-iLRP–derived peptides are naturally processed and presented by hematologic tumors.

The IFN gamma-induced reduction of the transferrin receptor mRNA content is already present at the nuclear level to an extent comparable to that observed in whole cells.

Furthermore, the distinction between the mechanism of regulation exerted by IFN gamma and that exerted by cell proliferation on transferrin receptor gene expression suggests that, in WISH cells, the IFN-induced transferrin receptor decay is not a consequence of cell growth arrest but rather one of the causes of the antiproliferative effect of IFN through iron deprivation...|$|R

All current {{evidence indicates that}} olfaction is a major mediator of chemical signals and is involved in diverse teleost behavior. This paper describes the morphological components and {{the basic principles of}} developmental patterns of the olfactory organ as well as cellular differentiation of receptors in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (formerly Salmo gairdneri). The olfactory organ originates from an anlage formed by the ectoderm on the ventrolateral part of the head during stage 19 (11 d postfertilization). Ciliated receptor cells appear at stage 24 (day 18) and dominate until <b>immature</b> microvillar <b>receptor</b> cells develop in stage- 28 (day 26) embryos. During this period, the olfactory placode continues a lateral and upward migration. At stage 29, the day of hatching, the olfactory groove is enclosed by flaps of skin, and by stage 33, distinct anterior and posterior nares are formed. Spontaneous electrical activity is recorded from the olfactory mucosa as early as stage 25, and neural responses to chemical stimuli are induced from stage- 26 embryos that contain sparse ciliated receptor cells. Stereochemical specificity of receptor responses is evident at these stages. We conclude that the olfactory receptor has two ontogenetically distinct forms, ciliated and microvillar. By the time of hatching, both cell types are mature and capable of responding and discriminating among chemical stimuli. The functional distinction of the olfactory system is discussed further in relation to the gustatory system, which is endodermal in origin and is still incomplete at hatching...|$|R
40|$|The membrane-associated protein SCG 10 is {{expressed}} specifically by neuronal cells. Recent experiments {{have suggested that}} it promotes neurite outgrowth by increasing microtubule dynamics in growth cones. SCG 10 {{is related to the}} ubiquitous but neuron-enriched cytosolic protein stathmin. To better understand the role played by SCG 10 and stathmin in vivo, we have analyzed the expression and localization of these proteins in both the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb in developing and adult rats, as well as in adult bulbectomized rats. The olfactory epithelium is exceptional in that olfactory receptor neurons constantly regenerate and reinnervate the olfactory bulb throughout animal life-span. SCG 10 and stathmin expression in the olfactory receptor neurons was found to be regulated during embryonic and postnatal development and to correlate with neuronal maturation. Whereas SCG 10 expression was restricted to <b>immature</b> olfactory <b>receptor</b> neurons (GAP- 43 -positive, olfactory marker protein-negative), stathmin was also expressed by the basal cells. In the olfactory bulb of postnatal and adult rats, a moderate to strong SCG 10 immunoreactivity was present in the olfactory nerve layer, whereas no labeling was detected in the glomerular layer. Olfactory glomeruli also showed no apparent immunoreactivity for several cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins. In unilaterally bulbectomized rats, SCG 10 and stathmin were seen to be up-regulated in the regenerating olfactory epithelium at postsurgery stages corresponding to olfactory axon regeneration. Our data strongly suggest that, in vivo, both SCG 10 and stathmin {{may play a role in}} axonal outgrowth during ontogenesis as well as during axonal regeneration...|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the contribution of}} stochastic thermal fluctuations in the attachment times of the <b>immature</b> T-cell <b>receptor</b> TCR: peptide-major-histocompatibility-complex pMHC immunological synapse bond. The key question addressed here is the following: how does a synapse bond remain stabilized {{in the presence of}} high-frequency thermal noise that potentially equates to a strong detaching force? Focusing on the average time persistence of an immature synapse, we show that the high-frequency nodes accompanying large fluctuations are counterbalanced by low-frequency nodes that evolve over longer time periods, eventually leading to signaling of the immunological synapse bond primarily decided by nodes of the latter type. Our analysis shows that such a counterintuitive behavior could be easily explained {{from the fact that the}} survival probability distribution is governed by two distinct phases, corresponding to two separate time exponents, for the two different time regimes. The relatively shorter timescales correspond to the cohesion:adhesion induced immature bond formation whereas the larger time reciprocates the association:dissociation regime leading to TCR:pMHC signaling. From an estimate of the bond survival probability, we show that, at shorter timescales, this probability PΔ(τ) scales with time τ as a universal function of a rescaled noise amplitude DΔ 2, such that PΔ(τ) ∼τ-(ΔD+ 12),Δ being the distance from the mean intermembrane (T cell:Antigen Presenting Cell) separation distance. The crossover from this shorter to a longer time regime leads to a universality in the dynamics, at which point the survival probability shows a different power-law scaling compared to the one at shorter timescales. In biological terms, such a crossover indicates that the TCR:pMHC bond has a survival probability with a slower decay rate than the longer LFA- 1 :ICAM- 1 bond justifying its stability...|$|R
40|$|Differentiation and {{maturation}} of oligodendroglial {{cells are}} postnatal processes involving specific morphological changes {{correlated with the}} expression of stage-specific surface antigens and functional voltage-gated ion channels. A small fraction of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) generated during development are maintained in an immature and slowly proliferative or quiescent state in the adult central nervous system (CNS) representing an endogenous reservoir of <b>immature</b> cells. Adenosine <b>receptors</b> are expressed by OPCs and a key role of adenosine in oligodendrocyte maturation has been recently recognised. As evaluated on OPC cultures, adenosine by stimulating A 1 receptors, promotes oligodendrocyte maturation and inhibits their proliferation; on the contrary by stimulating A 2 A receptors, it inhibits oligodendrocyte maturation. A 1 and A 2 A receptor-mediated effects are related to opposite modifications of outward delayed rectifying membrane K+ currents (IK) {{that are involved in}} regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Brain A 1 and A 2 A receptors might represent new molecular targets for drugs useful in demyelinating pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke and brain trauma...|$|R
40|$|Through its {{involvement}} in inflammation, opsonization, and cytolysis, the complement protects against infectious agents. Although {{most of the}} complement proteins are synthesized in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), the role of the complement system in the normal or ischemic CNS remains unclear. Here we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} neural progenitor cells and <b>immature</b> neurons express <b>receptors</b> for complement fragments C 3 a and C 5 a (C 3 a receptor (C 3 aR) and C 5 a receptor). Mice that are deficient in complement factor C 3 (C 3 −/−) lack C 3 a and are unable to generate C 5 a through proteolytic cleavage of C 5 by C 5 -convertase. Intriguingly, basal neurogenesis is decreased both in C 3 −/− mice and in mice lacking C 3 aR or mice treated with a C 3 aR antagonist. The C 3 −/− mice had impaired ischemia-induced neurogenesis both in the subventricular zone, the main source of neural progenitor cells in adult brain, and in the ischemic region, despite normal proliferative response and larger infarct volumes. Thus, in the adult mammalian CNS, complement activation products promote both basal and ischemia-induced neurogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Maturation {{as well as}} antigen-dependent {{activation}} of B cells is accompanied by alternating phases of proliferation and quiescence. We and others have previously shown that Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF 2), a regulator of T cell quiescence and migration, is upregulated in small resting precursor (pre) -B cells after assembly of the <b>immature</b> pre-B cell <b>receptor</b> (pre-BCR) and is downregulated upon antigen-induced proliferation of mature B cells. These findings suggest that KLF 2, besides its function in maintaining follicular B cell identity, peripheral B cell homeostasis and homing of antigen-specific plasma cells to the bone marrow, also controls clonal expansion phases in the B cell lineage. Here, we demonstrate that enforced expression of KLF 2 in primary pre-B cells results in a severe block of pre-BCR-induced proliferation, upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitors p 21 and p 27 and downregulation of c-myc. Furthermore, retroviral KLF 2 transduction of primary B cells impairs LPS-induced activation, favors apoptosis and results in reduced abundance of factors, such as AID, IRF 4 and BLIMP 1, that control the antigen-dependent phase of B cell activation and plasma cell differentiation. Hence, we conclude that KLF 2 {{is not only a}} key player in terminating pre-B cell clonal expansion but also a potent suppressor of B cell activation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInitial {{experiments}} {{established the}} experimental conditions {{necessary for the}} induction of LH receptor mRNA down-regulation in granulosa cells isolated from diethylstilbestrol (DES) -primed <b>immature</b> rats. LH/hCG <b>receptor</b> mRNA was first induced in granulosa cells by incubating them for 24 h with FSH. Exposure of granulosa cells to a second dose of gonadotropin caused a decrease in LH/hCG receptor mRNA and binding levels after 4 h. This effect was transient, by 12 h the mRNA levels had returned to control levels, and by 24 h the mRNA levels were higher than the control. To evaluate the ability of cAMP to down-regulate the receptor, cells were exposed to 8 -Br-cAMP. The pattern of sustained decrease in LH/hCG receptor mRNA levels seen with 8 -Br-cAMP {{was similar to that}} with gonadotropins. The presence of activin with FSH or hCG is more effective than FSH or hCG alone in inducing LH/hCG receptor down-regulation in rat granulosa cells. The LH/hCG receptor mRNA levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of increasing concentrations (30 – 100 ng/ml) of activin with FSH. These observations indicate that an increase in cAMP causes down-regulation of LH/hCG receptor mRNA and contributes to the effect of FSH and hCG, whereas basal cAMP activity is required for LH/hCG receptor mRNA expression...|$|R
40|$|T cell {{activation}} {{is restricted}} {{in the sense}} that T cells respond to antigens only in the context of self MHC antigens (1). It has been shown (2 - 4) that T cells learn about self in the thymus but the unanswered question is, how. Approximately 95 % of the cells in the thymus die in situ (5, 6). To account for the low survival rate, and forMHC restriction, it has been proposed that the majority of <b>immature</b> thymocytes, whose <b>receptors</b> have little or no affinity for self MHC, do not receive the proper maturational signals and undergo programmed cell death (7, 8). Cells that are strongly self-reactive are deleted (9 - 12). The small proportion ofthymocytes whose receptors have the "right " affinity (low but real) for selfMHC antigens are positively selected to survive and are exported to the periphery. These cells would bind weakly to self alone, but they might bind strongly, that is, with activating affinity, to self plus antigenic peptides (13). This model predicts that all mature T cells should be able to recognize the selecting self-MHC molecules. However, the binding ofT cells with cells bearing selfMHC in the absence of specific antigen cannot, by definition, result in activation. With this limitation in mind can we determine if selfrecognitio...|$|R

Using paired recordings, we demonstrate that the developmental shift in release probability at synapses between rat somatosensory layer 5 thick-tufted pyramidal cells {{is due to a}} higher and more heterogeneous activation of presynaptic adenosine A 1 <b>receptors.</b> <b>Immature</b> synapses under control conditions exhibited distributions of CV, failure rate and release probability that were almost coincident with the A 1 receptor blocked condition; however, mature synapses under control conditions exhibited much broader distributions that spanned those of both the A 1 receptor agonised and antagonised conditions. Immature and mature synapses expressed A 1 receptors with no observable difference in functional efficacy and therefore the heterogeneous A 1 receptor activation seen in the mature neocortex is due to increased adenosine concentrations that vary between synapses. Given the central role demonstrated for A 1 receptor activation in determining synaptic amplitude and the statistics of transmission between mature layer 5 pyramidal cells, the emplacement of adenosine sources and sinks near the synaptic terminal could constitute a novel form of long-term synaptic plasticity...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) was recently demonstrated in lesions of inflammatory skin diseases. Since anaphylatoxins or their precursors {{were also found}} in such lesions, we investigated a possible interaction between pDC and anaphylatoxins C 3 a and C 5 a. pDC precursors isolated from peripheral blood did not express the receptors for C 3 a and C 5 a, complement C 3 a receptor (C 3 aR) and complement C 3 a receptor (C 5 aR). If these pDC precursors were cultured with IL- 3, the resultant immature pDC expressed both receptors. Expression of C 3 aR and C 5 aR could also be demonstrated on pDC in lesions of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and allergic contact dermatitis. Such pDC were immature since they lacked {{the expression of the}} maturation marker CD 83. Blood-derived pDC matured with CpG oligonucleotides downregulated the <b>receptors.</b> <b>Immature</b> pDC responded to C 3 a and C 5 a (but not C 3 adesArg) stimulation with increased F-actin polymerization and chemotactic migration. In contrast, interferon alpha production, surface molecule expression, and T-cell stimulatory capacity were not significantly modulated by C 3 a or C 5 a. Thus, immature pDC represent another type of antigen-presenting cell that express C 3 aR and C 5 aR, and respond to anaphylatoxins with chemotaxis. This might be relevant in the direction of pDC to cutaneous lesions of inflammation, for example, in lupus erythematosus or contact dermatitis...|$|R
40|$|Neurogenesis of {{projection}} neurons {{requires that}} axons be initiated, extended, and connected. Differences in {{the expression of}} axon growth and guidance genes must drive these events, but comprehensively characterizing these differences in a single neuronal type has not been accomplished. Guided by a catalog of gene expression in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that Cxcr 4 and Dbn 1, two axon initiation genes, marked the developmental transition from basal progenitor cells to immature OSNs in the olfactory epithelium. The CXCR 4 immunoreactivity of these nascent OSNs overlapped partially with markers of proliferation of basal progenitor cells and partially with immunoreactivity for GAP 43, the canonical marker of immature OSNs. Intracellular guidance cue signaling transcripts Ablim 1, Crmp 1, Dypsl 2, Dpysl 3, Dpysl 5, Gap 43, Marcskl 1, and Stmn 1 – 4 were specific to, or much more abundant in, the <b>immature</b> OSN layer. <b>Receptors</b> that mediate axonal inhibition or repulsion tended to be expressed in both immature and mature OSNs (Plxna 1, Plxna 4, Nrp 2, Efna 5) or specifically in mature OSNs (Plxna 3, Unc 5 b, Efna 3, Epha 5, Epha 7), although some were specific to immature OSNs (Plxnb 1, Plxnb 2, Plxdc 2, Nrp 1). Cell adhesion molecules were expressed either by both immature and mature OSNs (Dscam, Ncam 1, Ncam 2, Nrxn 1) or solely by immature OSNs (Chl 1, Nfasc 1, Dscaml 1). Given the loss of intracellular signaling protein expression, the continued expression of guidance cue receptors in mature OSNs {{is consistent with a}} change in the role of these receptors, perhaps to sending signals back to the cell body and nucleus. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Pterygium is an ocular surface {{disorder}} characterised by centripetal {{invasion of}} the cornea by altered limbal cells, accompanied by fibrosis and neovascularisation. One of the enigmatic features of pterygium is its wing-like shape and the mechanism(s) supporting its centripetal growth remain to be elucidated. As the growth pattern of pterygia mirrors the radial arrangement of corneal nerves, we hypothesised that neuropeptides may facilitate its directional growth. In this thesis, we investigated the roles that the sensory neuropeptide substance P (SP) may play in the pathogenesis of pterygia given its known functions in corneal cell migration, proliferation, wound healing and neurogenic inflammation. Using a modified Boyden chamber method, SP was shown {{to act as a}} chemoattractant to pterygium fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells, and this activity was diminish by blockade of its receptor (NK 1). 3 H-thymidine incorporation assays confirmed that our cell migration results were unrelated to SP-stimulated proliferation. A bead-based multiplex cytokine array detected secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 8 and CCL 2) from SP stimulated pterygium and limbal epithelial cells. Using real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting, we show that UVB stimulated transcription of the TAC 1 gene followed by secretion of SP in ocular surface epithelial cell cultures. Finally, SP and NK 1 receptor immunoreactivity was identified in pterygium tissue, where overall, NK 1 receptors were up-regulated in pterygia. Furthermore, we identified a population of NK 1 receptor positive mononuclear cells in pterygia that did not express lineage markers for T or B-Iymphocytes, macrophages or mast cells, but may represent immature haemopoietic cells that may have migrated in from the blood since these cells were also present in autologous conjunctival tissue. In summary, SP may contribute to the shape of pterygia by facilitating migration of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells into the normally avascular cornea. Additionally, UVB stimulates SP production in epithelial cells and the presence of SP contributes to inflammation in pterygia by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Finally, we identified a population of relatively <b>immature,</b> NK 1 <b>receptor</b> positive cells in pterygia that may have been attracted by the presence of SP. Collectively, these results imply that SP may contribute to the pathogenesis of pterygia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{optimize}} {{the potential benefits of}} neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, it is necessary to understand their biological characteristics. Although neurotrophin transduction strategies are promising, alternative approaches such as the modulation of intrinsic neurotrophin expression by NSCs, could also be beneficial. Therefore, utilizing the C 17. 2 neural stem cell line, we have examined the expression of selected neurotrophic factors under different in vitro conditions. In view of recent evidence suggesting a role for the pineal hormone melatonin in vertebrate development, it was also of interest to determine whether its G protein-coupled MT 1 and MT 2 receptors are expressed in NSCs. Results RT-PCR analysis revealed robust expression of glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in undifferentiated cells maintained for two days in culture. After one week, differentiating cells continued to exhibit high expression of BDNF and NGF, but GDNF expression was lower or absent, depending on the culture conditions utilized. Melatonin MT 1 receptor mRNA was detected in NSCs maintained for two days in culture, but the MT 2 receptor was not seen. An <b>immature</b> MT 1 <b>receptor</b> of about 30 kDa was detected by western blotting in NSCs cultured for two days, whereas a mature receptor of about 40 – 45 kDa was present in cells maintained for longer periods. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that the MT 1 receptor is expressed in both neural (β-tubulin III positive) and glial (GFAP positive) progenitor cells. An examination of the effects of melatonin on neurotrophin expression revealed that low physiological concentrations of this hormone caused a significant induction of GDNF mRNA expression in NSCs following treatment for 24 hours. Conclusions The phenotypic characteristics of C 17. 2 cells suggest that they are a heterogeneous population of NSCs including both neural and glial progenitors, as observed under the cell culture conditions used in this study. These NSCs have an intrinsic ability to express neurotrophic factors, with an apparent suppression of GDNF expression after several days in culture. The detection of melatonin receptors in neural stem/progenitor cells suggests involvement of this pleiotropic hormone in mammalian neurodevelopment. Moreover, the ability of melatonin to induce GDNF expression in C 17. 2 cells supports a functional role for the MT 1 receptor expressed in these NSCs. In view of the potency of GDNF in promoting the survival of dopaminergic neurons, these novel findings have implications for the utilization of melatonin in neuroprotective strategies, especially in Parkinson's disease. </p...|$|R
