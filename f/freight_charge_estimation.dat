40|$|Our paper empirically {{investigates the}} {{structure}} of transport costs for interregional trade, by using the micro-data of <b>freight</b> <b>charge.</b> We focus on road transport, reflecting the fact that trucking has a dominant share in transporting goods between regions in many countries (in Japan, 91. 2 % of overall domestic freight volume in 2005). An advantage of our method is that our data represent the costs actually incurred by shippers or carriers, unlike those based on indirect information, or constructed data. Another feature of our paper is to consider the cost structure of each shipment. This {{is in contrast to}} many other studies using firm-level data. We present a microeconomic model of inter-regional freight transportation based on careful formulation of cost structure in trucking firm and market equilibrium. We consider that output of transportation service is a bundle of multiple characteristics, such as distance (d), volume (q) and time (t). This is different from the conventional definition of output variable in transportation, i. e., the product of quantity and distance (q*d, according to the above notations). We derive the <b>freight</b> <b>charge</b> equation for empirical analysis based on the market equilibrium, which is derived in a similar manner to the hedonic theory. We use the micro-data from the 2005 Net Freight Flow Census (NFFC), in which information on <b>freight</b> <b>charge</b> and other variables for individual shipment (origin, destination, volume, shipping time) are obtained. The data for other explanatory variables such as distance, toll payment and wage are obtained from various sources. By estimating the parameters of <b>freight</b> <b>charge</b> equation, we investigate the effects of various factors on the level of <b>freight</b> <b>charge.</b> We also examine the existence of scale economies with respect to lot size (weight) and long-haul economies: transport cost per unit weight is decreasing with weight; transport cost per distance is decreasing with distance. Main results are summarized as follows. (1) There are very strong scale economy and long-haul economy: elasticity of <b>freight</b> <b>charge</b> with respect to lot size and distance evaluated around the sample mean are - 0. 55 and 0. 60, respectively. Consequently, the unit <b>freight</b> <b>charges</b> have similar values if the values of q*d are the same. This suggests that the conventional definition of output, ton km, {{turns out to be a}} good approximation. (2) Degree of market competition (represented by the number of trucking firms per 1000 population) has significant effect on freight charge: elasticity is 0. 09...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} measuring the values of time cost for freight transportation, and examines its applicability through empirical analysis. We develop the method based on the hedonic approach by explicitly formulating how transport time is determined as market outcome. In the model, the <b>freight</b> <b>charge,</b> the price of transportation services, is determined through interaction in the transport market, where shippers demand and carriers supply transport services. We assume that shippers {{are willing to pay}} higher price for faster delivery, which requires additional cost for carriers. Consequently equilibrium <b>freight</b> <b>charge</b> tends to be higher for shorter transport time, such as express delivery fee in postal service. Output of transport service is a bundle of multiple attributes such as quantity, distance, and transport time, thereby <b>freight</b> <b>charge</b> is also a function of multiple attributes. Our model distinguish between the transport technology and firm's effort for reducing transport time: the former is exogenous for firms, and for the market. This formulation has a merit that the effects of technological change (including infrastructure improvement) are more rigorously evaluated: equilibrium transport time under new technology is determined in the market where transport firms choose the level of effort in response to technological change. We estimate the parameters of <b>freight</b> <b>charge</b> function, using microdata from the 2005 Net Freight Flow Census (NFFC), in which information on <b>freight</b> <b>charge,</b> weight, origin and destination, and transport time for individual shipment are obtained. Based on the estimated <b>freight</b> <b>charge</b> function, we obtain the values of transport time for shippers (VTTS) as implicit price in the hedonic theory. We further present a method to evaluate the welfare effect of time-saving technological change based on the hedonic approach. We obtain the estimates of value of time for various combinations of distance (d) and shipment size (weight, q). The value of time is larger as transport distance is shorter, or as shipment size is smaller. Around the sample mean (d = 200, q = 4), the value is 1, 232 Yen/hour (for time designated delivery) and 1, 966 Yen/hour (without time designation). These values are smaller than those estimated by the willingness to pay method (2, 606 Yen and 1, 972 Yen) based on discrete choice model of expressway use. We apply the method to evaluate the benefit of time-reducing technological change (including infrastructure improvement) based on hedonic approach to evaluation of expressway construction. Then we compare the results with those obtained by the existing methods. The results suggest that the benefits calculated by our method tend to be larger than those based on the other methods...|$|R

The estimated values of transport time for shippers are larger than those obtained by the widely adopted method based on the discrete choice model.

40|$|Today's {{automotive}} industry is undergoing {{significant changes in}} technology due to economic, political and environmental pressures. The shift from conventional internal combustion vehicles to hybrid and plug in hybrid electric vehicles brings with it a new host of technical challenges. As the vehicles become more electrified, and the batteries become larger, there are many difficulties facing the battery integration including both embedded control and supervisory control. A very important aspect of Li-Ion battery integration is the state estimation of the battery. State estimation can include multiple states, however {{the two most important}} are the state of charge and state of health of the battery. Determining an accurate state of <b>charge</b> <b>estimation</b> of a battery has been an important part of consumer electronics for years now [1]. In small portable electronics, the state of charge of the battery is used to determine the time remaining on the current battery charge. Although difficult, the estimation is simplified by the relatively low charge and discharge currents (approximately + 3 C) of the devices and the non-dynamic duty cycle. Hybrid vehicle battery packs can reach much higher charge and discharge currents (+ 20 C) [2]. This higher current combined with a very dynamic duty cycle, large changes in temperature, longer periods without usage and long life requirements make state of <b>charge</b> <b>estimation</b> in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) much more difficult. There have been a host of methods employed by various previous authors. One of the most important factors in state of <b>charge</b> <b>estimation</b> is having an accurate estimation of the actual capacity (depending on state of health) of the battery at any time [3]. Without having an understanding of the state of health of the battery, the state of <b>charge</b> <b>estimation</b> can vary greatly. This paper proposes a state of charge and state of health estimation based on a dual Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Employing an EKF for the state estimation of the battery pack not only allows for enhanced accuracy of the estimation but allows the control engineer to develop vehicle performance criteria based not only on the state of <b>charge</b> <b>estimation,</b> but also the state of health...|$|R
