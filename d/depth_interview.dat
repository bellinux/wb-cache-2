40|$|In this manuscript, {{the authors}} discuss using paired <b>depth</b> <b>interviews</b> {{as a method}} of {{collecting}} qualitative data. Paired depth interviewing—also known as paired interviewing—is defined as one researcher interviewing two people together (Houssart 2 ̆ 6 Evens, 2011) for the purposes of collecting information about how the pair perceives the same event or phenomenon (Arksey, 1996). Although this form of interviewing has much potential as a data collection tool, it has received scant attention in the qualitative research literature. Thus, {{the purpose of this article}} is to provide a framework for using paired <b>depth</b> <b>interviews</b> {{as a method of}} collecting qualitative data. In this manuscript, we define and describe paired <b>depth</b> <b>interviews,</b> discuss conceptualizations of paired <b>depth</b> <b>interviews</b> using Roulston’s (2010) framework, delineate the strengths and limitations of paired <b>depth</b> <b>interviews,</b> and provide examples of paired <b>depth</b> <b>interviews</b> utilized in helping professions. Furthermore, we present a case study of original work that illustrates the utility of paired <b>depth</b> <b>interviews</b> and provide suggestions for future directions for paired <b>depth</b> <b>interviews...</b>|$|R
