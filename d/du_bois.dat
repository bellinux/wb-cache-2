5|$|In 1932, <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> was {{selected}} by several philanthropies– including the Phelps-Stokes Fund, the Carnegie Corporation, and the General Education Board– to be the managing editor for a proposed Encyclopedia of the Negro, a work <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> had been contemplating for 30 years. After several years of planning and organizing, the philanthropies cancelled the project in 1938, because some board members believed that <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> was too biased to produce an objective encyclopedia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1894, <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> {{received}} several job offers, including one from the prestigious Tuskegee Institute; he accepted a teaching job at Wilberforce University in Ohio.Lewis, p. 111. At Wilberforce, <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> was strongly influenced by Alexander Crummell, who believed that ideas and morals are necessary tools to effect social change.

40|$|This essay {{originally}} {{appeared in}} Representation and Decoration in a Postmodern Age, edited by Alfred Hornung and Rüdiger Kunow (Heidelberg: Universitätsverlag Winter, 2009), 65 – 96. Günter H. Lenz’s important essay focuses on W. E. B. <b>Du</b> <b>Bois’s</b> education and experiences in Germany. Tracing <b>Du</b> <b>Bois’s</b> time in Germany, from his university years there (1892 – 1894) to his visits in the 1920 s and 1930 s, {{and finally to}} his last stay in 1958 when he received an honorary doctorate in Berlin, Lenz’s analysis of <b>Du</b> <b>Bois’s</b> work indicates how political factors and social change in Germany influenced and transformed <b>Du</b> <b>Bois’s</b> interpretation of the US but also shifted the ground of <b>Du</b> <b>Bois’s</b> critique to the larger forces of global imperialism and colonialism. Moving from a study of The Souls of Black Folk (1903) through {{an analysis of the}} less popular Dark Princess (1928) and on to essays and books such as Color and Democracy: Colonies and Peace (1945), Lenz develops an argument for reading <b>Du</b> <b>Bois’s</b> “radical cosmopolitanism” as “an open, trans (and post-) national, diasporic discourse that acknowledges and negotiates intercultural multiplicity, heterogeneous interests and positions, and hybrid publics. ...|$|R

Surprising many NAACP leaders, <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> jumped into the job with vigor and determination. During the 10 years while <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> was away from the NAACP, its income had increased fourfold, and its membership had soared to 325,000 members.|$|E
5|$|While visiting Ghana in 1960, <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> {{spoke with}} its {{president}} about {{the creation of}} a new encyclopedia of the African diaspora, the Encyclopedia Africana. In early 1961, Ghana notified <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> that they had appropriated funds to support the encyclopedia project, and they invited <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> to come to Ghana and manage the project there. In October 1961, at the age of 93, <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> and his wife traveled to Ghana to take up residence and commence work on the encyclopedia. In early 1963, the United States refused to renew his passport, so he made the symbolic gesture of becoming a citizen of Ghana. While it is sometimes stated that he renounced his U.S. citizenship at that time, and he did state his intention to do so, <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> never actually did. His health declined during the two years he was in Ghana, and he died on August 27, 1963, in the capital of Accra at the age of 95. <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> was buried in Accra near his home, which is now the <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> Memorial Centre. A day after his death, at the March on Washington, speaker Roy Wilkins asked the hundreds of thousands of marchers to honor <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> with a moment of silence. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, embodying many of the reforms <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> had campaigned for his entire life, was enacted almost a year after his death.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> {{attended}} a New England Congregational {{church as a}} child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> described himself as agnostic or a freethinker, {{but at least one}} biographer concluded that <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> was virtually an atheist.Lewis, p. 550 (agnostic, atheist).Johnson, passim (agnostic). However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded that he had a religious voice, albeit radically different from other African-American religious voices of his era, and inaugurated a 20th-century spirituality to which Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and James Baldwin also belong.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> and the NAACP shifted support {{back and forth between}} the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E
5|$|<b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> {{was married}} twice, first to Nina Gomer (m. 1896, d. 1950), {{with whom he}} had two children, a son Burghardt (who died as an infant) and a {{daughter}} Yolande, who married Countee Cullen. As a widower, he married Shirley Graham (m. 1951, d. 1977), an author, playwright, composer and activist. She brought her son David Graham to the marriage. David grew close to <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> and took his stepfather's name; he also worked for African-American causes. The historian David Levering Lewis wrote that <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> engaged in several extramarital relationships.|$|E
40|$|W. E. B. <b>Du</b> <b>Bois’s</b> Dark Princess (1928) pointedly uses Spirituals and dandyism to {{interrogate}} cultural hierarchies. This essay highlights the shared genealogy between early twentieth-century African American writing and two bifurcating branches of nineteenth-century dandyism: the European tradition of Baudelaire and Wilde and the blackface {{tradition of the}} minstrel show. Tracing these lines of transmission reveals an unexamined embranchment of literary modernity’s family tree and demonstrates how <b>Du</b> <b>Bois’s</b> novel repurposes this legacy for the twentieth century...|$|R
40|$|The essay {{argues that}} Nella Larsen’s first novel, Quicksand (1928), is an intertextual {{revision}} of W. E. B. <b>Du</b> <b>Bois’s</b> The Quest of the Silver Fleece (1911). In Quicksand Larsen registers the clothing and color symbolism running through <b>Du</b> <b>Bois’s</b> novel to articulate her {{critique of the}} gender politics such symbolism enshrines. Exploring this previously neglected intertextual relationship enables a deeper appreciation and revises traditional scholarly assessments of both novels, foregrounding the political significance of Larsen’s fiction and illuminating the critically underestimated literariness of The Quest of the Silver Fleece...|$|R
25|$|Throughout his career, Walter White {{spoke out}} against {{segregation}} and discrimination but also black nationalism. Most notably, White and <b>Du</b> <b>Bois's</b> 1934 conflict was over the latter's endorsement of blacks' voluntary separation within US society.|$|R
5|$|Nine {{years after}} the 1917 Russian Revolution, <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> {{extended}} a trip to Europe to include {{a visit to the}} Soviet Union. <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> was struck by the poverty and disorganization he encountered in the Soviet Union, yet was impressed by the intense labors of the officials and by the recognition given to workers. Although <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> was not yet familiar with the communist theories of Karl Marx or Vladimir Lenin, he concluded that socialism may be a better path towards racial equality than capitalism.|$|E

5|$|The Crisis carried editorials by <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> that {{supported}} the ideals of unionized labor but excoriated the racism demonstrated by its leaders, who systematically excluded blacks from membership. <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> also supported {{the principles of the}} Socialist Party (he was briefly a member of the party from 1910 to 1912), but he denounced the racism demonstrated by some socialist leaders.Lewis, p. 275 (denounced).

The conference celebrated their independence, as the nations began to assert their power as non-aligned nations during the Cold War. In 1958, <b>Du</b> <b>Bois</b> regained his passport, and with his second wife, Shirley Graham <b>Du</b> <b>Bois,</b> he traveled around the world, visiting Russia and China.
