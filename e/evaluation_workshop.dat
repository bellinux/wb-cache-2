5000|$|The Cross-lingual WSD {{task was}} {{introduced}} in the SemEval-2007 <b>evaluation</b> <b>workshop</b> and re-proposed in the SemEval-2013 workshop [...] [...] To facilitate the ease of integrating WSD systems into other Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as Machine Translation and multilingual Information Retrieval, the cross-lingual WSD evaluation task was introduced a language-independent and knowledge-lean approach to WSD. The task is an unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation task for English nouns by means of parallel corpora. It follows the lexical-sample variant of the Classic WSD task, restricted to only 20 polysemous nouns.|$|E

40|$|Is the {{potential}} for 'knowledge-transforming' writing in study skills, enhanced, or not, using e-learning in LAMS (Learner Activity Management systems) and Moodle Course Management system? In 2005, the Universities of Greenwich, Oxford and Kent piloted learning design <b>evaluation</b> <b>workshops</b> for the JISC-funded e-Learning Independent Study Award (eLISA) project, building on a University/Local Education Authority partnership tackling low attainment. The pilot aims to transform study materials into reusable open source e-learning resources for learners and teachers. Influenced by government research findings that study skills improve achievement, the team was keen to discover if e-learning can augment this effect. Scaffolding techniques supporting learning through 'knowledge transforming' activities were amongst social constructivist research concepts underpinning our analysis of initial <b>evaluation</b> <b>workshops.</b> This paper reflects on Phase 1 results from workshops with learners and teachers using LAMS with Moodle, exploring whether e-learning can stimulate knowledge transformation through 'separate' and 'connected' writing activities...|$|R

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{information}} are being accumulated nowadays due {{to the use of}} information systems in construction firms. Among them, the reusable legacy information can be referred to as ‘information resources’ and two approaches have been adopted to utilize them, i. e. to utilize them by using general- purpose software such as Microsoft Office, or by using specialized software such as BI (Business Intelligence) software. Identifying and representing the information resources is the essential step in both approaches. This research identified decision activities and information resource items through literature reviews and two expert workshops: an <b>evaluation</b> <b>workshop</b> and a verification workshop. The reusability of information resource items was evaluated in the <b>evaluation</b> <b>workshop</b> and validated in the verification workshop. A way to represent information resources by using IFC was formulated and an extension of IFC was developed and validated based on the analysis of information resources. This research will benefit construction firms in utilizing the information resources more effectively and efficiently to support decision- making in their project and enterprise management...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focuses on}} the {{integration}} of acoustic and visual information for people tracking. The system presented relies on a proba-bilistic framework within which information from multiple sources is in-tegrated at an intermediate stage.
