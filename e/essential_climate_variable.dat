Here we describe the global land cover and land use reference data derived from the Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing platform via four campaigns.

This assessment highlighted specific needs in terms of land cover characterization, accuracy of products, as well as stability and consistency needs that are currently not met or even addressed.

40|$|River runoff is an <b>essential</b> <b>climate</b> <b>variable</b> {{as it is}} {{directly}} linked to the terrestrial water balance and controls {{a wide range of}} climatological and ecological processes. Despite its scientific and societal importance, there are to date no pan-European observation-based runoff estimates available.

For this we first assemble an unprecedented collection of river flow observations, combining information from three distinct data bases. Observed monthly runoff rates are first tested for homogeneity and then related to gridded atmospheric variables (E-OBS version 12) using machine learning. The resulting statistical model is then used to estimate monthly runoff rates (December 1950 - December 2015) on a 0. 5 ° x 0. 5 ° grid. The performance of the newly derived runoff estimates is assessed in terms of cross validation. The paper closes with example applications, illustrating the potential of the new runoff estimates for climatological assessments and drought monitoring...|$|E

We investigated how the relationships between forest variables and albedo change seasonally and along latitudinal gradients in the forest biomes of Finland between 60 ° and 70 ° N. We observed an increase in forest albedo with increasing latitude in winter but not in summer. Also, relationships between forest variables and the black-sky albedo or directional–hemispherical reflectance (DHR) at different latitudes were tighter in winter than in summer, especially for forest biomass. Summer albedo was only weakly correlated with the traditional inventory variables. Our findings suggest that the relationships between forest variables and DHR depend on latitude...|$|E

We present an algo-rithm, SnowCover, for mapping snow cover from polar orbiting optical sensors with frequent (~daily) repeat passes. The algorithm is based on a new time series filter, adaptive to local cloud conditions, and pixel wise calibration of snow and snow free end members. SnowCover was ap-plied to a 1 km resolution climate data archive of NOAA AVHRR data over the Western Arctic to produce daily snow cover maps from 1982 to present with, on average, 90 % temporal coverage. Comparison of the maps with snow cover estimates derived from 83 in-situ long term snow depth sites in Canada indicate year round agreement rates above of 90 % at the 50 %ile (85 % at the 95 %ile).

The ESA CCI aims at providing global long-term satellite-based products tailored to the need of the climate modelling community. In the framework of the CCI-LC project, the LC concept was revisited in order to reconcile the LC users’ divergent needs for both stable/consistent global LC products over time and a more dynamic description of the land surface processes. Three global CCI-LC seasonality products were therefore generated in response to the need for dynamic information. These climatologies describe the average behaviour of the green vegetation phenology, the burned areas and snow occurrences over the 1999 - 2012 period. They are based on existing products, independent sensors, spatio-temporal resolutions and algorithms. The integration of 13 or 14 years of observations allows characterizing the land surface even in the cloudiest regions of the world. These CCI-LC seasonality products, thanks to a processing step of compliance, can be used together and with the CCI-LC Maps to describe the land surface in a detailed and consistent manner...|$|E

Such a diagnosis is helpful to identify strengths and weaknesses of each data set that may vary in time and introduce uncertainties in long-term trend estimates. The analysis reveals that the relative drift between the sensors is not statistically significant for most pairs of instruments. The relative drift values can be used to estimate the added uncertainty in physical trends. The added drift uncertainty is estimated at about 3 % decade − 1 (1 σ).
