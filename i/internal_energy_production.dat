40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} and sustainability of an anaerobic green gas production pathway was evaluated, taking into account five biomass feedstocks, optimization of the green gas production pathway, replacement of current waste management pathways by mitigation, and transport of the feedstocks. Sustainability is expressed by three main factors: efficiency in (Process) Energy Returned On Invested (P) EROI, carbon footprint in Global Warming Potential GWP(100), and environmental impact in EcoPoints. The green gas production pathway operates on a mass fraction of 50 % feedstock with 50 % manure. The sustainability of the analyzed feedstocks differs substantially, favoring biomass waste flows over, the specially cultivated energy crop, maize. The use of optimization, {{in the shape of}} <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>production,</b> green gas powered trucks, and mitigation can significantly improve the sustainability for all feedstocks, but favors waste materials. Results indicate a possible improvement from an average (P) EROI for all feedstocks of 2. 3 up to an average of 7. 0 GJ/GJ The carbon footprint can potentially be reduced from an average of 40 down to 18 kgCO(2) eq/GJ. The environmental impact can potentially be reduced from an average of 5. 6 down to 1. 8 Pt/GJ. <b>Internal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> proved to be the most effective optimization. However, the use of optimization aforementioned will result in les green gas injected into the gas grid as it is partially consumed internally. Overall, the feedstock straw was the most energy efficient, where the feedstock harvest remains proved to be the most environmentally sustainable. Furthermore, transport distances of all feedstocks should not exceed 150 km or emissions and environmental impacts will surpass those of natural gas, used as a reference. Using green gas as a fuel can increase the acceptable transportation range to over 300 km. Within the context aforementioned and from an {{energy efficiency}} and sustainable point of view, the anaerobic digestion process should be utilized for processing locally available waste feedstocks with the added advantage of producing energy, which should first be used internally for powering the green gas production process.

Three channels appear to be significant: (CCl 2) 2 +->CCl+(X 1 Sigma+) +Cl+(3 P) (channel 1); (CCl 2) 2 +->CCl+(X 1 Sigma+) +Cl+(1 D) (channel 2); (CCl 2) 2 +->(Cl 2) +(X 2 Pig) +C+(2 P). The second channel becomes dominant at high <b>internal</b> <b>energy.</b> <b>Production</b> of ground state fragments (channel 1) involves a transition driven by spin-orbit coupling from the (CCl 2) 2 + X 1 Sigma+g state to the (CCl 2) 2 + a 3 Sigma-u state {{en route to the}} fragments. The dissociation barrier for the production of the ground state fragments from the ground electronic state of (CCl 2) 2 + via the spin-orbit-induced transition is equal to 420 kJ/mol. The dissociation pathway that corresponds to channel 3 includes a first isomerization step from the linear (Cl-C-Cl) 2 + structure to a bent (Cl-C-Cl) 2 + connectivity. The calculated isomerization barrier amounts to 550 kJ/mol. The calculated reverse activation barriers are compatible with the measured kinetic energy released on the fragments. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The physically relevant case of the temperature dynamics {{in the presence of}} Joule heating via the dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy is selected and analysed by theoretical and numerical means. In particular, the sensitivity of the temperature decay to the non-dimensional parameters Prandtl number (Pr) and Eckert number (Ec), the latter measuring the intensity of the <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> mechanism, is investigated. The time behaviour of the global quantities such as the temperature variance θ 2 ¯¯¯(t) and its destruction rate εθ(t) is analysed, and a detailed analysis of the temperature variance spectrum Eθ(k) is provided. In the case of a very strong heating mechanism, some important modifications of the temperature dynamics are observed. The time-decay-law exponents of the global physical quantities assume new values, which are governed only by features of the kinetic energy spectrum, while they depend on the shape of Eθ(k) in the classical free-decay case. The temperature variance spectrum Eθ(k) exhibits two new spectral ranges. One is a convective–production range such that Eθ(k) ∝k 1 / 3 is observed for a finite time at all values of Pr. In the case of very diffusive fluids with Pr≪ 1, a convective–diffusive–production range with Eθ(k) ∝k− 7 / 3 is also detected...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyze the entropy, entropy flux and entropy supply rate of {{granular}} fluids within the frameworks of the Boltzmann equation and continuum thermodynamics. It is shown that the entropy inequality for a granular gas that follows from the Boltzmann equation differs from the one of a simple fluid due {{to the presence of}} a term which can be identified as the rate of entropy supply density. From the knowledge of a non-equilibrium distribution function [...] valid for for processes closed to equilibrium and quasi-elastic restitution coefficients [...] it is obtained that the rate of entropy supply density is equal to the rate of <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> density divided by the temperature and the entropy flux is equal to the heat flux vector divided by the temperature. A thermodynamic theory of a granular fluid is also developed whose objective is the determination of the basic fields of mass density, momentum density and internal energy density. The constitutive laws are restricted by the principle of material frame indifference and by the entropy principle. Through the exploitation of the entropy principle with Lagrange multipliers, it is shown that the results obtained from the kinetic theory for granular gases concerning the rate of entropy supply density and entropy flux are valid in general for processes close to equilibrium of granular fluids, where linearized constitutive equations hold.
