50|$|Immunoglobulin {{derangements}} including <b>hypergammaglobulinemia,</b> autoantibodies, and {{circulating immune complexes}} {{are commonly}} seen.|$|E
50|$|An excess {{is known}} as <b>hypergammaglobulinemia.</b> A {{deficiency}} {{is known as}} hypogammaglobulinemia.|$|E
5000|$|MeSH {{considers}} hyper IgM syndrome to {{be a form}} of dysgammaglobulinemia, not a form of <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> [...]|$|E
50|$|Autoimmune disease. Classically Sjögren's syndrome, {{but it is}} also {{associated}} with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and even <b>hypergammaglobulinemia.</b> Hypokalaemia is often severe in these cases.|$|E
50|$|The {{classical}} laboratory {{finding is}} polyclonal <b>hypergammaglobulinemia,</b> and other immunoglobulin derangements are also seen, including hemolytic anemia with cold agglutinins, circulating immune complexes, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, and positive rheumatoid factor.|$|E
50|$|Autoimmune {{thrombocytopenia}} and anemia sometimes seen {{in patients}} with SMZL. Circulating villous lymphocytes are sometimes observed in peripheral blood samples. A monoclonal paraprotein is detected in a third of patients without <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> or hyperviscosity.|$|E
5000|$|These {{disorders}} are subdivided into three main classes, which are lymphoproliferative disorders, <b>hypergammaglobulinemia,</b> and paraproteinemia. The first is cellular, {{and the other}} two are humoral (however, humoral excess can be secondary to cellular excess.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypergammaglobulinemia</b> is a {{condition}} that {{is characterized by the}} increased levels of a certain immunoglobulin in the blood serum. The name of the disorder refers to an excess of proteins after serum protein electrophoresis (found in the gammaglobulin region).|$|E
50|$|The {{clinical}} {{symptoms are}} caused by abnormalities {{of the immune system}} and disruption of basic cellular functions. Patients show markedly decreased circulating T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells, with severely reduced naive T cells and <b>hypergammaglobulinemia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hypergammaglobulinemia</b> is {{characterized}} by increased levels of immunoglobulins in the blood serum. Five different hypergammaglobulinemias are caused by an excess of immunoglobulin M (IgM), and some types are caused by a deficiency in the other major types of immunoglobulins.|$|E
50|$|Most hypergammaglobulinemias {{are caused}} by an excess of {{immunoglobulin}} M (IgM), {{because this is the}} default immunoglobulin type prior to class switching. Some types of <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> are actually caused by a deficiency in the other major types of immunoglobulins, which are IgA, IgE and IgG.|$|E
50|$|Nonspecific reactions, <b>hypergammaglobulinemia,</b> or the {{presence}} of antibodies directed to other infectious agents that may be antigenically similar to HIV can produce false positive results. Autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, have also rarely caused false positive results. Most false negative results are due to the window period.|$|E
5000|$|Lymphoproliferative {{disorders}} (LPDs) {{refer to}} several {{conditions in which}} lymphocytes are produced in excessive quantities. They typically occur in {{people who have a}} compromised immune system. They are sometimes equated with [...] "immunoproliferative disorders", but technically lymphoproliferative disorders are a subset of immunoproliferative disorders, along with <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> and paraproteinemias.|$|E
50|$|The {{secondary}} accessory in diagnosis are elevated biomarkers (plasma sFASL over 200 pg/ml, plasma IL-10 >20 pg/ml, plasma or serum vitamin B12 >1500 ng/L, Plasma IL-18 >500pg/ml) and immunohistochemical {{findings on}} biopsy consistent with ALPS {{as determined by}} an experienced hematopathologist. Another sign is autoimmune cytopenias and polyclonal <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> and {{a family history of}} ALPS or non-malignant lymphoproliferation.|$|E
50|$|A {{diagnosis}} {{can only}} be definitively made after genetic testing {{to look for a}} mutation in the DOCK8 gene. However, it can be suspected with a high IgE level and eosinophilia. Other suggestive laboratory findings include decreased numbers of B cells, T cells, and NK cells; and <b>hypergammaglobulinemia.</b> It can be distinguished from autosomal dominant hyper-IgE (STAT3 deficiency) because people with DOCK8 deficiency have low levels of IgM and an impaired secondary immune response. IgG and IgA levels are usually normal to high. It can be distinguished from the similar X-linked Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome by the presence of thrombocytopenia and the consequent bloody diarrhea, as well as its pattern of inheritance. WHIM syndrome, caused by a mutation in CXCR4, is associated with similar chronic cutaneous viral infections.|$|E
50|$|Abnormal {{blood tests}} are frequent, {{accounting}} for over 50% of cases, {{but is not}} diagnostic. Lymphopenia {{is the most common}} blood anomaly in sarcoidosis. Anemia occurs in about 20% of people with sarcoidosis. Leukopenia is less common and occurs in even fewer persons but is rarely severe. Thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia are fairly rare. In the absence of splenomegaly, leukopenia may reflect bone marrow involvement, but the most common mechanism is a redistribution of blood T cells to sites of disease. Other nonspecific findings include monocytosis, occurring in the majority of sarcoidosis cases, increased hepatic enzymes or alkaline phosphatase. People with sarcoidosis often have immunologic anomalies like allergies to test antigens such as Candida or purified protein derivative (PPD). Polyclonal <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> is also a fairly common immunologic anomaly seen in sarcoidosis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{immunoglobulins}} or antibodies {{are generally}} the only proteins {{present in the}} normal gamma region. Of note, any protein migrating in the gamma region will be stained and appear on the gel, which may include protein contaminants, artifacts, or certain medications. Depending on whether an agarose or capillary method is used, interferences vary. Immunoglobulins consist of heavy chains, (IgA, IgM, IgG, IgE and IgD) and light chains (kappa and lambda). A normal gamma zone should appear as a smooth 'blush,' or smear, with no asymmetry or sharp peaks. [...] The gamma globulins may be elevated (<b>hypergammaglobulinemia),</b> decreased (hypogammaglobulinaemia), or have an abnormal peak or peaks. Note that immunoglobulins may be {{also be found in}} other zones; IgA typically migrates in the beta-gamma zone, and in particular, pathogenenic immunoglobins may migrate anywhere, including the alpha regions.|$|E
40|$|SummaryB {{lymphocyte}} hyperactivation {{and elevated}} immunoglobulin levels (<b>hypergammaglobulinemia)</b> are pathogenic manifestations of HIV- 1 infection. Here we {{provide evidence that}} these hallmarks are caused by a soluble factor whose production by infected macrophages is induced by the HIV- 1 Nef protein. In vitro, HIV- 1 -infected macrophages or macrophages expressing Nef promoted B cell activation and differentiation to immunoglobulin-secreting cells. Nef-mediated activation of NF-κB in macrophages induced secretion of the acute-phase protein ferritin, and ferritin was necessary and sufficient for the observed Nef-dependent B cell changes. The extent of <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> in HIV- 1 -infected individuals correlated directly with plasma ferritin levels and with viral load. Furthermore, the induction of ferritin production and <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> was recapitulated when Nef was specifically expressed in macrophages and T cells of transgenic mice. Collectively, {{these results indicate that}} the HIV- 1 Nef protein carries a pathogenic determinant that governs B cell defects in HIV- 1 infection...|$|E
40|$|Isolated {{cutaneous}} plasmacytosis (CP) {{is a rare}} entity {{with few}} cases reported in world literature. CP masquerading as hidradenitis suppurativa like presentation is a unique case with some features differentiating it clinically from it which were further confirmed by histopathology and immunostaining. Our case showed hyperplasia of mature plasma cells and polyclonal <b>hypergammaglobulinemia,</b> immunostaining for CD 138 positivity and kappa: lambda ratio more than 3 : 1. Extensive clinical and laboratory investigations failed to reveal any underlying pathology, presence of any underlying disease accompanying the <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> and/or plasma cell proliferation...|$|E
40|$|We studied how {{combination}} antiviral therapy affects B cell abnormalities {{associated with}} HIV- 1 infection, namely elevated circulating immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody-secreting cell (ASC) frequencies and <b>hypergammaglobulinemia.</b> Within {{a few weeks}} of starting antiviral therapy, there is a marked decline in IgG-ASC frequency in both acutely and chronically infected people, whereas the <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> often present during chronic infection is more gradually resolved. These reductions are sustained while HIV- 1 replication is suppressed. HIV- 1 antigen–specific B cell responses are also affected by therapy, manifested by a rapid decline in circulating gp 120 -specific ASCs. Anti-gp 120 titers slowly decrease in chronically infected individuals and usually fail to mature in acutely infected individuals who were promptly treated with antiretroviral therapy. Long-term nonprogressors have high titer antibody responses to HIV- 1 antigens, but no detectable gp 120 -specific IgG-ASC, and normal (or subnormal) levels of total circulating IgG-ASC. Overall, we conclude that HIV- 1 infection drives B cell hyperactivity, and that this polyclonal activation is rapidly responsive to decreases in viral replication caused by combination antiviral therapy.

40|$|We {{report a}} 58 -year-old woman who {{presented}} with acute quadriparesis, bulbar weakness, atrial fibrillation, ventricular ectopics, and distal {{renal tubular acidosis}} with severe hypokalemia.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{mechanism}} of <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> from {{a point of view}} of T and B cell functions, the appearance rate of Ig-containing cells and the amount of Ig synthesized after stimulation of pokeweed mitogen (PWM) in the mixed culture of T and B cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined by immunofluorescent antibody technique and solid-phase radioimmunoassay, respectively. Diseases with monoclonal gammopathy and polyclonal <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> were studied. 1) In normal control subjects, the appearance rate of PWM-induced Ig-containing cells and concentrations of synthesized Ig showed no significant difference between autologous and allogeneic culture systems. 2) In patients with multiple myeloma (MM), both the appearance rate of the cells and the concentrations of all classes of Ig were significantly lower than those of normal control. T cells were considered to display a suppressive function in a mixed culture of patient-T and normal-B cells and to exert an effect on the function and differentiation of B cells in this disease. 3) In contrast to MM, T cells in patients with essential benign monoclonal gammopathy (BMG) exhibited a less suppressive function. However, a remarkable suppressive effect was observed in T cells from patients with BMG accompanied with cancer, malignant lymphoma or Sjogren syndrome. These findings may indicate the differences of T and B cell functions among clinical types of BMG. 4) As to polyclonal <b>hypergammaglobulinemia,</b> there was an increase in concentrations of synthesized Ig in both autologous and allogeneic culture systems in patients with liver cirrhosis, suggesting a hyperfunction of T and B cells. Similar findings were observed in patients with chronic active hepatitis. 5) T cells in patients with RA exhibited suppressor functions on the appearance rate of Ig-containing cells. In patients with SLE in an active stage, T cells showed a helper function on. Ig synthesis, whereas in the inactive stage B cell functions were found to increase. In polyclonal <b>hypergammaglobulinemia,</b> merely the results of Ig-containing cells and synthesized Ig did not seem relevant directly to the cause of <b>hypergammaglobulinemia.</b> Further studies regarding the relations of these results to surface Ig on B cell and local Ig production in tissue lesions will be required...|$|E

40|$|A 73 -year-old {{woman with}} a long history of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis and polyclonal <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> developed a solitary mass in the tongue, which on morphologic and immunohistochemical analyses was consistent with crystal-storing histiocytosis, a rare condition commonly described in association with clonal lymphoplasmacytic disorders. The lesion consisted of a localized collection of histiocytes filled with numerous eosinophilic crystals immunoreactive for both kappa and lambda light chain and gamma heavy chain antibodies. Mature lymphocytes and plasma cells were present both throughout and around the lesion. Since a clonal lymphoplasmacytic neoplasm was ruled out by clinical and immunohistochemical studies, we consider that, in this case, crystal-storing histiocytosis was consequent to polyclonal <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> and suggest that this rare histiocytosis is not specific to lymphoplasmacytic neoplasms, but may represent a reaction to high values of normal (or abnormal) immunoglobulins...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Sinus {{histiocytosis}} {{with massive}} lymphadenopathy is an infrequent, self-resolving histo-proliferative disorder of benign nature, {{also known as}} Rosai–Dorfman Disease. The typical manifestation of this disease includes bilateral, progressive cervical lymphadenopathy along with pyrexia. Laboratory manifestations consist of raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocytosis and <b>hypergammaglobulinemia.</b> Case report: An 8 year old female child presented with progressive, painful cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy of three months duration. There was polymorphic leukocytosis and anemia along with raised Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and <b>hypergammaglobulinemia.</b> Fine Needle Aspiration cytology revealed sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, which was confirmed by the cervical lymph node biopsy. The histopathology revealed dilated sinuses filled with lympho plasma cells, large histiocytes and engulfed neutrophils (Emperipolesis). Conclusion: Massive, progressive bilateral cervical and sub mandibular lymphadenopathy, suggesting Sinus histiocytosis and massive lymphadenopathy-Rosai–Dorfman Disease. This was confirmed by Cytology, histopathology and immuno- histochemistry...|$|E
40|$|Pseudohyponatremia {{refers to}} low serum sodium in the {{presence}} of normal plasma tonicity. Whereas pseudohyponatremia secondary to hyperlipidemia is a commonly recognized occurrence, falsely low sodium levels secondary to elevated protein are less frequently observed. We present in this paper the case of a man coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C who had pseudohyponatremia from <b>hypergammaglobulinemia.</b> As <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> is a frequent occurrence in both HIV and HCV, we suggest that pseudohyponatremia is an important and likely underdiagnosed phenomenon in this patient population. Clinicians {{need to be aware of}} the electrolyte exclusion effect and become familiar with the techniques used by their local laboratory in the measurement of serum electrolytes. Pseudohyponatremia should also be included in the differential diagnosis of an elevated osmolal gap, as the falsely lowered sodium level will lead to a falsely low calculated serum osmolality...|$|E

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} Aleutian disease (AD) of mink {{is characterized}} by <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> and lesions resembling many of those described in hypersensitivity or autoimmune diseases (1, 2, 7). There are segmental vasculitis; fibrinoid deposition in arterial walls and glomeruli; and marked perivascular and parenchymal lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration. Henson et al. (1) reported absolute increases in serum gamma globulin and total protein and decreased albumin in mink with the natural disease. Studies of mink on an affected ranch have shown a familial occurrence of <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> (3). Mink homozygous recessive for the Aleutian gene symbolized as (aa) are the usual genotype spontaneously affected, but the disease occasionally occurs in those which are heterozygous (Aa) or homozygous dominant (AA). When these genotypes are present on an affected ranch, the incidence is highest in aa mink. Field observations suggest a marked increase of AD particularly in aa min...|$|E

40|$|A {{disease in}} mink has been {{discovered}} that has many {{of the features of}} collagen diseases in man. Affected animals suffer from wasting with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia as well as plasma cell infiltration, <b>hypergammaglobulinemia,</b> glomerulonephritis, arteritis and amyloidosis. Cell-free filtrates and ultracentrifugates from diseased animals induced the disease in normal mink, and aleutian genotypes were unusually susceptible to infection. This genotype was characterized by abnormal lysosomal structures in all the granule-forming cells, resembling the Chediak-Higashi syndrome of man. Anti-γ-globulin factors similar to human rheumatoid factors were reported, although tests for antibodies such as ANF and LE factors have been negative. Arteritis and glomerulonephritis lesions stained positively for γ-globulin, and Coombs-type sensitized red cells have been detected in the majority of affected mink. Some mink develop a monodispersion of <b>hypergammaglobulinemia</b> resembling the serum protein changes in human myeloma.
