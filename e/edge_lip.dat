25|$|In metal, the lip and {{spur drill}} bit is {{confined}} to drilling only the thinnest and softest sheet metals in a drill press. The bits have an extremely fast cutting tool geometry: no point angle and a large (considering the flat cutting <b>edge)</b> <b>lip</b> angle causes the edges {{to take a very}} aggressive cut with relatively little point pressure. This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they have a tendency to punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind.|$|E
50|$|Ice {{accumulation}} on {{the leading}} <b>edge</b> (<b>lip)</b> of engine inlets causes flow problems {{and can lead to}} ice ingestion. In turbofan engines, laminar airflow is required at the face of the fan. Because of this, most engine ice protection systems are anti-ice systems (prevent build up).|$|E
5000|$|In {{a review}} of Once I Gazed at You in Wonder, poet Alice Fulton writes, “Jan Heller Levi's work countervails the {{implications}} of this curmudgeonly koan with passional, self-critical intelligence. Ardent yet free of gush, the spontaneity and conversational ease of her poems assure that the quality of wonder, like that of mercy, is not strained. In addition to unguardedness and heart, there is backtalk—bite and <b>edge,</b> <b>lip</b> and lash.” ...|$|E
50|$|Some notable {{examples}} of drinking horns of Dark Ages Europe {{were made of}} the horns of the Aurochs, the wild ancestor of domestic cattle which became extinct in the 17th century. These horns were carefully dressed up and their <b>edges</b> <b>lipped</b> all round with silver. The remains of a notable example were recovered from the Sutton Hoo burial.|$|R

6000|$|This huge, ceaseless breaker, {{to which}} I have so often alluded, {{was a much}} larger and more sublime object than we had at all {{imagined}} it to be. It rose many yards above {{the level of the}} sea, and could be seen approaching at some distance from the reef. Slowly and majestically it came on, acquiring greater volume and velocity as it advanced, until it assumed the form of a clear watery arch, which sparkled in the bright sun. On it came with resistless and solemn majesty, the upper <b>edge</b> <b>lipped</b> gently over, and it fell with a roar that seemed as though the heart of Ocean were broken in the crash of tumultuous water, while the foam-clad coral reef appeared to tremble beneath the mighty shock! ...|$|R
50|$|Perhaps most {{innovative}} at a conceptual level is The Sonic Mess Kit. This {{is made from}} a cinema film reel cover. The <b>edge</b> (<b>lip)</b> is scored to allow two sets (courses) of rubber bands to be strung across. The two courses are at different depths in the lid, and are mostly perpendicular (a right angle) to each other. Parallel to the lower course is a spring, divided into three segments. The tension of each rubber band and spring segment can be individually adjusted.|$|E

50|$|The married {{quarters}} are located immediately {{adjacent to the}} single men's quarters and include huts, two communal kitchens (one later converted into accommodation), a garden area, cess pits, a midden, and general laundry buildings. Former structures are marked by concrete pads. At least five huts in this section may have been occupied by single patients and follow the same pattern as that seen in the other single patients sections. Generally, the hut pads in the {{married quarters}} differ from the single patient's hut pads by {{an extension of the}} pad for a personal kitchen. Each hut pad has an <b>edge</b> <b>lip</b> (of varying width) that runs three sides of the hut pad and along the inner side of the veranda (where they exist) but not on the outer side of the veranda. Iron bed frames are scattered in the area. A 35 sqm garden area is located behind the second, more southerly, kitchen. At the south-eastern extremity of the married quarters and adjacent to a tidal creek are two possible cess pits and two rectangular concrete pads (probably general laundry building remains). There is a midden on the creek bank which contains shells of clam and oyster, brown bottle debris, ceramic fragments, metal, and assorted domestic artefacts.|$|E
50|$|In {{examining}} bowls {{found during}} an archaeological dig in North America, the anthropologist Vincas Steponaitis defines a bowl by its dimensions, writing that a bowl's diameter rarely falls under half its height and that historic bowls {{can be classified}} by their <b>edge,</b> or <b>lip,</b> and shape.|$|R

40|$|The most of {{the human}} {{emotions}} are communicated by changes {{in one or two}} of discrete facial features. Theses changes are coded as Action Units (AUs). Among the facial features mouth has most flexible deformability and it is highly complicated to track. In this paper, we develop a lip shape extraction and lip motion tracking system both in static and dynamic facial images, based on a novel two step active contours model. A knowledge based system is used for estimating initial position of mouth. An oval shaped initial active is considered inside the estimated mouth region. At the first step active contour locks onto stronger upper <b>lip</b> <b>edges</b> by using both high threshold Canny edge detector and balloon energy for contour deflation. Then using lower threshold image gradient as well as balloon energy for inflation, snake inflates and locks onto weaker lower <b>lip</b> <b>edges.</b> Extracted <b>lip</b> feature points are used to extract some geometric feature points to form a feature vector which is used to classify lip images into AUs, using Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN). Experimental results show robust edge detection and reasonable classification where an average AUs recognition rate is 85. 98 % in image sequences and 77. 44 % in static images...|$|R
5000|$|Located on the {{south-west}} side of {{the northern}} peninsula of Fantome Island, and to the south-west of the main lazaret pathway, are {{the remains of the}} single women's quarters. The site consists of concrete pads of former huts, communal kitchens, dispensary, toilet and shower blocks, and laundry. There are five rows of concrete pads representing individual huts, with three pads per row (a total of 15 huts). The pads are rectangular in shape and are roughly the same size (5 x 6 m). The pads have markings indicating a 1 m wide, open veranda on one side with an outwardly sloping floor. The veranda is oriented to the south- east or the north-west alternately so that verandas face each other. The pad has an <b>edge</b> <b>lip</b> of varying width defining the position of the former walls. Low density artefact scatters are associated with each hut. According to an oral history of a former patient, the most westerly hut in the single women's quarters was later modified for use as a [...] "lock-up" [...] for women patients. There are pads relating to two communal kitchens. Both are situated at the northern ends of the huts and between two rows. At the north end of kitchen 1 and kitchen 2 are projections which suggest the location of a stove or oven. Additional features of note include a track leading to the single men's quarters from the north-west and the nearby supply centre. Located 30 m west of the last row of hut pads are the remains of a pit toilet.|$|E

40|$|The {{acoustical}} excitation {{of instability}} waves in free shear layers is investigated theoretically and experimentally. A configuration {{with a thin}} shear layer leaving from a semi-infinite plate is considered. The excitation by sound sources in various locations, e. g., {{far away from the}} trailing edge or very near the <b>edge</b> <b>lip,</b> is analyzed. The influence of additional walls (like those in a channel) is also predicted. The theory is extended to include two streams {{on both sides of the}} shear layer having different velocities and densities. A reference quantity for the artificial excitation is suggested. The experimental data compare well with the theory. The theory does not contain any empirical constants...|$|E

40|$|The current paper {{discussed}} {{the definition of}} lip protrusion and proposed an effective method to measure the lip protrusion. Because the movement patterns for upper lip and low lip were distinct, the authors defined the low and upper lip protrusion respectively as the Euclidean distance between the <b>lip</b> <b>edge</b> and incisors. Three-dimensional lip data were obtained by catching the movement trajectory of the reference points pasted on the forehead and mandible through motion capture. The singular value decomposition(SVD) method was applied to rectify the positional information of lower and upper incisors, and this rectified information and the coordinates of the <b>lip</b> <b>edge</b> data were {{used to calculate the}} lip protrusion.
