40|$|We {{set out to}} {{determine}} the molecular mechanisms involved in the proliferative response of primary rat osteoblasts to mechanical stimulation using cell culture centrifugation {{as a model for}} hypergravity. We hypothesized that this proliferative response is mediated by specific integrin/Extracellular Matrix (ECM) interactions. To investigate this question we developed a cell culture centrifuge and an automated system that performs cell fixation during hypergravity loading. We generated expression vectors for various focal adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins fused to GFP or dsRed and visualized these structures in transfected (or infected) osteoblasts. The actin cytoskeleton was also visualized using rhodamine-phalloidin staining and Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) levels were assessed biochemically. We observed that a 24 hour exposure to 50 -g stimulated proliferation compared to the 1 -g control when cells were plated on fibronectin, collagen Type I, and collagen Type IV, but not on uncoated tissue culture plastic surfaces. This proliferative response was greatest for osteoblasts grown on fibronectin (2 -fold increase over 1 -g control) and collagen Type I (1. 4 fold increase over 1 -g control), suggesting that specific matrices and integrins are involved in the signaling pathways required for proliferation. Exposing osteoblasts grown on different matrices to 10 -g or 25 -g showed that effects on proliferation depended on both matrix type and loading level. We found that osteoblasts exposed to a short pulse of hypergravity during adhesion spread further and had more GFP-FAK containing focal adhesions compared to their 1 -g controls. While overall levels of FAK did not change, more FAK was in the active (phosphorylated) form under hypergravity than in the 1 -g controls. Cytoskeletal F-actin organization into filaments was also more prominent after brief exposures to hypergravity during the first five minutes of adhesion. These results suggest that specific integrins sense hypergravity and activate distinct matrix-dependent FAK signaling pathways that can enhance proliferation. Our results also imply that brief exposures to hypergravity accelerate cell adhesion and spreading processes via the <b>focal</b> adhesion-signaling <b>axis.</b> These results support the role of the ECM/integrin-signaling axis in osteoblast response to hypergravity loading...|$|R
40|$|Directional {{motility}} is {{a complex}} process requiring the spatiotemporal integration of signals that regulate cytoskeletal changes, {{and the establishment of}} an anteroposterior or polarized cell <b>axis.</b> <b>Focal</b> adhesion kinase (FAK) promotes cell migration, but a molecular role for FAK in promoting cell polarity remains undefined. Here, using wound healing and Golgi-reorientation analyses, we show that fibroblast, endothelial and carcinoma polarity during cell migration requires FAK and is associated with a complex between FAK, p 120 RasGAP and p 190 RhoGAP (p 190 A), leading to p 190 A tyrosine phosphorylation. Fibronectin-integrin-mediated FAK activation and phosphorylation promote SH 2 -mediated binding of p 120 RasGAP to FAK and FAK-mediated p 190 A tyrosine phosphorylation. The association of p 120 RasGAP with FAK facilitates the formation of a FAK-p 120 RasGAP-p 190 A complex targeted to leading-edge focal adhesions by FAK. Knockdown of p 120 RasGAP, mutation of FAK Y 397 or inhibition of FAK activity prevent the association of FAK with p 190 A and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of p 190 A, and result in the loss of cell polarity. Because reconstitution of FAK-null fibroblasts with FAK or a Pyk 2 -FAK chimera restore the normal decrease in RhoA GTP binding upon cell spreading on fibronectin, our studies support a model whereby FAK activity facilitates the recruitment and stabilization of a p 120 RasGAP-p 190 A complex at leading-edge focal adhesions connected to the transient inhibition of RhoA activity and the regulation of cell polarity...|$|R

40|$|Continental {{earthquakes}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely observable indicators of on-going continental lithospheric deformation. Accurate earthquake depth estimates are critical to tectonic interpretations, yet depths are not reliably provided by global earthquake catalogs and bulletins. Therefore, separate analyses are needed to determined accurate earthquake depths. In this thesis, I compile accurate estimates of continental earthquake depths and combine them with complementary datasets, such as topography, subsurface structural interpretations, and lithospheric thickness estimates, to investigate continental deformation. I present results of focal mechanisms and accurate depth estimates for continental earthquakes throughout the Central Andes of South America. Through integration with high resolution topographic data and interpretations of subsurface structures, I find the following: (1) earthquakes in the foreland and Eastern Cordillera are consistently associated with basement-involved deformation, (2) earthquake <b>focal</b> mechanism P <b>axis</b> orientations indicate an east-west crustal shortening direction in the forelands, (3) local orientations of deformational structures influence earthquake focal mechanism orientation, and (4) normal and strike-slip focal mechanisms beneath southern Peru and northernmost Chile are consistent with the effects of the increase in vertical compressive stress, due to high topography and thick crustal root of the plateau, superimposed on the stress orientations seen in the foreland. I also conduct a global study of the depth distributions of continental earthquakes by synthesizing previously reported accurate earthquake depth determinations to investigate in what tectonic settings lower crustal earthquakes occur in an attempt to understand their significance to lithospheric strength and deformation. I find that deep continental crustal earthquakes occur within stable lithosphere and within tectonically active lithosphere at a transitional state of lithospheric thickness and crustal deformation...|$|R

The samples were subjected to tensile testing after an aging {{post weld heat treatment}} was performed at 480 ºC for 3 hours. Acceptable results were obtained although some concerns emerged regarding the ability of the welding jig to ensure repeatability of joint fit-up and alignment of the laser beam with respect to the seam. Alternative techniques such as dual focus (twin spot), scanner welding, addition of filler material and pulsed Nd:YAG welding were investigated to increase the operating window compared to autogenous single spot laser welding by making the process less sensitive to fit up and alignment. Metallurgical investigations were also performed to compare the microstructures produced by the various welding techniques. Twin spot and pulsed Nd:YAG welding increased the tolerance with regards to laser beam offset to 0. 5 mm compared to 0. 2 mm for single spot autogenous welding. The higher heat input of twin spot resulted in a higher fraction of reverted austenite after PWHT at 480 ºC for 3 h and reduced mechanical properties compared to pulsed Nd:YAG welding. The presence of contamination and misalignment has been found to have a profound impact on weld integrity. Pulsed Nd:YAG welding is the preferred process due to the large operating window, small amount of reverted austenite and excellent weld geometry...|$|R

40|$|International audience— Direct {{photometric}} visual servoing {{uses only}} the pure image information {{as a visual}} feature, instead of using classic geometric features such as points or lines.

Here {{we examine the}} effects of environmental factors on the conversion efficiencies of a new type of STECG comprising parabolic trough concentrators and thermoelectric modules (TEMs). Each TEM array was bonded with a solar selective absorber plate and directly positioned on the <b>focal</b> <b>axis</b> of the parabolic concentrator. Glass tubular collectors were not used to encase the TEMs. Although this makes the overall system simpler, the environmental effects become significant. Simulations show that the performance of such a system strongly depends on ambient conditions such as solar insolation, atmospheric temperature and wind velocity. As each of these factors increases, the thermal losses of the STECG system also increase, resulting in reduced solar conversion efficiency, despite the increased radiation absorption. However, the impact of these factors is relatively complicated. Although the electrical efficiency of the system increases with increasing solar insolation, it decreases with increasing ambient temperature and wind velocity. These results serve as a useful guide to the selection and installation of STECGs, particularly in Guangzhou or similar climate region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To measure the error of angular measurements in photo images with different digital resolutions in an object with pre-determined angles. METHODS: We used a rubber ball with 52 cm in circumference. The object was previously marked with angles of 10 °, 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° degrees. The photographic records were performed with the <b>focal</b> <b>axis</b> of the camera perpendicular and three meters away from the object, {{without the use of}} optical zoom and a resolution of 3, 5 and 10 Megapixels (Mp). All photographic records were stored and a previously trained experimenter using the computer program ImageJ analyzed the angular values of each photo. The measurements were performed twice within a fifteen-days interval. Subsequently, we calculated the accuracy, relative error and error in degrees values, precision and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: When analyzing the angle of 10 °, the average accuracy of measurements was higher for those records of 3 Mp resolution compared to 5 and 10 Mp resolutions. The ICC was considered excellent for all resolutions. With regards to the analyzed angles in photographic records, it was possible to verify that the 90 -degree angle photographs were more accurate, had lower relative error and error in degrees, and were more precise, regardless of image resolution.

We {{present a}} {{constructive}} {{solution to a}} generalization of Hugo Stein-haus ’ problem of partitioning a given triangle, by dropping perpendiculars from an interior point, into three quadrilaterals whose areas are in prescribed propor-tions. 1. Generalized Steinhaus problem Given an acute angled triangle ABC, Steinhaus ’ problem asks a point P in its interior with pedals Pa, Pb, Pc on BC, CA, AB such that the quadrilaterals APbPPc, BPcPa, and CPaPPb have equal areas. See [3] and the bibliographic information therein. A. Tyszka [2] has also shown that Steinhaus ’ problem is in general not soluble by ruler-and-compass. We present a simple constructive solu-tion (using conics) of a generalization of Steinhaus ’ problem. In this note, the area of a polygon P will be denoted by ∆(P). In particular, ∆ = ∆(ABC). Thus, given three positive real numbers u, v, w, we look for the point(s) P such that (1) P is inside ABC and Pa, Pb, Pc lie respectively in the segments BC,CA, AB, (2) ∆(APbPPc) : ∆(BPcPPa) : ∆(CPaPPb) = u: v: w.

Symptomatic patients who entered into this prospective trial had BDC in the common bile duct and/or the intrahepatic, cystic or lobar ducts of the liver that were inaccessible or untreatable by papillotomy or percutaneous stone extraction. The study excluded gallbladder stones. Nasobiliary (54. 4 %) or transhepatic catheters (10. 5 %) and T-tube or cholecystostomy tubes (17. 5 %) or combinations (14. 0 %) permitted access for radiographic contrast to allow fluoroscopic monitoring of stone position and fragmentation. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, failure to localize the stone, disturbances of coagulation, pacemakers, or vascular aneurysms or large bones that lie in the <b>focal</b> <b>axis</b> of the shock waves. Eleven institutions treated 42 patients (23 male, 19 female) with BDC; age range was 25 to 95 years (mean +/- SD, 73. 5 +/- 13. 8) and ASA risk category was 1 to 4 (mean, 2. 3 +/- 0. 8). Fourteen patients (33. 3 %) had a single BDC; 28 had 2 to 8 stones (mean, 2. 7 +/- 1. 8) {{ranging in size from}} 6 mm to 30 mm (mean, 18. 5 +/- 6. 4). The majority (66. 7 %) of patients were postcholecystectomy. The 42 patients received 57 ESWL treatments consisting of 600 to 2400 shocks per treatment (mean, 1924 +/- 289) at 12 to 22 kV (mean, 18. 5 +/- 1. 9) administered over 20 to 125 minutes (mean, 52. 9 +/- 20. 8). General anesthesia was used in 32 % of the treatments; the majority were treated with epidural or regional block (42. 1 %), local infiltration (28. 1 %), or intravenous sedation (38. 6 %). Fifteen patients (35. 7 %) required two ESWL treatments. Stone fragmentation occurred in 94. 6 % of evaluable patients and in 90. 4 % of ESWL treatments, respectively; however, BDC fragments remained in 59. 5 % of patients 24 hours after treatment (diameter less than or to 3 mm, 12 %; 4 to 9 mm, 16 %; {{greater than or equal to}} 10 mm, 68 %). Some patients (50 %) required adjunctive procedures to achieve stone removal that included endoscopic extraction (n = 10; 47. 6 %), biliary lavage (n = 8; 38. 1 %), endoscopic bile duct prosthesis (n = 1; 4. 8 %), and operation (n = 2; 9. 5 %). ESWL treatment complications during hospitalization were observed in 15 patients (35. 7 %) and were present in four (9. 5 %) at discharge.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in generating high energy (> 50 MeV) protons from intense laser-matter interactions {{has opened up}} new areas of research, with applications in radiography, high energy density physics, and ion-proton beam fast ignition (FI). The ability to focus the proton beam has made these applications more attractive. Fast ignition (FI) is an evolved concept of conventional inertial confinement fusion (ICF). In proton FI, a collimated beam of protons is used to deliver the necessary ignition energy to the compressed Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fuel capsule instead of the original concept of a beam composed of relativistic electrons. In cone-guided FI, a cone is embedded {{into the side of}} the fuel capsule where the proton source foil is placed within the cone. The cone provides a clear path to the dense core and protects the proton source foil from radiation during the compression of the capsule. The proton source foil is a segment of a hemispherical shell target used to help focus the proton beam to the core to spark ignition. The viability of proton FI requires focusing of the generated proton beam to a 40 [mu]m spot at the compressed fuel and a laser to proton conversion efficiency of ̃ 15 %. Here, proton focusing and the laser to proton conversion efficiency are investigated using flat foils and hemispherical shell targets. Experiments were conducted on the 200 TW short pulse laser at Los Alamos Laboratory. The 1053 nm laser pulse delivered 70 - 80 J on target in 500 - 600 fs focused by an f/ 8 parabolic mirror. The generated proton beam from the target was examined by placing a mesh downstream of the target, which the proton beam would pass though and then imaged with a pack of radiochromic film (RCF). A 3 D ray-tracing technique was developed to determine the focal position and focal spot size of the generated proton beam by tracing the proton trajectories from the image of the mesh collected by the RCF back through the mesh to the central axis. The focal position calculated from the ray- tracing technique for the flat foils resulted in a real focus, contrasting the convention wisdom of a virtual focus. Investigation of the proton expansion from flat foils established that initially the protons are accelerated normal to the surface, due to the fact that the electrostatic sheath field generated by the escaping hot electrons is only a few microns beyond the rear surface of the foil. As time progresses and more electrons are accelerated into the target by the laser irradiation, the sheath expands away from the rear surface of the foil, developing a bell-shaped curvature. The protons are then accelerated normal to the sheath field, which is at the leading edge of the expansion. Due to the bell-shaped curvature, protons that are accelerated further away from the central axis of the laser interaction experience gradients within the expansion causing the protons to gain radial velocity, which changes the angle of divergence of the protons. The radial velocity gained by the protons affects the trajectory of the protons, resulting in a calculated real focal position when trajectories are calculated the ray-tracing technique. The trajectories of the protons are further affected by the mounting technique. When the foils are mounted to washers for stability, electrons accelerated in the foil escaped into the washer creating a field along the interior wall of washer. The field affects the proton trajectories near the wall and decreases the laser to proton conversion efficiency. With the understanding gained from the flat foil targets, proton focusing is further investigated using freestanding hemispherical shell targets. Using the 3 D ray-tracing technique, the calculated focal position is determined to be located inside the radius of curvature of the hemisphere, which is less than the distance of 1. 7 R (where R is the radius of curvature of the hemisphere, which is less than the distance of 1. 7 R (where R is the radius of curvature of the hemispherical shell) determined from proton heating experiments. With the aid of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, using the code LSP (large-scale-plasma), it was determined that proton trajectories are not straight, but actually bend near the focal region. A hot electron pressure gradient in the expansion beam sets up a radial electric field, Er ? kTehot/R, where here R is the radial scale length of the beam and kTehot is the hot electron temperature. When the radial electric field surpasses the radial acceleration force, the proton trajectories are bent away from the <b>focal</b> <b>axis.</b> The first demonstration of the generation and focusing of a proton beam from a hemispherical shell in a FI geometry is presented, where the beam is generated from a curved focusing surface, which propagates and is channeled via surface fields through an enclosed cone structure. A segment of a hemispherical shell is placed within a novel cone-shaped target. The proton focusing and conversion efficiency are calculated for the structured targets and are compared to the freestanding hemispherical shells. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are presented for further understanding. It is clearly shown that the focusing is strongly affected by the electric fields in the beam in both open and enclosed (cone) geometries, bending the trajectories near the axis. It is also reported that in the cone geometry, a sheath electric field effectively channels the proton beam through the cone tip, substantially improving the focusing properties. The sheath electric field on the wall of the cone is generated by electrons that escape the hemispherical shell and travel into the surrounding structure. Focusing of the proton beam is improved by the sheath electric field on the wall of the cone; however, the laser to proton conversion efficiency is decreased due to the hot electrons escaping the shell reducing the amount of energy available to accelerate the proton...|$|E
