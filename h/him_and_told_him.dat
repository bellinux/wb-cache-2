5|$|In {{almost all}} {{versions}} of the tale, Ila wants to live as a man, but in the Skanda Purana, Ila desires to be a woman. The king Ela (Ila) entered Parvati's grove at Sahya mountain and became the woman Ilā. Ilā wished to remain a woman and serve Parvati (Gauri) and Ganga, the goddess of the Ganges river. However, the goddesses dissuaded <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that life as a woman was a curse and full of sorrow. Ilā bathed in a sacred pool and returned as Ela, bearded and deep-voiced.|$|E
5|$|While {{keeping his}} {{involvement}} with Waters's underground filmmaking a secret from his parents, Divine continued relying on them financially, charging them for expensive parties that he held and writing bad checks. After charging them for a major repair to his car in 1972, his parents confiscated it from <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{that they would not}} continue to financially support him in such a manner. In retaliation, he came by their house the following day, collected his two pet dogs and then disappeared, not seeing or speaking with them for the next nine years. Instead, he sent them over fifty postcards from across the world, informing them that he was fine, but on none did he leave a return address. Frances and Harris Milstead retired soon after and moved to Florida at the advice of Harris's doctor, who prescribed the southern state's warmer weather as being beneficial for Harris's muscular dystrophy.|$|E
25|$|Music {{director}} S. D. Burman {{is credited}} with spotting Kumar's talent for singing. During the making of Mashaal (1950), Burman visited Ashok's house, where he heard Kumar imitating K. L. Saigal. He complimented <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that he should develop a style of his own, instead of copying Saigal. Kumar eventually developed his own style of singing, which featured yodeling, which he had heard on the records of Tex Morton and Jimmie Rodgers.|$|E

25|$|Once Jesus, {{the prophet}} Elijah, and St. George {{were going through}} Georgia. When they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine. They saw a Georgian {{shepherd}} and decided {{to ask him to}} feed them. First, Elijah went up to the shepherd and asked him for a sheep. After the shepherd asked his identity Elijah said that, {{he was the one who}} sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming. The shepherd became angry at <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows. (After Elijah, Jesus and St. George attempt to get help and eventually succeed).|$|E

Osborne refused and was immediately arrested. His party comrades arrived immediately with money for bail, but regular bail at the jail was refused by orders of the Chief and Osborne was held overnight in the Seattle city jail — a decision which further provoked the Socialists and led to banner headlines in the Seattle Socialist detailing the affair. A protest meeting was scheduled for Sunday night by the party, who saw a fight against the new public speaking rules on Pike Street as a matter of fundamental principle.|$|E

25|$|Helm {{believed}} in making all philanthropic and missionary work distinctively Church work. To this end she {{wrote for the}} Church papers. Many of her articles appeared in the Nashville Christian Advocate and in the St. Louis Christian Advocate. Through them, she became known to the entire Church. Many of the bishops and other dignitaries of the Church were her staunch friends. Soon after the department of Church Extension of the M. E. Church, South, was organized, in 1882, with Dr. David Morton as General Secretary, she went to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she wanted to assist in that work in any way she could.

25|$|On March 24, 2004, {{one week}} after {{capturing}} a bomb in the bag of 12-year-old Abdullah Quran, Hussam Abdo, a 16-year-old Palestinian (who initially claimed he was 14), was captured in a checkpoint near Nablus wearing an explosive belt. The young boy was paid by the Tanzim militia to detonate himself at the checkpoint. IDF soldiers manning the checkpoint were suspicious of <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{to stay away from}} people. Later, an EOD team arrived and by using a police-sapper robot, removed the explosive belt from him. Hussam explained that he was offered 100 NIS and sex with virgins if he would perform the task. He said his friends mocked him in class.|$|E
25|$|His family {{stated that}} Tobares' enthusiasm for work went {{down a few}} months before he disappeared. He told his sister that he was scared, and one time he called her sobbing. In March 2013, he spoke to his sister and told her that he wanted to return to Argentina. They believe that Tobares was kidnapped because he might have seen {{something}} suspicious while on the job that his employers did not want him to see. Tobares worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki Sushi Bar, but he was also a hired chef for private parties; his family told investigators that Tobares was sometimes taken by the CJNG, Tobares' last employer, to their private islands in western Mexico to cook for their exclusive events. He was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone while he was there. His family believes that in one of those private parties, Tobares saw something suspicious and began asking third-parties to clarify what he saw. When the CJNG found out what he was doing, Gerardo reportedly threatened <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to ask those question to his face. A week before his disappearance, Gerardo reportedly ordered Tobares to close down the Asian restaurant and fire all of the employees.|$|E

500|$|Boycott was {{involved}} in a number of disputes while on Achill. Two years after his arrival, he was unsuccessfully sued for assault by Thomas Clarke, a local man. Clarke said that he had gone to Boycott's house because Boycott owed him money. He said that he had asked for repayment of the debt, and that Boycott had refused to pay <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to go away, which Clarke refused to do. Clarke alleged that Boycott approached him and said: [...] "If you do not be off, I will make you." [...] Clarke later withdrew his allegations, and said that Boycott did not actually owe him any money.|$|E
500|$|One {{morning in}} 1914, Hogg {{was awakened by}} a burglar in her bedroom.

When asked why she did that, Hogg responded, [...] "He didn't look like a bad man." [...] Later that year, she sailed to Germany, alone. While she was en route, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated, and the day before she arrived, Britain declared war on Germany. The United States was still neutral, however, so Hogg continued her tour of Europe, not leaving until several months later.|$|E

500|$|Having posted similar {{offensive}} {{statistics in}} the regular season, the Eagles and Cardinals were expected to play a tight game. Played in a blizzard at Philadelphia's Shibe Park, the game's only score was a fourth quarter rushing touchdown by Van Buren from five yards out. The 7–0 win gave the Eagles their first league title. Van Buren finished with 98 yards on 26 carries, though he nearly missed the game entirely. Thinking the game would not be played in the blizzard, he remained home until coach Greasy Neale called <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the game was still on. He had to catch three trolleys and walk six blocks {{in order to make}} the game on time.

500|$|In August 1941, Rowell {{returned}} to Australia {{to take up}} the post of Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS), with the rank of major general. He expected that his main task would be to support the AIF; but it turned out the primary concern was the looming war with Japan, which broke out soon after. It was at this juncture that Rowell was approached by Major General George Vasey, who had a scheme to retire all officers over the age of fifty, and making Major General Horace Robertson Commander in Chief. Presumably Vasey expected Rowell, as a fellow Duntroon graduate, to be sympathetic. A heated argument ensued, ending with Rowell telling Vasey that [...] "if he weren't so bloody big, I'd toss him out of the room". Rowell immediately went to Sturdee, who had Lavarack with <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what had transpired.|$|E
500|$|Ed Salvo {{developed}} Skeet Shoot independently. Salvo had self-taught {{himself to}} {{program for the}} 2600 after purchasing an Atari 800; the dealer wanted a flight simulator for the 2600 so he contracted Salvo to make one. The game was never released as the dealer had lost interest. According to Salvo, the development of Skeet Shoot took him around a month at night in his home to finish. After his friend sent him an advertisement from a Dallas newspaper by newly founded studio Games by Apollo that asked for programmers, he contacted Apollo founder Pat Roper and showed him Skeet Shoot. [...] Roper decided that Skeet Shoot was a good enough game for a first time. He offered Salvo a job at Apollo, which Salvo declined, believing {{it would be too}} risky. When Salvo returned to his Iowa home, Roper contacted <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he would buy Skeet Shoot for five thousand dollars which Salvo accepted.|$|E

500|$|... "One Son" [...] {{would be}} the last episode of the series to feature Owens' character, Jeffrey Spender, until the ninth season entry [...] "William".

Owens was {{slightly}} disappointed, noting that he had just been introduced in the series during the conclusion of the previous season. Davis was upset that Owens was leaving the series, and reportedly told Owens during their last scene together, [...] "I don't want to shoot you! I enjoy working with you!" [...] Owens, however, jokingly noted that Davis had no problems slapping him when the script called for it. In the episode, Laurie Holden, who played Marita Covarrubias, returns. Spotnitz crafted the sequence in which she confronts Mulder to be a way of [...] "taking away [...] beauty and making her [...] as horrifying as possible". To accomplish this, she was given [...] "terrible-looking" [...] contact lenses and her hair was unkempt.|$|E

According to Reagan, these Iranians sought to establish a quiet relationship with the United States, before establishing formal relationships upon {{the death of the}} aging Ayatollah. In Reagan's account, McFarlane told Reagan that the Iranians, to demonstrate their seriousness, offered to persuade the Hezbollah militants to release the seven U.S. hostages. McFarlane met with the Israeli intermediaries; Reagan claimed that he allowed this because he believed that establishing relations with a strategically located country, and preventing the Soviet Union from doing the same, was a beneficial move. [...] Although Reagan claims that the arms sales were to a [...] "moderate" [...] faction of Iranians, the Walsh Iran/Contra Report states that the arms sales were [...] "to Iran" [...] itself, which was {{under the control of the}} Ayatollah.|$|E
500|$|Chung {{speaks to}} a science fiction and Dungeons & Dragons fanatic, Blaine, who {{frequently}} roams the woods of Klass County at night looking for UFOs. As Blaine tells Chung, one night he found an alien body that was subsequently recovered by Mulder, Scully and Detective Manners. Blaine thinks that Mulder and Scully {{are a couple of}} men in black. He claims that Mulder was emotionless, but shrieked when he saw the alien, and that Scully, whom Blaine believed was a man dressed like a woman, threatened <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> not to talk to anyone about the alien body. Mulder allows Blaine to videotape Scully performing an autopsy on the alien, which is quickly released as a video [...] "documentary" [...] labeled [...] "Dead Alien! Truth or Humbug?" [...] that is narrated by the Stupendous Yappi (from [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"). The autopsy reveals that the alien is actually a dead Air Force pilot in an alien costume.
