When studying the film at varying speeds, it still appeared as if <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> his arm, even though the brace makes it impossible to do so. His unique shoulder rotation and amazing wrist action seem to create the illusion that he straightens his arm.|$|E
2500|$|... 53 Then each of {{them went}} home, 1 while Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 Early {{in the morning he}} came again to the temple. All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them. 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, 4 they said to him, ‘Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of {{committing}} adultery. 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?’ 6 They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7 When they kept on questioning him, <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> up and said to them, ‘Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.’ 8 And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground. 9 When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus straightened up and said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?’ 11 She said, ‘No one, sir.’ And Jesus said, ‘Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.’ ...|$|E

60|$|Max {{watched her}} for some moments. Then {{suddenly}} <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> himself, pushed back his brown hair that was brushed {{up in the}} German fashion, and crossed himself, dropping his knee as before an altar; crossed himself and dropped his knee once more; and then a third time crossed himself and inclined before the altar. Then <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> himself again, and turned aside.|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightens</b> {{his little}} hoofs, {{and opened his}} wide mouth,and with his tail firmly behind him, he said [...] "goodbye" [...] to everyone.Que tu ru ru ru ru...|$|R

60|$|CRAVEN (offended). You must excuse me, Paramore, if I {{say that}} I {{no longer feel}} any {{confidence}} in your opinion as a medical man. (Paramore's eye flashes: <b>he</b> <b>straightens</b> himself and listens.) I paid you a pretty stiff fee for that consultation when you condemned me; and I can't say I think you gave me value for it.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me he gave a little start of surprise; <b>he</b> {{certainly}} <b>straightened</b> {{up and looked at}} me hard.|$|R
60|$|LUCREZIA (with {{a sudden}} access {{of energy and}} passion). The disgustingness of it, you mean. (She pushes him from her. His head wobbles once, {{as though it were}} inanimate, before <b>he</b> <b>straightens</b> into life.) The {{maternal}} instinct. Ugh. It's been the undoing of too many women. You men come with your sentimental babyishness and exploit it for your own lusts. Be a man, Bertino. Be a woman, I mean, if you can.|$|R
60|$|Just then Aleck came in sight. As he saw {{the couple}} {{through the open door}} <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> up.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> up so {{abruptly}} as to alarm Selim, who sprang {{back the}} length of his bridle rein and snorted.|$|E

5000|$|Oblivious to all this, [...] "Chauncey" [...] wanders {{off through}} Rand's wintry estate. <b>He</b> <b>straightens</b> out a pine sapling, touches some flowers and then walks {{off across the}} surface of a small lake.

6000|$|I {{had never}} seen him so upset. Loosening his hold of me, <b>he</b> {{mechanically}} <b>straightened</b> a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to himself: [...] "Yes, that alters everything--everything." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{monument}} {{was erected}} to honour {{him in the}} town of Getxo {{at the mouth of the}} Nervion River, which <b>he</b> definitely <b>straightened</b> allowing the further developing of Bilbao's industrial power.|$|R

40|$|Sheriff Akinleye bends {{low over}} a {{customer}} in the barbershop, his eyes intently following the movements {{on a little}} dial, and a stethoscope in his ears. Then <b>he</b> <b>straightens</b> up. "All right. I get 136 over 82. Which is a little high. Normal is less than 120 over 80. You have prehypertension," he tells Phillip Griffin, 42, who has heard this before - though perhaps not in this much detail.

During practice for the mission, he is accidentally injured by Lt. Worf {{on the side of}} his head, and while Dr. Crusher heals the wound, Riker still experiences some pain there. Riker performs the play for the crew, and receives a standing ovation, except for one officer in the center of the crowd who frowns at the performance. Riker takes a bow, but when <b>he</b> <b>straightens,</b> <b>he</b> finds the audience gone, himself trapped in a cell similar to the set for the play. An alien humanoid doctor iterates [...] "I see we still have much work to do", a line from the play, before locking Riker in the cell.|$|R
