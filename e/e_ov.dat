It was revealed that his English acquisition was markedly different from English-speaking children. The comparison of utterance types revealed that his VO and VA-type utterances were infrequent and restricted. The emergence order of his utterance types was noticeably different. Although the instances ware few, he produced utterances with word-order reversal (i. <b>e.</b> <b>OV</b> and AV sequences), with the sibilant sound attached to Object and Adverbial (Yamada-Yamamoto 1993 and 1994). His preposition + NP combinations also lacked productivity. In addition, he sometimes produced instances with word-order reversal (e. g. you for big (= "A big one for you")). Further, unlike English-speaking children, he did not produce utterances with prepositions being omitted. The lack of productivity, together with word-order reversal, for both VA and Preposition + NP sequences, suggested that this child initially lacked grammaticcal control over VA and/or Prep + NP word orders in English. This suggestions was verified by the experiment based on the Derbyshire Language Scheme (Knowles % Masidlover 1982). The above-mentioned unusual aspect of this child's early English speech was explained from the typological differences between English and Japanese: Japanese is a typical head-final language; English, on the other hand, {{is a good example of}} a head-initial language (e. g. Comrie 1981). The scarcity in the production of both VA and AV sequences, as well as both Prep + NP sequences, suggests that this child initially avoided word combinations involving 'V' and 'A' and 'Prep' and 'NP'. The Japanese language influenced, therefore, only as a default, and it worked as a basic principle for him, unless he overruled it by the English principle, such as VA and Prep + NP, which he fradually acquired in due course...|$|E

The phase difference between the above 22 PN waveform families and numerical waveforms are evaluated during two-year inspirals for two prototypical EMRI systems with mass ratios 10 - 4 and 10 - 5. We find that the dephases (in radians) for TaylorT 1 and TaylorT 2, respectively, are about 10 - 9 (10 - 2) and 10 - 9 (10 - 3) for mass ratio 10 - 4 (10 - 5). This suggests that using 22 PN TaylorT 1 or TaylorT 2 waveforms for parameter estimation of EMRIs will result in accuracies comparable to numerical waveform accuracy for most of the LISA parameter space. On the other hand, from the dephase results, we find that TaylorT 3, TaylorT 4 and TaylorEt fare relatively poorly as one approaches the last stable orbit. This implies that, as for comparable mass binaries using the 3. 5 PN phase of waveforms, the 22 PN TaylorT 3 and TaylorEt approximants do not perform well enough for the EMRIs. The reason underlying the poor performance of TaylorT 3, TaylorT 4 and TaylorEt relative to TaylorT 1 and TaylorT 2 is finally examined...|$|E

MÉTODOS: a amostra consistiu de 162 crianças residentes no município de São Pedro, SP. Em entrevista com cada mãe, informações sobre o tempo e a forma de aleitamento, a presença de hábitos deletérios, e orientações recebidas pela mãe durante o pré-natal foram coletadas. O exame epidemiológico foi realizado nas dependências das creches, por um único examinador, previamente calibrado, sob iluminação direta. As seguintes variáveis foram avaliadas: presença e severidade de oclusopatias [ligeiro apinhamento e espaçamento (AE), mordida aberta (MA), sobremordida (SM), mordida cruzada uni ou {{bilateral}} (MC), overjet positivo (OV) e relação terminal dos segundos molares decíduos (RTM) ]. A análise dos dados consistiu de análise univariada (teste qui-quadrado) e de regressão logística múltipla.

OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate the}} frequency of malocclusion and their associations with the type and period of breastfeeding, deleterious oral habits, and information received by mothers during the pre-natal period, in 5 -year-old children attending municipal daycare centers. METHODS: The sample consisted of 162 children resident in the municipality of São Pedro, SP, Brazil. In an interview {{with each of the}} mothers, information was collected about the time and form of breastfeeding, presence of deleterious habits, and information the mother received during the pre-natal period. The epidemiological exam was performed at the daycare center facilities by a single, previously calibrated examiner, under direct lighting. The following variables were evaluated: presence and severity of malocclusion [slight overcrowding and spacing (OS) ], open occlusal relationship (open bite) (OPB), vertical overlap (over bite) (OVB), uni- or bilateral cross bite (CB), positive overjet (OV) and the primary second molar terminal plane relationship (TPR) ]. Data analysis consisted of univariate analysis (chi-square test) and multiple logistic regressions. RESULTS: The prevalence of malocclusions was 95. 7 % (OS = 22. 8 %; OPB = 24. 7 %; OVB = 20. 4 %; CB = 14. 8 %; and OV = 13. 0 %). In TPR the straight terminal plane was predominant (85. 0 %).

The results indicated that <b>E.</b> adhaerens (<b>OV</b> 14) exhibits infection efficiencies ranging between 50 – 70 %, 90 – 100 % and 90 – 95 % for Cur‑ inga, Nipponbare and IR 64 respectively. Curinga and Nipponbare plants transformed with <b>E.</b> adhaerens (<b>OV</b> 14) and A. tumefaciens (LBA 4404 and EHA 105) were regenerated achieving transformation efficiencies of 16 % and 26 – 32 % for Curinga and 7 and 4 % for Nipponbare respectively. Separately, the transformation of IR 64 was only recorded via EMT (transformation efficiency ~ 1 %). Integration analyses conducted on 24 transgenic rice lines illustrated that T‑DNA insertion occurred randomly throughout the rice genome for EMT (and AMT), with similar integration patterns in the rice genomic DNA observed for both bacterial species...|$|R

According to different models of T-DNA insertions, deletions occur when illegitimate recombination between the T-DNA and the genomic DNA takes place (Tinland 1996). These deletions have been reported previously in aspen plants (Kumar and Fladung 2002) and in A. thaliana (Forsbach et al. 2003; Mayerhofer et al. 1991); hence, these results suggest that T-DNA integration mechanisms are similar in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species and between <b>E.</b> adhaerens (<b>OV</b> 14) and A. tumefaciens. Although mapping of T-DNA insertions from 22 independent transgenic lines did not reveal a significant bias of T-DNA insertion across the rice genome, there was a tendency for EMT delivered T-DNA to be inserted outside of gene coding regions of the genome, which would assist future regulatory evaluations of those lines engineered through EMT.|$|R
40|$|Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma (ATC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{aggressive}} tumor characterized by an average survival time of 3 - 6 months after diagnosis. Multimodality therapy, which includes surgical debulking, external radiation therapy and chemotherapy, has failed to show any improvements in survival. Therefore, novel therapies with different mechanisms of action are required. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) represent a novel therapeutic tool for the treatment of aggressive tumors. OVs as single agents have demonstrated limited efficacy in a clinical setting, thus highlighting the need of novel combinatorial therapies (i. <b>e.</b> <b>OVs</b> plus a rationally selected drug) with a potential great impact on clinical use. In this study, we showed that the oncolytic adenovirus dl 922 - 947 induces massive S-phase entry in ATC cell lines, followed by an extensive DNA damage, quantified by γH 2 AX staining. Moreover, we demonstrated that dl 922 - 947 triggered a DNA damage response, characterized by the activation of the checkpoint kinases ATM and Chk 1, and at the same time impaired the ability of the DNA repair, by affecting MRN complex protein levels. The virus-induced single-strand DNA breaks (SSBs) activate the Poly-ADP-Ribose Polymerase (PARP) to signal SSBs to the enzymatic machinery involved in their repair. Here, we demonstrate that the pharmacological inhibition of PARP increases dl 922 - 947 cytotoxicity against Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma both in vitro and in vivo. We also show that PARP inhibitor AZD 2281 synergizes with dl 922 - 947 increasing viral replication and accelerating cell death pathways. Furthermore, we showed that the virus as single treatment induced an apoptotic-like cell death, as indicated by the presence of Caspase 3 activation, PARP cleavage, Annexin V positivity and Cytochrome C release from mitochondria, although lacking the morphological features of apoptosis. In this regard we also proved that dl 922 - 947 acts on the pathway involved in membrane blebbing by inhibiting Myosin Light Chain 2 (MLC 2) phosphorylation. Using a pan caspase inhibitor, both caspase-dependent and -independent cell death pathways are found activated upon dl 922 - 947 infection. Our data clearly suggest that the combination of the oncolytic adenovirus dl 922 - 947 with PARP inhibitor could represent a novel and effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOrf virus (OV), the prototypic parapoxvirus, is {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} interferon (IFN) and this function of OV has been mapped to the OV 20. 0 L gene. The protein product of this gene shares 31 % amino acid identity to the E 3 L-encoded protein of vaccinia virus (VV) that is required for the broad host range and IFN-resistant phenotype of VV in cells in culture and for virulence of the virus in vivo. In this study we investigated whether the distantly related <b>OV</b> <b>E</b> 3 L homologue could complement the deletion of E 3 L in VV. The recombinant VV (VV/ORF-E 3 L) expressing the <b>OV</b> <b>E</b> 3 L homologue in place of VV E 3 L was indistinguishable from wt VV in its cell-culture phenotype. But VV/ORF-E 3 L was over a 1000 -fold less pathogenic than wt VV (LD 50 > 5 × 106 PFU, compared to LD 50 of wtVV = 4 × 103 PFU) following intranasal infection of mice. While wt VV spread to the lungs and brain and replicated to high titers in the brain of infected mice, VV/ORF-E 3 L could not be detected in the lungs or brain following intranasal infection. VV/ORF-E 3 L was at least 100, 000 -fold less pathogenic than wt VV on intracranial injection.

40|$|While the {{previous}} maximum-flow algorithms worked by finding augmenting paths, an alternate {{method is to}} find the maximum-flow using something called preflow. Preflow is flow that has entered a vertex but has not left yet. Two versions of the algorithm are presented; a generic version, in which the legal operations can be chosen in any order, and Relabel to Front version {{in which there is a}} specified order of the operations. The generic version achieves <b>O(V</b> 2 <b>E),</b> which is already an improvement on augmenting path algorithms. Relabel to Front gives us O(V 3) running time, which is a significant improvement on dense graphs. Many of the fastest actual implementations of the max flow algorithm are based on the push-relabel algorithm.

40|$|AbstractBetweenness {{centrality}} is a graph analytic {{that states}} {{the importance of}} a vertex {{based on the number of}} shortest paths that it is on. As such, betweenness centrality is a building block for graph analysis tools and is used by many applications, including finding bottlenecks in communication networks and community detection. Computing betweenness centrality is computation- ally demanding, O(V 2 + V · E) (for the best known algorithm), which motivates the use of parallelism. Parallelism is especially needed for large graphs with millions of vertices and billions of edges. While the the memory requirements for computing be- tweenness are not as demanding, <b>O(V</b> + <b>E)</b> (for the best known sequential algorithm), these bound increase for different parallel algorithms. We show that is possible to reduce the memory requirements for computing betweenness centrality from <b>O(V</b> + <b>E)</b> to <b>O(V)</b> at the expense of doing additional traversals. We show that not only does this not hurt performance it actually improves performance for coarse grain parallelism. Further, we show that using the new approach allows parallel scaling that previously was not possible. One example is that the new approach is able to scale to 40 x 86 cores for a graph with 32 M vertices and 2 B edges, whereas the previous approach is only able to scale upto 6 cores because of memory requirements. We also do analysis of fine-grain parallel betweenness centrality on both the x 86 and the Cray XMT...|$|R

The way the geomagnetic f ield rev erses itself remains poorly understood, because of the scarcity of reliable and suf f iciently complete paleomagnetic records of the same rev ersal f rom widely distant sites at Earth's surf ace.

40|$|Abstract. Let V be a {{quadratic}} {{space with}} a form q over an arbitrary local field F of characteristic different from 2. Let W = V ⊕ Fe with the form Q extending q with Q(e) = 1. Consider the standard embedding O(V) → O(W) and the two-sided action of O(V) × O(V) on O(W). In this note we show that any O(V) ×O(V) -invariant distribution on O(W) is invariant with respect to transposition. This result was earlier proven in a bit different form in [vD] for F = R, in [AvD] for F = C and in [BvD] for p-adic fields. Here we give a different proof. Using results from [AGS], we show that this result on invariant distributions implies that the pair (O(V), O(W)) is a Gelfand pair. In the archimedean setting this means that for any irreducible admissible smooth Fréchet representation (π, E) of O(W) we have dimHom <b>O(V)</b> (<b>E,</b> C) ≤ 1...|$|R
