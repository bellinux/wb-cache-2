40|$|This paper uses {{cross-sectional}} individual {{data from}} the 1994 Integrated Household Survey of Romania to analyze the determinants {{of male and female}} wages in public and private enterprises. Using quantile regression, the rate of return to education and experience at different quantiles of the wage distribution is estimated. Higher levels of education are significantly associated with higher wages {{for both males and females}} in public firms. In private firms, only college education is correlated with significantly higher wages. Differences in individual characteristics are found to explain the highest portion of the male-female wage differential in Romania in both sectors. CONTENTS 1.

30|$|This {{paper has}} {{presented}} results of conceptual understanding {{of climate change}} and variability in Tharaka. FGDs and household survey were used to collect data from four main agro-ecological zones in Tharaka sub-county. People of Tharaka are aware of climate change and variability. This is reflected in frequent droughts and change in rainfall amount. Respondents associated climate change and variability with deforestation and industrial pollution, showing awareness {{on the role of}} man in altering the climate. This awareness should be harnessed into an opportunity to mitigate climate change. There are however misconceptions on the causes of climate change and variability. The paper recommends involvement of scientific institutions in communicating climate change science. Knowledge of determinants of climate variability and basic skills in <b>data</b> collection <b>and</b> <b>descriptive</b> <b>statistics</b> are a way of improving awareness of climate science among local communities in arid and semi-arid lands.|$|R
