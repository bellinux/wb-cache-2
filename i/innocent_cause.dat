500|$|Major {{was born}} in Chicago on July 29, 1894. Her birth name was Geraldyn Hodges. When her mother died giving birth to her, her father {{arranged}} for her adoption by an aunt and uncle who lived nearby. In a biographic sketch published in 1927 her first husband explained that her father was [...] "overcome by the sudden loss of his wife, never forgave the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of his bereavement." [...] Following elementary school, she attended Wendell Phillips High School and subsequently was awarded a work-study scholarship at the University of Chicago from which she graduated with a Bachelor in Philosophy degree in 1915. [...] While a university student, {{she was one of}} five founding members of an undergraduate chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day, Fremantle {{went out}} for a walk along Broadway. Upon his return to the hotel, he found that shopkeepers were closing their shutters early, and then noticed that several buildings were ablaze. Fire engines were present, but the crowd was not permitting them to be used. Increasingly alarmed, Fremantle saw a black youth pursued by the mob, eventually finding refuge with a company of soldiers, to the disgust of the massed protestors. Bewildered, the Englishman asked a bystander why the crowds were so vehement in their hatred of blacks. [...] In response, he was told that they were 'the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of all these troubles'.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Eldest, Ma'am,' said Polly. 'Yes, indeed, it is. That's {{the little}} fellow, Ma'am, {{that was the}} <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of so much.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{does the}} white lord do that?" [...] asked Babemba. [...] "Now I {{see that you}} are truly deceiving me, and {{that what you are}} giving me to swallow is nothing but hot mwavi, which in the <b>innocent</b> <b>causes</b> vomiting, but that in those who mean evil, death." ...|$|R
25|$|Fictitious entries {{placed by}} the {{plaintiff}} {{that appear in}} the defendant's work. For example, fake names or places are often inserted in factual works like maps or directories to serve as proof of copying in a later infringement case since their appearance in a defendant's work cannot be explained away by <b>innocent</b> <b>causes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not innocent,' he said, 'not <b>innocent</b> of <b>causing</b> all the discord {{that has}} ended in their exile, and the dear child's death.' ...|$|R
60|$|In the meantime, Zo {{had become}} the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of a {{difference}} of opinion between two no less dissimilar personages than Maria and the duenna.|$|E
60|$|There {{was no one}} in the {{adjoining}} room. We had searched it thoroughly before I suddenly remembered the visitor who had been the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of these exciting moments.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{shocked to}} hear that I have been the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of your falling into temptation, Mrs. Inchbare! Make your proposal--and I shall be happy to meet it, if I can." ...|$|E
25|$|Enron Corporation exemplifies {{all five}} tendencies, and its failure {{demonstrates}} the extreme dangers {{of a culture}} of corruption within a publicly traded corporation. The rarity of such spectacular failures of a corporation from securities fraud attests to the general reliability of most executives and boards of large corporations. Most spectacular failures of publicly traded companies result from such <b>innocent</b> <b>causes</b> as marketing blunders (Schlitz), an obsolete model of business (Penn Central, Woolworth's), inadequate market share (Studebaker), non-criminal incompetence (Braniff).|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the controversial claim damaged the reputation of Pope Innocent and halted canonisation proceedings. The Roman Catholic Church had been keen to promote <b>Innocent's</b> <b>cause</b> as an active opponent of the Ottomans {{in the light of the}} terrorist attack by Islamic fundamentalists on 9/11. It was subsequently reported that the authors had been effectively [...] "blackballed by Italian journalism and publishing" [...] because of the embarrassment caused to the church. A spokesman for the Vatican has denied this.|$|R
5000|$|On Assumption day 15 August 1474, Christians wreaked brutal {{havoc on}} the Jewish dwellers of the Cartellone area of Modica, the {{so-called}} [...] "Strage dell'Assunta" [...] (massacre of the assumption). This episode {{was the first and}} most horrible antisemitic massacre of Sicilian Israelites. During the evening a number of Christians (fomented by fanatic Catholic preachers inspired by the inquisitorial repression) slaughtered about 360 <b>innocents</b> <b>causing</b> a total and fierce devastation in La Giudecca. The incitement that echoed through the streets was: [...] "Hurrah for Mary! Death to the Jews!" [...] (Viva Maria! Morte ai Giudei!).|$|R
60|$|The old gentleman {{looked almost}} as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the lock. He turned {{with a sigh}} to the book, which had been the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of all this disturbance.|$|E
60|$|MR. VANSTONE'S {{inquiries}} {{into the}} proposed theatrical entertainment at Evergreen Lodge were answered by {{a narrative of}} dramatic disasters; of which Miss Marrable impersonated the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause,</b> and in which her father and mother played the parts of chief victims.|$|E
60|$|A swift blush {{rushed to}} the girl's pale cheeks; her brown eyes {{expressed}} unadulterated joy. Marguerite, who was studying her closely, was conscious that her poor aching heart went out to this exquisite child, the far-off <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of so much misery.|$|E

5000|$|Eustace died at Reading on 3 February 1215 or on 4 February. He {{was buried}} in Ely Cathedral near the altar of St. Mary. A modern historian, C. R. Cheney, said of Eustace that even though he started as a royal official, he [...] "rose to his responsibilities" [...] as bishop. It was a letter of Eustace to <b>Innocent</b> that <b>caused</b> <b>Innocent</b> {{to write a letter}} back {{entitled}} Pastoralis officii diligentia, which later was incorporated into Gratian's Decretals. Eustace was also active in promoting the canonization of Gilbert of Sempringham. He also investigated alleged miracles of Wulfstan of Worcester. He also built the church of St. Mary, in Ely.|$|R
50|$|R.S. Mani directs this mythological fantasy {{based on}} the first century A.D. Tamil Jain saga Silapadhigaaram. The film centers on Kovalan (P.U. Chinnappa), {{who is married to}} the {{faithful}} Kannagi (P. Kannamba). Later, Kovalan falls for the beautiful, dissolute dancer Madhavi (N.S. Saroja), who leads him to ruin. Kannagi comes in at the last moment and saves him from almost certain debauchery. She also offers to sell her golden anklet to restore the household's depleted funds. Unfortunately, the artistry and value of the object leads the king of a neighboring land to accuse Kovalan of theft and sentence him to the chopping block. Once again, Kannagi comes in at the last moment and proves to the king and the queen that they are <b>innocent,</b> <b>causing</b> them both to die instantly. After razing Madhavi's native village to the ground, Kannagi ascends to heaven.|$|R
6000|$|... 'To the Angel at Bury,' replied Mr. Pickwick, {{speaking}} very quickly. 'How do we {{know whom}} he is deceiving there? He deceived a worthy man once, and we were the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause.</b> He shall not do it again, if I can help it; I'll expose him! Sam! Where's my servant?' ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Pecksniff murmured certain cheering {{expressions}} of sympathy and encouragement as they retired; and Martin, awakening from the stupor {{into which the}} closing portion of this scene had plunged him, to the opportunity afforded by their departure, caught the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of all in his embrace, and pressed her to his heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Armadale's {{petition}} to me, under these circumstances, entreats (as I am the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> {{of the new}} attack on his character) that I will write to the major to absolve him of all indiscretion in the matter, {{and to say that}} he could not, in common politeness, do otherwise than accompany me to London.|$|E
50|$|At the {{barbecue}} that is attended by Quagmire, the Swansons, and the Browns, Peter finds {{it difficult to}} control his jealously of Quagmire loving Lois. Quagmire's <b>innocent</b> conversation <b>causes</b> him to confront {{him in front of}} everyone. Quagmire is upset about his private conversation being made public and they fight until Peter orders the picnic over causing everyone leave.|$|R
5000|$|French philosopher Voltaire criticised Leibniz's {{concept of}} theodicy in his Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne (Poem on the Lisbon disaster), {{suggesting}} that the massive destruction of <b>innocent</b> lives <b>caused</b> by the Lisbon earthquake demonstrated that God was not providing the [...] "best of all possible worlds". Voltaire also includes the earthquake/theodicy theme in his novel, Candide.|$|R
5000|$|Inadequate {{investigation}} and hasty rulings by courts have caused some wrongful convictions of <b>innocent</b> people <b>causing</b> them to languish {{in jail for}} many years. For instance, the Bombay high court in September 2009 asked the Maharashtra government to pay [...] 100,000 as compensation to a 40-year-old man who languished in prison for over 10 years for a crime he didn't commit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why pain your gentle {{ears with}} details of slaughter? A few fearful minutes sufficed to exterminate my bewildered and unarmed countrymen, to bind the only survivors, Miranda (<b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> {{of the whole}} tragedy) and four other women with their infants, and to lead them away in triumph across the forest towards the Indian town.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray say no more, dear madam--you really confuse me. I am the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of {{his little}} outbreak. I most {{unfortunately}} {{reminded him of the}} time when he lived with us at Wurzburg--and in that way I revived one of his old delusions, which even your admirable treatment has failed to remove from his mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear,' remonstrated Mr. Pott, 'do {{not give}} way to these {{sensitive}} feelings. I never believed that the paragraph had any foundation, my dear--impossible. I was only angry, my dear--I may say outrageous--with the INDEPENDENT people for daring to insert it; that's all.' Mr. Pott cast an imploring look at the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of the mischief, as if to entreat him to say nothing about the serpent.|$|E
5000|$|... : U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon {{stated that}} he wanted to [...] "express my outrage at the loss of so many <b>innocent</b> lives, no <b>cause</b> can justify such inhuman and {{indiscriminate}} violence." ...|$|R
5000|$|They {{also argue}} that the {{civilian}} deaths caused by their operations are dwarfed by those dismissed as [...] "collateral damage" [...] caused by the full-scale military campaigns done by various world powers. Some see the <b>innocent</b> deaths <b>caused</b> by such operations as regrettable, but as an only option {{to solve the problems}} of millions of Palestinians. Furthermore, they point to the use of violence against non-combatants by most other independence struggles, including, they say, the American War of Independence.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, Maria Brentano (Valentina Cortese) and {{her younger}} sister Nora (Audrey Hepburn) flee to London as their father {{is about to be}} {{executed}} by his country's dictator. Seven years later, Maria unexpectedly meets Louis (Serge Reggiani), her childhood sweetheart, who is engaged in a plot to assassinate the dictator. Maria is persuaded to play an active part in the plan, but it all goes horribly wrong when the bomb they plant kills an <b>innocent</b> waitress, <b>causing</b> Maria much distress.|$|R
60|$|Taking {{leave of}} my publisher, I went to consult an artist-friend on my future prospects. I {{supposed}} {{myself to be}} merely {{on my way to}} a change of profession. As destiny ordered it, I was also {{on my way to the}} woman who was not only to be the object of my first love, but the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of the great disaster of my life.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{appears that}} there was some {{difficulty}} about his seat, which was sold to him at the box office, and which he, nevertheless, found wrongfully occupied by a determined lady, who refused to move. The management had to be appealed to; the attendants also remembered not only the incident, but also the face and appearance of the gentleman who was the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of the altercation.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{promises}} {{to become an}} expensive undertaking," [...] remarked Maud, with a sigh. [...] "Perhaps {{it will be better}} to let me go alone, as I originally expected to do. But, if we take along the hospital ship, do not be extravagant, Mr. Merrick, in equipping it. I feel that I have been the <b>innocent</b> <b>cause</b> of drawing you all into this venture and I do not want it to prove a hardship to my friends." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{did they}} know of charlatanism or trickery? To them it was all real, living, awesome, terrible. The devil was a person with glowing eyes, two horns, and a forked tail, who <b>caused</b> <b>innocent</b> people to fall flat on their backs and foam at the mouth.|$|R
25|$|Claims {{that some}} of the {{provisions}} of the tax code are unconstitutional are submissions of a different order. They do not arise from <b>innocent</b> mistakes <b>caused</b> by the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code. Rather, they reveal full knowledge of the provisions at issue and a studied conclusion, however wrong, that those provisions are invalid and unenforceable. Thus, in this case, Cheek paid his taxes for years, but after attending various seminars and based on his own study, he concluded that the income tax laws could not constitutionally require him to pay a tax.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{typical of}} later Condon works is his precise {{detailing}} of the peripheral deaths and injuries to <b>innocent</b> bystanders <b>caused</b> by some particularly careless or coldblooded act committed {{by one of}} the characters, sometimes by the book's sympathetically drawn protagonist. Dr. Muñoz of The Oldest Confession is far from sympathetic—he is repellent even—and when he sets out to create an [...] "extraordinary diversion", one that will instantly have all of Madrid buzzing while Bourne carries out the actual theft of the Goya painting, he makes himself even more detestable. After carrying out the first step of the diversion demanded by Bourne: ...|$|R
