5|$|Beale {{suggested}} that, {{in addition}} to a military fort, the route was also in immediate need of bridges and dams to ensure safe travel and provide a reliable water supply; he requested $100,000 to fund the improvements. Further complicating the journey, the only pockets of civilization between Albuquerque and San Bernardino, California, a distance of , were the Zuni and Laguna pueblos. According to Baley, US Army officers stationed in Albuquerque insisted the emigrants hire Jose Manuel Savedra, a Mexican guide who had traveled with Beale during his initial survey of the route, and his interpreter, Petro. Unbeknownst to the group, Beale was unhappy with Savedra's scouting abilities, and had demoted him to helping with the animals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> train.

5|$|Southern Cross left London on 23 August 1898, after {{inspection}} by HRH the Duke of York (the future King George V), {{who presented}} a Union Flag. Along with the expedition's personnel, equipment and provisions {{the ship was}} carrying Siberian sledge dogs, {{the first to be}} taken on an Antarctic expedition. After final provisioning in Hobart, Tasmania, Southern Cross sailed for the Antarctic on 19 December. She crossed the Antarctic Circle on 23 January 1899, and was then caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> ice for three weeks. Cape Adare was sighted on 16 February, and the following day the ship was anchored close to the shore.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the {{expedition}} had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen {{to believe that a}} specially designed ship could be frozen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> ice and follow the same track as the Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole.|$|E

25|$|As {{a matter}} of course in the Royal Navy, all captains who lost ships were tried by Courts-Martial. And so Belcher was tried by court-martial for abandoning the four {{seaworthy}} vessels, as were Resolutes captain, Henry Kellett; Intrepid 's commander, Francis Leopold McClintock; and Pioneer 's commander, Sherard Osborn. All were acquitted. Belcher, however, never received another commission and was scorned by the officers of his Court-Martial when they returned his sword to him in complete silence. Resolute continued to move slowly eastward <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> ice, and one year later in the autumn of 1855 she was 1200 miles away from the place where she had been abandoned. In September 1855 an American whaler named James Buddington, from New London, CT saw Resolute adrift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> ice off Cape Walsingham in Davis Strait. He split his crew and sailed her back to New London, arriving home on Christmas Eve. Buddington's ship, George Henry, had preceded Resolute, and many were beginning to wonder if Buddington was still alive. The British government waived all claims to the ship upon learning of its arrival in New London.|$|E

40|$|The {{intensification}} of rapid reactions for multiphase systems in a microchannel reactor by packing microparticlesIn this study, the nitration of o-nitrotoluene (NT) with mixed acid {{as a model}} fast liquid-liquid multiphase reaction was conducted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> and nonpacked microchannel reactors. Better reaction performance could be obtained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> microchannel reactor compared with the nonpacked microchannel reactor because of its excellent mass transfer performance.

25|$|Despite Ferrari's {{dominance}} (taking 15 wins {{from the}} 18 races), the battle back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> {{was much more}} open than 2002, as powerhouses McLaren and Williams got off to horrendous starts with radical new cars. As could have been expected, Renault were quick {{to capitalize on the}} misfortunes of the two older British teams, but the real shock came from British American Racing, led by Jenson Button. Although failing to win a race, Button was a regular sight on the 2nd or 3rd step of the podium, and with teammate Takuma Sato who had finished 3rd at the US Grand Prix behind the Ferraris managed to clinch 2nd in the Constructors' Championship, leaving Renault 3rd, Jarno Trulli's win in Monaco some consolation.

25|$|The 1896 Championship {{witnessed}} {{a change in}} direction for the Welsh team, with a massive upheaval in the team selection. The selectors chose a new pairing at half-back for the first game against England, but the blame again fell on the forwards, with the English winning by a massive 25 points to nil. Biggs and Parfitt were brought back into the squad for the second game, but more importantly five new caps made their debut <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack.</b> The Scottish lost 6–0 against Wales at Cardiff, which {{was seen as an}} upset by the inexperienced Welsh. Biggs missed the final game against Ireland and his replacement, Llewellyn Lloyd, had a torrid time trying to defend the Irish attacks.

25|$|Broadcast 25 November 1993, {{the second}} {{programme}} examines what happens during spring on Antarctica. The sea ice extends {{for hundreds of}} miles around the continent, {{but there are a}} few subantarctic islands that escape it. Such places are highly valued, for as the sea never freezes, animals can always get ashore. Elephant seals are the first creatures to return to the beaches. They form large breeding colonies, where the males fight fierce battles to gain and retain permanent access to a great number of females and mate with them as soon as they are receptive again. Millions of macaroni penguins occupy huge territories on the islands to breed, as do thousands of albatrosses. The Antarctic peninsula is one of the few regions of the continent inhabited by animals, even in summer. Gentoo penguins build their nests on bare rock and humpback whales seek krill along the coast, while Adelie penguins nest even further south. Crabeater seals, one of the most numerous mammals on Earth, live and reproduce <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> ice zone around Antarctica. Snow petrels fly many miles into the island to find rock on which to lay their eggs.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some that {{this is perhaps the}} most interesting of all the series events, including the race itself. In this event there are heats of 5–8 riders, depending on the number of riders signed up for the day. These heats are seeded according to the results of each rider's ITT. Riders are placed along the starting line in order from fastest (on the inside) to slowest (on the outside) and are then given one lap to get the position they want <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> and to gain some speed. Once they cross the start/finish line again, the race begins. The riders race around the track and every time the pack crosses the start/finish line, the last one to cross is out and must leave the track. Riders keep racing until there are only three riders left. These three riders {{move on to the next}} round. This process continues until the final heat of 8. In this heat, riders continue to race and get out until you have the last three and then they commence a one lap full out sprint and the first, second, and third-place winners are determined by the order in which the riders cross the start/finish line. This is a great event because it really measures the skill of a rider, because in order to win, a rider must be more than just fast. If a rider hopes to win, she must also have good drafting skills, the ability to find good positioning, the intuition to know when to get out of the pack and sprint around the outside, and the endurance to be able to do this all day.|$|E
