5000|$|According to McMoneagle, remote viewing is {{possible}} and accurate outside the boundaries of time. He believes he has remote-viewed into the past, present, and future and has predicted future events. Among the subjects {{he claims to have}} remote-viewed are a Chinese nuclear facility, the Iranian hostage crisis, the Red Brigades, and <b>Muammar</b> <b>Qadhafi.</b> He writes that he predicted the location and existence of the Soviet [...] "Typhoon"-class submarine in 1979, and that in mid-January 1980, satellite photos confirmed those predictions. McMoneagle says the military remote viewing program was ended partly due to stigma: [...] "Everybody wanted to use it, but nobody wanted to be caught dead standing next to it. There’s an automatic ridicule factor. ‘Oh, yeah, psychics.’ Anybody associated with it could kiss their career goodbye." [...] Supporters of his claims include Charles Tart.|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{analyses}} {{the recent}} transformation of regional {{security in the}} Maghreb and Sahel. It argues that the collapse of <b>Muammar</b> <b>Qadhafi’s</b> Libya combined with the refusal of Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s Algeria {{to act as a}} regional hegemon in the Sahel has produced a new conjuncture of intensified security interdependence between the Sahel and the Maghreb. It furthermore suggests that this new interdependence has eclipsed the Western Sahara conflict as the most important regional security issue capable of shaping present-day domestic and regional security politics in the two regions. The rise of the Sahel-Maghreb security issue, does not, however, signal an end to the importance of the Western Sahara conflict in regional security. While Algeria and Morocco may have developed an overlapping vision and shared interest in the future development of Libya after Qadhafi, the continued non-resolution of the Western Sahara conflict remains a potential root cause for a great regional power rupture between Algeria and Morocco...|$|R

5000|$|Monitor Group {{was hired}} in 2005 to assess the state of Libya’s economy, develop plans for {{economic}} modernization and reform of the banking system, and train leaders from different sectors of society. The work did not involve any wider political reforms in the North African nation. According to a 2007 memo from Monitor to Libya's intelligence chief which was subsequently obtained by the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition and posted on the internet in 2009, Monitor entered into further contracts with the Libyan regime in 2006 which were worth at least $3m (£1.8m) per year plus expenses. According to the memo these contracts were for a campaign to [...] "enhance international {{understanding and appreciation of}} Libya... emphasize the emergence of the new Libya... and introduce <b>Muammar</b> <b>Qadhafi</b> as a thinker and intellectual." [...] Monitor’s work became the subject of controversy with the onset of the Libyan Civil War. In March 2011 Monitor announced that it had launched an internal investigation into its work for the Libyan government and in May 2011 registered past work in Libya.|$|R

[...] In connection with these contracts Monitor engaged and flew to Libya several leading Western academics, including Anthony Giddens of the London School of Economics (LSE), Joseph Nye of Harvard’s Kennedy School, Benjamin Barber of Rutgers University and Michael Porter. Monitor also provided research support for a doctoral thesis which Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, submitted to the LSE. During this period Monitor also proposed a separate project to write a book for a fee of $2.45 million, to be published in Gaddafi's name and which would [...] "allow the reader to hear Gaddafi elaborate, in his own words and in conversation with renowned international experts, his core ideas on individual freedom, direct democracy vs. representative democracy, and the role of state and religion". The book was never completed and Monitor later stated that the project had been a [...] "serious mistake on our part".|$|R
