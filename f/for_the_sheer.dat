This was Argentina's first win under new coach Jorge Sampaoli.|$|E
25|$|The reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheer</b> {{number of}} dams in the project, more than would at first appear needed, is maintenance. Dams {{need to be}} cleaned from the debris carried with the water flow. After a while the dam becomes {{obsolete}} as water flow slows down to inadequate levels. The dams will be shut down every 5 to 10 years for fall maintenance (also called fall cleanup). Water levels are normally lowest in fall. The extra dams are placed in service during this maintenance period.|$|E

25|$|José Martí {{is usually}} honored {{as a great}} poet, patriot and martyr of Cuban Independence, {{but he was also}} a {{translator}} of some note. Although he translated literary material <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheer</b> joy of it, much of the translating he did was imposed on him by economic necessity during his many years of exile in the United States. Martí learned English at an early age, and had begun to translate at thirteen. He continued translating {{for the rest of his}} life, including his time as a student in Spain, although the period of his greatest productivity was during his stay in New York from 1880 until he returned to Cuba in 1895.|$|E
25|$|Singapore {{once had}} a burgeoning pork industry, which used to yield S$300,000,000 annually. By 1985, {{there were at least}} 520 pig farms {{situated}} within the island-state, {{to keep up with the}} citizens' demand for fresh pork. Most of the consumers were of Chinese ethnicity. However, Singapore's status as a land-scarce nation could not allow <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheer</b> number of pig farms and thus in mid-1984 the government began closing down or relocating these farms. Stricter sanitation guidelines were also imposed on the farm owners. By 1990, the number of pig farms in Singapore had already been reduced to 22, with neighbouring country Indonesia supplying the majority of the country's fresh pork. To minimise reliance on overseas imports of fresh pork, the government decided to promote an alternative – frozen pork.|$|E

He loved practical jokes, and allegedly kept a halfpenny in his pocket to trick pickpockets. On another occasion he played a joke on the delegates at a Prehistoric Society conference by lecturing them on a theory that the Neolithic monument of Woodhenge had been constructed as an imitation of Stonehenge by a nouveau riche chieftain. Several audience members failed to realise that he was being tongue in cheek.|$|E
500|$|Ferb was devised as a {{character}} devoid of ill will. Marsh explained, [...] "It was important to us that [...] never did anything with any animosity.

500|$|Doubt (also 2008) {{features}} Streep with Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis. A drama {{revolving around}} the stern principal nun (Streep) of a Bronx Catholic school in 1964 who brings accusations of pedophilia against a popular priest (Hoffman), the film became a moderate box office success, and was hailed by many critics {{as one of}} the best films of 2008. The film received five Academy Awards nominations, for its four lead actors and for Shanley's script. Ebert, who awarded the film the full four stars, highlighted Streep's caricature of a nun, who [...] "hates all inroads of the modern world", while Kelly Vance of The East Bay Express remarked: [...] "It's thrilling to see a pro like Streep step into an already wildly exaggerated role and then ramp it up a few notches just <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheer</b> hell of it.

In NME Jerry Smith called the collection [...] "a weird and wonderful varied combination of the zany, trivial, witty and wacky, delivered with a spritely foot-tapping ease that belies their bizarre subject matter". Record Mirrors Iestyn George observed that [...] "if it's to be faulted, the album is a mite too cluttered for its own good, but the virtues of imagination and originality that these native New Yorkers display are worthy of enthusiastic approval". Andy Ross of Sounds {{believed that it was}} the duo's melodic talents that prevented them from becoming just a novelty act, and wrote that Flood was [...] "a real cryptic crossword of an album, requiring perseverance and application with ultimately rewarding and fulfilling results".|$|E

500|$|In another {{unqualified}} review, Time {{wrote that}} the film had [...] "a vitality that makes their efforts fully the equal of the original picture... Screenwriters Hurlbut & Balderston and Director James Whale have given it the macabre intensity proper to all good horror pieces, but have substituted a queer kind of mechanistic pathos <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheer</b> evil that was Frankenstein." [...] The Oakland Tribune concurred it was [...] "a fantasy produced on a rather magnificent scale, with excellent stagecraft and fine photographic effects". While the Winnipeg Free Press thought that the electrical equipment {{might have been better}} suited to Buck Rogers, nonetheless the reviewer praised the film as [...] "exciting and sometimes morbidly gruesome", declaring that [...] "All who enjoyed Frankenstein will welcome his Bride as a worthy successor." [...] The New York Times called Karloff [...] "so splendid in the role that all one can say is 'he is the Monster. The Times praised the entire principal cast and Whale's direction in concluding that Bride is [...] "a first-rate horror film", and presciently suggested that [...] "The Monster should become an institution, like Charlie Chan."

[...] A Dinamani article that day said, [...] "People who were depressed with the quality of our Tamil pictures so far can now raise their heads and hail proudly that a great picture can be produced in our land also." [...] Kumudam gave the film a lukewarm review: [...] "Though the story is ordinary, the shocking events inserted into the narrative are something new to the Tamil cinema." [...] The magazine criticised the film's songs and length, saying that its time period was inconsistent: [...] "In a scene, there is a wall clock in the King's office, whereas he is writing with a feather-pen." [...] In its January 1949 issue Gundoosi magazine praised Chandralekha Hindi version as an improvement on the Tamil version, saying that it had better dialogue and pacing.|$|E
