25|$|In contrast, the Dual Language System Hypothesis {{states that}} bilinguals have a {{separate}} system for the L1 and L2 which they learn right from the start, so both languages can be acquired simultaneously. Research on vocabulary development have generally provided strong support for this theory. Monolingual children in early language development learn one term for each concept, so does a bilingual child, <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bilingual child does so for both L1 and L2, and hence they know two language terms of the same concept that has similar meaning, which {{is also known as}} translational equivalents.

[...] Critic Richard Freeman found Barbara Hershey's character [...] "moronic", and referred to the film as [...] "twaddle." [...] Freeman said it was [...] "fraught with symbolism. Or maybe it is just fraught". He further said of the film, [...] "Actually, it's about David Carradine, of whom the less said the better". The Kokomo Tribune called the story [...] "pointless".

500|$|As {{opposed to}} a theodicy (a {{justification}} for God's actions), Plantinga puts forth a defense, offering a new proposition that is intended to demonstrate that it is logically possible for an omnibenevolent, omnipotent and omniscient God to create a world that contains moral evil. Significantly, Plantinga {{does not need to}} assert that his new proposition is true, merely that it is logically valid. In this way Plantinga's approach differs from that of a traditional theodicy, which would strive to show not <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new propositions are valid, but that the argument is sound, prima facie plausible, or that there are good grounds for making it. Thus the burden of proof on Plantinga is lessened, and yet his approach may still serve as a defense against the claim by Mackie that the simultaneous existence of evil and an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God is [...] "positively irrational".|$|E
500|$|Glover {{believes}} Lionel has {{two competing}} agendas with Lex—for Lex {{to become his}} own man and for Lex to follow in his father's steps. This becomes frustrating for Lex because Lionel wants his son to be both [...] "loyal follower" [...] and the [...] "best person he can be". This all plays into Lionel's [...] "pretty huge ego". John Glover believes if Lionel and Lex were not related Lionel would have [...] "destroyed" [...] Lex early on because he views his son as [...] "weak". Lionel is also bound {{by the fact that}} Lex is his heir, although he does not trust Lex. Lionel's distrust of Lex partially arises because he believes Lex is a coward. John Glover said, [...] "It's not that [...] meant to be a foe; it's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poor boy's weak, so [...] mold him.

[...] 411Mania's Ron Martin described the episode as having a [...] "ridiculous set up". Andre Dellamorte of Collider thought negatively of the episode as well, calling it [...] "Mannered {{to the point of}} ridiculousness." [...] While he didn't consider it the worst episode he's ever seen, he criticized the episode's pacing and lack of satire, writing [...] "it’s <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plates spin so fast and so pointlessly that it becomes just about the gags.

500|$|A printed inverted-F antenna can be {{implemented}} in the classic inverted-F shape, usually {{to one side of}} the circuit board where the ground plane has been removed from underneath the antenna. [...] However, another approach is a modified patch antenna, the shorted patch antenna. [...] In this approach, one edge of the patch, or some intermediate point, is grounded with grounding pins or vias through to the ground plane. [...] This works on the same principle as an inverted-F; viewed sideways, the F shape can be seen, it is <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> antenna element is very wide in the horizontal plane. [...] The shorted patch antenna has a wider bandwidth than the thin line type due to the greater radiation area. [...] Like the thin line type, the shorted patch antenna can be printed on the same printed circuit board as the rest of the circuitry. [...] However, they are commonly printed on to their own board, or on to a dielectric fixed to the main board. [...] This is done so that the antenna, can be suspended and effectively be in air dielectric, is a greater distance from the ground plane than it would otherwise be, or the dielectric used is a more suitable material for RF performance.|$|E
500|$|Haunting Ground {{received}} [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews per ratings aggregator Metacritic. Critics {{were quick}} {{to compare it to}} the Clock Tower series, specifically its 2002 installment, Clock Tower 3 (2002). The defenseless heroine elements and hide-and-chase gameplay were found to be highly derivative of the former titles. The dog companion was, for some, a well-received addition to the gameplay formula, with Eurogamer's Kristan Reed comparing it positively to Ico. Others found the dog and other gameplay elements to be repetitive and contributors to poor pacing. The graphics, cinematics, and atmosphere were universally praised. The staff at 1UP.com described the environments as [...] "some of the most detailed, lavish 3D environments Capcom has ever produced." [...] Kill Screen's Zach Budgor compared Haunting Ground's [...] "psychological landscape" [...] to Dario Argento's film Suspiria (1977) and also highlighted its grotesque expressionism. Despite these highlights, critics ultimately felt that Haunting Ground was too predictable and relied heavily on clichés previously established in the horror genre. For this reason, Reed said it [...] "becomes stifled by its own eventual lack of ambition to break away from the norms instilled by two generations of Japanese horror adventures." [...] The staff at 1UP.com felt the game was dated when compared with the recently released Resident Evil 4 (2005), but said, [...] "Haunting Ground isn't without merit, it's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> merits are buried deep in an occasionally thrilling, mostly 'been there, done that' game of indistinct origin." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital.
