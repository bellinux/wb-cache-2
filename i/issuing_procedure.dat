Applicants have to apply in person - {{in case of a}} child under 14, accompanied by a parent - at the local police department or at a Greek Consulate Authority. Upon submitting all the requirements (special portrait photo, issuing request and fee), the police department begins the <b>issuing</b> <b>procedure.</b> All passports are manufactured centrally at the N.P.C main building in Athens. Depending on the circumstances, passports are issued in 3 to 9 business days and must be picked up at the police department in which the issuing request was made. For this, an applicant must carry with her/him a special receipt they received after applying. Standard passports are valid for a period of 5 years for adults and teenagers above 14 years and 3 years for children under 14 (after the official edition of the 135th Presidential decree in 2007).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A secure roaming {{protocol}} for mobile networks is proposed. Roaming has been analysed in some schemes from the security point of view; however, there are vulnerabilities {{in most of}} them and so the claimed security level is not achieved. The scheme offered by Wan et al. recently is based on hierarchical identity-based encryption, in which the roaming user and the foreign network mutually authenticate each other {{without the help of}} the home network. Although the idea behind this proposal is interesting, it contradicts technical considerations such as routing and billing. The proposed protocol makes use of similar functions used in Wan et al. ’s scheme but contributes a distinguished structure that overcomes the previous shortcomings and achieves a higher possible level of security in mobile roaming as well as enhancing the security of the key <b>issuing</b> <b>procedure.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Anonymous {{credential}} {{systems have}} to provide strong privacy pro-tection: a user may prove his (chosen) attributes without leaking neither his identity nor other attributes. In this paper we consider U-Prove – {{one of the major}} commercial anonymous credential sys-tems. We show that the revocation mechanism designed for U-Prove en-ables a system provider to efficiently trace the users ’ activities. Namely, the Revocation Authority run the system provider may execute the U-Prove protocol in a malicious way so that: (a) the deviations from the protocol remain undetected, (b) the Revocation Authority becomes aware of each single authentication of a user in the whole system and can link them (regardless which attributes are disclosed by the user against the verifiers), (c) it can link presenta-tion tokens with the corresponding token <b>issuing</b> <b>procedure</b> (under some conditions). Thereby, the system described in the technical drafts of U-Prove does not guarantee privacy protection unless the system provider can be trusted unconditionally. In fact, a malicious provider may convert the Revocation Authority into a “Big Brother ” installation...|$|E

40|$|In {{the race}} against climate change, aiming for {{low-carbon}} competitiveness, Flanders has initiated a carbon neutrality strategy on industrial parks, building towards energy efficient buildings and processes, {{acting as a}} stimulus for the production and consumption of green electricity. However, premises and internal process optimisation on industrial parks is not considered sufficient to limit greenhouse emissions in Flanders. Structural transition is called for, aiming for industrial clustering and energy autonomy based on renewables. Therefore, the concept of industrial symbiosis is analysed to determine how it could improve the energy-related carbon management on industrial parks. This article explores the literature on industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks searching for specific energy strategies, and is illustrated with case studies. Energy management on industrial parks can be integrated in the entire development process and park management. Maximising efficiency is a promising local optimisation issue, in which business should be engaged, stimulated and facilitated. By clustering buildings and processes, by energy exchange, collective production and joint contracting of energy services, local synergies can be intensified. Yet, uncertainty and variability in time of energy consumption can keep developers from tailoring industrial park design and utilities. Instead flexibility and solidity could be gained, and the offer of business space could be diversified, supported by a persevering <b>issuing</b> <b>procedure</b> to join similar and matching energy profiles. Energy management on industrial parks in Flanders has only recently started but is expected to gain professionalism. However {{further research is needed}} on this flexible design and thermal planning. Eco-industrial park Mixed industrial park Energy management Carbon footprint...|$|E

As most of engineering problems and courses are based on mathematical modeling which appreciates ample computing power, parallel machines make the best platform to carry out the computations. Thanks to the development of open source parallel processing library, it is possible to build a powerful cluster out of commodity personal computers. Almost all institutions have plenty of retired personal computers. Supplemented with free operating systems and parallel processing library, they can be built into a parallel machine with minimal cost. The performance of the cluster is sufficient for education purpose.

Accordingly, a randomized, crossover study was undertaken to clarify this <b>issue.</b> <b>Procedure</b> Seventeen children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and treated on standard protocols were randomized to receive G-CSF following either {{the first or second}} intensification blocks of chemotherapy. G-CSF was administered as a single daily subcutaneous injection of 5 mcg/kg from day 9 following the start of intensification therapy, and continued until the neutrophil count exceeded 0. 5 × 109 /l for 3 days. Study endpoints were days of neutropenia (neutrophils < 1 × 109 /l) and severe neutropenia (neutrophils < 0. 5 × 109 /l), days in hospital, days of fever, and days on antibiotics.
