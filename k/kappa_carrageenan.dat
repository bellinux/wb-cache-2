40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two sections: - a) The {{development}} and application of a new method for the analysis of the ultrasonic relaxation spectra of molecules undergoing conformational changes. The analytical technique described has the advantage over previous methods of treating ultrasonic relaxation data on conformational systems, in that for the first time, enthalpy differences which are consistent with those obtained from spectroscopic techniques can be derived. b) A study of the binding of ions and small molecules to macromolecules using the resonance interferometric technique. The ultrasonic resonance method has been used to study proton transfer to the c-amino group of poly-L-lysine as a function of pH and polypeptide concentration. The relaxation data, obtained by several workers and relating to proton transfer in a range of amino-acids has been analysed using the Debye-Smoluchowski - Eigen equations in an attempt to explain the observed absorption behaviour. This work was extended to study a similar phenomenon involving the interaction between a number of sodium alkyl sulphates and N-polyvinylpyrrolidone, a synthetic polymer, in aqueous solution at detergent concentrations above and below the surfactant critical micelle concentration.

Previous qualitative research revealed women had strong preferences regarding product shape, while preferences related to size and firmness were less clear. Here, we explored the effect of size and firmness on the acceptability of semisolid ovoid microbicide prototypes intended for vaginal use. Sexually active women (n = 74) were randomized {{to one of two}} conditions: with and without applicator. Nine different prototypes were evaluated; they were formulated to low, medium and high firmness using mixtures of <b>kappa</b> and iota <b>carrageenan</b> and potassium chloride.

Results indicated size and firmness both influenced the outcome measures, but firmness was more influential than size. Also, the specific effects of size and firmness depended strongly on presence or absence of an applicator. Generally, women in the without applicator condition wanted a larger, firmer product.

40|$|New Zealand?s {{isolation}} {{makes it}} a natural home to many unique species. One {{of them is the}} now cultivated New Zealand green shell mussel (Perna canaliculus) which is sought after by seafood lovers around the world. This mussel is by far the largest seafood export from New Zealand accounting for about 85 % and exported to 78 countries in 2011. This research was conducted to create a variant of an existing value-added product: lactic-fermented comminuted mussel meat. This product has been named Perna. The existing knowledge relates to a spreadable form of Perna, which is currently undergoing commercial evaluation. This work is mainly about developing a gelled form of Perna using hydrocolloids, specifically carrageenans and gelatine. The proposition was that a gelled, sliceable form of Perna would expand its culinary potential. The spreadable form would be used for crackers and breads, while a slice of Perna could be part of an entr?e in domestic cuisine or food service. However, as the project progressed it became clear that unacceptable variations in pH of Perna were affected by the time the mussels were cooked in boiling water prior to comminution and fermentation. Because of the fundamental importance of this variation in terms of odour/flavour, {{the first part of the}} thesis explores the chemistry of how pH could be better controlled. It was found that the buffering capacity of mussel proteins changed with cooking. Although no explanations were obtained at a biochemical level, the empirical outcome was that cooking live mussels between 7 to 10 minutes would predictably result in a desired final pH of around 4. 5 that yields superior organoleptic properties such as pleasant smell, taste and texture. Moving to gelation as a goal, it was found that <b>kappa</b> and iota <b>carrageenans</b> were incapable of forming useful gels in Perna, the former producing excessive syneresis and latter a soft, spongy product. Experiments with gelatine were initially unsuccessful, inadvertently because of the low gelatine concentrations tested. After a more concentrated gelatine colloidal suspension of about 8 % was incorporated into the mussel mince, a useful gel was finally created, although the texture was crumbly. However, this final success is considered an excellent starting point for sliceable product refinement...|$|R

Com base nestas técnicas, nomeadamente em FTIR-ATR e FT-Raman, foram desenvolvidas metodologias inovadoras que nos permitiram a correcta identificação das diversas fracções de carragenana, em {{particular}} das variantes da família lambda (carragenana lambda, ksi e theta) e dos precursores biológicos (mu e nu) das carragenanas gelificantes (kappa e iota, respectivamente). Visto que as amostras foram sujeitas a uma manipulação mínima (as algas são simplesmente secas e moídas), a composição determinada representa, o mais fielmente possível, a composição natural dos ficocolóides. A espectroscopia de ressonância magnética nuclear do protão e do carbono 13 foi usada na caracterização e quantificação dos diferentes componentes das carragenanas extraídas. Eight carrageenophytes {{from the}} Central and Northern coast of Portugal, representing seven genera and four families of Gigartinales, were studied {{for a period}} of one year (seasonal variation studies) in the Buarcos bay and in fifteen other different coastal stations (geographic variation studies) from Baleal (Peniche), in the Central zone, to Moledo, in the Northern zone. The reproductive status, dry weight and carrageenan content have been followed by monthly random sampling. In general, the plant size and the biomass shows a seasonal increase in early Spring (April), a marked increase in early Summer (June/July) and low values in late Summer, Autumn and Winter. The low colloid content in Winter (December) and the high colloid content in Summer (July) can be related to high and low nutrient (N and P, mainly) contents of the water, respectively. The highest average carrageenan yield was found in Chondracanthus acicularis (40. 1 %), Gigartina pistillata (38. 7 %) and Chondracanthus teedei var. lusitanicus (34. 9 %). The haphazard sampling method (with quadrates) was used to determine the biomass and the continuous sampling method, applied along a perpendicular transept to the shoreline, was used to calculate the carrageenophytes cover in two periods: Autumn/Winter and Spring/Summer. The following results must be enhanced: the highest cover and biomass was found in Chondrus crispus (3. 75 % - 570 g m- 2), Chondracanthus acicularis (3. 45 % - 99 g m- 2), Chondracanthus teedei var. lusitanicus (2. 51 % - 208 g m- 2) and Mastocarpus stellatus (2. 02 % - 520 g m- 2). In order to characterize the different carrageenan types, vibrational (Infrared and Raman) and resonance (1 H and 13 C-NMR) spectroscopy has been used to show detailed information concerning the properties and structure of these polysaccharides at molecular level. In this work some techniques of analysis based on the FTIR-ATR and FT-Raman spectroscopy have been developed in order to obtain an accurate identification of the diverse carrageenan fractions, with particular relief for the variants of lambda-family (lambda, ksi and theta) and for the biological precursors (mu and nu) of the gelling <b>carrageenans</b> (<b>kappa</b> and iota, respectively). Because the samples are minimally treated (dried ground algal material), the determined composition represents, as accurately as possible, the natural composition of the colloids. The spectra of both commercial carrageenan samples and common carrageenophytes were used as reference. The NMR (1 H and 13 C) spectroscopy was used in order to characterize and quantify the different carrageenan fractions in the extracted phycocolloids (water and alkali extractions). A new set of 13 C and 1 H-NMR chemical shifts of most common carrageenan types is given relative to DSS as the internal standard according to the IUPAC recommendations. Moreover, the chemical shifts of characteristic signal for pyruvate acetal and floridean starch are reported. Relatively to the carrageenan types, the following results are to be enhanced: female gametophytes and non-fertile thalli samples of C. crispus, M. stellatus, C. teedei var. lusitanicus, G. pistillata, C. acicularis and Gymnogongrus crenulatus, show a significant degree of kappa-iota hybrid carrageenan (copolymers of kappa-iota carrageenan). Relative amounts of the different gelling carrageenan fractions were determined with 1 H-NMR. The carrageenans extracted from Ahnfeltiopsis devoniensis are mainly constituted by iota-carrageenan, but seasonal variations in the nature of carrageenans are present. Lambda-family carrageenans were found in tetrasporophytes of C. cripus (lambda carrageenan), M. stellatus (lambda carrageenan), C. teedei var. lusitanicus (hybrid ksi-theta carrageenan), C. aciculais (hybrid ksi-theta carrageenan) and G. pistillata (hybrid ksi-lambda carrageenan). Calliblepharis jubata presents carrageenans of iota-type in all reproductive stages. Considering these results, based on FTIR-ATR, FT-Raman and 1 H-NMR techniques, more sensible than 13 C-NMR, we can conclude that the carragenana kappa and iota have distinct biological precursors, mu and nu respectively. The “soft” alkaline extraction method, used in this work, makes possible the carrageenan extraction with low degradation and high molecular weight. Taking in consideration the high available biomass and the phycocolloid content of the Chondracanthus species and Gigartina pistillata they are a potentially important source of copolymers of kappa-iota carrageenan, in addition to the traditionally harvested carrageenophytes (M. stellatus and C. crispus). However, collection of seaweeds from rocky shore has its limitations, as it always contains the risk of overcollection and subsequent loss of the population. The next step, in the near future, will be to develop further studies in order to introduce these carrageenophytes in the aquaculture integrated systems. In this work, fronds of G. pistillata exhibiting both tetrasporangial sori and cystocarps, i. e., tetraspores and carpospores (heterosporic thalli), were found in several costal stations. In order to clarify the nature and function of these reproductive structures, it’s morphological, cytological and biochemical study was carried out. Other morphological, citochemical and ultrastructural studies were performed in selected carrageenophytes in order to study both the carpospore/tetraspore formation (C. teedei var. lusitanicus) and polysaccharide distribution (cellulose and carrageenan) in the thalli and cell walls (G. crenulatus, A. devoniensis and G. pistillata).

40|$|The {{extraction}} of agar and carrageenan {{was carried out}} after alkali treatment, and alginate after acid treatment, of samples agarophytes and carrageenophytes were treated at high temperatures whilst the alginophytes were extracted at room temperature. Agar yield and gel strength were obtained after alkali treatment (5 % NaOH, at 70 and 80 ℃, for 2 hours) from commercially harvested Gracilaria chorda (mature and young material) from Japan; G. fisheri (cultivated and wild material from Thailand); G. verrucosa from the Philippines and G. lemaneiformis from Chile. Agar with a high yield (18. 34 % of dry weight) and gel strength (692 ± 24 g. cm^) was obtained from G. chorda (mature thalli) after alkali treatment at 80 ℃, whilst a low yield (9. 92 %) and gel strength (355 ± 22 g. cm^) was obtained from G. verrucosa. The yield and gel strength of carrageenan were obtained with alkali treatment (6 % KOH), for <b>kappa</b> <b>carrageenan</b> and 6 % NaOH for iota carrageenan, at 80 ℃ {{for a period of}} 3 hours, using different extract recovery methods (e. g. freeze-thawing, gel pressing and alcohol precipitation).

40|$|Hydrocolloid {{materials}} {{have been used}} for some time in the fields of regenerative medicine and drug delivery. Despite a significant body of work, to date the majority of research in the area has focused on relatively simple compositions and microstructures. In comparison, the food industry has long used refined and often subtle methods to structure and thereby tailor the release and handling properties of a vast range of similar materials. In this thesis, a range of processing methodologies has been used to generate novel materials intended for use in the regenerative medicine and drug delivery using gellan and <b>kappa</b> <b>carrageenan.</b> The thesis demonstrates how even small changes in process conditions can result in significant changes in the way a material handles and may deliver therapeutic molecules. This thesis has demonstrated that gellan can be used to form robust quiescent structures, as well as shear thinning fluid materials by changing the processing and formulation. Furthermore, it was demonstrated {{that it was possible to}} generate a novel cell delivery device by the hydration of <b>kappa</b> <b>carrageenan</b> in warm biomedical buffers.

40|$|Floating hydrogels were {{prepared}} from <b>kappa</b> <b>carrageenan</b> containing CaCO 3 and NaHCO 3 as pore forming agents. The effects of CaCO 3 and NaHCO 3 on hydrogel characterizations were investigated and compared. Amoxicillin trihydrate {{was used as}} a model drug. Characterizations of the hydrogels were carried out using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). As pore forming agents concentration increases, the porosity (%) and floating properties increased. NaHCO 3 incorporated hydrogels showed higher porosity with shorter floating lag time (FLT) than CaCO 3. Hydrogel which contained CaCO 3 exhibited better gel stability over the control and NaHCO 3 containing gel. Incorporation of CaCO 3 into <b>kappa</b> <b>carrageenan</b> hydrogel showed smoother surface gels compared to those produced with NaHCO 3. CaCO 3 also showed higher drug entrapment efficiency and sustained drug release profile than NaHCO 3. The results of these studies showed that, CaCO 3 is an effective pore forming agents in κC hydrogels preparation as compare to NaHCO 3. Thus, CaCO 3 can be an excellent pore forming agent for an effective floating drug delivery system...|$|E
