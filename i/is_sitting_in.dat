5|$|A set of {{fourteen}} redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, {{based on the}} Rider-Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork. The cards depict band members in surrealistic tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect the iconography of the album's lyrical content: The Fool is stepping off a cliff, with grainy images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a JFK campaign poster in the background; The Emperor, with prosthetic legs, <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a wheelchair clutching a rifle {{in front of an}} American flag; Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album's inner sleeve contains these three images, along with a further nine: The Magician, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Hermit, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star and The World. The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.|$|E

Michael grabs his customer list and makes a final desperate offer for the other employees to join him. Charles notices Michael and physically threatens him, prompting Michael to leave without the customer list. After Charles angrily closes the conference room door, Pam follows Michael out of the building, announcing that she is leaving with him. However, she tells Michael {{she wants to be}} a salesperson at his new company, not a receptionist. Michael agrees, then asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he wants to come with them, but he declines. Pam and Michael leave together, feeling both exhilarated and apprehensive.|$|E

On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale {{back to his}} farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for more every winter.|$|E

25|$|Momentum is a {{measurable}} quantity, and the measurement {{depends on the}} motion of the observer. For example: if an apple <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a glass elevator that is descending, an outside observer, looking into the elevator, sees the apple moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two observers each have a frame of reference, in which, they observe motions, and, if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see behavior that is consistent with those same physical laws.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} decoration focus' {{mainly on}} the western facade where {{the entrance to the}} building is.

The ornament also has large letters interlaced by shoots with leaves and flowers. The Holy Virgin <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the Oriental way with Child. The pattern of the rug is visible with drooping tassels. In Syunik temples of the thirteenth-fourteenth centuries the cult of the Holy Virgin was widely spread. She was depicted in relief, and many churches were dedicated to her.|$|E

For the Orlando attraction, Krusty <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a control room and pushes an emergency button on a control panel, causing the vehicle to vibrate, ending the ride. In the Hollywood version, Krusty <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a control room and takes a picture of the guests (The on-ride photo is taken here for the Hollywood attraction).

500|$|Alberti opines that, {{rather than}} denying All in the Familys {{influence}} on The Simpsons, the series writers [...] "mockingly embrace it" [...] by having Homer visually likened to Bunker {{as he sits}} on his chair. Alberti also noted {{that one of the}} security officer's use of the word [...] "pinko", a term used for a person who is regarded as sympathetic towards communism, is [...] "ironic" [...] as it was used by Bunker, whose chair Homer <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in.</b> When the other officer complains about citizens [...] "hiding behind the Bill of Rights", Homer shields himself from the officers blows with the actual manuscript, making the officer's previous statement literal.|$|E
500|$|When Homer is {{escorted by}} the hired goons into {{what appears to}} be Burns' conservatory, a Burns-headed bird <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> front of the screen, which then flies away. This is a {{reference}} to the cockatoo in Citizen Kane. The episode features an incidental music, a sample of [...] "Classical Gas" [...] by Mason Williams played by Lisa on a request from Lenny. Before Mr. Burns shuts off the power to the town in response to the strike, he says, [...] "From Hell's heart I stab at thee" [...] which is a reference to Captain Ahab's curse, from the novel Moby-Dick. The workers' resistance to the power outage, and Mr. Burns's response, is a parody of How the Grinch Stole Christmas.|$|E

500|$|As well as source {{information}} for Cheyenne military and social history, {{the book is}} a rich source of anecdotes. [...] One tale describes how Wooden Leg and Little Bird chase a fleeing Reno soldier. [...] Neither Indian was willing to shoot a fleeing man, as it [...] "seemed not brave" [...] to do so. [...] This did not prevent the soldier from shooting Little Bird, after which Wooden Leg clubbed the soldier off his horse. [...] Wooden Leg describes the screams of his mother when she is presented with a scalp as a present. In another story, Wooden Leg <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the lodge with his friend, Noisy Walking, who is dying of his battle wounds. He wants to support his friend but doesn't know what to say. There are many other examples.|$|E

It features a by-the-numbers band performance, in which Coldplay are playing in a huge, nearly empty room.

During the video, Martin sings directly to the camera. During the guitar solo, Martin runs up to the two women in the background, talks to them for a while, and then returns to sing the rest of the song. The video concludes with the band finishing the song.|$|E
500|$|While writing [...] "Tabula Rasa", Damon Lindelof {{suggested}} that John Locke {{was in a}} wheelchair {{before going to the}} island, and {{while the rest of the}} writing team initially reacted with shock, they embraced the idea. Lindelof wanted to embrace how [...] "what you think these people are is actually entirely different", particularly since [...] "Tabula Rasa" [...] did not have many developments on Kate's backstory or why she was a fugitive, [...] "the Locke thing was a huge, big, reveal". To enhance the plot twist, all the flashbacks were shot in a way that disguised the presence of a wheelchair. In the scene where Locke <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> his bed, the paralysis is alluded by the electromedical nerve stimulation machine on his nightstand. Lindelof also created a title for the episode, [...] "Lord of the Files", a pun on Lord of the Flies and Locke's off-island occupation, but the writers had already settled on [...] "Walkabout".|$|E
