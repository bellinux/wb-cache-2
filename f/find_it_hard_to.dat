5|$|In the January 2003 general {{election}}, the LPF shrank to 5.7% {{support and}} eight seats. Following the election the LPF was exchanged for the Democrats 66 {{in the government}} coalition, and would <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> maintain support in opposition. Besides Joost Eerdmans, most of its Members of Parliament were not very visible, while party leader Herben had enough work just keeping the party from further infighting. The party also went into financial straits, and as the new coalition continued most of the former coalition's policies, {{it was hard for}} the LPF to oppose the government.|$|E

Some in their twenties have a physical statures as small as the 7- or 8-years-old. They find it difficult to feed themselves, much less have mental ability or physical capacity for work. No one can hold back the tears when seeing the heads turning round unconsciously, the bandy arms managing to push the spoon of food into the mouths with awful difficulty... Yet they still keep smiling, singing in their great innocence, at the presence of some visitors, craving for something beautiful.|$|E

Less than 30% is African, whereas about 1% is of unmixed European descent. Because of this, Cape Verdeans <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> define themselves as either mixed or Africans. They regard themselves as either both or as unique Cape Verdeans.

They need to give and receive a lot of affection and will direct it towards family, close friends and animals. A subject lacking water may lack intuition and be unable to see the needs of others. They may be too full of ideas or too fond of the material world to consider their own spiritual needs or those of other people. Planets in the 4th, 8th and 12th houses in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|Government TVETs are {{particularly}} concerned with occupations requiring investment in {{machinery and equipment}} and with increasing provision in remote areas. Workshop provision varies in quality. Some TVETs have good provision but many others have a shortage of workshops or old dilapidated workshops that lack safety features, basic sanitary facilities and essential equipment. Classrooms, stores and libraries may be in poor condition or non-existent. Instructors may lack competence since, in 2012, only 53% of those assessed met the assessment criteria. Even when TVETs have machinery and equipment, {{there are too many}} students for the few resources available. Students cannot meet the 70% to 80% requirement for practice and training remains theory based. Consequently, students have difficulty in meeting the assessment criteria with only 23% of students being found competent in 2012. Students who do graduate may still <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> get work. The Amhara TVET promotion bureau found only about 40% of TVET graduates managed to obtain employment.|$|E

30|$|Against this, {{there are}} reasons why migration-innovation {{channels}} may be limited. A diverse team may <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> communicate, and levels of trust may also be lower (Alesina and Ferrara 2005). As a result, organisations may <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> make decisions or allocate resources, {{and the quality of}} those decisions may be lower than in more homogenous organisations. Similarly, if knowledge flows only within diasporic communities, this will limit the scope of knowledge spillovers. Finally, diverse organisations may also face discrimination from other market actors.|$|R

500|$|The Castle Doctrine {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, {{with a score}} on review aggregator Metacritic of 58/100. Patrick Carlson of PC Gamer reviewed the game well, responding positively to the game rewarding experimentation and being easy to understand, describing it as thoughtfully designed. Game Informer's Daniel Tack also rated the game well, commenting particularly on its creativity, stating though {{that he did not}} think the game was [...] "deep enough to stay interesting for long."

500|$|These {{conditions}} create [...] "maximum surplus appropriation"; workers' {{daily lives}} revolve around factory production and {{are dependent on}} the economic conditions.

The 2003 statistics from the People's University show 90% of migrants work without contracts, directly violating the Chinese Labour Law.

500|$|The monarch {{butterfly}} (Danaus plexippus) {{is a member}} of a Müllerian complex with the viceroy butterfly (Limenitis archippus), sharing coloration patterns and display behaviour. The viceroy has subspecies with somewhat different coloration, each closely matching the local Danaus species. For example, in Florida, the pairing is of the viceroy and the queen butterfly, whereas in Mexico the viceroy resembles the soldier butterfly. The viceroy is thus involved in three different Müllerian pairs. This example was long believed to be Batesian, with the viceroy mimicking the monarch, but the viceroy is actually the more unpalatable species. The genus Morpho is palatable, but some species (such as M. amathonte) are strong fliers; birds – even species that specialize in catching butterflies on the wing – <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> catch them. The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most Morpho species may be Müllerian, or may be [...] "pursuit aposematism".|$|E

[...] She also notes that the series [...] "is more cynical than The Americans on FX and more pessimistic about human nature than The Walking Dead on AMC". However, The Americans [...] "is more complex and inventive" [...] according to Stanley who concurs that season 2 is darker but notes it is more compelling than season 1. [...] Stuever compares the show unfavorably to both Veep for its [...] "bumbling chaos and ego implosions" [...] over House of Cards [...] "prohibitively sinister" [...] execution and The Good Wife for its superior delivery of [...] "nastiness and self-interest in power plays".|$|E

500|$|Oblivion {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, {{and became}} a commercial success. The game had shipped 1.7million copies by April 10, 2006, sold over 3million copies by January 2007, and over 3.5 million by November 2011. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold 9.5 million copies worldwide. Reviewers praised the game for its impressive graphics, expansive game world and schedule-driven NPCs. Eurogamer editor Kristan Reed stated that the game [...] "successfully unites {{some of the best}} elements of RPG, adventure and action games and fuses them into a relentlessly immersive and intoxicating whole". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin wrote that compared to Morrowind, {{which was one of the}} best role-playing games he has seen in years, [...] "Oblivion is hands-down better, so much so that even those who'd normally have no interest in a role-playing game should <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> resist getting swept up in this big, beautiful, meticulously crafted world". X-Plays Jason D'Aprile stated, [...] "All the games in this series have been known for their sheer vastness and freedom of choice, but the Elder Scrolls IV takes that concept and runs with it".|$|E
500|$|In 1903, the Georgist Lizzie Magie {{applied for}} a patent on a game called The Landlord's Game with the object of showing that rents enriched {{property}} owners and impoverished tenants. She knew that some people would <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> understand the logic behind the idea, and she thought that if the rent problem and the Georgist solution to it were put into the concrete form of a game, it might be easier to demonstrate. She was granted the patent for the game in January 1904. The Landlord's Game {{became one of the}} first board games to use a [...] "continuous path", without clearly defined start and end spaces on its board. Another innovation in gameplay attributed to Magie is the concept of [...] "ownership" [...] of a place on a game board, such that something would happen to the second (or later) player to land on the same space, without the first player's piece still being present. A copy of Magie's game that she had left at the Georgist community of Arden, Delaware and dating from 1903–1904, was presented for the PBS series History Detectives. This copy featured property groups, organized by letters, later a major feature of Monopoly as published by Parker Brothers.|$|E
500|$|The World Hockey {{magazine}} {{reported on}} the first hockey tournament played on an artificial pitch in 1975a trial event in Montreal prior to the Olympicsand said the surface had [...] "enormous benefits". Steve Ruskin, of Sports Illustrated, said that [...] "A slow, analytical game gave way to one of nonstop, true-hop action." [...] However, it has been stated {{that the decision to}} make artificial surfaces mandatory greatly favoured more affluent Western countries who could afford these new pitches. Before the switch to an artificial surface the Indian men's hockey team were dominant, winning seven of the eight Olympic gold medals between 1928 and 1964. [...] In 1996, Indian hockey player Ajit Pal Singh stated that despite its size [...] " [...] can afford only 12 or so AstroTurf fields". Sardara Singh, captain of the Indian men's hockey team, said that [...] "hockey players in India play on astroturf {{for the first time at}} the age of 19 or 20 and <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> adapt." [...] However, the Pakistan hockey team have performed well following the change of surface despite the country being worse off economically and having fewer artificial pitches.
