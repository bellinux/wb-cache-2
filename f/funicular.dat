5|$|When a drop {{of falling}} water hits the {{interior}} of the cup with the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air by the force of the drop. The force of ejection tears open the purse, and results in the expansion of the <b>funicular</b> cord, formerly coiled under pressure in {{the lower part of the}} purse. The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive <b>funicular</b> cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby plant stem or stick. The hapteron sticks to it, and the <b>funicular</b> cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole. After drying out, the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.|$|E

5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} and transmission electron microscopy has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the <b>funicular</b> cord are arranged in a twisted form like a rope. Further, the <b>funicular</b> cord, known to be highly elastic and with a high tensile strength, is made of thicker hyphae {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched hyphae, known as skeletal hyphae. It has been proposed that these skeletal hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The Haifa {{underground}} {{railway system}} is called Carmelit. It is a subterranean <b>funicular</b> on rails, running from downtown Paris Square to Gan HaEm (Mother's Park) on Mount Carmel. With a single track, six stations and two trains, it {{is listed in}} Guinness World Records as the world's shortest metro line. The Carmelit accommodates bicycles.|$|E
5|$|The cone shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward force of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound <b>funicular</b> cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the <b>funicular</b> cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.|$|E

5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their <b>funicular</b> cord and basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the <b>funicular</b> cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E
5|$|The Mont Blanc massif {{is now a}} {{significant}} tourist destination. The region attracts over sixmillion people per annum, with around one in five gaining access to its slopes by means of mechanical infrastructure (cable cars or <b>funicular</b> railways). Some surveys have shown that tourists mostly come to the Mont Blanc massif and its environs for winter sports such as skiing as well as summer outdoor activities like hiking, climbing and cycling.|$|E
5|$|Crucibulum {{species have}} light tan to cinnamon-colored fruiting bodies, {{known as a}} {{peridium}}, that are cup- or crucible-shaped. Depending on the species, {{the size of the}} peridium may range from 2–4tall by 1.5–3mm wide at the mouth (for C.parvulum) to 5–10mm tall by 5–8mm wide (for C.laeve). Viewed microscopically, the wall of the peridium is made of a single layer of tissue, in contrast to the three-layered peridium wall in Cyathus species. The outer surface of the peridium has hyphae that agglutinate so as to form a texture with visible filaments, a condition known as fibrillose; this outer layers of hairs typically wears off with age to leave a relatively smooth surface. Young specimens have a thin layer of tissue called an epiphragm that covers the top of the peridium; it wears off at maturity to expose the peridioles within. There are usually 4–6 peridioles (up to 15 have been noted for C.laeve) that are disc-shaped, whitish in color, and attached to the endoperidium by a strand called a <b>funicular</b> cord. Made of mycelia, The <b>funicular</b> cord tends to wither away and disappear as the fruiting body ages. Spores from Crucibulum species typically have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape, and are thick-walled, transclucent (hyaline) or light yellow-brown in color, with dimensions of 5–15 by 5–8µm. the spores of C.cyathiforme are notably slightly or strongly curved.|$|E

5|$|Peridioles are {{attached}} to the fruit body by a funiculus, a complex structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the <b>funicular</b> cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In some species the peridioles may be covered by a tunica, a thin white membrane (particularly evident in C.striatus and C.crassimurus).|$|E

In Crucibulum species the peridioles is covered by a whitish tunica. The funiculus of Crucibulum species is markedly different from those of Cyathus species: in Crucibulum, the purse is a rounded knob 0.3–0.5mm wide, attached to the underside of the peridiole. Attaching the purse directly to the wall of the peridium is a stout yellow-grey cord 0.1mm wide and about 2.5mm long.|$|E

50|$|A {{cable car}} {{in the context of}} mass transit is a system using rail cars that are hauled by a {{continuously}} moving cable running at a constant speed. Individual cars stop and start by releasing and gripping this cable as required. Cable cars are distinct from <b>funiculars,</b> where the cars are permanently attached to the cable and cable railways, which are similar to <b>funiculars,</b> but the rail vehicles are attached and detached manually.|$|R
5|$|The peridioles {{are about}} 1 to 1.5mm wide and rarely up to 2mm wide. They are disc-shaped, but may appear angular due to {{pressure}} from neighbouring peridioles. Peridioles may be dark, or a drab gray if still covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.Peridioles in C.striatus are sheathed and attached to the endoperidium by complex cords of mycelia known as a funiculus in the singular. The funiculus is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. Inside the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the <b>funicular</b> cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. When dry the funiculus is brittle, but when wet it is capable of long extension.|$|E
5|$|The fruiting bodies, or perida, are funnel- or barrel-shaped, 6–15mm tall, 4–8mm wide at the mouth, {{sometimes}} short-stalked, {{golden brown}} to blackish brown in age. The outside {{wall of the}} peridium, the ectoperidium, is covered with tufts of fungal hyphae that resembles shaggy, untidy hair. However, in older specimens this outer layer of hair (technically a tomentum) may be completely worn off. The internal wall of the cup, the endoperidium, is smooth and grey to bluish-black. The 'eggs' of the bird's nest – the peridioles – are blackish, 1–2mm in diameter, and there are typically about 20 in the cup. Peridioles are often attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the <b>funicular</b> cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. However, Brodie reports that sometimes C.stercoreus is found without a funiculus, which has led some authors to misidentify this species with the genus Nidula.|$|E
