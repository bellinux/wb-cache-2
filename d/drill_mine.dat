40|$|This report {{proposes a}} method that will allow lunar vertical-shaft mining. Lunar mining allows the {{exploitation}} of mineral resources imbedded within the surface. The proposed lunar vertical-shaft mining system is comprised of five subsystems: structure, materials handling, <b>drilling,</b> <b>mining,</b> and planning. The structure provides support for the exploration and mining equipment in the lunar environment. The materials handling subsystem moves mined material outside the structure and <b>mining</b> and <b>drilling</b> equipment inside the structure. The drilling process bores into the surface {{for the purpose of}} collecting soil samples, inserting transducer probes, or locating ore deposits. Once the ore deposits are discovered and pinpointed, mining operations bring the ore to the surface. The final subsystem is planning, which involves the construction of the mining structure...|$|R

50|$|Meta-{{regulation}} {{is a form}} {{of regulation}} that encourages self-regulation of firms. In contrast to traditional forms of regulation, where decisions concerning rules are decided by the regulator, meta-regulation has firms create their own rules while observing and monitoring those rules. The advantages of self-regulation are that devolved structures of regulation allow for greater learning in complex and uncertain environments. Firms with the potential for catastrophic failure such as finance, oil <b>drilling,</b> <b>mining,</b> manufacturing, etc. often desire effective regulation to prevent such failures because of cost and damaged public relations. Meta-regulation has the advantage of fostering norms of reflexivity among institutions, as they are forced to conscientiously consider optimal levels of regulation and elucidate the reasoning to regulators. In an ideal world of meta-regulation the motivations for both regulators and regulatees become the same by diffusing the norms of safety and stability.|$|R

40|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} are a poor choice for {{addressing}} energy challenges in a carbon-constrained, post-Kyoto world. Nuclear generators {{are prone to}} insolvable infrastructural, economic, social, and environmental problems. They face immense capital costs, rising uranium fuel prices, significant lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, and irresolvable problems with reactor safety, waste storage, weapons proliferation, and vulnerability to attack. Renewable power generators, in contrast, reduce dependence on foreign sources of uranium and decentralize electricity supply so that an accidental or intentional outage would have a more limited impact than the outage of larger nuclear facilities. Most significantly, renewable power technologies have environmental benefits because they create power without relying on the extraction of uranium and its associated digging, <b>drilling,</b> <b>mining,</b> transporting, enrichment, and storage. As a result, renewable energy technologies provide a much greater potential for substantial carbon emissions reductions than significant investments in new nuclear power generation...|$|R
