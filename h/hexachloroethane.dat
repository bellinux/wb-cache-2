50|$|It was {{determined}} that spent hydrocarbons buried at the landfill disposal site included not only chlorobenzene, hexachlorobutadiene, <b>hexachloroethane,</b> hexachloronorbornadiene, naphthalene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, hexachlorocyclopentadiene, and benzene, but also the known carcinogens carbon tetrachloride and chloroform. The drums and cartons containing these chemicals were deposited in trenches that were 15 ft deep and 12 to 15 ft wide and covered with approximately 3 ft of soil. Velsicol took no precautions to insure the drums from bursting and, invariably, some of the drums would leak their contents into the soil. Furthermore, the trenches were neither lined nor covered with any impermeable material to prevent the chemical waste from leaking into the soil.

The <b>hexachloroethane</b> dehalogenation activity of CYP 101 has been investigated by mutagenesis.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} load of {{selected}} organochlorine compounds {{in the blood}} of aluminium foundry workers who use <b>hexachloroethane</b> as a degassing agent for aluminium and to measure some possible effects on internal organs. METHODS: Plasma from nine male aluminium foundry workers with past experience of use of <b>hexachloroethane</b> and 18 controls (two controls per exposed case) matched for residence, sex, age, and socioeconomic status was analysed for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), (P-HCB), and octachlorostyrene (P-OCS) with low resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Serum samples from the same subjects were analysed for standard kidney, pancreas, and liver function variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the triplets retained, a non-parametric test, and linear regression were used for the analysis. RESULTS: A fourfold increase of mean P-HCB was found among the exposed subjects compared with the controls (313. 1 v 66. 9 ng/g lipid; P < 0. 01; (ANOVA model)). For P-OCS this difference was even larger (54. 6 v 0. 7 ng/g lipid; P < 0. 01). Results were still significant (P < 0. 05) with non-parametric testing. Within the exposed group there was a good correlation between the ln P-HCB (r = 0. 80) and ln P-OCS (r = 0. 91), respectively, with the cumulative number of years of exposure to <b>hexachloroethane.</b> No significant difference in kidney, pancreas, or liver function was found between the two groups.
