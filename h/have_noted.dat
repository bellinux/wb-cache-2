5000|$|Simon Keefe <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> {{contemporary}} {{comments from}} Mozart's era {{on how the}} woodwind writing in this concerto showed a [...] "newly intricate and sophisticated" [...] character compared to Mozart's prior keyboard concerti.

[...] Joel Galand <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> that the finale, in rondo/ritornello form, avoids use of a new re-entry theme.|$|R

5|$|Heyer {{frequently}} {{highlights the}} heroine's many masculine qualities, {{which include a}} fierce independence and a disregard for social mores. Modern literary critics <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the relationship between}} the protagonists is modelled on those of the latter 20th century, offering companionship and allowing both parties to retain a level of independence. The heroine's unwillingness to conform attracts the hero, rather than repels him.|$|E
