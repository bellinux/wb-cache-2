40|$|We {{present an}} initial {{characterization}} of the murine Gsh- 4 gene which is shown to encode a LIM-type homeodomain. Genes in this category are known to control late developmental cell-type specification events in simpler organisms. Whole mount and serial section in situ hybridizations show transient Gsh- 4 expression in ventrolateral regions of the developing neural tube and hindbrain. Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in Gsh- 4 suffer early postnatal death resulting from immature lungs which do not inflate. Prenatal administration of progesterone and glucocorticoid, to extend <b>gestational</b> <b>term</b> and accelerate maturation, resulted in lung inflation at birth. Nevertheless, the hormonally treated mutants generally failed to survive beyond an hour after birth, due to ineffective breathing efforts.

40|$|Studies in rodents {{indicate}} that the disruption of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function increases drug distribution into the developing fe-tus and organs such as the brain. To simultaneously and serially evaluate the effect of P-gp activity and inhibition on the tissue distribution of drugs in a more representative animal model, we tested the feasibility of conducting whole-body PET of the pregnant nonhuman primate (Macaca nemestrina). We used 11 C-verapamil as the prototypic P-gp substrate and cyclosporine A (CsA) as the prototypic inhibitor.

40|$|Objective Antitumour {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) {{during pregnancy}} {{in patients with}} IBD is related to high fetal anti-TNF levels. We evaluated maternal and child safety on discontinuing anti-TNF in the second trimester of pregnancy. Design Two groups of women with IBD were prospectively followed-up during pregnancy: women in sustained remission stopped anti-TNF before week 25 (stop group) and the remaining group continued anti-TNF beyond week 30 (continue group). Maternal, birth and 1 -year child outcomes were compared with children of non-IBD women. Results Overall, 106 patients with 83 completed pregnancies were included. Relapse rate after week 22 did not differ between the stop (n= 51) and continue (n= 32) groups (5 (9. 8 %) versus 5 (15. 6 %), p= 0. 14). There {{was no difference in}} allergic reactions (p= 1. 00) or loss of response (p= 1. 00) postpartum between the two groups. Birth outcomes were comparable. Infants from both groups had lower birth weight (p= 0. 001), shorter <b>gestational</b> <b>term</b> (p= 0. 0001), were more often delivered via caesarean section (p= 0. 0001) and were less often breastfed (p= 0. 0001) compared with infants from non-IBD controls. Growth, infection rate, allergies, eczema and adverse reactions to vaccines were comparable across the stop and the continue groups as well as the children of anti-TNF-exposed and non-IBD women at 1 year. Conclusions To limit anti-TNF exposure in utero, anti-TNF can be stopped safely in the second trimester in women with IBD in sustained remission. In patients not in sustained remission, anti-TNF may be continued without clear additional risks to the fetus. We observed excellent 1 -year child outcomes compared with children from non-IBD controls...|$|E

40|$|Five {{hundred and}} four {{pregnant}} women {{participated in this}} study. The objective {{was to examine the}} association between selected sociocultural characteristics and physical activity on the course of pregnancy, labor, delivery infant measures and maternal health. The participants were from the European (71 %), Maori (20 %) and Pacific communities (9 %) in New Zealand. On average, pregnant women spent 20 hours each day in sedentary activities, such as sleeping, sitting, and standing. Urban women were found to be more sedentary than rural women. There was no difference in the activity patterns by ethnicity. During the seventh month of pregnancy the low income group and beneficiaries were found to be more sedentary than others. The need for some birth interventions was found to increase with time spent in sedentary activity. Sedentary activity was significantly related to the need for an episiotomy. The results also showed that the more active the women the lesser the need for pain relief. The need for syntocin and epidural anesthesia almost halved as the number of minutes spent in moderate high activity increased. The more the number of minutes spent in sedentary activity in the seventh month, the longer the duration of labor. However, the duration of sleeping was associated with a shorter duration of labor. Duration of physical activity did not affect birth weight, but time spent in sedentary activity was found to impact on the gestational age of the baby. The more sedentary mothers had a shorter <b>gestational</b> <b>term</b> and the more active the subjects the more likely they were to go full term. Sedentary activity during pregnancy was found to affect weight gain between the fourth to seventh months of pregnancy. The more time women spent on moderate low to moderate high activity, the less was the weight gain. Thus standing and sitting were not beneficial for a good pregnancy outcome. It was very clear that pregnant women would need to get more active. Furthermore, physical activity during pregnancy did not affect post partum weight retention. There may be other lifestyle characteristics such as diet both during and after pregnancy, or change in activity patterns postpartum that may have affected post partum weight retention...|$|E
40|$|The goal {{of present}} study was a search for pathogenetical {{reasoning}} of an opportunity for prolongation of pregnancy complicated by premature rupture of membranes at a <b>gestational</b> <b>term</b> of 22 - 34 weeks. The patients were subject to due observation and expectant treatable of pregnancy with prevention of possible infectious and inflammatory complications, as well as monitoring of systemic inflammatory response markers, immune state, and cytokine profile of blood in pregnant women with this disorder.   We conducted a comprehensive clinical and laboratory examination of fifty pregnant women, whose pregnancy was complicated by premature membrane rupture at 22 - 34 weeks of gestation. A control group consisted of 40 women with normal pregnancy. For assessment of cellular composition of the blood, a BC 3000 + hematological analyzer was used. Distinct subsets of peripheral blood lymphocytes were studied by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies («FACS Calibur» «Becton Dickinson», USA). Blood levels of cytokines (IL- 2, IL- 6, IL- 8, TNFα, IL- 4, IL- 10) were determined by ELISA using test systems (ZAO “VectorBest”, Novosibirsk, Russia). Stereoultrastructural study of membranes was performed with a scanning electron microscope «Hitachi S- 450 ”.   The {{findings suggest that the}} failure of membranes emerging du to systemic metabolic disorders and changes in peripheral blood cells (leukocytosis, lymphopenia due to CD 19 + B lymphocytes). Moreover, one could observe reduced counts of CD 16 + CD 56 + T cells (natural killer cells) that showed certain parallelism with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 8, TNFα) in blood from pregnant PROM, as well as a decrease in IL- 10 and IL- 4 contents antagonized their proinflammatory effects to certain extent. An opportunity of incomplete pregnancy prolongation for patients with premature rupture of membranes was based on thorough assessment of their somatic and obstetric status and general condition of the fetus, when adequate and comprehensive therapy was applied. In the course of pregnancy prolongation, we found a progressive increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL- 2, IL- 6, IL- 8, TNFα), a steady decrease in CD 19 + B cell counts, CD 3 + СD 4 + helpers, natural killer cells, increased levels of cytotoxic CD 3 + CD 8 + T cells. The pathogenesis-based criteria for necessary termination of the pregnancy for women with PROM are identified, including an increase in acute-phase proteins levels in blood, development of neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopenia, increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in blood (IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, TNFα), along with progressive reduction of CD 3 + СD 4 + lymphocytes, CD 16 + CD 56 + and CD 19 + В lymphocytes.    </div...|$|E

40|$|Background: New {{diagnostic}} criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are being currently implemented into clinical practice. GDM prevalence and pregnancy outcomes {{in women with}} GDM diagnosed {{according to the new}} criteria have not been studied in Russia. Aim: To evaluate prevalence of GDM and pregnancy outcomes in women with GDM based on the Russian consensus criteria 2012 ("Gestational diabetes mellitus: diagnosis, treatment and postpartum follow-up") in the population of the Moscow Region. Materials and methods: The study included 176  pregnant women living in the Moscow Region. We retrospectively analyzed 100   pregnant women (mean age±SD  – 28. 3 ± 6  years) who delivered before  2013 with collection of data on blood glucose and gestational age of its measurement, body mass index (BMI) at conception and pregnancy outcomes. The prospective part of the study conducted from January to July  2015 included screening of 820   pregnant women helped to identify 76  cases of GDM (mean age±SD – 30. 4 ± 5. 5  years); their follow-up included monitoring of glucose levels, <b>gestational</b> <b>term,</b> and pregnancy outcomes. Results: In the retrospective part of the study, 19   women (19 %) were identified with their fasting glucose levels≥ 5. 1   mmol/L (5. 39 ± 0. 29   mmol/L) at 14. 4 ± 9. 3   weeks of gestation, that corresponds to diagnosis of GDM with 2012  criteria. The comparison of pregnant women with and without fasting hyperglycemia showed no difference in age and pre-pregnancy BMI values. Women with fasting hyperglycemia had high total rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes than those without (52. 6 %  vs 24. 6 %, respectively, p< 0. 017), as well as higher rates of fetal asphyxia during delivery and clavicle fractures (15. 8 %  vs 3. 7 %, p= 0. 04  and 10. 5 % vs 0 %, p= 0. 03). In the prospective part of the study, 820   pregnant women were screened for GDM, and it was found in 76  (9. 2 %) of them. Among those, in 50  (65. 8 %) the diagnosis of GDM was based on fasting glucose in venous plasma (5. 5 ± 0. 3  mmol/L) at 11. 3 ± 6. 1  weeks of gestation. Pregnant patients with fasting hyperglycemia in the retrospective and prospective parts of the study did not differ in their age, pre-pregnancy BMI, fasting glucose levels and terms of assessment; however, in the prospective study, the rate of fasting hyperglycemia was lower than in the retrospective (6 % vs  19 %). The second phase of the screening performed at 20 to 30  weeks of gestation helped to identify 26   women (34. 2 %) with GDM: in 15 of them (19. 7 %) the diagnosis was based on repeatedly high fasting glucose (5. 5 ± 0. 3  mmol/L) and in 11  (14. 5 %), on the results of the oral glucose tolerance test. To all pregnant women with GDM, diet and blood glucose self-monitoring were recommended. Pregnancy outcomes were assessed in 64  GDM patients, with their comparison in compliant patients (n= 30) vs non-compliant (n= 34). Patients with poor compliance had higher rates of preterm delivery (11. 4 % vs 0 %, р= 0. 05), macrosomia (32. 3 %  vs 6. 6 %, р= 0. 01) and other adverse outcomes (76. 5 % vs 50 %, р= 0. 03) than those with good compliance. Conclusion: The prevalence of GDM in a district of the Moscow Region in the prospective study was 9. 2 %. The retrospective analysis showed an overestimated rate of fasting hyperglycemia (19 %). In the majority of GDM patients, the diagnosis was based on an increased fasting glucose level in venous plasma (85. 5 %). Treatment of GDM patients helps to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes. </p...|$|E

40|$|Stress is an {{inevitable}} part of life, and maternal stress during the gestational period has dramatic {{effects in the}} early programming of the physiology and behavior of offspring. The developmental period is crucial {{for the well-being of}} the offspring. Prenatal stress influences the developmental outcomes of the fetus, in part because the developing brain is particularly vulnerable to stress. The etiology of birth defects of the offspring is reported to be 30 - 40 % genetic and 7 - 10 % multifactorial, with the remaining 50 % still unknown and also there is no clear cause for neonatal mortality and still-birth. The present study explores the association of maternal psychological stress on mother and the offspring's incidence of birth defects, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality. Pregnant animals were restrained to induce psychological stress (3 times per day, 45 minutes per session). Except control group, other animals were exposed to restraint stress during the gestational period: early gestational stress (EGS, stress exposure during 1 st day to 10 th days of gestational period), late gestational stress (LGS, stress exposure during 11 th day to till parturition), and full <b>term</b> <b>gestational</b> stress (FGS, stress exposure to the whole gestational period). The effects of maternal stress on the mother and their offspring were analyzed. Expectant female rats exposed to stress by physical restraint showed decreased body weight gain, food intake, and fecal pellet levels. Specifically, the offspring of female rats subjected to late <b>gestational</b> and full <b>term</b> <b>gestational</b> restraint stress showed more deleterious effects, such as physical impairment (LGS 24. 44 %, FGS 10 %), neonatal mortality (EGS 2. 56 %, LGS 24. 44 %, FGS 17. 5 %), stillbirths (FGS 27. 5 %), low birth weight (EGS 5. 42 g, LGS 4. 40 g, FGS 4. 12 g), preterm births (EGS 539 Hrs, LGS 514 Hrs, FGS 520. 6 Hrs), and delayed eyelid opening (EGS 15. 16 Days, LGS 17 Days, FGS 17. 67 Days).

40|$|Low amplitude, {{long-lasting}} epochs of myometrial activity, contractures, occur {{throughout the}} majority of pregnancy in all species studied to date. Contractures {{are associated with a}} fall in fetal oxygenation and changes in fetal behavioral state. In the present study we observed that contractures produced by the administration of 70 mU oxytocin iv to the pregnant ewe at 125 - 139 days <b>gestational</b> age (<b>term</b> 145 - 150 days) result in a fall in fetal carotid arterial PO 2 of approximately 2. 5 mm Hg and are followed by a rise in fetal carotid arterial plasma ACTH of 16. 3 +/- 9. 6 pg. ml- 1 (mean +/- SEM). When the contracture-induced fall in fetal arterial PO 2 was prevented by administration of oxygen to the ewe, fetal ACTH did not rise after the contracture. In conclusion, these observations demonstrate that the relatively small fall in fetal PO 2 that accompanies a contracture can be sensed by the fetus and {{is an essential part of}} the stimulus to the increased secretion of fetal ACTH that accompanies a contracture.

In the present study, we tested in an ovine chorioamnionitis model whether IL- 1 is a major cytokine driving the inflammatory response in the fetal ileum. Method: Sheep bearing singleton fetuses received a single intraamniotic injection of recombinant ovine IL- 1 a at 7, 3 or 1 d before caesarian delivery at 125 days <b>gestational</b> age (<b>term</b> = 150 days). Results: 3 and 7 d after IL- 1 a administration, intestinal mRNA levels for IL- 4, IL- 10, IFN-c and TNF-a were strongly elevated. Numbers of CD 3 + and CD 4 + T-lymphocytes and myeloidperoxidase+ cells were increased whereas FoxP 3 + T-cells were detected at low frequency. This increased proinflammatory state was associated with ileal mucosal barrier loss as demonstrated by decreased levels of the intestinal fatty acid binding protein and disruption of the tight junctional protein ZO- 1.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Despite {{a change}} of fetal {{physiologic}} and biochemical functions with gestational age, stationary umbilical cord acid-base reference values are used as measures of obstetric care quality. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the risk of low Apgar score relative to low pH when using stationary versus gestational age-adjusted reference values. METHODS: Umbilical artery pH was determined in 24, 390 term singleton vaginal deliveries with a 5 -minute Apgar score of 9 or greater. Low pH was defined as less than 7. 10 as a stationary cutoff value, whereas pH less than (mean 2 standard deviations [SDs)) was used when gestational age was considered. The 5 -minute Apgar score less than 7 at low pH was studied in 44, 978 term deliveries. RESULTS: A significant negative correlation was found between gestational age and umbilical artery pH. ne odds ratio (OR) for pH less than 7. 10 was continuously increasing, from 0. 6 at 37 weeks to 1. 5 at 42 weeks. In contrast, the OR for pH less than (mean - 2 SDs) was steady until 42 weeks, whereafter it increased (OR 1. 24; 95 % confidence interval 1. 05, 1. 47). A linear decrease of the association between Agar score less than 7 and pH less than 7. 10 with increasing pregnancy duration was found (P =. 097), but for pH less than (mean - 2 SDs) there was no such association. CONCLUSION: We found a physiologic linear decline of umbilical artery pH with <b>gestational</b> age at <b>term.</b> <b>Gestational</b> age-adjusted umbilical cord artery pH reference values result in fewer diagnoses of cord acidemia than a stationary cutoff of pH less than 7. 10...|$|R

One area of interest to childbirth educators and the clients they serve is the connection between excessive gestational weight gain and increased risk factors for the mother and unborn child that extend, potentially decades, beyond delivery. Current research is now supporting a phenomenon of downstream obesity in children born after excessive <b>gestational</b> weight gain <b>termed</b> metabolic memory. Guidelines for healthy weight gain during pregnancy, a definition of excessive gestational weight gain, and an exploration of possible adverse effects of weight gain during pregnancy and after pregnancy for mother and child will be reviewed.

40|$|Endotoxin induced chorioamnionitis {{increases}} IL- 1 and provokes {{an inflammatory}} {{response in the}} fetal ileum that interferes with intestinal maturation. In the present study, we tested in an ovine chorioamnionitis model whether IL- 1 is a major cytokine driving the inflammatory response in the fetal ileum. Sheep bearing singleton fetuses received a single intraamniotic injection of recombinant ovine IL- 1 α at 7, 3 or 1 d before caesarian delivery at 125 days <b>gestational</b> age (<b>term</b> = 150 days). 3 and 7 d after IL- 1 α administration, intestinal mRNA levels for IL- 4, IL- 10, IFN-γ and TNF-α were strongly elevated. Numbers of CD 3 + and CD 4 + T-lymphocytes and myeloidperoxidase+ cells were increased whereas FoxP 3 + T-cells were detected at low frequency. This increased proinflammatory state was associated with ileal mucosal barrier loss as demonstrated by decreased levels of the intestinal fatty acid binding protein and disruption of the tight junctional protein ZO- 1. Intraamniotic IL- 1 α causes an acute detrimental inflammatory response in the ileum, suggesting that induction of IL- 1 is a critical element in the pathophysiological effects of endotoxin induced chorioamnionitis. A disturbed balance between T-effector and FoxP 3 + cells may contribute to this process...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} {{genomics}} has expanded into subspecialties such as metagenomics {{over the course}} of the last decade and a half. The development of massively parallel sequencing capabilities has allowed for increasingly detailed study of the genome of the human microbiome, the microbial super organ that resides symbiotically within the mucosal tissues and integumentary system of the human host. The gut microbiome, and particularly the study of its origins in neonates, have become subtopics of great interest within the field of genomics. This brief review seeks to summarize recent literature regarding the origins and establishment of the neonatal gut microbiome, beginning in utero, and how it is affected by neonatal nutritional status (breastfed versus formula fed) and <b>gestational</b> age (<b>term</b> versus preterm). We also explore the role of dysbiosis, a perturbation within the fragile ecosystem of the microbiome, and its role in the origin of select pathologic states, specifically, obesity and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. We discuss the evidence supporting enteral pre- and probiotic supplementation of commensal organisms such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the neonatal period, and their role in the prevention and amelioration of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants. Finally, we review directions to consider for further research to promote human health within this field...|$|R

Another type of atypical oocyte activation occurs in parthenogenesis. In the human, two types of tumors, dermoid cysts and teratomas, can result from this process. The authors of this paper aim to elucidate the mechanisms how these abnormal growths ensue and provide explanations why they cannot be regarded as human individuals or human beings.

40|$|During {{the first}} week of life serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, immunoreactive {{thyrocalcitonin}} hormone, and parathyroid hormone concentrations were determined daily in 36 preterm and 29 small for <b>gestational</b> age, full <b>term,</b> healthy infants. Preterm babies with early neonatal hypocalcaemia had significantly higher concentrations of serum thyrocalcitonin hormone in the first four days of life than normocalcaemic preterm babies. Parathyroid hormone concentrations were similar in hypocalcaemic and normocalcaemic infants. In contrast, in the full term group no significant differences were detected in thyrocalcitonin hormone and parathyroid hormone patterns between hypocalcaemic and normocalcaemic subjects. This suggests two different pathogeneses for early hypocalcaemia in low birthweight infants. Hyperthyrocalcitoninaemia seems to be the main determining factor in preterm infants, while a non-hormonal pathogenesis should be considered in full term infants who are small for gestational age...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{follow the}} {{maturation}} of the auditory pathway of infants born small for <b>gestational</b> age <b>term,</b> by studying absolute and interpeak latencies of Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) {{in the first}} six months of life. METHODS: Multicentric prospective longitudinal study. The ABR was carried out in the neonatal period in 96 newborn infants, 49 small for gestational age (SGA) and 47 appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Of these, 77 infants (39 SGA and 38 AGA) returned for a second evaluation. In the third evaluation, 70 infants (35 SGA and 35 AGA) returned. RESULTS: SGA and AGA did not present significant differences in the neonatal period and at three months of life. However, at six months, there was statistical significant difference between SGA and AGA groups for the latencies of wave III and interpeak I-III. Latencies of ABR waves decreased more rapidly in the first three months than the third to the sixth month of life for the SGA. AGA group showed progressive decrease in latency of ABR waves during the six months. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that, for SGA infants, the maturational process of the auditory pathway occurs in different rate when compared to AGA infants. The SGA infants have faster maturation especially at the first three months of life, while in infants AGA, this process occurred in a constant and gradual way throughout the six months studied...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Chorioamnionitis is {{associated}} with preterm delivery and involution of the fetal thymus. Women at risk of preterm delivery receive antenatal corticosteroids which accelerate fetal lung maturation and improve neonatal outcome. However, the effects of antenatal corticosteroids on the fetal thymus in the settings of chorioamnionitis are largely unknown. We hypothesized that intra-amniotic exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes involution of the fetal thymus resulting in persistent effects on thymic structure and cell populations. We also hypothesized that antenatal corticosteroids may modulate the effects of LPS on thymic development. Methods: Time-mated ewes with singleton fetuses received an intra-amniotic injection of LPS 7 or 14 days before preterm delivery at 120 days <b>gestational</b> age (<b>term</b> = 150 days). LPS and corticosteroid treatment groups received intra-amniotic LPS either preceding or following maternal intra-muscular betamethasone. Gestation matched controls received intra-amniotic and maternal intra-muscular saline. The fetal intra-thoracic thymus was evaluated. Results: Intra-amniotic LPS decreased the cortico-medullary (C/M) ratio of the thymus and increased Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 mRNA and CD 3 expression indicating involution and activation of the fetal thymus. Increased TLR 4 and CD 3 expression persisted for 14 days but Foxp 3 expression decreased suggesting a change in regulatory T-cells. Sonic hedgehog and bone morphogenetic protein 4 mRNA, which are negative regulators of T-cell development, decreased in response to intra...|$|R
