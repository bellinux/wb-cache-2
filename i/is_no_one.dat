5|$|During these episodes, Stephen feels {{lonely and}} writes to Isabelle, {{feeling that there}} <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else to whom he can express his feelings. He writes about his fears that he will die, and confesses that he has only ever loved her.|$|E
5|$|Not doing {{anything}} creative is nearly killing me. The {{trouble is that}} there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> near me who cares whether I ever do any more work or not... I feel the artist in me is dying and the dying is an agony... only one's self knows the craving and the best part in one is aching unsatisfied.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{argue that}} there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> High Priest who is the strongest candidate for identification {{with each of the}} Wicked Priest passages. The different demises of the Wicked Priest and the tenses associated with them are often cited as evidence of the impossibility of a single Wicked Priest.|$|E

5|$|In June 2015, Jenner debuted her {{new name}} and image, and began {{publicly}} using feminine pronoun self-descriptors. Jenner held a renaming ceremony in July 2015, adopting the name Caitlyn Marie Jenner. Prior to her 20/20 interview, a two-part special titled Keeping Up with the Kardashians: About Bruce was filmed {{with the family}} in which she answered questions, and prepared her children for the personal and public aspects of the transition. In the special, which aired in May 2015, the point was emphasized that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> right way to transition. Jenner made it a priority {{to ensure that all}} her children were independent first before focusing on her transition. In September 2015, her name was legally changed to Caitlyn Marie Jenner and gender to female.|$|E
5|$|New Caledonia {{languages}} {{are divided into}} several groups. The Northern language group is tonal and includes 12 languages: Caac, Cemuhî, Fwâi, Jawe, Kumak, Nemi, Paicî, Pije, Pwaamei, Pwapwa, Yalayu, and Yuaga. Approximately 60,000 residents of New Caledonia speak {{at least one of}} the Kanak languages. Most of these {{languages are}} only in spoken form. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> unified language among the Kanaks; however, the largest group of Kanaks speak Drehu.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> {{way to do}} Archaeoastronomy. The {{divisions}} between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends {{to depend on the}} location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.|$|E

5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|Although the themes, {{events and}} {{characters}} of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text, and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> canonical version; Geoffrey's version of events often served {{as the starting point}} for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul. Many elements and incidents that are now {{an integral part of the}} Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the wizard Merlin, Arthur's wife Guinevere, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's conception at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann, and final rest in Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chrétien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the legend lives on, not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

5|$|The {{formally}} registered {{association was}} dissolved {{some time after}} October 1956 but intermittently revived for different reasons by Plantard between 1961 and 1993, though in name and on paper only. The Priory of Sion is considered dormant by the subprefecture because it has indicated no activities since 1956. According to French law, subsequent references to the Priory bear no legal relation to that of 1956 and no one, other than the original signatories, is entitled to use its name in an official capacity. André Bonhomme played no part in the association after 1956. He officially resigned in 1973 when he heard that Plantard was linking his name with the association. In light of Plantard's death in 2000, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> who is currently alive who has official {{permission to use the}} name.|$|E
5|$|This New Life is endless, {{and even}} after my {{physical}} death it will be kept alive by those who live the life of complete renunciation of falsehood, lies, hatred, anger, greed and lust; and who, to accomplish all this, do no lustful actions, do no harm to anyone, do no backbiting, do not seek material possessions or power, who accept no homage, neither covet honor nor shun disgrace, and fear no one and nothing; by those who rely wholly and solely on God, and who love God purely {{for the sake of}} loving; who believe in the lovers of God and in the reality of Manifestation, and yet do not expect any spiritual or material reward; who do not let go the hand of Truth, and who, without being upset by calamities, bravely and wholeheartedly face all hardships with one hundred percent cheerfulness, and give no importance to caste, creed and religious ceremonies. This New Life will live by itself eternally, even if there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to live it.|$|E

60|$|These {{were happy}} {{days in the}} Green Forest. At least, they were happy for Lightfoot the Deer. They were the happiest days he had ever known. You see, he had won beautiful, slender, young Miss Daintyfoot, and now she <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer Miss Daintyfoot but Mrs. Lightfoot. Lightfoot was sure that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> {{anywhere}} so beautiful as she, and Mrs. Lightfoot knew that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> so handsome and brave as he.|$|R

25|$|The {{shoreline}} of {{the island}} constantly changes {{with the level of}} the river, so there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> consistent best spot for landings, but {{the northern part of the}} western coast is generally the most favorable area.

25|$|This is {{what the}} Chinese room thought {{experiment}} is intended to prove: the Chinese room has syntax (because there is a man in there moving symbols around). The Chinese room has no semantics (because, according to Searle, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> or nothing {{in the room that}} understands what the symbols mean). Therefore, having syntax is not enough to generate semantics.|$|E
25|$|Owing to this, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> {{official}} statement of principles. Rather, all formulations by accepted early Torah leaders {{are considered to}} have possible validity. The 13 principles of Maimonides have been cited by adherents as the most influential: they are often printed in prayer books, and in many congregations a hymn (Yigdal) incorporating them is sung on Friday nights.|$|E
