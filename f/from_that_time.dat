5|$|A popular {{hypothesis}} {{about the}} origins of the lemuriform clade is that they evolved from European adapiforms known as adapids. In some adapids, the crests of the lower incisors and canines align to form functional cropping unit, and the American paleontologist Philip D. Gingerich has suggested this foreshadowed the development of the lemuriform toothcomb. However, no lemuriform toothcomb has been found in the fossil record of the Eocene, and the European adapid lower jaws <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> did not resemble the derived state seen in lemuriforms.|$|E
5|$|According {{to genetic}} studies, the {{families}} Hyloidea, Microhylidae, and the clade Natatanura (comprising about 88% of living frogs) diversified simultaneously some 66 million years ago, {{soon after the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event associated with the Chicxulub impactor. All origins of arboreality (e.g. in Hyloidea and Natatanura) follow <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> and the resurgence of forest that occurred afterwards.|$|E

5|$|From {{the end of}} the Heian {{and into}} the Kamakura period, hyōgo-gusari were fashionable {{mountings}} for tachi. Along the edge of both the scabbard and the hilt they were decorated with a long ornamental border.

The corresponding blades <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> are unusable.|$|E

5|$|Adapiforms are extinct strepsirrhines that shared many {{anatomical}} similarities with lemuriforms. They {{are sometimes}} referred to as lemur-like primates, although the diversity of both lemurs and adapiforms do not support this analogy. Like living strepsirrhines, adapiforms were extremely diverse, with at least 30genera and 80species known from the fossil record as of the early 2000s. They diversified across Laurasia during the Eocene, some reaching North America via a land bridge.They were among the most common mammals found in the fossil beds <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> A few rare species have also been found in northern Africa. The most basal of the adapiforms include the genera Cantius from North America and Europe and Donrussellia from Europe. The latter bears the most ancestral traits, so it is often considered a sister group or stem group of the other adapiforms.|$|E
5|$|After the 1938 Anschluss by Germany with Austria, Yugoslavia {{shared a}} border with the Third Reich and came under {{increasing}} pro-Axis political pressure as her neighbours fell {{into line with}} the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with the Kingdom of Italy when that country invaded Albania. Between September and November 1940, Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact, Italy invaded Greece, and Romania also joined the Pact. <b>From</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their client states, and her neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, Adolf Hitler invited the Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković and his foreign minister Aleksandar Cincar-Marković to Berchtesgaden and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact. Two weeks later, Bulgaria joined the Pact. The next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.|$|E
