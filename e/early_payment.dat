In {{addition}} to the <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> in cash or kind of a sum of $5,000,000,000, Germany is required to deliver bearer bonds to a further amount of $10,000,000,000, or, {{in the event of}} the payments in cash or kind before May 1, 1921, available for Reparation, falling short of $5,000,000,000 by reason of the permitted deductions, to such further amount as shall bring the total payments by Germany in cash, kind, and bearer bonds up to May 1, 1921, to a figure of $15,000,000,000 altogether.[112] These bearer bonds carry interest at 2-1/2 per cent per annum from 1921 to 1925, and at 5 per cent plus 1 per cent for amortization thereafter. Assuming, therefore, that Germany is not able to provide any appreciable surplus towards Reparation before 1921, she will have to find a sum of $375,000,000 annually from 1921 to 1925, and $900,000,000 annually thereafter.[113] ...|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} why dynamic {{discounting}} is beneficial to buyers is as follows. If a buyer receives a 2 per cent discount for <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> of an invoice—for example paying a 30-day-net invoice after 10 days. Therefore, instead of earning interest on the cash held in an account, it is “invested” for 20 days to get a 2 per cent return, This represents the equivalent of an over 36 per cent annual return on capital. While the <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> of the invoice {{would lead to a}} reduction in interest on the cash, the return for <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> far outweighs the loss of interest. That <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> may also be very valuable to the supplier who values cash flow more than high margins.|$|E

50|$|A commonplace {{method of}} {{mortgage}} acceleration is a so-called bi-weekly payment plan, in which {{half of the}} normal calendar monthly payment is made every two weeks, so that 13/12 of the yearly amount due is paid per annum.

50|$|Dynamic Discounting {{describes}} {{a collection of}} methods in which payment terms can be established between a buyer and supplier to accelerate payment for goods or services {{in return for a}} reduced price or discount. Dynamic Discounting methods are used for business-to-business transactions when contractual or pre-established <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> terms may not exist or the payment date does not conform to agreed upon discount terms. Dynamic Discounting includes the ability to agree upon terms that vary the discount according to the date of <b>early</b> <b>payment.</b> The earlier the payment, the greater the discount. In addition, it includes an ability for either buyer or supplier to propose an <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> date and discount for a one-time payment using electronic mail or specialized software. Through the use of dynamic discounting methods, buying organizations can increase the number and size of <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> discounts they receive and suppliers can get paid sooner at a lower cost of capital than alternative options. A range of concepts is available to implement dynamic discounting into supply chain finance (SCF): dynamic discounting {{can be seen as a}} comparatively simple form, whereby the supplier grants a cash discount for <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> of its invoices - the amount of the reduction and the time of payment are quickly and freely negotiable.|$|E

25|$|Adjustable rate mortgages, {{like other}} types of mortgage, usually allow the {{borrower}} to prepay principal (or capital) early without penalty. <b>Early</b> <b>payments</b> of part of the principal will reduce {{the total cost of}} the loan (total interest paid), but will not shorten the amount of time needed to pay off the loan like other loan types. Upon each recasting, the new fully indexed interest rate is applied to the remaining principal to end within the remaining term schedule.|$|R

50|$|Bond {{duration}}: Bond duration is the weighted-average time {{to receive}} the discounted present values of all the cash flows (including both principal and interest), while WAL is the weighted-average time to receive simply the principal payments (not including interest, and not discounting). For an amortizing loan with equal payments, the WAL will be higher than the duration, as the <b>early</b> <b>payments</b> are weighted towards interest, while the later payments are weighted towards principal, and further, taking present value (in duration) discounts the later payments.|$|R

The fees and penalty charges increased the cost so the county in 2011 had $3.2 billion outstanding. Carrington said one of the problems was that elected officials had welcomed scheduling with very low <b>early</b> <b>payments</b> so long as peak payments occurred after they left office.|$|R

50|$|Challenges {{can include}} {{outcomes}} only being delivered beyond the provider or investor’s return horizon, meaning an <b>earlier</b> <b>payment</b> or proxy outcome must be used; having sufficient {{confidence that the}} cash savings used to fund the payment of outcomes will ultimately be realised (e.g. that a reduction in re-offending translates {{to a reduction in}} prison capacity); finding a contractual solution that ensures transactional costs are reasonable; and determining how far the delivery of outcomes is attributable to the actual intervention rather than other services or background factors. Commissioners may also find providers are reluctant to accept all of the delivery risk (e.g. where there is a dependency on future Government actions or policies) or where Government cannot truly transfer all of the delivery risk.|$|R

In default of appropriation by the debtor the creditor is entitled to determine the application of the sums paid, and may appropriate them even to the discharge of debts barred by the Statute of Limitations.
