I would be very distressed if public service broadcasting was weakened. I have been at the BBC since 1952, and know the BBC is constantly being battered. It is today.|$|E
500|$|Later on 1 May, Vice-Admiral Voss saw Goebbels for {{the last}} time: [...] "...While saying goodbye I asked Goebbels to join us. But he replied: 'The captain must not leave his sinking ship. I have thought about it all and decided to stay <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> nowhere to go because with little {{children}} I {{will not be able}} to make it, especially with a leg like mine...'

500|$|In January 2016, Harpole {{was interviewed}} by {{conservative}} news site Watchdog.org about refugees in Amarillo. In the article, Harpole is quoted talking about [...] "small ghettos" [...] being created and [...] "rival tribes" [...] being settled together. Despite Harpole's assertion that he was misquoted, multiple conservative sites, including Breitbart News, picked up the story. Harpole insisted, [...] "I have no concern about refugees and ones that have been <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always felt that they've been a big part and {{a good part of}} our community". Later, on April 21, 2016, Harpole testified in front of the Texas Senate on the issue, complaining that Amarillo has not [...] "been involved in the consultation meetings [...] at all".|$|E

500|$|The Texian {{garrison}} was woefully undermanned and underprovisioned, {{with fewer}} than 100soldiers remaining by January 6, 1836. Colonel James C. Neill, the acting Alamo commander, wrote to the provisional government: [...] "If there has ever been a dollar <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no knowledge of it". Neill requested additional troops and supplies, stressing that the garrison {{was likely to be}} unable to withstand a siege lasting longer than four days. The Texian government was in turmoil and unable to provide much assistance. Four different men claimed to have been given command over the entire army: on January 14, Neill approached one of them, Sam Houston, for assistance in gathering supplies, clothing, and ammunition.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and {{my heart goes out to}} every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I belong <b>here...</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> learned much in these brief three months about life and living. And I know I have already changed in many ways and many viewpoints... It is truly a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E
500|$|... {{would not}} that day suffer {{one of her}} own sort to tarry at home, and was so earnest to have them gone to the fair, that with any of her own sort that made reason of tarrying at home she was very angry, and came to Mrs. Odingsells … who refused that day to go to the fair, and was very angry with her also. Because [...] said it was no day for gentlewomen to go … Whereunto my lady {{answered}} and said that she might choose and go at her pleasure, but all hers should go; and was very angry. They asked who should keep her company if all they went; she said Mrs. Owen should keep her company at dinner; the same tale doth Picto, who doth dearly love her, confirm. Certainly, my Lord, as little while as I have been <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard divers tales of her that maketh me judge her to be a strange woman of mind.|$|E

"Not a greeting, not a curl of smoke, till we made Pelly. <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{counted on}} grub; and <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> counted on leaving Long Jeff, who was whining and trail-sore. But the factor's lungs were wheezing, his eyes bright, his cache nigh empty; {{and he showed}} us the empty cache of the missionary, also his grave with the rocks piled high to keep off the dogs. There {{was a bunch of}} Indians there, but babies and old men there were none, and it was clear that few would see the spring.|$|R
500|$|On 8 June 2007, Alonso {{signed a}} five-year contract, stating, [...] "I {{knew there was}} {{interest}} from other clubs {{but it was always}} my idea to stay <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been here for three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. I understand what Liverpool means to so many people. It is such a special club and I just didn't want to leave." [...] The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso's determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, [...] "I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don't want to come off, particularly when the team is winning and I stayed on." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{successful}} on track, the Mercedes team {{got into}} a discussion with Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone over the TV coverage time their drivers received during the Grand Prix. Over the ninety-minute race, Mercedes cars were visible for only six minutes, leading to their non-executive chairman Niki Lauda saying: [...] "I was watching TV all day long, and funny enough I saw Saubers {{and a lot of}} Honda cars, but I don't know why [...] Somebody must do the filming <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to ask what's wrong with him. I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for me out there this afternoon because a combination of circumstances meant I had to just sit back and was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, but there was nothing I could do." ...|$|E
500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have assumed. I {{have reason to believe}} they will attack us this night. I do not wish to conceal our real state, because I do not believe there is a man here who is afraid to face any sort of danger. We {{are in a position to}} defend ourselves against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E
5000|$|Till <b>I</b> came <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{no idea of}} {{the fixed}} {{determination}} which there is in the heart of every American to extirpate the Indians and appropriate their territory.|$|R

2500|$|The Björketorp Runestone, Blekinge, Sweden, is one {{of three}} menhirs, but {{is the only one of}} them where, in the 6th century, someone has written a curse: haidz runo runu falh'k hedra ginnarunaz argiu hermalausz ... weladauþe saz þat brytz uþarba spa (<b>Here,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> hidden the secret of {{powerful}} runes, strong runes.

2500|$|And {{going around}} with the master mason, {{examining}} which figures to leave and which to destroy, the priest spotted a Saint Anthony and said: 'Save this one.' Then he found a figure of Saint Sano and said: 'This one is to be gotten rid of, since as long as I have been the Priest <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never seen anyone light a candle in front of it, nor has it ever seemed to me useful; therefore, mason, get rid of it.' ...|$|E

2500|$|On 5 February 2016, it was {{announced}} that Ray Ivany would be leaving his post as President of Acadia University {{at the end of the}} 2017 academic year. In a statement provided to The Chronicle Herald, Ivany wrote [...] "I came to Acadia in 2009 because I respected the institution’s history, the faculty and staff who had established its reputation, its alumni who care deeply about the university, and its students who, year after year, earn awards and recognition for their work. In my time <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> discovered the same Acadia magic that attracts students from around the world".|$|E
2500|$|It {{would indeed}} be terrible {{to find it}} {{necessary}} to believe that an American soldier that harbors such racial intolerance and disregard for justice and human feeling is a prototype of all American national character; yet the frequency of such soldiers lends credulity to such beliefs. ... What has been outlined <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen not only in my own unit, but also in others we have worked with, and I fear it is universal. If this is indeed the case, it is a problem which cannot be overlooked, but can through a more firm implementation of the codes of MACV (Military Assistance Command Vietnam) and the Geneva Conventions, perhaps be eradicated.|$|E
2500|$|After the shooting, {{recordings}} of police radio communications during the event were {{released by the}} Snohomish County Police Staff and Auxiliary Services Center after requests for public records. A timeline was also provided by Marysville police spokesman Robb Lamoureux. According to the timeline and recordings, an anonymous 9-1-1 caller, using a cellphone, first alerted police to the shooting. The school resource officer was the first law enforcement officer {{to make contact with}} the victims, arriving at the scene a minute after the first 9-1-1 call was received. He immediately reported that a fire alarm was going off and that there were students and staff evacuating from the building. A dispatcher then informed him about a report of a possible shooting in the cafeteria. The officer responded, [...] "Ocean 12, it's confirmed. We have a shooter. We have five down." [...] He later said, [...] "Shooter is DOA [...] We have got apparently four [...] " [...] Soon afterward, he said, [...] "Ocean 12, I need aid <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> two that are still breathing and alive. Looks like I have three possibly deceased." [...] The first paramedics arrived on the scene ten minutes after the first radio dispatch.|$|E
