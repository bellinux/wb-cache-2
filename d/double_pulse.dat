40|$|The {{influence}} of the ambient gas pressure on ablated material and the plasma state of laser-inducedplasmas using single and collinear <b>double</b> <b>pulses</b> is studied. A Q-switchedNd:YAG laser pulse is focused on iron samples in air at pressures ranging from 0. 1 to 1013 mbar. At 1013 mbar <b>double</b> <b>pulses</b> ablate up to a factor of 4. 6 more material than single pulses of the same energy. Whereas between 1013 mbar and 100 mbar a strong variation of the ablation ratio is found, the pressure dependence vanishes below 100 mbar. Electron densities in the plasma are always higher for single pulses and increase monotonously with higher ambient pressures. While the electron density for single and <b>double</b> <b>pulses</b> at 1013 mbar {{is close to the}} same value of about 10 (17) cm(- 3), the electron temperature is more than 1500 K higher for <b>double</b> <b>pulses.</b> The plasma state achieved with <b>double</b> <b>pulses</b> at atmospheric pressure is similar to that obtained with single pulses of the same energy at a pressure of 100 mbar.

50|$|Crossplane V8 engines have a {{left and}} right bank each {{containing}} 4 cylinders. When the engine is running, pistons are firing according to the engine firing order. If a bank has two consecutive piston firings it will create a high pressure area in the exhaust pipe, because two exhaust pulses are moving through it close in time. As the two pulses move in the exhaust pipe they should encounter either an X or H pipe. When they encounter the pipe, part of the pulse diverts into the X-H pipe which lowers the total pressure by a small amount. The reason for this decrease in pressure is that the fluid (liquid, air or gas) will travel along a pipe {{and when it comes}} at a crossing the fluid will take {{the path of least resistance}} and some will bleed off, thus lowering the pressure slightly. Without an X-H pipe the flow of exhaust would be jerky or inconsistent, and the engine would not run at its highest efficiency. The double exhaust pulse would cause part of the next exhaust pulse in that bank to not exit that cylinder completely and cause either a detonation (because of a lean air-fuel ratio (AFR)), or a misfire due to a rich AFR, depending on how much of the <b>double</b> <b>pulse</b> was left and what the mixture of that pulse was.|$|E
