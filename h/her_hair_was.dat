5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the choice}} of her next feature, Hepburn decided to star in George Cukor's new project, Sylvia Scarlett (1935), which paired {{her for the first}} time with Cary Grant. <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> cut short for the part, as her {{character}} masquerades as a boy for much of the film. Critics disliked Sylvia Scarlett and it was unpopular with the public. She next played Mary Stuart in John Ford's Mary of Scotland (1936), which met with a similarly poor reception. A Woman Rebels (1936) followed, a Victorian era drama where Hepburn's character defied convention by having a child out of wedlock. Quality Street (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy. Neither movie was popular with the public, which meant she had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E

Due to their similar appearance, Nami ties <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> in pigtails. <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> slightly longer than Sora's when let down {{and this is}} the only noticeable physical difference between them aside from their gender.

25|$|Marge Simpson, {{voiced by}} Julie Kavner, is the well-meaning and {{extremely}} patient wife of Homer {{and mother of}} Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Her most notable physical feature is her distinctive beehive hairstyle which was inspired by Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Matt Groening's mother wore during the 1960s, although <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> never blue.|$|E
25|$|Shirley's biggest {{trademark}} was her hair, {{which was}} also the subject of rumors. A rumor circulated that she wore a wig. More than once, fans yanked her hair to test the theory. She later said she wished {{all she had to}} do was wear a wig. The nightly process she went through in the setting of her curls was tedious and grueling, with once a week vinegar rinses burning her eyes. Rumors also spread about her hair color, namely that she wasn't a natural blonde. During the making of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, news spread that she was going to do extended scenes without her trademark curls. During production, she also caught a cold, which caused her to miss a couple of days. As a result, a false report originated in Britain that all of <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> cut off.|$|E

25|$|She {{was persuaded}} {{to return to}} work in 1914 for her company (Victor Film Company), which had been {{acquired}} by Universal Studios. During the filming of Pawns of Destiny in 1915, a staged fire got out of control. Lawrence was burned, <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> singed, and she suffered a serious fall which fractured her spine. She went into shock for months. She returned to work, but collapsed after the film was completed. Blaming Solter for making her do the stunt in which she was injured, the two divorced. To add to her problems, Universal refused to pay her medical expenses, leaving Lawrence feeling betrayed. In mid-1916, she returned to work for Universal and completed another feature film, Elusive Isabel. However, the strain of working took its toll on her and she suffered a serious relapse. She was completely paralyzed for four months. In 1921, she traveled to Hollywood to attempt a comeback, but had little success. She received a leading role in a minor melodrama (The Unfoldment), and then two supporting roles. All her film work after 1924 would be in uncredited bit parts.|$|E
25|$|Early on 16 October, Marie Antoinette was {{declared}} {{guilty of the}} three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against {{the internal and external}} security of the State, and high treason because of her intelligence activities {{in the interest of the}} enemy; the latter charge alone was enough to condemn her to death. At worst, she and her lawyers had expected life imprisonment. In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law, Madame Élisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children. The letter did not reach Élisabeth. Preparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards. She put on a plain white dress, white being the color worn by widowed queens of France. <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her back and she was put on a rope leash. Unlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (carrosse), she had to sit in an open cart (charrette) for the hour it took to convey her from the Conciergerie via the rue Saint-Honoré thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in the Place de la Révolution, (the present-day Place de la Concorde). She maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd. A constitutional priest was assigned to her to hear her final confession. He sat by her in the cart, but she ignored him all the way to the scaffold.|$|E
25|$|Once Henry had {{withdrawn}} with {{the bulk of}} the imperial army the towns that had supposedly fallen to the Empire immediately declared their allegiance to Tancred, for the most part now fearing his retribution. Nicholas of Ajello, son of Matthew and former Archbishop of Salerno, who was helping defend Naples, wrote letters about the events to his friends in Salerno. Thus the populace of Salerno saw an opportunity to win some favour with Tancred, so they besieged the defenseless Constance at Castel Terracena. Constance presented herself on a balcony and spoke to them in the tone of mild remonstrance and admonition, trying to tell them that the situation might improve and the defeat of Henry might be exaggerated by Nicholas, but the Salernitans were determined to capture her for Tancred, so they continued the siege. Constance locked herself in her room, locked the windows, and prayed to God for help and revenge. After a rapid negotiation with Elia di Gesualdo, a distant relative of Tancred, Constance voluntarily went out under the condition that her German garrison were to be allowed to leave unharmed. She was then arrested by Elia (and some barons of Apulia who were related to her) and delivered to Tancred in Messina by Admiral Margaritus of Brindisi (her brother-in-law who had helped in the defence of Naples), on a bireme galley or dromon with 200 rowers. She was in her attire as empress, wearing a dress quilted with gold and decorated with roses, a cloak covered with precious jewels, and <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> strewn with gems, making her look like a goddess. Thus she became an important and valuable prize given that Henry had every intention of returning. When meeting Constance Tancred blamed her for the invasion, but she proudly responded that she was just taking back her dominion robbed by Tancred.|$|E

500|$|According to Kline, Yeats {{compared}} Olivia to Diana and Maud to Helen; he {{was attracted}} to dark coloured women, describing Olivia's skin as [...] "a little darker than a Greek's would have been and <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> very dark". Literary scholar Humphrey Carpenter writes that Yeats' impression of Olivia {{was one of a}} woman with [...] "a profound culture, a knowledge of French, English, and Italian and seemed always at leisure. Her nature was gentle and contemplative, and she was content, it seems, to have no more of life than leisure and the talk of her friends".|$|E
500|$|In The Virgin Tour, [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was {{the third}} song of the setlist. Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top, {{revealing}} her characteristic black bra.

She had a tambourine in her hand like her two male dancers, and together they sang the song while {{standing in front of a}} microphone, in tandem.

Wearing a [...] "demure black ensemble", <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> pulled back in her curls. On June 8, 2010, Aguilera performed the song again with several of her tracks, [...] "Fighter", [...] "Bionic", [...] "Not Myself Tonight", and [...] "Beautiful". According to James Dinh from MTV News, the performance of [...] "You Lost Me" [...] "brought a subtle and gentle ambience" [...] to the show, and it was not aired on television.|$|E

She sometimes wears clothing with either her name on it or the Capsule Corporation logo.|$|R

[...] "Monster" [...] was the first song of the medley that she performed, others being [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "Speechless". She also performed the song on all legs of The Monster Ball Tour. The performance was preceded by a video interlude featuring snarling dogs and brooding ravens. [...] "Monster" [...] began with Gaga emerging in a black feathered jacket and performing dance moves reminiscent of Michael Jackson. The backdrop featured the close-up of a black bird's wings.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not easy for him {{to come up with the}} lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and the hook, in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking at herself in the mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes and <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> untidy, she kept saying, [...] "I'm looking so crazy right now." [...] Harrison sang back to her and said, [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyoncé had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase – [...] "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" [...] – alongside Harrison.|$|E
500|$|She was {{eventually}} {{determined to be}} {{between the ages of}} three and five and appeared to be white with possible Hispanic ancestry. <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> described as being [...] "brown, wavy and fourteen inches in length". [...] It is presumed that the child's hair was left untrimmed for approximately two years, judging by its length. It was also estimated that she was between three feet one and three feet six inches tall and weighed around thirty pounds. There were no distinct birthmarks or scars on the body. It was later discovered that the girl had pierced ears, so the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children released an updated image of the child wearing earrings. The girl appeared to have been [...] "well-cared for" [...] during her life; no signs of malnutrition or abuse were noted, and investigators stated the clothing also reinforced the theory.|$|E

500|$|While at Fox, her roles {{had been}} that of a [...] "girl next door"; at Columbia, she was modeled after Rita Hayworth. Monroe's {{hairline}} was raised by electrolysis and <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> bleached even lighter, to platinum blonde. She also began working with the studio's head drama coach, Natasha Lytess, who would remain her mentor until 1955. Her only film at the studio was the low-budget musical Ladies of the Chorus (1948), {{in which she had}} her first starring role as a chorus girl who is courted by a wealthy man. During the production, she began an affair with her vocal coach, Fred Karger, who paid to have her slight overbite corrected. Despite the starring role and a subsequent screen test for the lead role in Born Yesterday (1950), Monroe's contract was not renewed. Ladies of the Chorus was released in October and was not a success.|$|E
500|$|Matt Groening first {{conceived}} Marge and {{the rest}} of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. Marge was named after Groening's mother Margaret [...] "Marge" [...] Groening, who has said she bears little similarity to the character, stating, [...] "It's really weird to have people think you're a cartoon." [...] Marge's beehive hairstyle was inspired by the titular Bride in Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> never blue.|$|E
500|$|Sullivan's longest {{love affair}} {{was with the}} American socialite, Fanny Ronalds, a woman three years his senior, who had two children. He met her in Paris around 1867, and the affair began in earnest soon after she moved to London {{permanently}} in 1871. A contemporary account described Fanny Ronalds this way: [...] "Her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness, her features small and exquisitely regular. <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> a dark shade of brown – châtain foncé [...] – and very abundant ... a lovely woman, with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine, and the most beautiful teeth." [...] Sullivan called her [...] "the best amateur singer in London". [...] She often performed Sullivan's songs at her famous Sunday soirees. She became particularly associated with [...] "The Lost Chord", singing it both in private and in public, often with Sullivan accompanying her. When Sullivan died, he left her the autograph manuscript of that song, along with other bequests.|$|E
