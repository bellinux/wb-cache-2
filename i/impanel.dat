5|$|The {{violence}} turned {{public opinion}} against Dow, {{and he was}} denounced in newspapers across the nation. He was tried for violation of the prohibition law; the prosecutor was former U.S. Attorney General Nathan Clifford, a longtime Dow opponent, and the defense attorney was a fellow founder of the Maine Temperance Society, future senator William P. Fessenden. Dow was acquitted, but his opponents convinced the coroner to <b>impanel</b> a jury that pronounced the protester's death a homicide. He was ultimately acquitted of that charge, but his popularity had suffered and he declined to run for re-election as mayor.|$|E
5|$|The entire park {{is within}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, making it the only federal court district that includes portions of more than one state (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming). Law professor Brian C. Kalt has argued that it may be impossible to <b>impanel</b> a jury in compliance with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment for a crime committed solely in the unpopulated Idaho portion of the park (and that {{it would be difficult to}} do so for a crime committed solely in the lightly populated Montana portion). One defendant, who was accused of a wildlife-related crime in the Montana portion of the park, attempted to raise this argument but eventually pleaded guilty, with the plea deal including his specific agreement not to raise the issue in his appeal.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the county grand juries in California, {{at least twice a}} year, the state <b>impanels</b> several Federal Grand Juries. The summons arrive in the mail just like regular jury summons. Jurors are requested to come on a certain date to be <b>impaneled</b> on the jury. There are over 500 people that attend this impanelment and multiple grand juries are chosen at this time. When the juries are chosen there are at least 50 alternates chosen as well. Each Grand Jury has 23 members and are expected to attend jury service one day per week for the time <b>impaneled.</b>|$|R

25|$|When a Lake County coroner's inquest {{concluded}} that McCall had acted {{in the line}} of duty, Judge Truman Futch ruled that he saw no need to <b>impanel</b> a grand jury on this incident. After Irvin recovered from the shooting, his re-trial was moved to Marion County (just north of Lake County), beginning in February 1952. He was offered a plea bargain but Irvin refused to plead guilty and maintained his innocence. The jury found Irvin guilty, and the judge sentenced him to death again. The case was appealed, but the conviction was upheld by the Florida State Supreme Court. In early 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case.|$|E

50|$|Defendants in {{political}} trials tend {{to participate in}} the proceedings more than defendants in non-political cases, as they may have greater ability to depart from courtroom norms to speak to political and moral issues.
