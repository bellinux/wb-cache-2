50|$|After the 810, Atari {{released}} the more reliable, enhanced density (130 KB) 1050 <b>drive.In</b> {{addition to the}} extra storage, the serial I/O could be cranked up a notch even faster than the 810 Happy product by the faster speed of the 1050s 6502 processor.The 1050 Enhancement was also a plug-in board, and could be installed without soldering or permanent modification.In addition to the buffered reading and writing with zero latency and faster serial i/o, it supported true double density (180 KB). The 1050 Controller was a small board that was installed inside the 1050 Happy drive that had 2 switches and an led that allowed enabling or disabling disk write-protect to override the notch in the disk. It also allowed switch selection of a slower mode to provide compatibility with some picky programs. Some commercial software only ran in the original slow speed mode. The controller required a mechanical modification to the drive's enclosure and hence its installation was harder than the happy board.|$|E
50|$|Methadone {{treatment}} may impair driving ability. Drug abuse patients had significantly more involvement in serious crashes than non-abuse {{patients in a}} study by the University of Queensland. In the study of a group of 220 drug abuse patients, most of them poly-drug abusers, 17 were involved in crashes killing people, compared with a control group of other patients randomly selected having no involvement in fatal crashes. However, there have been multiple studies verifying the ability of methadone maintenance patients to <b>drive.In</b> the UK, persons who are prescribed oral Methadone can continue to drive after they have satisfactorily completed an independent medical examination which will include a urine screen for drugs. The licence will be issued for 12 months at a time and even then, only following a favourable assessment from their own doctor. Individuals who are prescribed methadone for either IV or IM administration cannot drive in the UK, mainly due to the increased sedation effects that this route of use can cause.|$|E

50|$|From the department's {{inception}} {{until the}} end of prohibition in 1933, a DeKalb County Police officer's primary responsibility was to apprehend bootleggers. Officers Samuel Gentry, Lewell Henderson, Miles Phillips, and Charles Wright were all killed in incidents involving suspected bootleggers.During the remainder of the 1930s,the Department's primary focus was the Enforcement of Traffic regulations and local county ordinances At the beginning of the 1940s, DeKalb had just 20 police officers. In 1947, Under County Commissioner Scott Candler, a program was started to expand and better train and equip the department, starting with the introduction of two-way car radios. The radio system afforded officers greater mobility and increased their effectiveness, before the radio system, officers had to regularly call in from pay phones for instructions. The radios,along {{with the addition of a}} new fleet of patrol cars in 1949 allowed officers to quickly respond to calls,that same year DeKalb Police moved into headquarters located in the county complex on Camp <b>drive.in</b> the 1950s the department added more officers, formed Traffic Enforcement, Criminal Investigation,and a Records and Identification section, and responsibilities between the Sheriff and the Police Dept. were more clearly defined. By 1960 the department had grown to over 100 officers, and efforts were made for Dekalb to organize their own Academy.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962, the City of Miami Beach {{created the}} [...] "Garden Center" [...] on a vacant site {{opposite}} the Miami Beach Convention Center built in 1957. Operated {{then as a}} City park, the Garden was situated on the historic Collins Canal, {{an integral part of}} the beginnings of Miami Beach. In the early 1900s pioneer John S. Collins dug the canal to transport mangoes and avocados, then called alligator pears by boat to the Port of Miami from groves along what is now Pinetree <b>Drive.In</b> the 1920s pioneer Carl Fisher developed Lincoln Road, luxury hotels such as the Flamingo and the Nautilus with polo fields and golf courses. The Garden site was originally a golf course.By 1922 Miami Beach boasted the largest avocado and mango groves in the world, but Miami's agricultural roots wouldn't last much longer, sacrificed for the tourist trade. Tourism has long been a driving force in Miami Beach, but the City also experienced the impact of economic recessions, World Wars, and destructive hurricanes. The Garden had sadly deteriorated before the Art Deco renaissance of the 1980s and after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. A group of residents approached the City in 1996 to create the Miami Beach Garden Conservancy as a non-profit organization with a mission to restore the Garden. Today's Miami Beach Botanical Garden is a public/private partnership, owned by the City of Miami Beach. The Garden has again become a dynamic venue for arts and cultural programming, environmental education and cultural tourism.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1950s the {{character}} of West Chermside was beginning to change. The small farm sector was fading, as economies of scale began to drive industries like dairying and poultry farming towards larger production requiring bigger land holdings [...]However, there was a problem. The Brisbane City Council Town Plan which divided the city into nine zones, involved the development of separate satellite towns and suburbs separated from the main city and each other by continuous open spaces called green belts; these were to be part parkland and part farming areas all zoned as rural. The postwar reconstruction of roads and infrastructure, along with the huge housing boom {{and the lack of}} planners, meant that the growth of the city outstripped the development of the plan and it became more of a dream as the future unfolded. In 1956 William Basnett, a dairy farmer of West Chermside, challenged the Council in the Land Court and won the right to subdivide his property into building blocks instead of being part of the proposed Green Belt. This case played a part in ending the Green Belt plan and opened the way to develop his property; others soon followed.Since the new suburb grew out of the small farms and bush that covered most of the area it enabled the Council and developers to make it a completely planned modern suburb depending on the motor car for transport, as automobiles were becoming commonplace by the late 1950s. The Telegraph, Saturday 14 June 1969, reported that the settlement was referred to as Nappy Valley by many people till a more elegant name was chosen; West Chermside was gazetted in 1975. But the colloquial name aptly described not only the new arrivals but also the new area with its modern houses, shopping centre and churches. The writer commented, “It is not a suburb of corner stores and scattered shops, but has a compact <b>drivein</b> shopping centre offering most of the facilities needed - this type of shopping is ideal for the predominance of young families who live in the area.” ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring {{the process}} of {{mesoderm}} specification inXenopusembryos, cells of the equatorial region are induced to form mesoderm in response to signals from the underlying endodermal cells. One mesodermal cell type resulting from thisin vivoinduction is skeletal muscle, which has a very specific and tightly regulated course of electrical and morphological development. Previously, electrical development could be analyzed only after neurulation, once myocytes could be morphologically identified. In vitro,activin triggers a cascade of events leading {{to the development of}} specific mesodermal tissues, including skeletal muscle; however, the precise role of activinin vivois less clear. Much is now known about the mechanism and control of activin action, but very {{little is known about the}} subsequent time course of differentiation of activin-induced muscle. Such muscle is routinely identified by the presence of a small number of specific markers which, although they accurately confirm the presence of muscle, give little indication of the time course or quantitative aspects of muscle development. One of the most important functional aspects of muscle development is the acquisition of the complex electrical properties which allow it to function normally. Here we assess the ability of activin to <b>drivein</b> vitrothe normal highly regulated sequence of electrical development in skeletal muscle. We find that in most, but not all, respects the normal time course of development of voltage-gated ion currents is well reproduced in activin-induced muscle. This characterization strengthens the case for activin as an agent capable of inducing the detailed developmental program of muscle and now allows for analysis of the regulation of electrical development prior to neurulation...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) {{lead to the}} concept of eco-driving support systems, which assist drivers in controlling vehicles in a sustainable way by reducing fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. In this thesis, an algorithm for an ecological Adaptive Cruise Control (ecoACC) system is designated. In order to test the system in MIL (Model in the Loop) and DIL (Driver In the Loop) environments, an important task is the specification of a fuel consumption model. In {{the first part of the}} thesis an overview is presented about fuel consumption models and several eco-devices developed by different authors. In the second part of the thesis an experimental campaign (with a sample of 100 drivers) is carried out in order to specify and validate the model. The survey is supported by the <b>DRIVEIN</b> 2 (DRIVEr monitoring: technologies, methodologies, and IN-Vehicle Innovative systems) project. As the major data are collected using the OBD-II port of the vehicle, and in particular the data related the instantaneous fuel consumption, a validation of the former data is carried out in collaboration with the CNR (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche – Istituto motori). To carry out a more realistic simulation a vehicle dynamics model was coupled with the ADAS model. The purpose of the implemented vehicle dynamics model is to simulate, in real time, the vehicle’s dynamic behaviour, thanks to continuous integration of the balance equations regulating the longitudinal and lateral vehicle motion. Furthermore, a model able to provide an estimation of real-time fuel consumption of the vehicle is developed: such a model is embedded in the vehicle model discussed in the following, in order to optimize consumption performance during driving task. The implemented system is a next-generation eco-drive system, in the sense that it is able to observe the driver's behaviour and the current fuel consumption, as well as to simulate the fuel consumption in the same traffic conditions and stimuli the driver is subject to, and finally to compare the actual fuel consumption with this of an eco driver. In this way the system gives a reward to the driver if his/her fuel consumption is lower than those of the eco driver, vice versa the system indicates the possibility to improve his/her driving style...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho tem como objetivo o de mostrar experimentalmente a influência que os paletes de madeira podem exercer no comportamento das estruturas de armazenagem do tipo {{drive in}} com um nível de carregamento. Considerar o palete com apoios móveis em ambos os braços da estrutura, ou por outro lado, desconsiderá-lo totalmente na análise estrutural, pode resultar em análises irreais, pois o atrito entre o palete e os trilhos pode influenciar no comportamento deste tipo de estrutura. A fim de se verificar a existência desta influência em condições próximas à realidade, dois pórticos com características semelhantes às dos fornecidos pelas empresas fabricantes foram testados com a utilização de três tipos de paletes com características semelhantes às dos paletes encontrados no mercado, com inércias variadas, apoiados sobre trilhos pintados. Estes paletes foram testados sobre trilhos com mesas abrasivas a fim de se verificarem possíveis diferenças nos deslocamentos entre as estruturas carregadas com paletes sobre trilhos pintados e entre as estruturas carregadas com paletes sobre trilhos com mesas abrasivas. Além disso, os pórticos foram testados com um palete suspenso com o objetivo de simular o modelo teórico elaborado pelo Slope-deflection. Cada pórtico foi testado com as forças verticais de 245 N, 490 N, 735 N e 980 N aplicadas nos braços e com a força {{horizontal}} de 1, 5 % correspondente ao valor da força vertical aplicada neste pórtico para simular possíveis forças horizontais aplicadas pelas empilhadeiras na movimentação dos materiais. Dois relógios comparadores com sensibilidade de 1 / 1000 mm e um com sensibilidade de um 1 / 100 mm, todos com curso de 10 mm, foram colocados, respectivamente, no topo e na base de cada uma das colunas de cada pórtico com o objetivo de se medirem os deslocamentos lineares e angulares destes pórticos. Os deslocamentos medidos nas extremidades de cada coluna foram úteis para se determinar os momentos fletores e as reações nas extremidades destas colunas. A influência dos paletes de madeira no comportamento das estruturas do tipo <b>drivein</b> foi verificada com nível de 5 % de significância através da análise da variânciaThis dissertation?s {{intent is to}} investigate experimentally the influence the wood pallets exert {{on the behavior of}} the drive in storage racks with one level of loading. To consider the pallets as roller supported on both rails of the structure implies in not to consider the influence of the friction between the pallets and the rails in the behavior of the structure, and thus the results obtained by the theoretical model of analysis may lead to results that may differ from the observed in the real structure. With the aim of investigating this influence in conditions {{as close as possible to}} the reality, two frames resembling those supplied by manufacturers were tested with three sort of pallets, each one with characteristics and dimensions resembling the pallets utilized by users, but with different resistance and inertia in comparison with each other. The same pallets were tested in the same frames, but this time on rails with an abrasive surface to verify the possible differences in displacements between the structures loaded with pallets on smooth surfaces rails and between structures loaded with pallets on abrasive surfaces rails. Furthermore, the frames were subjected to a suspense load with the aim of simulating the theoretical model of analysis. Each arm were tested with vertical forces of 245 N, 490 N, 735 N and 980 N. It was considered also the horizontal force of 1, 5 % of the vertical force acting on the frame to take into consideration the lift truck operation. With the aim of measuring the linear and angular displacements of these frames, two dial gages were positioned at the top and one was positioned at the bottom of each column. The readings of all linear and angular displacements at the end of the columns were useful for evaluating the bending moments, the horizontal and vertical reactions acting in each one of the end of the columns of these frames. The 8 elements considered (3 pallets on smooth surface rails, 3 pallets on abrasive surface rails, 1 suspense load and 1 for the Slope-Deflection Method) were combined in groups of 3, so that the influence of the wood pallets in the behavior of drive in racks can be investigated through the variance analysis with 5 % in the level of significanc...|$|E
