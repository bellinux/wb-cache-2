5|$|In January 2004, the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) {{released}} {{their first}} prediction for tropical cyclone activity throughout the Northeast Pacific. Based on a Neutral El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), {{a total of}} 15 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes was forecast.

5|$|Sigismund {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to strengthen the}} position of the Roman Catholic Church, especially by appointing Catholics to the highest positions of state administration. Carillo and other Jesuit friars returned to Sigismund's court in disguise in early 1591. Sigismund met Andrew and Balthasar Báthory <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> seek their support for the legalization of the Jesuits' presence, but they refused to stand by the friars at the Diet.|$|E
5|$|This in turn {{endangered}} Libyan {{control over}} the Aouzou Strip, and Aouzou fell <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> the FANT, only to be repelled by an overwhelming Libyan counter-offensive and the French refusal to provide air cover to the Chadians. Habré readily replied to this setback with the first Chadian incursion in Libyan territory of the Chadian–Libyan conflict, mounting on 5 September a surprise and fully successful raid against the key Libyan air base at Maaten al-Sarra. This attack {{was part of a}} plan to remove the threat of Libyan airpower before a renewed offensive on Aouzou.|$|E
5|$|After {{carrying}} out temporary repairs in Abu Qir Bay, Bellerophon hoisted jury masts and, towing the captured Spartiate with HMS Majestic, sailed to Gibraltar for a refit. When this was completed {{she returned to}} Britain, arriving at Spithead on 2 April 1800, where she paid off and entered the dockyard for a more substantial refit in September. These works amounted to £32,608 and lasted until August 1801. She recommissioned on 25 June 1801 {{under the command of}} Captain Lord Garlies and sailed <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> rejoin the Channel Fleet, which was blockading Brest. Lord Garlies was superseded by Captain John Loring on 25 November, and Bellerophon continued on the blockade until receiving new orders in early March 1802.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{commercial}} smash, the record received initially lukewarm reviews from mainstream music critics; many contemporary reviewers deemed it inferior to Definitely Maybe, with the songwriting and production particular points of criticism. In the ensuing years, however, critical opinion towards the album reversed, {{and it is}} now generally considered a seminal record of both the Britpop era, and the 1990s in general. Over several months in 1995 and 1996, the band performed an extensive world tour in support of the album. The most notable of the concerts were two Knebworth House performances <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> a combined crowd of 250,000 people. At the 1996 Brit Awards, the album won Best British Album.|$|E
5|$|Despite its post-revolutionary mythology, {{the march}} {{was not a}} {{spontaneous}} event. Numerous calls for a mass demonstration at Versailles had already been made; the Marquis of Saint-Huruge, one of the popular orators of the Palais-Royal, had called for just such a march <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> evict the obstructionist deputies who, he claimed, were protecting the king's veto power. Although his efforts were foiled, revolutionaries continued {{to hold onto the}} idea of a march on Versailles to compel the king to accept the Assembly's laws. Speakers at the Palais-Royal mentioned it regularly throughout the next month, creating enduring suspicions of the proprietor, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. The idea of a march on Versailles was widespread, and was even discussed {{in the pages of the}} Mercure de France (5 September 1789). A menacing unrest was in the air, and many nobles and foreigners fled the oppressive atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{negative}} associations with service there, Nolan had deliberately {{transferred to a}} regiment operating in India. He initially travelled to Maidstone, where the 15th maintained a troop to train new recruits, {{under the command of}} Captain George Key. He then caught a troopship to Bombay, the Malabar, which arrived on 9 November. Soon after arrival he fell ill and was granted two years of sick leave, starting from 26 March 1840, and returned to Britain. He returned to active service in June 1841, again to the Maidstone depot, and became a Lieutenant on the 19th. He went on leave again <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> take the riding master's course and exam, and returned on 8 March 1842, newly qualified.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, No.78 Wing, {{comprising}} Nos.75, 78 and 80 Squadrons, and No.114 MFCU, departed Tarakan for Australia. Arriving in December 1945, {{the formation}} was based initially at Deniliquin, New South Wales, where its squadrons were reduced to cadre status; No.80 Squadron was disbanded there in July 1946. The wing and its remaining squadrons relocated in May and June to RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales, and then <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> RAAF Station Williamtown, where they re-equipped with P-51 Mustangs. Rawlinson, now a group captain, completed his appointment as officer commanding in December 1946. Wing Commander Dick Cresswell held command of the wing—as well as the Williamtown base—from March 1947 to March 1948.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{in order}} to meet an urgent need to {{increase}} the number of aircraft able to designate targets for laser-guided bombs, 10 GR1As and two T2As were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated Jaguar GR1B or T2B respectively. TIALD equipped Jaguar GR1Bs were deployed to Italy <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> take part in Operation Deliberate Force against Bosnian Serb forces, being used to designate targets for RAF Harriers. During the Bosnian operations, a Jaguar of 41 Squadron carried out the first RAF bombing raid in Europe since the end of the Second World War fifty years before.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Roosters {{became the}} first club to play 100 seasons of first grade rugby league; {{they were the only}} outfit to play in each season since the competition's {{inception}} in 1908. They appointed Chris Anderson as coach in 2007 and 2008 following two relatively unsuccessful years under Ricky Stuart. On 9 July 2007, Anderson resigned after a 56–0 loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Assistant Coach Fittler acted as the caretaker {{for the remainder of the}} 2007 season, before being appointed <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> the top job for two years. With eight rounds remaining in a disappointing 2009 season in which the Roosters finished with the wooden spoon for the first time in 43 years, Fittler was informed he would not be the coach in 2010, his position to be taken by veteran coach Brian Smith. The Roosters wound up winning only five games for the entire season; twice against Cronulla and once against each of Canberra in Canberra, eventual grand finalists Parramatta and Newcastle in Newcastle.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Cooder {{recorded}} Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down {{after being}} {{inspired by a}} headline about bankers and other affluent people profiting from bank bailouts and the resulting recession during the late-2000s. Released <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> critical acclaim, it showcased Cooder's return to his early work's musical style and told topical stories about political and social corruption, various economic victims, and an emerging class war. With the album finished, Cooder had developed a penchant for writing such songs and wanted to continue writing more storyline-inspired songs. A month after the album's release, Cooder had his first short-story collection, Los Angeles Stories, published by City Lights Bookstore. In June 2012, he joined Time political columnist Joe Klein on the latter's road trip across the United States, speaking out to people in towns {{about the state of}} the nation and its forthcoming presidential election in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In May 2004, del Potro won {{his first}} senior match, {{at the age of}} 15, at the ITF Circuit event in Buenos Aires by {{defeating}} Matias Niemiz. He then went on to lose in three sets to Sebastián Decoud in the second round. His next victory came over five months later against the Chilean Álvaro Loyola in a tournament in Antofagasta. Later that year, del Potro reached the quarterfinals of the ITF Circuit event in Campinas, Brazil; recording victories over Henrique Mello and Alessandro Camarco. Del Potro won two more matches {{before the end of the}} year and saw his world ranking rise from no. 1441 <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> no. 1077 in November. He also reached the finals in the Argentina Cup and Campionati Internazionali D'Italia Junior tournaments.|$|E
5|$|In early 1816, the Territory {{approved}} a census and Pennington {{was named to}} be the census enumerator.

Because of the heat of the season, the delegation moved outdoors on many days and wrote the constitution beneath the shade of a giant elm tree. The state's first constitution was completed on June 29, and elections were held <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> fill the offices of the new state government. In November Congress approved statehood.|$|E

In the US, Is This It entered the Billboard200 at number74 after selling 16,000units in the first week. 20,000copies were shipped in America per week from October 2001 to January 2002, when a performance by the Strokes on nationwide TV show Saturday Night Live caused a temporary rise in sales. A 60%increase allowed the album to reach a peak of number33 on the Billboard200 from its previous high of 63.|$|E
5|$|Long-time {{assistant}} coach Brian Schmetzer {{was promoted to}} interim head coach. The same day, the club announced their signing of Uruguayan midfielder Nicolás Lodeiro on a designated player contract, {{as well as the}} return of former designated player Álvaro Fernández. Despite the sluggish start as well as the loss of midfielder Clint Dempsey, who was forced <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>to</b> stop playing after evaluations for an irregular heartbeat, the Sounders turned their season around with 8 wins, 2 losses, and 4 draws. In the process, they came back from 9th to 4th in the Western Conference and qualified for the 2016 MLS Cup Playoffs. Schmetzer was named as permanent head coach as a result.|$|E
5|$|Right {{after signing}} the {{contract}} with the Canadiens, Morenz began to reconsider joining them.

After receiving the letter, Dandurand phoned Morenz and told him to come to Montreal to talk in person. In Montreal, Morenz began explaining his reasons for not signing to Dandurand but began crying and could not finish. In response, Dandurand falsely threatened that if Morenz did not join the Canadiens, his professional hockey career would be over. Hearing this, Morenz relented and agreed to report to the Canadiens' training camp later in the year.|$|E
