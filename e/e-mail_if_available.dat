30|$|This active labor-market {{initiative}} {{started its}} operations in 1998 {{with the introduction}} of CIL-PROEMPLEO, an LMI institution that offers intermediation services. Bureaucratic practices were greatly simplified as participation only requires individuals and firms to register in-person at any labor mediation office by filling a simple application form and answering a short standard labor-market survey 3. This information is subsequently uploaded to SILNET, a customized informatics system of job intermediation available only through an intranet. SILNET has simplified enormously the search costs in time and effort for both firms and workers. The registration process, for instance, went from 4  days prior to 1998 to less than an hour (MTPS 1999). The computer software analyzes and matches workers’ skills and experience with job openings. Once a suitable match is found, the jobseeker is contacted in person (or in some cases, by telephone or <b>e-mail</b> <b>if</b> <b>available),</b> in order to pick-up a letter of presentation from the Ministry of Labor with details about the job vacancy. It is worth noticing that job matches are based only on job opportunities generated from firms that have previously signed up on CIL-PROEMPLEO. Unlike other experiences, particularly in developed countries, participation in these services is voluntary given the absence of an unemployment insurance system in Peru.|$|E
