5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not to press the issue. Even so, three <b>key</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E
5|$|The British {{policy as}} stated in the {{declaration}} was to face numerous challenges to its implementation in the following years. The first of these was the indirect peace negotiations which took place between Britain and the Ottomans in December 1917 and January 1918 during a pause in the hostilities for the rainy season; although these peace talks were unsuccessful, archival records suggest that <b>key</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War Cabinet may have been willing to permit leaving Palestine under nominal Turkish sovereignty as part of an overall deal.|$|E
5|$|The Kentish rebels had {{assembled}} a wide-ranging {{list of people}} whom they wanted the King to hand over for execution. It included national figures, such as John of Gaunt, Archbishop Sudbury and Hales; other <b>key</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal council; officials, such as Belknap and Bampton who had intervened in Kent; and other hated members of the wider royal circle. When they reached the Marshalsea Prison in Southwark, they tore it apart. By now the Kent and Essex rebels had been joined by many rebellious Londoners. The Fleet and Newgate Prisons were attacked by the crowds, and the rebels also targeted houses belonging to Flemish immigrants.|$|E

5|$|The assassins, the <b>key</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clandestine network, {{and the key}} Serbian {{military}} conspirators {{who were}} still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished. Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators. Much {{of what is known}} about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records.|$|E
5|$|The open {{world was}} {{modelled}} on Southern California and Los Angeles, and its design and in-game render constituted {{much of the}} game's early work. <b>Key</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game world production team took field research trips throughout the region and documented their research with photo and video footage. Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks. To reflect and reproduce Los Angeles' demographic spread, the developers studied census data and watched documentaries about the city. The team considered creating the open world the most technically demanding aspect of the game's production.|$|E
5|$|Development for Mulan {{began in}} 1994, after the {{production}} team sent {{a select group}} of artistic supervisors to China for three weeks to take photographs and drawings of local landmarks for inspiration; and to soak up local culture. <b>Key</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creative team at the time – Pam Coats, Barry Cook, Ric Sluiter, Robert Walker, and Mark Henn – were invited to travel to China as a research trip to study the landscape, people, and history of the original legend. From June 17 to July 2, 1994, the research trip flew to Beijing, China, which is where Pam Coats became inspired by the placement of flags on the Great Wall, Datong, Luoyang, Xi'an, Jiayuguan, Dunhuang, and Guilin.|$|E

5|$|In 1867 the Fenians were {{preparing}} to launch an armed uprising against British rule, but their plans became known to the authorities, and several <b>key</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement's leadership were arrested and convicted. Two succeeded in evading the police, Thomas J. Kelly and Timothy Deasy, and travelled from Ireland to Britain to reorganise and raise {{the morale of the}} Fenian groups there {{in the wake of the}} failed uprising. Both were Irish Americans who had fought with distinction in the American Civil War– Kelly achieving the rank of colonel and Deasy that of captain– and both had played important roles in the abortive uprising; Kelly had been declared the chief executive of the Irish Republic at a secret republican convention, and Deasy commanded a Fenian brigade in County Cork.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{took with}} him several <b>key</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Army staff, {{including}} Brigadier General George Honnen {{as chief of}} staff, Colonel George H.

White as assistant chief of staff, G-2 (intelligence), Clyde Eddleman as assistant chief of staff, G-3 (operations) and Colonel Kenneth Pierce as assistant chief of staff, G-4 (supply). Honnen had health problems, and spent much of April, May and June 1943 in hospital before being ordered home on 18 June. He was replaced by Brigadier General Edwin D. Patrick, who had served {{on the staff of}} Admiral William F. Halsey in the South Pacific Area. Patrick did not get along smoothly with Krueger or the rest of the Sixth Army staff, and in May 1944 Patrick was appointed to command the 158th Regimental Combat Team, and Decker became chief of staff.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1950s, Soedjatmoko and President Sukarno, {{with whom}} he had had a warm working relationship, had a falling out over the president's {{increasingly}} authoritarian policies. In 1960 Soedjatmoko co-founded and headed the Democratic League, which attempted to promote democracy in the country; he also opposed Sukarno's Guided Democracy policy. When the effort failed, Soedjatmoko went to the US and took a position as guest lecturer at Cornell University. When he returned to Indonesia in 1962, he discovered that <b>key</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PSI had been arrested and the party banned; both Siasat and Pedoman were closed. To avoid trouble with the government, Soedjatmoko voluntarily left himself unemployed until 1965, when he became co-editor of An Introduction to Indonesian Historiography.|$|E

5|$|PlatinumGames {{was founded}} by the merger of Seeds Inc. and Odd Ltd. in October 2007. Seeds Inc. had been founded by Shinji Mikami, Atsushi Inaba, and Hideki Kamiya on August 1, 2006. Prior to {{establishing}} the company, the three worked for Capcom, and were <b>key</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Osaka-based Clover Studio, which specialized in making new and creative intellectual properties. They worked closely together developing popular Capcom franchises including: Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe and Ōkami. Most of these titles received critical acclaim, but under-performed commercially, leading to Capcom's decision to close the studio. Prior to the closure, the three founders had already left the studio to form their own company in mid-2006. In January 2006, the company expanded to 51 employees, including more former Capcom employees such as Masami Ueda, composer for the early Resident Evil games, and Mari Shimazaki, Ōkamis artist. Yusuke Hashimoto and Kenji Saito, who would eventually become PlatinumGames' directors, also joined during its establishment period. The new company revealed its existence by launching its website in February 2007.|$|E
