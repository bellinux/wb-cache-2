25|$|Dental plaque is an oral biofilm that {{adheres to}} the teeth and {{consists}} of many species of both bacteria and fungi (such as Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans), embedded in salivary polymers and microbial extracellular products. The accumulation of microorganisms subjects the teeth and gingival tissues to high concentrations of bacterial metabolites which results in dental disease. Biofilm {{on the surface of}} teeth is frequently subject to oxidative stress and acid stress. Dietary carbohydrates can cause a dramatic <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> in oral biofilms to values of 4 and below (acid stress). A pH of 4 at body temperature of 37°C causes depurination of DNA, leaving apurinic (AP) sites in DNA, especially loss of guanine.|$|E
25|$|A common {{technique}} involves engineering {{a sequence}} of 6 to 8 histidines into the N- or C-terminal of the protein. The polyhistidine binds strongly to divalent metal ions such as nickel and cobalt. The protein can be passed through a column containing immobilized nickel ions, which binds the polyhistidine tag. All untagged proteins pass through the column. The protein can be eluted with imidazole, which competes with the polyhistidine tag for binding to the column, or by a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> (typically to 4.5), which decreases the affinity of the tag for the resin. While this procedure is generally used for the purification of recombinant proteins with an engineered affinity tag (such as a 6xHis tag or Clontech's HAT tag), {{it can also be}} used for natural proteins with an inherent affinity for divalent cations.|$|E

These span the food chain from autotrophs to heterotrophs and include organisms such as coccolithophores, corals, foraminifera, echinoderms, crustaceans and molluscs. As described above, under normal conditions, calcite and aragonite are stable in surface waters since the carbonate ion is at supersaturating concentrations. However, as ocean pH falls, the concentration of carbonate ions required for saturation to occur increases, and when carbonate becomes undersaturated, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution. Therefore, even if there is no change in the rate of calcification, the rate of dissolution of calcareous material increases. affects shell dissolution rate but not calcification rate in a marine snail |journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume = 277 |issue = 1693 |pages = 2553–2558 |pmc = 2894921 |doi = 10.1098/rspb.2010.0206 |pmid = 20392726 |ref = harv}} ...|$|E
2500|$|Different {{phases of}} {{digestion}} take place including: the cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase {{occurs at the}} sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food {{at this point and}} thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH.</b> Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. [...] Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. [...] Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine.|$|E
