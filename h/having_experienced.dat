From there through the coast of southwestern Florida, small craft were advised to remain near shore due to rough seas. Offshore, workers were removed from oil rigs.

5|$|Minton's time on {{the court}} {{marked the end of}} a {{transitory}} period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court, which has had strong political science implications on the Supreme Court. The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress of be appointed to the court. Linda Gugin and Professor James St. Clair have noted that the federal courts have lost a valuable point of view by not <b>having</b> <b>experienced</b> legislators among their ranks.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} is a two-page summary of key results on stalking victimization in Alaska statewide from the 2015 Alaska Victimization Survey. The summary describes Alaska statutory {{definitions of the}} crime of stalking, methodology and limitations of the survey, and estimates of lifetime and past year stalking victimization experienced by adult women in Alaska. Results show that 1 in 3 women in Alaska <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> stalking in their lifetime. One in 17 <b>have</b> <b>experience</b> stalking in the past year. More than 80, 800 women in Alaska <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> stalking in their lifetime, and more than 15, 300 <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> stalking in the past year. Stalking was even more common among women who <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> intimate partner violence or sexual violence...|$|R
50|$|Campus {{sexual assault}} has {{received}} less attention from researchers outside the United States. Studies that have examined sexual assault experiences {{among college students}} in western countries other than the U.S. have found results {{similar to those found}} by American researchers. A 1993 study of a nationally representative sample of Canadian College students found that 28% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> some form of sexual assault in the preceding year, and 45% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> some form of sexual assault since entering college. A 1991 study of 347 undergraduates in New Zealand found that 25.3% <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> rape or attempted rape, and 51.6% <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> some form of sexual victimization. A 2014 study of students in Great Britain found that 25% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> some type of sexual assault while attending university and 7% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> rape or attempted rape as college students.|$|R
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} contains {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans <b>having</b> <b>experienced</b> severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|U-30 {{began her}} first patrol {{operating}} from Lorient and her seventh overall on 13 July 1940. During {{a period of}} 12 days, she traveled {{as far south as}} Portugal and sank the 712-ton British ship Ellaroy on the 21st. Three days later, on 24 July, U-30 returned to Lorient, <b>having</b> <b>experienced</b> a malfunction in one of her engines. It then became clear that the boat was suffering a number of mechanical difficulties and as a result it was decided that she would need to be used sparingly. For her next patrol it was decided that she would leave from Lorient, but would return to Germany.|$|E
5|$|A system {{developed}} {{within a}} convergence zone on January20 near {{the boundary between}} the South-West Indian Ocean and the Australia region. Its circulation became better defined, and MFR initiated advisories on January22. With a ridge to the south, it drifted to the southeast, approaching 90°E, but turning to the southwest before crossing over. On January23, the system intensified into a tropical depression. Slowly intensifying, the depression became Tropical Storm Eddy on January24. That day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 11S, and it turned toward the south. After <b>having</b> <b>experienced</b> moderate wind shear, Eddy entered an area of more favorable conditions, and its convection gradually organized. Early on January26, MFR upgraded it to a tropical cyclone, later estimating peak winds of 130km/h (80mph). After that time, increasing wind shear weakened Eddy to a tropical storm, causing it to curve to the west. By January28, the circulation was exposed from the convection, and Eddy weakened to a tropical depression. It turned to the southwest the next day, and dissipated fully on January30.|$|E

The 2005 Canadian General Social Survey, looking at the years 1999-2004 found similar data; 4% of men and 3% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> IPV in a relationship in which they were still involved, 16% of men and 21% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> IPV in a relationship which had now ended, and 6% of men and 7% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> IPV across all relationships, past and present.|$|R

5|$|Drewett {{emigrated to}} Australia in 1884, causing {{the boys to}} be uprooted as they {{went to live with}} Drewett's mother in London. In September of that year, Aurobindo and Manmohan joined St Paul's School there. He learned Greek and spent the last three years reading {{literature}} and English poetry. He also acquired some familiarity with the German and Italian languages and, exposed to the evangelical strictures of Drewett's mother, a distaste for religion. He considered himself at one point to be an atheist but later determined that he was agnostic. A blue plaque unveiled in 2007 commemorates Aurobindo's residence at 49 St Stephen's Avenue in Shepherd's Bush, London, from 1884 to 1887. The three brothers began living in spartan circumstances at the Liberal Club in South Kensington during 1887, their father <b>having</b> <b>experienced</b> some financial difficulties.

5|$|In 1971, the Miami Urban Area Transportation Study {{completed}} by the Dade County metropolitan planning organization recommended the construction for a rapid transit system for Greater Miami. <b>Having</b> <b>experienced</b> a prolonged post-World War II population boom, metropolitan Dade County's permanent population rose by 35% to nearly 1.3 million residents within a decade, among the fastest population growth rates in the United States. Within a year of the study, county residents approved a $132.5 million ($ million, adjusted for current inflation) bond dedicated to transit, with additional funding approved by the Florida Legislature for transit which, up until that time, operated solely on fare revenue. In 1976, with preliminary engineering completed for the system, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA, then, the Urban Mass Transit Administration) committed 80% of the costs for {{the first stage of}} rapid transit system, with the county and state incurring the remaining cost. In the end the system cost over a billion dollars.|$|E
