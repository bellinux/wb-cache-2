Blood samples were collected for complete blood counts, plasma biochemical profiles, serum iron concentrations, total iron-binding capacity, whole-blood lead concentrations, and plasma ferritin assays. Liver samples obtained by laparotomy were divided, with one half processed for histologic examination {{and the other half}} frozen and submitted for tissue mineral analysis. The histologic sections were scored by two blinded observers for iron deposition, necrosis, and fibrosis. The Egyptian fruit bats had significantly higher liver iron (mean = 3, 669 ± 1, 823 ppm) and lead (mean = 8. 9 ± 5. 8 ppm) concentrations than the <b>island</b> <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (mean [Fe] = 174 ± 173 ppm, mean [Pb] = 1. 9 ± 0. 5 ppm). Hepatic iron concentrations significantly correlated with tissue lead concentrations, histologic grading for iron and necrosis, serum iron, transferrin saturation, and plasma ferritin (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Blood lead concentrations negatively correlated with tissue lead concentrations (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). When the product of transferrin saturation and serum iron was greater than 51, an individual animal had a high probability of having iron overload. When the product of these two variables was greater than 90, there was a high probability that the animal had hemochromatosis. On the basis of this study, it appears that evaluation of serum iron, transferrin saturation, and plasma ferritin are useful and noninvasive methods for diagnosis of hemochromatosis in Egyptian fruit bats...|$|R

50|$|The McConkey and Drake (2006) {{study is}} unique {{because it was}} one of the first {{attempts}} to model a density-dependent threshold relationship that described ecological extinction. They studied a seed dispersal interaction between <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> and trees with large seeds on the tropical Pacific <b>Islands.</b> Insular <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (Pteropus tonganus), are considered to be keystone species because they are the only seed dispersers that can carry large seeds long distances. The host-pathogen model by Janzen and Connell suggests that survivorship of seeds in the tropics greatly increases the further away from the parent tree it lands, and that trees require this dispersal in order to avoid extinction. In the pathogen latent environment of the tropics, seed dispersal only becomes more paramount to species survival. As hypothesized, McConkey and Drake found a threshold relationship between the Flying Fox Index (FFI) and the median proportion of seeds carried over five meters. Below the threshold of abundance seed dispersal was insignificant and independent of <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> abundance; however, above the threshold, dispersal positively correlated with increased <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> abundance (as measured by the FFI). Although they did not directly prove the cause for this relationship, McConkey and Drake proposed a behavioral mechanism. Flying foxes are known to be territorial, and in the absence of competition a <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> will eat within one tree, effectively dropping the seeds right below it. Alternatively, if there is a high density of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> feeding at one time (abundance above the threshold density) then aggressive behavior, such as stealing fruit from another individual’s territory, will lead to longer average seed dispersal. In this way the seed dispersing <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> has a disproportional effect on the overall community structure in comparison to their relative biomass. Modeling the effect of ecological extinction on communities is the first step to applying this framework into conservation work.|$|R
40|$|The Nipah virus {{outbreak}} in Malaysia (September 1998 to May 1999) resulted in 265 cases of acute encephalitis with 105 deaths, and near {{collapse of the}} billion-dollar pig-farming industry. Because it was initially attributed to Japanese encephalitis, early control measures were ineffective, and the outbreak spread {{to other parts of}} Malaysia and nearby Singapore. The isolation of the novel aetiological agent, the Nipah virus (NiV), from the cerebrospinal fluid of an outbreak victim was the turning point which led to outbreak control 2 months later. Together with the Hendra virus, NiV is now recognised as a new genus, Henipavirus (Hendra + Nipah), in the Paramyxoviridae family. Efforts of the local and international scientific community have since elucidated the epidemiology, clinico-pathophysiology and pathogenesis of this new disease. Humans contracted the infection from close contact with infected pigs, and formed the basis for pig-culling that eventually stopped the outbreak. NiV targeted medium-sized and small blood vessels resulting in endothelial multinucleated syncytia and fibrinoid necrosis. Autopsies revealed disseminated cerebral microinfarctions resulting from vasculitis-induced thrombosis and direct neuronal involvement. The discovery of NiV in the urine and saliva of Malaysian <b>Island</b> <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (Pteropus hypomelanus and Petropus vampyrus) implicated these as natural reservoir hosts of NiV. It is probable that initial transmission of NiV from bats to pigs occurred in late 1997 /early 1998 through contamination of pig swill by bat excretions, as a result of migration of these forest fruitbats to cultivated orchards and pig-farms, driven by fruiting failure of forest trees during the El Nino-related drought and anthropogenic fires in Indonesia in 1997 - 1998. This outbreak emphasizes the need for sharing information of any unusual illnesses in animals and humans, an open-minded approach and close collaboration and co-ordination between the medical profession, veterinarians and wildlife specialists in the investigation of such illnesses. Environmental mismanagement (such as deforestation and haze) has far-reaching effects, including encroachment of wildlife into human habitats and the introduction of zoonotic infections into domestic animals and humans...|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{infectious}} diseases involving zoonosis have become important global health problems. The 1998 outbreak of severe febrile encephalitis among pig farmers in Malaysia {{caused by a}} newly emergent paramyxovirus, Nipah virus, is a good example.

The clinical presentation includes segmental myoclonus, areflexia, hypertension, and tachycardia, and histologic evidence includes endothelial damage and vasculitis of the brain and other major organs. Magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated the presence of discrete high-signal-intensity lesions disseminated throughout the brain. Nipah virus causes syncytial formation in Vero cells and is antigenically related to Hendra virus.

40|$|Fruit bats provide {{valuable}} pollination services to humans through a unique coevolutionary relationship with chiropterophilous plants. However, chiropterophily in the Old World and the pollination roles of large bats, such as flying foxes (Pteropus spp., Acerodon spp., Desmalopex spp.), are still poorly understood and require further elucidation. Efforts {{to protect these}} bats have been hampered {{by a lack of}} basic quantitative information on their role as ecosystem service providers. Here, we investigate the role of the locally endangered <b>island</b> <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> Pteropus hypomelanus in the pollination ecology of durian (Durio zibethinus), an economically important crop in Southeast Asia. On Tioman Island, Peninsular Malaysia, we deployed 19 stations of paired infrared camera and video traps across varying heights at four individual flowering trees in a durian orchard. We detected at least nine species of animal visitors, but only bats had mutualistic interactions with durian flowers. There was a clear vertical stratification in the feeding niches of flying foxes and nectar bats, with flying foxes feeding at greater heights in the trees. Flying foxes had a positive effect on mature fruit set and therefore serve as important pollinators for durian trees. As such, semi-wild durian trees—particularly tall ones—may be dependent on flying foxes for enhancing reproductive success. Our study is the first to quantify the role of flying foxes in durian pollination, demonstrating that these giant fruit bats may have far more important ecological, evolutionary, and economic roles than previously thought. This has important implications and can aid efforts to promote flying fox conservation, especially in Southeast Asian countries. ...|$|E
40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need to {{identify}} and understand the ecosystem services of pollination and seed dispersal provided by threatened mammals such as flying foxes. The first step towards this is to obtain comprehensive data on their diet. However, the volant and nocturnal nature of bats presents a particularly challenging situation, and conventional microhistological approaches to studying their diet can be laborious and time-consuming, and provide incomplete information. We used Illumina Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) as a novel, non-invasive method for analysing the diet of the <b>island</b> <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus hypomelanus) on Tioman Island, Peninsular Malaysia. Through DNA metabarcoding of plants in flying fox droppings, using primers targeting the rbcL gene, we identified at least 29 Operationally Taxonomic Units (OTUs) comprising the diet of this giant pteropodid. OTU sequences matched at least four genera and 14 plant families from online reference databases based on a conservative Least Common Ancestor approach, and eight species from our site-specific plant reference collection. NGS was just as successful as conventional microhistological analysis in detecting plant taxa from droppings, but also uncovered six additional plant taxa. The island flying fox’s diet appeared {{to be dominated by}} figs (Ficus sp.), which was the most abundant plant taxon detected in the droppings every single month. Our study has shown that NGS can add value to the conventional microhistological approach in identifying food plant species from flying fox droppings. At this point in time, more accurate genus- and species-level identification of OTUs not only requires support from databases with more representative sequences of relevant plant DNA, but probably necessitates in situ collection of plant specimens to create a reference collection. Although this method cannot be used to quantify true abundance or proportion of plant species, nor plant parts consumed, it ultimately provides a very important first step towards identifying plant taxa and spatio-temporal patterns in flying fox diets...|$|E
40|$|Globally, island bats are {{vulnerable}} to subsistence hunting, with widespread population declines, local extirpations and extinctions. Bats {{are important to the}} ecological functioning of remote oceanic islands, and thus the sustainable management of hunting of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> Pteropus spp. is a conservation priority in the Pacific. In Solomon <b>Islands</b> people hunt <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> for bushmeat and their canine teeth, which are used as traditional currency. The value of teeth potentially increases hunting pressure on species of Pteropus. We interviewed 197 people on Makira Island to determine the nature of this use and how it may influence flying-fox populations. We asked questions to gather information about hunting practices, the value of canine teeth, utilization of traditional currency, and population trends of Pteropus. Flying-fox teeth remain highly valued on Makira. It is primarily the teeth of P. tonganus that are used rather than those of the smaller P. cognatus. Although <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> are not targeted solely for their teeth, this added value seemingly drives hunters to focus on P. tonganus. Hunting varied across five regions of Makira and high hunting pressure corresponded with perceived rarity of P. tonganus. Regions with low hunting pressure may be opportune locations to initiate flying-fox conservation on Makira...|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{their world}} distribution, fruit bats (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) play an {{extremely}} important role in forest ecology through seed dispersal and pollination. However, the recognition of their role in maintaining forest ecological diversity has been largely overshadowed {{by the fact that}} fruit bats are known to cause damage {{to a wide variety of}} cultivated fruits and, as a result, significant effort is undertaken to control fruit bat numbers in areas where crop damage frequently occurs. In Australia, fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (or <b>flying</b> <b>foxes)</b> are well known for their role in destroying valuable fruit crops, particularly along the east coast from Cairns to Sydney. Historical evidence suggests that <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> have been culled as an orchard pest in large numbers for the past 80 years. Uncontrolled culling both on-farm and in roosts coupled with extensive habitat destruction in the past century, has resulted in noticeable declines both in <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> distribution and local population numbers. In New South Wales, <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> have been 'protected' under the National Parks and Wildlife Act (1974) since 1986. From that time, fruitgrowers have been required to obtain a licence (referred to as an occupier's licence) from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) to cull <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> causing damage to fruit crops. However, despite the 'protected' status of the species, <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> continue to be culled in large numbers as an orchard pest. An examination of the management of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> in NSW, has shown that, between 1986 - 1992, fifteen NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service Districts issued a combined total of 616 occupier's licences to shoot <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> with an total allocation of over 240, 000 animals. In addition, most <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> are culled when the female is carrying her young under wing or when the young remain in the camp but continue to be dependent on her return for survival. Further evidence on the extent of culling includes a widely distributed fruitgrower survey with responses indicating that as few as 50 % of the fruitgrowers shooting <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> in NSW obtain the required licence from the National Parks and Wildlife Service. While the NPWS has undertaken research into the role of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> in seed dispersal and pollination, management effort largely continues to focus on resolving conflicts between fruitgrowers and <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> primarily by issuing culling permits to fruitgrowers. At present, there is no NPWS policy on the management of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> in NSW to guide the administration of the permit system. As a result, the process of issuing permits for <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> is largely inconsistent between NPWS Districts. The absence of comprehensive goals and objectives for the management of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> has resulted in the current situation where large numbers of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> are being culled both legally and illegally in the absence of any data on the impacts of unknown culling levels on local <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> populations. The NPWS has a statutory obligation to manage <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> consistent with the 'protected' status of the species in NSW and several well known principles of wildlife management. However, current management of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> in indicates that the Service may be in violation of the requirement to 'protect' and 'conserve' <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> as required under the National Parks and Wildlife Act (1974). This study recommends that licences issued to fruitgrowers to cull <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> be discontinued immediately and that adequate enforcement be engaged to reduce illegal shooting. This action should continue until such time that research on <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> populations is able to demonstrate that the culling of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> will not lead populations into decline. Furthermore, management effort should focus on the development of alternative strategies to reduce crop damage by <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> and provide incentives for growers to utilize existing control strategies such as netting...|$|R
