40|$|Planning was an {{activity}} to determine type {{and amount of}} drugs according to the need. Weakplanning was indicated by no stored drugs or drugs accumulation in the storage. <b>Drug</b> <b>planning</b> inGunung Mas district pharmacy storage (GFK) was based on inaccurate data; therefore, distortionin the <b>drug</b> <b>planning</b> precision and {{in the level of}} drug availability occurred. Objective of this studywas to evaluate <b>drug</b> <b>planning</b> at GFK Gunung Mas based on the obedience of GFK workers inimplementing <b>drug</b> <b>planning</b> guideline. This was a descriptive study. Study variables were 1) ability of workers that was based on theireducation, workload, training, and supervision; 2) obedience of workers in implementing <b>drug</b> <b>planning</b> guideline. Main informants were the head of GFK and two GFK workers. Data werecollected by conducting in-depth interview and observation. Content analysis was applied in thedata management. Results of the study showed that <b>drug</b> <b>planning</b> at GFK Gunung Mas was inadequate. This wascaused by insufficient number of workers with adequate abilities, and the obedience of workers inimplementing planning guideline was insufficient. Workers 2 ̆ 7 education level was suitable with therequirement namely pharmaceutical school. Majority of workers 2 ̆ 7 knowledge was limited to definitionand drug criteria; majority of GFK workers 2 ̆ 7 workload was overload. All workers did not get trainingon <b>drug</b> <b>planning.</b> Supervision by their superior was not done periodically. Obedience of workersto <b>drug</b> <b>planning</b> guideline was insufficient. Suggestions for district health office are to conduct training on integrated <b>drug</b> <b>planning</b> technique,to improve periodic supervision to GFK workers. Suggestions to GFK Gunung Mas are to formulatestandard operating procedure for <b>drug</b> <b>planning,</b> to do right drug calculation, to do ABC/ VEN analysis...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Sustainable {{values and}} {{implementation}} tools {{are now more}} widely included in Australian land use planning and development. <b>Planning</b> <b>agreements</b> are one instrument by which environmental values and preservation can be made more enduring, particularly as <b>planning</b> <b>agreements</b> run with the land. Little {{has been said about}} these agreements and {{the purpose of this paper}} is to strive to add to the body of knowledge in this area. The aim of this paper is to introduce a contextual framework for <b>planning</b> <b>agreements,</b> drawing on collaborative planning theory and practice. It also demonstrates how <b>planning</b> <b>agreements</b> can been used as a tool to preserve environmental values and principles generally, and more particularly the rich flora and fauna in the surrounding housing estate adjacent to the Royal Botanical Gardens in Cranbourne, Victoria, Australia. Design/methodology/approach - The paper relies on a case study from the municipality of Casey located in the state of Victoria and introduces measures taken, via <b>planning</b> <b>agreements</b> between the municipality and estate developers, to preserve green values and the flora and fauna located in the surrounds of the Royal Botanical Gardens in Cranbourne. Findings - The case study suggests that, whilst the <b>planning</b> <b>agreements</b> may have established excellent procedure and practice to preserve the flora and fauna at the botanic gardens and in its surrounds, the effectiveness of the <b>planning</b> <b>agreements</b> as an environmental preservation tool has limitations. This may be due to the lack of resources for more effective information dissemination and enforcement. Ultimately, it may have to be left to the goodwill of residents to ensure environmental protection of the botanic gardens and its surrounds is maintained...|$|R

40|$|Reference pricing (RP) limits <b>drug</b> <b>plan</b> {{reimbursement}} of interchangeable medicines to {{a reference}} price, which is typically {{equal to the}} price of the lowest-cost interchangeable drug; any cost above that is borne by the patient. Much of the evidence of the effects of RP comes from 'before and after' studies of the RP scheme adopted by Pharmacare, the publicly funded <b>drug</b> <b>plan</b> for seniors and others in British Columbia, Canada. We critically assess the identifying assumption inherent in the before and after design - namely, that pre-RP trends accurately predict counterfactual outcomes - in the context of estimating the impact of RP on Pharmacare's expenditure on anti-hypertensive drugs for its senior beneficiaries. We use similar data from a public plan that has not introduced RP to estimate the effects on drug expenditures of patent expiration, secular changes in prescribing patterns and various other factors common to all Canadian public <b>drug</b> <b>plans</b> that could potentially confound the before and after estimates of the effect of RP on <b>drug</b> <b>plan</b> expenditures. We find that controlling for such factors reduces estimates of <b>drug</b> <b>plan</b> savings attributable to RP of the Calcium Channel Blockers by about half.

40|$|In England, Since the 1970 s, {{a system}} of {{negotiated}} project-specific <b>agreements</b> between local <b>planning</b> authorities and developers/landowners has evolved into the sole mechanism by which part of land value uplift ‘released’ by the grant of planning permission is captured by government. In 2010, {{in an attempt to}} simplify and speed up the planning process – negotiated <b>planning</b> <b>agreements</b> were regarded as time-consuming and a brake on development – the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) was introduced. Originally intended as a simple flat rate charge to replace site-specific <b>planning</b> <b>agreements,</b> CIL now sits alongside that mechanism so that developers pay CIL to help fund infrastructure provision in the locality, whilst <b>planning</b> <b>agreements</b> help mitigate the impact of their development and provide affordable housing. The experience of running {{a system of}} negotiated <b>planning</b> <b>agreements</b> alongside a non-negotiable infrastructure levy offers an opportunity to evaluate these policy shifts in order to assess their strengths and weaknesses and whether there are any wider lessons for international discussions of best practice in land value capture. Drawing on survey findings the paper considers the implementation of CIL alongside <b>planning</b> <b>agreements,</b> the revenue and expenditure patterns, and the impact of these combined land value capture mechanisms on development activity and, in particular, on affordable housing supply...|$|R

40|$|Senator Kirby {{recommended}} {{that the federal government}} cover the "catastrophic" portion of drug costs incurred by <b>drug</b> <b>plans</b> that met certain minimum coverage requirements. Under the assumption that implementation of Kirby's proposal would result in every household not already in a qualifying plan being enrolled in such a plan, we estimate the benefits to households of different incomes, ages, and province of residence. We find that average immediate gains would be up to five times higher for households already covered by provincial government <b>drug</b> <b>plans</b> (seniors, low income) than for all other households. Of the $ 500 million gained by households, only about 8 percent would be contributed by the federal government. Hence, provincial governments with relatively non-comprehensive <b>drug</b> <b>plans</b> might not find the proposed federal assistance sufficiently attractive to upgrade their plans. ...|$|R

40|$|Selective {{contracting}} {{in health}} care involves contractual arrangements among insurers and health care providers that give covered individuals a financial incentive to obta{{in health care}} from a limited panel of providers. Although selective contracting {{has been an important}} strategy of health insurance plans for decades, it has only recently expanded to prescription <b>drug</b> coverage. <b>Drug</b> <b>plans</b> now create pharmacy networks that channel customers to in-network pharmacies. Pharmacies compete {{to be part of the}} networks by offering discounts on the drugs they sell to covered customers and <b>drug</b> <b>plans.</b> Although networks can lower prescription drug costs for <b>drug</b> <b>plans</b> and consumers, opponents have argued that they also reduce access to care because consumers can only visit certain providers. In this Article, I use the principles of economic theory, the conclusions of previous empirical studies, the determinations of the FTC, and proprietary data I obtained from the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the United States to analyze both the claims in support of pharmacy networks and the arguments against them. I find that pharmacy networks significantly lower the cost of prescription <b>drugs</b> for <b>drug</b> <b>plans</b> and consumers. Moreover, pharmacy networks have almost no effect on most consumers’ access to pharmacies; the overwhelming majority of consumers live near retail pharmacies that are included in exclusive pharmacy networks...|$|R
40|$|Company <b>Planning</b> <b>Agreements</b> are {{a form of}} {{government}} intervention designed to conform the planning of large companies more closely to {{the economic and social}} plans {{of government}}. It was argued in 1973 by Stuart Holland and others that a major reason why the 1965 National Plan failed to raise the rate of economic growth was that very large, usually multinational companies (which he called the meso economy) were not involved in the planning process and exercised the power to frustrate the Plan in pursuit of their own objectives, accordingly, they should be compelled to make <b>planning</b> <b>agreements.</b> In office, the 1974 Labour Government abandoned their intention of making <b>planning</b> <b>agreements</b> compulsory in face of strong opposition from business interests - and only two voluntary agreements were signed. With Labour in opposition from 1979, however the concept has continued to feature in The Alternative Economic Strategy (in several variants), but with less emphasis since the 1987 General Election. In this thesis the background of indicative planning from which the concept emerged is examined but it is also argued that the broader and longer-term social and cultural context and the role of interest groups in the political decision-making process must be understood if the concept and practicability of company <b>planning</b> <b>agreements</b> are to be assessed. Criteria for assessment are whether the concept is well designed to promote social justice and whether {{they are likely to be}} effective in practice. It is concluded that, although policies to promote competition are succeeding in fostering economic growth, <b>planning</b> <b>agreements</b> could still play a useful role in reducing unemployment and steering businesses towards other economic and social objectives...|$|R
