50|$|A wingsuit flight {{normally}} ends by deploying a parachute, {{and so a}} wingsuit can {{be safely}} flown from any point that provides sufficient altitude for flight and parachute deployment—normally a skydiving drop aircraft, or BASE-jump exit point such as a tall cliff or a safe mountain top. The wingsuit flier wears parachute <b>equipment</b> <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> skydiving or BASE jumping. While the parachute flight is normal, the canopy pilot typically unzips arm wings (after deployment) {{to be able to}} reach the steering parachute toggles and control the descent path.|$|E
30|$|Study {{on special}} {{microwave}} desulfurization equipment. Proper design of microwave desulfurization equipment is the decisive factor to achieve success. Making a survey on the microwave equipment currently used in coal desulfurization studies, some are microwave ovens {{used in our}} daily life and some are preferably modified ones while microwave output <b>equipment</b> <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> microwave desulfurization is less common. Therefore, special equipment shall be developed based on microwaves characteristics and microwaves transmission characteristics, which is significant to development of the microwave desulfurization technique.|$|E

40|$|The “Altitude SEE Test European Platform ” (ASTEP*) is {{dedicated}} to real-time soft-error rate (SER) testing of semiconductor memories. The platform, located in the French Alps on the “Plateau de Bure ” at 2552 m, has been operational since March 2006. This test facility includes a proprietary automatic test <b>equipment</b> <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> static memory (SRAM) testing and secured remote control operation via internet. Real-time SER measurements on 3. 6 Gbit of SRAMs manufactured in CMOS 130 nm technology are reported, {{as well as the}} comparison between real-time and accelerated SER. Finally, project perspectives for CMOS 65 nm SRAMs and real-time in situ neutron monitoring are presented. 1. Context and project milestone...|$|E
40|$|The Savannah River Site`s Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) near Aiken, South Carolina is the nation`s {{first and}} world`s largest {{vitrification}} facility. Following a ten year construction period and {{nearly three years}} of non-radioactive testing, the DWPF began radioactive operations in March 1996. Radioactive glass is poured from the joule heated melter into the stainless steel canisters. The canisters are then temporarily sealed, decontaminated, resistance welded for final closure, and transported to an interim storage facility. All of these operations are conducted remotely with <b>equipment</b> <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> these processes. This paper reviews canister processing during {{the first nine months}} of radioactive operations at DWPF. The fundamental design consideration for DWPF remote canister processing and handling equipment are discussed as well as interim canister storage...|$|E
