40|$|AbstractThe Pungar sub basin {{is located}} in the central part of South India. The geology is mainly {{composed}} of Archean crystalline metamorphic complexes. Increased population and intensive agricultural activity make it imperative to assess the quality of the groundwater system to ensure long-term sustainability of the resources. A total of 87 groundwater samples were collected from bore wells for two different seasons, viz., Pre monsoon and Post monsoon and analyzed for major cations and anions. Semi-arid climate, high evaporation rate and nutrient enrichment are the key features for EC enrichment. Higher 				NO 3 - and Cl− were observed in groundwater samples. The sources of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+ and K+ are from silicate weathering process. The facies demarcation suggests base exchanged hardened water. Gibbs plot suggests chemical weathering of rock forming minerals along with evaporation. The plot of (Ca 2 ++Mg 2 +) versus (				SO 42 -+HCO 3 -) suggests both ion exchange and reverse exchange processes. The plot of (				Na++K+) versus TZ+ shows higher cations via silicate weathering, alkaline/saline soils and residence time. The <b>disequilibrium</b> <b>index</b> for carbonate minerals point out influence of evaporation and silicate minerals favor incongruent dissolution. Mineral stability diagrams signify groundwater equilibrium with Kaolinite, Muscovite and Chlorite minerals. Comparison of groundwater quality with drinking standards and irrigation suitability standards proves that majority of water samples are suitable for drinking purpose. In general, water chemistry is guided by complex weathering process, ion exchange and influence of agricultural and sewage impact...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Plasmodium falciparum apical {{membrane}} antigen 1 (AMA 1) is {{a leading}} malaria vaccine candidate antigen. In the present investigation, for the first time, the almost full length of the ama 1 gene covering domain I (DI), DII and DIII was PCR amplified and sequenced in 21 P. falciparum isolates collected from the southeastern parts of Iran. The result showed the low genetic diversity of Iranian PfAMA 1 with 11 PfAMA 1 haplotypes in which nine out of 11 haplotypes are novel and have been reported for the first time. The Iranian P. falciparum population indicated a moderate level of genetic differentiation. The difference among the rates of non-synonymous and synonymous mutations, Tajima's D and McDonald-Kreitman tests suggested that the diversity at DI is due to positive natural selection. In addition, recombination contributes to the diversity of Iranian PfAMA 1 and this {{is supported by the}} decline of the linkage <b>disequilibrium</b> <b>index</b> R(2) with increasing the nucleotide distance. The highly polymorphic residues (positions: 187, 197, 200, 230 and 243) were polymorphic; however, most of the SNPs in non-polymorphic residues were conserved except the residue at position 395. Nevertheless, no mutation was found in the DII loop of the Iranian PfAMA 1, indicating that it is subjected to purifying selection. In conclusion, the low genetic diversity in PfAMA 1 among Iranian isolates supports and provides valuable information {{for the development of a}} PfAMA 1 -based malaria vaccine...|$|E
40|$|GeochemicaJ {{models are}} useful to {{calculate}} the distribution and activities of mineral species present in groundwater. The study area Salem district is underlain by Archaean crystalline metamorphic complex. Normally the groundwater occurs up {{to a depth of}} 300 m below ground level. So groundwater is exploited using compressor fitted purripsets. As the groundwater is saturated with calcium carbonate, the use of compressor air disturbs the equilibrium condition of calcium carbonate with groundwater and ultimately scale formation takes place in the delivery pipes. Generally oversaturated minerals tend to form as scales especially calcium carbonate. Groundwater from 60 locations were collected and analysed for major and minor ions. The geochemical model PHREEQE has been used to findout the <b>disequilibrium</b> <b>indices</b> of calcite along with other minerals.

The objetive {{of this study}} was to quantify the genetic {{diversity among}} 16 bovine racial subpopulations of Costa Rica, based on 1412 samples of bovine DNA from around the country, which were evaluated using 18 microsatellite markers. Average number of alleles (Na) per locus within breed was 10. 3, ranging from 8 (Holstein×Jersey) to 13 (Dual Purpose Creole). Average number of effective alleles (Ne) was 5. 04, ranging between 4. 18 (Jersey) and 5. 64, (Bos taurus×Bos indicu s). Average observed heterocigozity (Ho) was 0. 77, varying between 0. 73 (Jersey) and 0. 81 (Bos taurus×Bos indicus). Average expected heterocigozity (He) was 0. 78, oscillating between 0. 74 (Jersey and Holstein×Jersey) and 0. 81 (Bos taurus×Bos indicus, dual purpose Creole and dual purpose Crosses). The polymorphic information content (PIC) was 0. 76, ranging between 0. 71 (Jersey and Holstein×Jersey) and 0. 79 (dual purpose Creole and dual purpose crosses). Average FIS was 0. 02, ranging from - 0. 03 (Holstein×Jersey) to 0. 04 (Brahman, Beef Creole and Dairy crosses). Deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was not significant (p> 0. 05) for the majority of loci within racial subpopulations. Subgroup with the highest number of loci in disequilibrium was Jersey (8 loci), while subgroups Bos taurus×Bos indicus, Dairy Creole and Holstein×Jersey showed only 1 locus in <b>disequilibrium.</b> Fixation <b>indexes</b> FIS (0. 02), FIT (0. 05) and FST (0. 03) indicated some tendency towards homocigozity. The dendrograms showed 3 distinct racial groups that match races of Bos taurus, origin Bos indicus and their crosses. The results of the analysis indicated that the number of microsatellites used allowed to establish a clear discrimination at the level of the alelic frequencies and in the distribution of the size of aleles between the subpopulations of different species and even between pure races...|$|R
40|$|Aerobic {{capacity}} {{is a strong}} predictor of all-cause mortality and can influence many complex traits. To explore the biological basis underlying this connection, we developed via artificial selection two rat lines that diverge for intrinsic (i. e. inborn) aerobic capacity and differ in risk for complex disease traits. Here we conduct the first in-depth pedigree and molecular genetic analysis of these lines, the high capacity runners (HCR) and low capacity runners (LCR). Our results show that both HCR and LCR lines maintain considerable narrow-sense heritability (h 2) for the running capacity phenotype over 28 generations (h 2 = 0. 47 ± 0. 02 and 0. 43 ± 0. 02, respectively). To minimize inbreeding, the lines were maintained by rotational mating. Pedigree records predict that the inbreeding coefficient increases {{at a rate of}} < 1 % per generation, ~ 37 - 38 % slower than expected for random mating. Genome-wide 10 K SNP genotype data for generations 5, 14, and 26 demonstrate substantial genomic evolution: between-line differentiation increased progressively, while within-line diversity deceased. Genome-wide average heterozygosity decreased at a rate of < 1 % per generation, consistent with pedigree-based predictions and confirming the effectiveness of rotational breeding. Linkage <b>disequilibrium</b> <b>index</b> r 2 decreases to 0. 3 at ~ 3 Mb, suggesting that the resolution for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) can be as high as 2 - 3 cM. To establish a test population for QTL mapping, we conducted an HCR-LCR intercross. Running capacity of the F 1 population (n= 176) was intermediate of the HCR and LCR parentals (2...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Carbamazepine (CBZ) {{is used as}} {{the first}} line of {{treatment}} of Complex Partial Seizures (CPS) in the Epilepsy Clinic, Neurology Department of Kuala Lumpur Hospital (KLH). More than 30 % of the patients remain drug resistant to CBZ mono-therapy. CBZ is transported by the P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The P-gp encoded by the ABCB 1 and ABCC 2 genes are expressed in drug resistant patients with epilepsy. A few studies have shown significant association between CBZ resistant epilepsy and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) with adjacent polymorphisms of these genes. Our study is aimed at determining the correlation between patients ’ response to CBZ mono-therapy to Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms G 2677 T and C 3435 T of the ABCB 1 gene as well as G 1249 A and 224 C. T of the ABCC 2 gene. Method: 314 patients with CPS were recruited from the Neurology Department of the KLH based on stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, of whom 152 were responders and the other 162 were non-responders. DNA was extracted from their blood samples and Taqman technology for allelic discrimination was performed. Results were described as genotype frequencies. The SHEsis analysis platform was used to calculate linkage <b>disequilibrium</b> <b>index</b> and infer haplotype frequencies. Haploview was used to do permutation test to obtain a corrected p-value.

40|$|The genetic {{background}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is only partly understood, and several genes {{seem to be}} involved. The matrix metalloproteinases MMP 1 (interstitial collagenase) and MMP 3 (stromelysin 1) {{are thought to be}} important in destructive joint changes seen in RA. In the present study, functional relevant promoter polymorphisms of MMP 1 and MMP 3 were genotyped in 308 patients and in 110 controls, to test whether the polymorphisms contribute to the severity of the disease measured by radiographic progression of joint destruction. For comparison, the shared epitope of HLA DR 4 and DR 1 (SE) was determined by polymerase chain reaction. There was no association of MMP polymorphisms with susceptibility to RA. However, a strong linkage disequilibrium was observed between the 1 G/ 2 G (MMP 1) and the 5 A/ 6 A (MMP 3) polymorphisms (P << 10 - 6; linkage <b>disequilibrium</b> <b>index</b> D' = 0. 46). In factorial regression, the degree of radiographic joint destruction correlated significantly with the 1 G- 5 A haplotype (P = 0. 0001) and the interaction term 'estimated number of 1 G- 5 A haplotypes × duration of disease' (P = 0. 0007). This association was phasic, indicating that possession of the 1 G- 5 A haplotype has a protective effect over a period of about 15 years of RA, but might be associated with a more pronounced radiographic progression later on. Similar results were also found with the 1 G allele of MMP 1 alone (P = 0. 015) and with the interaction term 'estimated number of 1 G alleles × duration of disease' (P = 0. 014). The correlation of SE with the Ratingen score was comparable (0. 044). The regression model of MMP haplotypes explained 35 % of the variance of the radiographic score, whereas the SE explained 29 %. The 1 G- 5 A haplotype across the closely linked MMP 1 and MMP 3 gene loci is a newly described genetic factor strongly associated with the progression of joint damage in RA. Our findings suggest that there are haplotypes in a MMP cluster region that modify the joint destruction in RA in a phasic manner...|$|E
40|$|Since 2002, {{measurements}} of 222 Rn, 220 Rn activity and of CO 2 efflux in soil and fumaroles {{were carried out}} at several locations on Mt. Etna volcano. An empirical relationship links the 222 Rn/ 220 Rn ratio to the CO 2 efflux: deep sources of gas are characterized by high 222 Rn activity and high CO 2 efflux, whereas shallow sources are indicated by high 220 Rn activity and relatively low CO 2 efflux. This relationship is more constraining on the type and depth of the gas source than using the 222 Rn/ 220 Rn ratio alone. Since June 2006, periodical {{measurements of}} these parameters were carried out in 10 sites located over a surface of about 7 km 2 on the east flank of Mt. Etna (Zafferana village). The chosen area is characterized by anomalous diffuse degassing produced by fault-driven leakage of volatiles from a magma source whose depth is inferred at about 4 - 7 km below the surface. The sampling frequency varied between once a month to once every ten days. We studied the temporal variation of the ratio between CO 2 efflux and (222 Rn/ 220 Rn), that we define as a Soil Gas <b>Disequilibrium</b> <b>Index</b> (SGDI). Increases of this parameter occurred just {{before and during the}} 2006 eruptive period (July to December 2006), and {{at the onset of the}} March-May 2007 sequence of summit paroxysmal episodes. Furthermore, a slow increasing trend preceded by a few months the August-September 2007 summit activity of Etna, culminated with the September 4 th 2007 paroxysmal episode. Remarkable spike-like increases not associated with eruptions occurred on January 10 th, 2007, correlated with anomalous increases in volcanic tremor, and on June 20 th, 2007, linked with marked short-lived anomalies both in the ground deformation and in the gravimetric signals recorded by the INGV-Catania monitoring networks. The last increase in this geochemical index was recorded in late March 2008, correlated with a marked increase both in the volcanic tremor and in the plume SO 2 flux. This index looks very promising as a new tool for volcano monitoring, as it seem very sensitive to volcanic unrest...|$|E
40|$|Concurrent {{measurement}} of soil radon, soil thoron and soil CO 2 efflux {{is based on}} the method developed by Giammanco et al. (Geochem. Geophys. Geosys., 8 (10), Q 10001, doi: 10. 1029 / 2007 GC 001644, 2007). An empirical relationship links the 222 Rn/ 220 Rn ratio to the CO 2 efflux: deep sources of gas are characterized by high 222 Rn activity and high CO 2 efflux, whereas shallow sources are indicated by high 220 Rn activity and relatively low CO 2 efflux. This relationship is more constraining on the type and depth of the gas source than using the 222 Rn/ 220 Rn ratio alone. We studied the temporal variation of the ratio between CO 2 efflux and (222 Rn/ 220 Rn), that we define as a Soil Gas <b>Disequilibrium</b> <b>Index</b> (SGDI). Since June 2006, periodical measurements of the SGDI were carried out in ten sites located on the flanks of Mt. Etna, with sampling frequency of about ten days. Remarkable variations in this parameter were recorded during the period 2006 - 2008 likely associated with changes in the activity level of Mt. Etna. In particular, one of the sites located in the area called Primoti (on the lower east flank of the volcano) has shown significant anomalous changes of the SGDI in time, possibly correlated with the eruptive/tectonic activity. For this reason, in this site we set up an automatic monitoring station made of a Radon/Thoron monitor (model RTM 2100, SARAD GmbH, Germany) coupled with a soil CO 2 efflux station (model ACE, ADC BioScientific Ltd., UK). The sampling frequency was set at 30 minutes, in order to allow for a sufficient decay equilibration in the radon isotopes. Air temperature and barometric pressure were recorded as well, with the same sampling rate as for the soil gases. The site chosen for testing the monitoring station is located on the east flank of Mt. Etna at an altitude of about 520 a. s. l., in an area known for widespread diffuse emissions of CO 2 and other gases of magmatic origin. The preliminary data acquired so far showed an average soil CO 2 efflux of 10 g m 2 d 1 (std dev of about 7 g m 2 d 1) and average 222 Rn and 220 Rn activities of about 3. 3 103 Bq/m 3 (std dev of about 1140 Bq/m 3) and about 2. 0 103 Bq/m 3 (std dev of about 620 Bq/m 3), respectively. The corresponding values of the SGDI thus obtained varied in the range from about - 1. 5 to about 70. 1, with an average of about 7 and standard deviation of about 6. 3. The apparent baseline of the parameter is around the value of 3, and daily variations are clearly detected due to the combined influence of air temperature and barometric pressure. No clear influence from rainfall was observed. Some spikes were also detected, whose origin has to be studied by correlating the SGDI with other environmental parameters as well as with changes in the volcanic/tectonic activity of Mt. Etna...|$|E
