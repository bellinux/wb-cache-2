500|$|A {{muscle strain}} forced Mackin {{to miss a}} {{pre-season}} friendly against Shrewsbury Town in July 2008 and he returned to pre-season training later that month. He was shown a red card after picking up two yellow cards in his first appearance of 2008–09, which was Wrexham's first match in the Conference Premier, as they beat Stevenage Borough 5–0 at home on 9 August 2008. On reflection, Mackin said [...] "As for the second yellow I felt the ball was there to be won and I thought that's what I did. Looking back now I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have stayed on my feet". He was handed a one-match suspension and returned in a 1–1 draw away to Rushden & Diamonds on 17 August 2008. Mackin scored his first goal {{of the season with}} a 25-yard shot against Grays Athletic, which was Wrexham's only goal in a 2–1 away defeat on 20 September 2008. Despite starting the season as a regular in the team, he found opportunities hard to come by after the arrival of Dean Saunders as manager.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's only this. You <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{keep an eye}} {{on myself}} if I were you. There's nothing that gets a chap so barred here as side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you told}} mamma, perhaps {{she would let}} you stay,' {{returned}} Gillian. 'I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> hate it, worse than I do going to Rockstone and without you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah,--I wish <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{have said}} that I had seen every {{shilling}} that came into the house; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> nothing of this cheque,--whence it came." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{attachments}} are so. It is electricity--spontaneity. It is instantaneous. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{love you}} from the moment I saw you. Do you not feel it yourself?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But he can," [...] {{said the}} father. [...] "At any rate {{you can find}} out whether he will name a price. I'd go myself, but I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> quarrel with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{began to}} weep. [...] "There! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> hurt your feelings. But you mustn't mind what I say. I beg your pardon! I {{take it all}} back--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Bessy," [...] said Mrs. Glegg, [...] "if you'd {{exercise}} {{a little more}} thought, you might <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> hardly think it was worth while to unpin a bed, and go to all that trouble now, just at the end o' the time, when our house isn't above {{a quarter of an}} hour's walk from Mr. Deane's. She can come the first thing in the morning, and go back the last at night, and be thankful she's got a good aunt so close to her to come and sit with.

6000|$|She started, {{shaking her}} head saucily. ''Twas so slow there, and so broiling,' she called back, 'and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> only drift down to meet you, and could put in when I pleased.' ...|$|R
