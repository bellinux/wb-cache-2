Like methyltestosterone, ethyltestosterone is the parent compound of many AAS. Derivatives of ethyltestosterone include norethandrolone (ethylnandrolone, ethylestrenolone), <b>ethylestrenol</b> (ethylnandrol), norboletone, ethyldienolone, tetrahydrogestrinone, bolenol (ethylnorandrostenol), and propetandrol.|$|E

It is a 17α-ethylated derivative of nandrolone and lacks the 3-keto group. It was described in the literature in 1959 and approved in 1964 for testosterone deficiency in male patients.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} structure-activity relationships, the C17α cyanomethyl group of {{dienogest}} {{is responsible for}} its unique antiandrogenic instead of androgenic activity relative to other 19-nortestosterone progestins. A loss of ability to activate the AR is also seen with other testosterone derivatives with extended-length C17α substituions such as topterone (propyltestosterone) (compare to the AAS ethyltestosterone and methyltestosterone) and allylestrenol (compare to the AAS <b>ethylestrenol).</b>|$|E

50|$|Extension of the C17α alkyl chain {{longer than}} an ethyl group abolishes {{androgenic}} activity and converts the drug into an antiandrogen, as in topterone (17α-propyltestosterone) and allylestrenol (17α-allyl-3-deketo-19-nortestosterone) (an extended-chain variant of <b>ethylestrenol).</b> Conversely, {{replacement of the}} C17α alkyl group with an ethynyl group greatly reduces but does not abolish androgenic activity, as in ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone). Similarly to extension of the C17α alkyl chain, extension of the C17α ethynyl chain abolishes androgenic activity, as with dimethisterone (6α,21-dimethylethisterone). Dienogest, which is antiandrogenic, features extension of the C17α chain {{in the form of}} a cyanomethyl group at the C17α position.|$|E
50|$|Desoxymethyltestosterone {{is unusual}} {{in that it is}} {{structurally}} a 2-ene compound, lacking the 3-keto group present in almost all commercial AAS (with <b>ethylestrenol</b> being a notable {{and one of the few}} exceptions). This does not mean it is a weak compound, and clinical research has determined that it is a fairly potent oral agent. Rat studies indicate that desoxymethyltestosterone has an anabolic effect 160% that of testosterone while being only 60% as androgenic, giving it a Q ratio of 6.5:1. Because of this favorable ratio, experiments in orchiectomized rats have demonstrated that treatment with desoxymethyltestosterone resulted only in a stimulation of the weight of the levator ani muscle; the prostate and seminal vesicle weights remained unaffected leading the authors of one study to characterize desoxymethyltestosterone as a powerful AAS with attributes of a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) and some indication of toxicity.|$|E

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of {{the illegal}} growth promoter <b>ethylestrenol</b> (EES) was evaluated in bovine liver cells and subcellular fractions of bovine liver preparations. Incubations with bovine microsomal preparations revealed that EES is extensively biotransformed into norethandrolone (NE), another illegal growth promoter. Furthermore, incubations of monolayer cultures of hepatocytes with NE indicated that NE itself is rapidly reduced to 17 α-ethyl- 5 β-estrane- 3 α, 17 β-diol (EED). In vivo tests confirmed that, after administration of either EES or NE, EED is excreted as a major metabolite. Therefore, it was concluded that, both in urine and faeces samples, EED {{can be used as}} a biological marker for the illegal use of EES and/or NE. Moreover, by monitoring EED in urine or faeces samples, the detection period after NE administration is significantly prolonged.

In order to unravel specific metabolic steps and to identify possible biological markers, two in vitro liver models were used, i. e. monolayer cultures of isolated hepatocytes and liver microsomes, both prepared from liver tissue of cattle. Clostebol, boldenone, norethandrolone (NE) and <b>ethylestrenol</b> (EES) were used as model substrates. Results show that the metabolic profiles derived from in vitro experiments are predictive for the in vivo metabolic pathways of the steroids evaluated in this study. By means of this strategy, it is possible to identify 17 α-ethyl- 5 β-estrane- 3 α, 17 β-diol (EED) as a common biological marker for NE and EES. By in vivo experiments it was shown that EED is particularly important for the detection of the abuse of NE or EES because of its high excretion levels and its prolonged presence as compared with the parent compounds or any other metabolite...|$|E

Part A The microbial transformation of nine bioactive steroidal compounds was performed. This includes transformation of tibolone (51), 3 B-hydroxytibolone (65), 3 a-hydroxytibolone (66), E- guggulsterone (71), dehydroepiandrosterone (82), cortexolone (90), pregnenolone acetate (101),ethylestrenol (107), and nandrolone (110).

Twenty five metabolites were found to be new on the basis of detailed spectral analyses. Incubation of tibolone (51) with plant pathogen Rhizopus stolonifer, Fusarium lini, Cunninghamella elegans and Gibberilla fujikuroi was carried out, leading to the identification of twelve new and one known metabolites 52 - 64.
