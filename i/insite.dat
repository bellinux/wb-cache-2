25|$|In April 2010, {{the release}} of Apple's iPad tablet {{computer}} had {{a negative impact on}} Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs. Dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android. The Dell Streak tablet, introduced in 2010, was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated operating system, numerous software bugs, and low resolution screen. InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers. Dell responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets. Dell also went on an acquisition spree in 2010-2011, acquiring companies in the storage and software markets including Boomi, Exanet, <b>InSite</b> One, KACE, Ocarina Networks, Scalent, Compellent, SecureWorks, RNA Networks, and Force10 Networks.|$|E

In 2001, he merged the means of his instruments with the purpose of the projections in his Tijuana Projection executed for <b>InSite</b> 2000. In this public intervention, women working in the “maquiladora” industry of Tijuana, Mexico wore media technology designed to project their faces onto El Centro Cultural as they spoke emotionally of incest, police abuse, and work place discrimination in real time. As participants, their parrhesiastic speech was courageously offered at great risk to themselves for the purpose of moral and political change. Through the video projections, Wodiczko continues to develop the potential for aesthetic practice to effect social change as part of a wider discourse on agonistic pluralism prompted by such influences as Chantal Mouffe and Ludwig Wittgenstein.|$|E
25|$|Reeve's first role after 1978's Superman was as Richard Collier in the 1980 romantic fantasy Somewhere in Time. Jane Seymour played Elise McKenna, {{his love}} interest. The film was shot on Mackinac Island in mid-1979 and was Reeve's {{favorite}} film ever to shoot. After {{the film was}} completed, the plan was for a limited release and to build word of mouth, but early test screenings were favorable and the studio decided on a wide release, which ultimately {{proved to be the}} wrong strategy. Early reviews savaged the film as overly sentimental and melodramatic and an actors' strike prevented Reeve and Seymour from doing publicity. The film quickly closed, although Jean-Pierre Dorléac was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design in 1980. The film, commercially unsuccessful, was Reeve's first public disappointment. Almost 10 years after Somewhere in Time was released it became a cult film, thanks to screenings on cable networks and video rentals; its popularity began to grow, vindicating the belief of the creative team. <b>INSITE,</b> the International Network of Somewhere in Time Enthusiasts, did fundraising to sponsor a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1997 for Reeve. Jane Seymour became a personal friend of Reeve and in 1996 named one of her twin sons Kristopher in his honor.|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} ecology of sandy beaches {{has been largely}} ignored in comparison to rocky shores, even though sandy beach fauna may be abundant, and of considerable economic and ecological significance. I used ecological and genetic techniques to investigate aspects of the ecology, life history and levels of exploitation of the surf clam or pipi, Donax deltoides. My data, obtained from sampling pipis from five beaches over five years, highlight spatio-temporal variability in the distribution and abundance of Donax deltoides across all temporal and spatial scales. Within site variability was usually as high as between site or between time variability. Densities could vary by several orders of magnitude over spatial scales as small as 10 - 20 m. At least some of this variability {{can be attributed to}} the fact that Donax deltoides is highly mobile. Size classes were commonly missing from samples, with both medium and larger sized animals effectively missing on 27 % of sampling days, although smaller animals were present in 95 % of samples. This is a reflection of mobility rather than mortality, as size classes appeared or disappeared at very short temporal scales (days). Different size classes often occupied different heights on the shore, and the zone occupied by the different size classes varied over time. While small and medium pipis were most likely to be located in the swash (in 72 % and 48 % of samples respectively), large pipis were equally likely to be located in the swash (32 %), intertidal (38 %) or subtidal zone (30 %). The distribution pattern of different size groups was not consistent across short temporal scales (days) or across spatial scales of a few kilometres. This study underlines the inadequacy of the single transect approach adopted many workers. For smaller animals initial growth was rapid, from 6 mm to 30 mm within 4 - 8 months, and growth was asymptotic. Growth rates were fairly consistent both between and within regions. Pipis appeared to reach 37 mm in 37 mm <b>insites,</b> at which size 50 % were sexually mature. Growth clearly slowed with size. Mortality varied both between and within sites, with few large animals found at some sites. Recruitment patterns were consistent both between and within sites. Reproductive data, derived from a variety of sources including gonad smears, condition indices, oocyte diameters and stereology, revealed that the spawning pattern of Donax deltoides was poorly defined. I found considerable variation in the timing of reproduction from year to year, both among individuals and among years. The size at which pipis can be defined as fully mature was consistent both between sites and among years. Gonad smears indicated that at least 50 % of pipis were mature by 37 mm in length, with gametes being found in animals as small as 27 mm. Populations at two widely separated locations showed prolonged spawning, with some peaks in activity. At both sites, mature females (≥ 37 mm) contained apparently mature eggs nearly all year. The number of eggs held per female was low, but overall fecundity is likely to be high as females released eggs over a long period. A consequence of such a prolonged spawning period was the presence of recruits beaches all year round, however juvenile mortality was high and large numbers of recruits did not go on to establish detectable cohorts. Cohorts only established between July and December during this study at all sites. I found consistent recruitment even on beaches where there were very few adults, indicating that there was not a strong stockrecruitment relationship in this species. This finding was supported by electrophoretic data, suggesting that local populations of pipis on the east coast of Australia are strongly connected and form a single fishery. I surveyed patterns of allelic variation within 12 samples of pipis from beaches separated by up to 1200 km along the east Australian coast, influenced to varying degrees by the East Australian Current. On the east coast of Australia the erratic nature of this current, the formation of closed rip cells which limit the circulation of water offshore from surf beaches, and the turbulent nature of the surf zone itself (which may lower fertilisation success) might be expected to restrict larval dispersal and make the supply of recruits variable. However I found no evidence of population subdivision, with little genetic variation among all samples (FST = 0. 009), among geographic regions (FRT = 0. 001), or among samples (FSR = 0. 010). These data imply that larvae are moving between regions and that levels of present or recent gene flow are high. I found no accumulation of rare alleles at either extreme of the distribution studied, which suggests that gene flow is bidirectional. I found large differences between harvesting patterns in the recreational and commercial pipi fisheries, implying that the sectors may have very different impacts on local pipi stocks, even though both fisheries were restricted solely to hand gathering. I estimated the catch from Stockton Beach on the mid-north coast, which accounts for half of the total catch of pipis in NSW. I found a combined recreational and commercial catch of pipis of 237. 7 tonnes during the period March 1996 to February 1997 inclusive, taken in a total of 120, 672 collector hours. The commercial fishery was characterised by a relatively large catch, low fishing effort, and high catch rate. In contrast, the recreational fishery was characterised by a relatively small catch, high fishing effort, and very low catch rates. Recreational fishers took 20 % of the combined commercial and recreational catch on Stockton Beach, but accounted for 89 % of the fishing effort, with an estimated 15, 795 parties participating. The majority of recreational harvesters were collecting for food, rather than bait. I also compared the recreational harvest at Stockton Beach with that of Seven Mile Beach on the south coast of NSW. I found clear differences in the recreational catch between the north and south coasts of NSW, with extremely low catch rates in the south. In general my data fit with life history predictions for an outcrossing planktotrophic species in a variable environment. Pipis became sexually mature at an early age, produced large numbers of small eggs, and had low but variable reproductive effort. Year round spawning may mitigate the effects of a stochastic environment, particularly if spawning in Donax deltoides is in response to oceanographic triggers. Prolonged partial spawning may be a form of bet-hedging in exposed environments with changing environmental conditions...|$|R

The trial judge rejected Insite's interjurisdictional immunity argument, noting instead the primacy of double aspect in Canadian constitutional law. However, the trial judge found that s 4(1) and 5(1) of the CDSA violated Insite's s 7 Charter rights because they [...] "arbitrarily prohibited the management of addiction and its associated risks", and they could not be saved by s 1 of the Charter. The trial judge thus granted <b>Insite</b> a constitutional exemption and issued a suspended declaration of invalidity regarding s 4(1) and 5(1) of the CDSA.|$|E
