50|$|Boron {{trioxide}} (or <b>diboron</b> <b>trioxide)</b> {{is one of}} the oxides of boron. It is a white, glassy solid {{with the}} formula B2O3. It is almost always found as the vitreous (amorphous) form; however, it can be crystallized after extensive annealing (that is, under prolonged heat).|$|E
5000|$|Frits are {{indispensable}} {{constituents of}} most industrial ceramic glazes which mature at temperatures below 1150 °C. Frits are typically intermediates {{in the production}} of raw glass, as opposed to pigments and shaped objects, but they can be used as laboratory equipment in a number of high-tech contexts. Frits made predominantly of silica, <b>diboron</b> <b>trioxide</b> (B2O3), and soda are used as enamels on steel pipes. Another type of frit {{can be used as a}} biomaterial, which is a material made to become a part of, or to come into intimate contact with, one or more living organisms. Molten soda-lime-silica glass can be [...] "poured into water to obtain a frit", which is then ground to a powder. These powders can be used as [...] "scaffolds for bone substitutions". Also, certain frits can be added to high-tech ceramics: such frits are made by milling zinc oxide (ZnO) and boric acid (H3BO3) with zirconium (Zr) beads, then heating this mixture to 1100 °C, quenching it, and grinding it. This frit is then added to a lithium titanate (Li2TiO3) ceramic powder, which enables the ceramic to sinter at a lower temperature while still keeping its “microwave dielectric properties." [...] Sintering is the high temperature fusing together of powder to form a solid, usually porous, material. In laboratory and industrial chemical process equipment, the term frit denotes a filter made by the sintering-together of glass particles to produce a piece of known porosity referred to as fritted glass. The word is also used in a looser sense to denote a filter of any composition (for example, stainless steel, polyethylene) that is substituted where a frit of glass may otherwise have been used.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to report {{measurements}} on dilute Cu-B alloys at 1723 K using a new four-phase equilibrium technique. The method can be considered as an extension of the conventional procedure involving metal-slag-gas equilibration, where the gas phase containing carbon monoxide is pre-equilibrated with graphite to define the carbon and oxygen chemical potentials. Under the reducing atmosphere, liquid <b>diboron</b> <b>trioxide</b> $(B_ 2 O_ 3) $ is partially reduced by graphite generating a liquid Cu-B alloy and carbon monoxide at controlled pressure. After quenching to room temperature, the concentration of B in the liquid copper is measured. The equilibrium boron concentration in copper is measured as a function of the partial pressure of carbon monoxide in the gas phas...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents a}} computational account of strong and exothermic interaction of atomic and molecular oxygen with the α(001) B 12 surface of boron. Physisorbed oxygen interacts weakly with the surface, but the dissociative chemisorption entails considerable exothermicity {{in the range}} of 2. 47 - 3. 45 eV, depending on the adsorbed sites of the two oxygen atoms. Nonetheless, rupture of dioxygen on the surface involves a sizable intrinsic reaction barrier of 3. 40 eV (at 0 K). Such high amount of energy clearly explains the chemical inertness (i. e., the lack of oxidation) of boron at room temperature. However, elevated temperature encountered in real applications of boron, such as cutting machinery, overcomes the high-energy barrier for the dissociative adsorption of molecular oxygen (3. 40 eV). A stability T-P phase diagram reveals the spontaneous nature of the substitutional O/α(001) B 12 adsorption modes that lead to the formation of <b>diboron</b> <b>trioxide</b> (B₂O₃) at temperatures and pressure pertinent to practical applications. This finding conclusively collaborates the experimental observation of the formation of the B₂O₃ phase from adsorption of oxygen on boron. Finally, charge analysis provides an atomic-scale probe for the predicted stability ordering of the considered O/α(001) B 12 configurations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Diboron</b> <b>trioxide</b> (B 2 O 3) assumes {{critical}} importance {{as an effective}} oxidation inhibitor in prominent chemical applications. For instance, it has been extensively used in electrolysis and ceramic/glass technology. Results are presented of accurate quantum mechanical calculations using the PW 1 PW hybrid HF/DFT functional of four low-index surfaces of the low-pressure phase of B 2 O 3 : (101), (100), (011), and (001). Bond lengths, bond angles, and net Mulliken charges of the surface atoms are analyzed in detail. Total and projected density of {{states as well as}} surface energies are discussed. The occurrence of tetrahedral BO 4 units on the lowest energy structures of two of these surfaces has been demonstrated for the first time. The corresponding surface orientations incur larger energies in reference to the two orientations featuring only BO 3 units. All of the four investigated lowest energy structures have no dangling bonds, which reasonably relates to the experimentally observed low reactivity of this compound. Findings in this paper pave the way for potential interest in the perspective of future studies on the surfaces of amorphous B 2 O 3, {{as well as on the}} hydroxylation of both crystalline and amorphous B 2 O 3...|$|E
