40|$|Recent {{research}} documents {{a significant}} increase in U. S. transitory income variance over the past 25 years. An emerging literature explores the role of durables in the household's attempt to smooth consumption over these movements in transitory income. This paper examines the degree to which homeowners adjust their <b>home</b> <b>maintenance</b> decisions in order to offset transitory income fluctuations. American Housing Survey data show that <b>home</b> <b>maintenance</b> expenditures are economically significant, amounting to nearly $ 2, 100 per year. We find a statistically significant positive elasticity of maintenance expenditures to estimated transitory income changes. However, the results suggest that adjusting <b>home</b> <b>maintenance</b> expenditures plays a relatively minor role in the household's overall consumption smoothing strategy. In terms of actual dollars, deferred <b>home</b> <b>maintenance</b> offsets on average from 1 to 7 cents of each dollar of transitory income loss.

40|$|<b>Home</b> <b>maintenance</b> has a {{substantive}} {{social and economic}} role to play for households, in particular for homeowners. The question is which factors determine the organizational way in which households provide for <b>home</b> <b>maintenance.</b> At a level of pure types they have the choice between three options: either they commission the job formally, or they outsource it to an underground contractor, or they finally can do the maintenance work themselves. The prevalence of off-the-books contracts is high in <b>home</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Previous {{research shows that the}} choice for informal outsourcing is strongly dependent on the technical complexity of the job and on social and cultural resources of the household. The question addressed in this paper is what explains the persistence of informal outsourcing. Given the open nature of market exchanges, we look for elements that push households to repeat the informal contracting of <b>home</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and factors that make them change their idea about the preferred method of <b>home</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The analysis is based on questionnaire data collected from households that undertook maintenance jobs in their house. Multilevel ordinal and logistic regression analyses of these questionnaire data account for (1) the intention to repeat informal contracting and (2) the satisfaction with a previous maintenance job. The model focuses on features of the jobs (cost, complexity, duration) and of the household (ownership, social capital as a normative enforcer). These factors are expected to explain satisfaction of informal services, and account for the intention to outsource informally again. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|With declining {{capital grant}} {{expenditure}} and ageing and deteriorating UK private sector housing conditions, policy makers at {{national and local}} level are charged with finding new ways forward in encouraging home-owners to maintain their homes before they fall into disrepair. This is more economical to both home-owners and the state. However, the situation is complicated by a culture that seems to lack initiative to invest in <b>home</b> <b>maintenance.</b> This is {{for a variety of}} reasons, which include rapidly rising house-prices, often regardless of condition in some areas, and the inability of low income home-owners to be able to afford, or in some cases, to understand, the importance of regular maintenance. This paper explores literature relating to the history of housing grants, existing <b>home</b> <b>maintenance</b> initiatives and new requirements under The Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance) (England and Wales) Order 2002 and supporting Renewal Guidance (ODPM, 2002).

Many types of maintenance are [...] "Do it yourself" [...] (DIY) projects. Maintenance {{is not necessarily the}} same as home improvement, although many improvements can result from repairs or maintenance. Often the costs of larger repairs will justify the alternative of investment in full-scale improvements. It may make just as much sense to upgrade a home system (with an improved one) as to repair it or incur ever-more-frequent and expensive maintenance for an inefficient, obsolete or dying system. For a DIY project, also useful is the established limits on time and money investments before a repair (or list of repairs) become overwhelming and discouraging, and less likely to ever be completed.|$|R
