He arrives at the ballpark to watch the game, but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home {{by one of his}} friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} end of the bridge, M-26 turns east while US41 turns west into Hancock. M-26 passes through Ripley at the base of the Mt. Ripley Ski Area before turning north to Dollar Bay on the shore of the heavy {{polluted}} Torch Lake. Next are the twin communities of Lake Linden and Hubbell. M-26 forms the main streets of these as it passes north from Hubbell into Lake Linden. The highway then runs back to the west to rejoin US41 in Calumet. US41/M-26 connects with the northern end of M-203 on the north side of town before <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Keweenaw County. In the town of Phoenix, M-26 separates from US41 one last time, turning west for a stretch along the northern shoreline of the Keweenaw Peninsula. It passes through the communities of Eagle River (county seat of Keweenaw County) and Eagle Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Steered by {{currents}} {{from an area}} of {{high pressure}} to the north, the storm began to drift northwestward and rapidly deepen over warm waters of the Gulf. It executed a tight counterclockwise loop, and continued to mature; on October 16 it reached peaked winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) with a minimum barometric pressure of 924 mbar (hPa; 27.29 inHg). The hurricane turned northeastward, again approaching western Cuba, and began to accelerate towards the Florida Peninsula on October 17. Its center passed west of Key West and made landfall near Cape Romano. The storm moved due north for a time as it moved inland, and deteriorated into a tropical storm. From northeastern Florida, the cyclone curved northeastward and hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeast United States before <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea. The storm is estimated to have dissipated on October 23.|$|E

5|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} Hispaniola rapidly {{weakened}} {{the system to}} a tropical storm early on September4. Moving westward over the Caribbean Sea, the storm failed to re-strengthen before making landfall in western Cuba with winds of 40mph (65km/h) around midday on September6. Thereafter, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico and curved northeastward. At 09:00UTC on September9, the storm again made landfall near Bradenton, Florida with winds of 45mph (75km/h). Later that day, the storm weakened to a tropical depression while crossing Florida. Upon emerging into the Atlantic Ocean on the next day, the system re-intensified into a tropical storm. While located offshore South Carolina, the storm re-attained hurricane status early on September12. The hurricane then brushed the Outer Banks of North Carolina before <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea. The storm further strengthened to Category2 intensity, heading eastward, but weakened to a tropical storm early on September16. The following day, the storm deteriorated further to a tropical depression, and late on September17, the depression dissipated southwest of the Azores.|$|E

25|$|To {{prevent the}} English {{contingent}} being intercepted at sea by the navy of Castile, the Portuguese monarch planned a naval blockade. In mid-July 1381, a Portuguese fleet {{under the command}} of João Afonso Teles de Menezes, 6th Count of Barcelos, sailed from Lisbon towards the mouth of the Guadalquivir river to prevent the passage of the Castilian fleet, which was anchored in Seville. At the same time, the fleet of Admiral Fernando Sánchez de Tovar sailed from its base in Seville, <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the Portuguese coasts. On 17 July, sailing in opposite directions, the two fleets sighted each other off the Algarve.|$|E

25|$|The {{final day}} of filming the pilot was Friday, November 22, 1963, {{the day of the}} {{assassination}} of President John F. Kennedy. The cast and crew found out about the assassination late that morning, Hawaii time. Between the filming of scenes, they crowded around a radio, listening to news bulletins. A reminder of the tragedy appears in the opening sequence of the show's first season, when the theme song is played.

25|$|Currently, {{the annual}} quota for the gray whale {{catch in the}} region is 140 per year. Pursuant to an {{agreement}} between the United States and Russia, the Makah tribe of Washington claimed four whales from the IWC quota established at the 1997 meeting. With the exception of a single gray whale killed in 1999, the Makah people have been prevented from hunting by a series of legal challenges, culminating in a United States federal appeals court decision in December 2002 that required the National Marine Fisheries Service to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. On September 8, 2007, five members of the Makah tribe shot a gray whale using high-powered rifles in spite of the decision. The whale died within 12 hours, sinking while <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea.|$|E
25|$|As the {{aircraft}} approached the MAC VOR from the north, the pilot turned right, <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea, 1.0 to 1.5nm {{before reaching the}} MAC VOR. This {{made it difficult to}} establish {{the aircraft}} on the proper outbound course, though this was eventually done. The aircraft began its descent on this outbound leg, but it failed to level off at the minimum altitude of 1,540 feet. At 2416:22, the last radar contact was recorded with the aircraft 200 feet below that altitude, still outbound, and still descending at 1,050 feet per minute. At 2418 (approximately 100 seconds after the last radar return) the pilot made his last call to the controller (who did not have radar), saying he had completed his base turn back to the airport. Investigators believe the aircraft hit the water very soon after that transmission.|$|E

In the quarter-finals, Aerts was drawn against Rob van Esdonk whom he had {{defeated}} in the Netherlands six months earlier. Van Esdonk knocked Aerts down in round one but Aerts was able to come back and KO him with a right high kick. In the semis, he faced Patrick Smith, an American with a wild, aggressive style. Aerts was still able to handle him, however, and KO'd him just over one minute into the first round. Progressing into the final, he came up against Masaaki Satake for the second time. Aerts simply landed more powerful and a larger amount of strikes on Satake en route to a unanimous decision (27-25, 30-25, 30-29) victory. This made him the 1994 K-1 World Grand Prix Champion.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{people at}} the {{forefront}} of the wokou activities were merchants whose trade overseas were deemed illegal by the Ming government. Since the Ming government prohibited people from travelling <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea and forbid those who had from returning home, a large number of Chinese maritime merchants were forced to establish themselves on offshore islands or even overseas trading ports. Among the traders stationed overseas, of note were Xu Dong (許棟) and his brothers who began their fortunes in Malacca and Patani; and Wang Zhi and Xu Hai (徐海) who based themselves in the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. The Chinese traders in Kyushu had deep ties with the local daimyo, who provided patronage and refuge for the merchant-pirates in return for a share of their profits. For example, Xu Hai's right-hand man was described to the younger brother of the Satsuma lord Shimazu Takahisa, while his associate Chen Dong (陳東) held a high position in the Satsuma court as the chief of Shimazu's secretariat.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for {{the first}} {{adaptation}} of 3 Henry VI is found during the Restoration, when, in 1681, John Crowne created a two-part play entitled Henry the Sixth, The First Part and The Misery of Civil War. Henry comprised Acts 1–3 of 2 Henry VI focusing {{on the death of}} Gloucester, Misery adapted the last two acts of 2 Henry VI and much of 3 Henry VI. Writing at the time of Popish Plot, Crowne, who was a devout royalist, used his adaptation to warn about the danger of allowing England to descend into another civil war, which would be the case should the Whig party rise to power. Changes to the text include a new, albeit silent scene just prior to the Battle of Wakefield where York embraces Rutland before <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> fight; an extension of the courtship between Edward and Lady Grey, and the edition of two subplots; one concerning a mistress of Edward's whom he accidentally kills in battle (an allusion to Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher's Philaster), the other involving an attempt by Warwick to seduce Lady Grey after her husband's death at the Second Battle of St. Albans (this is later used as a rationale for why Warwick turns against Edward). Also worth noting is that the role of Margaret in 3 Henry VI was removed almost entirely, reducing her to two scenes; the death of York and the death of Prince Edward.|$|E

25|$|The final {{air attack}} mission (code-named Mad Dog Flight) {{comprised}} five B-26s, four {{of which were}} manned by American CIA contract air crews and pilots from the Alabama Air Guard. One FAR Sea Fury (piloted by Douglas Rudd) and two FAR T-33s (piloted by Rafael del Pino and Alvaro Prendes) shot down two of these B-26s, killing four American airmen. Combat air patrols were flown by Douglas A4D-2N Skyhawk jets of VA-34 squadron operating from USS Essex, with nationality and other markings removed. Sorties were flown to reassure Brigade soldiers and pilots, and to intimidate Cuban government forces without directly engaging in acts of war. At 10 am, a tank battle had broken out, with the brigadista holding their line until about 2:00 pm, which led Olvia to order a retreat into Girón. Following the last air attacks, San Román ordered his paratroopers and {{the men of the}} 3rd Battalion to launch a surprise attack, which was initially successful, but soon failed. With the brigadistas in disorganized retreat, the Cuban Army and militiamen started to advance rapidly, taking San Blas and only being stopped outside of Girón at about 11 am. Later that afternoon, San Román heard the rumbling of the advancing T-34s and reported with no more mortar rounds and bazooka rounds, he could not stop the tanks and ordered his men to fall back to the beach. Oliva arrived afterwards to find that the brigadistas were all <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the beach or retreating into the jungle or swamps. Without direct air support, and short of ammunition, Brigade 2506 ground forces retreated to the beaches in the face of considerable onslaught from Cuban government artillery, tanks and infantry.|$|E
500|$|The light {{aircraft}} carrier [...] was the operation control ship, and the flagship of Commodore Peter Gretton, the overall Naval Task Group commander.

Damage caused by a storm in the North Atlantic necessitated repairs in Kingston, Jamaica.

500|$|The {{second half}} of the album deals with various war-related issues. [...] While [...] "Southampton Dock" [...] is a lament to {{returning}} war heroes and other soldiers <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a likely death, [...] "Not Now John" [...] addresses society's ignorance of political and economic problems. [...] "Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert" [...] deals with Waters' feelings about war and invasion, and [...] "The Fletcher Memorial Home" [...] (the title is a nod to Waters' father) reflects a fantastical application of [...] "the final solution" [...] on a gathering of political leaders including Leonid Brezhnev, Menachem Begin and Margaret Thatcher. [...] The album's titular song deals with the aftermath of a man's isolation and sexual repression, as he contemplates suicide and struggles to reconnect with the world around him. [...] The album ends with [...] "Two Suns in the Sunset", a song that portrays a nuclear holocaust; the final result of a world obsessed with war and control.|$|E

500|$|The Avalanches have {{described}} the album as a [...] "road trip" [...] in a [...] "big, wide, expansive country like Australia." [...] For inspiration, the group looked back on their teenage years of driving {{around the country and}} suburbia listening to music. The record is supposed to [...] "capture that feeling of growing up...jumping in the car and hitting the road with a six-pack and <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the bush." [...] The album attempts to capture the [...] "halfway between happy and sad" [...] feeling similar to old Beach Boys records which are a constant inspiration for the group. Chater felt that this feeling is what made Since I Left You a success, and they have continuously strived to create that feeling. Di Blasi thinks of Wildflower as a free-spirited person who does what they wish regardless of conventionality. The album features many samples from 1960s psychedelic music and relates to the era through counterculture and anti-establishment themes.|$|E
500|$|The Earthquake Early Warning {{system was}} {{activated}} upon {{the detection of}} primary waves [...] seismic waves that forego an earthquake's perceivable ground motions [...] giving residents 6.8 seconds to seek cover before the main shock.

A warning for a localised tsunami of up to [...] was issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency; however, no significant waves were recorded, and the warning was cancelled soon thereafter. In response to the earthquake, the fire department dispatched search and rescue teams and emergency crews for relief efforts and damage assessments throughout the affected area. Six medical crews in pairs of two were also sent to Kanagawa, Chiba and Gunma prefectures. Former Prime Minister Naoto Kan postponed a press conference scheduled for 17:50 JST marking the one-month anniversary of the catastrophic Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.|$|E
500|$|The test {{series was}} given the secret codename [...] "Operation Grapple". Air Commodore Wilfrid Oulton was {{appointed}} task force commander, with the acting rank of air vice marshal from 1 March 1956. He had a formidable task ahead of him. Nearby Christmas Island was chosen as a base. It was claimed by both Britain and the United States, but the Americans were willing to let the British use it for the tests. With pressure mounting {{at home and abroad}} for a moratorium on testing, 1 April 1957 was set as the target date. Oulton held the first meeting of the Grapple Executive Committee on New Oxford Street in London on 21 February 1956. The RAF and Royal Engineers would improve the airfield to enable it to operate large, heavily loaded aircraft, and the port and facilities would be improved to enable Christmas Island to operate as a base by 1 December 1956. It was estimated that [...] of stores would be required for the construction effort alone. The LST [...] HMS Narvik would reprise the role of control ship it had for Operation Hurricane; but as it was also required for Operation Mosaic, it had very little time to return to the Chatham Dockyard for a refit before <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Christmas Island for Operation Grapple.|$|E
