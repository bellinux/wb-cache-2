5|$|Several actresses were {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Tatiana, including Italians Sylva Koscina and Virna Lisi, Danish actress Annette Vadim, and English-born Tania Mallet. 1960 Miss Universe runner-up Daniela Bianchi was ultimately cast, supposedly Sean Connery's choice. Bianchi started taking <b>English</b> <b>classes</b> for the role, but the producers ultimately chose to have her lines redubbed by British stage actress Barbara Jefford in the final cut. The scene in which Bond finds Tatiana in his hotel bed was used for Bianchi's screen test, with Dawson standing in, this time, as Bond. The scene later became the traditional screen test scene for prospective James Bond actors and Bond Girls.|$|E

25|$|In Hong Kong, {{because of}} its {{one and a half}} century British rule, many Hong Kong people will pick English names as early as {{attending}} <b>English</b> <b>classes</b> in kindergarten, or even have the English alias embedded in official documentation.
