By 2020, America's GDP might be only slightly larger than China's GDP. Together, the four BRICs may account for 41% of the world's market capitalization by 2030, the report said. In late 2010, China surpassed Japan's GDP for the first time, with China's GDP standing at $5.88 trillion compared to Japan's $5.47 trillion. China thus became the world's second-largest economy after the United States.|$|E
40|$|This paper, {{which is}} {{motivated}} by the literature on international asset pricing and recent work on exchange rate determination, investigates dynamic relationshiops between major currency and <b>equity</b> <b>markets.</b> Using a multivariate GARCH framework, we examine conditional cross- autocorrelations between pairs of national <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> and related exchange rates. This provides a parsimonious way of testing mean- volatility relationships in currency and <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> and re-examining the robustness of relationships between <b>equity</b> <b>markets,</b> while controlling for exchange rate effects. We find {{that the relationship between}} currency and <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> is bi-directional, significant, persistent, and independent of the relationship strictly between <b>equity</b> <b>markets,</b> and that it is better captured by the conditional second momentsinternational asset pricing, exchange rate determination, <b>equity</b> <b>markets,</b> relationships between currency and <b>equity</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R
40|$|While the {{importance}} of <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> {{as a vehicle for}} capital formation is well recognized, their role in providing economically valuable governance services, particularly to small and medium enterprises (SME), has not received much attention. The paper examines the role of public policy in promoting the governance role of secondary <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> for the benefit of SMEs. The paper first outlines the mechanisms through which <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> could promote good governance in small firms, showing that <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> serve as a monitoring and control conduit for outsiders to enforce good governance at the firm. It then establishes that the ability of <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> to deliver good governance is closely related to those markets’ liquidity, presenting further international evidence that firms supported by liquid <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> realize improved economic performance. Thus, the governance services of secondary <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> have real economic value to the firms. The paper then argues that public policy can {{have a positive impact on}} the effectiveness of <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> in delivering governance services through enhancing market liquidity. It examines the impact on market liquidity of two significant U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulatory reforms applied to The Nasdaq Stock Market: SEC’s ‘trade reporting’ rules of 1992, and SEC’s “order handling” reforms of 1997. The paper concludes that public policies that increase market transparency and efficiency [...] such as “trade reporting” requirements and better “order handling” rules [...] promote the effectiveness of the secondary <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> in delivering corporate governance through increased market liquidity...|$|R

40|$|This paper adopts the {{volatility}} index and Baker-Wurgler index as the U. S. financial market sentiment measures. Using monthly data from June 1965 to December 2010, we identify the causal relationships between sentiment {{and the performance}} of global <b>equity</b> <b>markets.</b> We include 23 G 20 market indices, 28 European indices, 25 Asia-Pacific indices, and 10 Americas indices, and employ Granger causality procedure to explore the linkages. We find that the international <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> are not greatly affected by the U. S. financial market sentiment. The type of extreme sentiment, whether it is optimistic or pessimistic, is irrelevant to its influential power. The <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> that are affected by {{the volatility}} index do not cluster in any region. In contrast, the majority of global <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> can Granger cause the U.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} whether, {{and to what}} extent, {{emerging market}} economies (EMEs) have systemic importance for global financial markets, above and beyond their influence during crises episodes. Using a novel database of exogenous economic and political shocks for 14 EMEs, we find that EME shocks not only have a statistically but also economically significant impact on global <b>equity</b> <b>markets.</b> The economic significance of EME shocks is in particular underlined by their remarkably persistent effects over time. Importantly, EMEs are found to influence global <b>equity</b> <b>markets</b> about just as much in "good" times as in "bad" times, i. e. during crises or periods of financial turbulence. Finally, we detect a large degree of heterogeneity in the transmission of EME shocks to individual countries’ <b>equity</b> <b>markets,</b> stressing the different degrees of financial exposure, which is relatively higher for European <b>equity</b> <b>markets.</b> global financial <b>markets,</b> <b>equity</b> <b>markets,</b> transmission, financial integration, shocks, news, emerging market economies, mature economics, euro area, United States...|$|R

25|$|ABS-CBN Corporation, {{commonly}} known as ABS-CBN, is a Filipino media and entertainment group based in Quezon City. It is the Philippines' largest entertainment and media conglomerate in terms of revenue, operating income, assets, <b>equity,</b> <b>market</b> capitalization, and number of employees. ABS-CBN was formed by the merger of Alto Broadcasting System and Chronicle Broadcasting Network. It was founded in 1946 by Jewish American electronics engineer James Lindenberg and Judge Antonio Quirino (the brother of the sixth Philippine President Elpidio Quirino) as Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). In 1952, BEC was renamed Alto Broadcasting System (ABS). Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN), on the other hand, was founded in 1952 by newspaper mogul Don Eugenio Lopez, Sr. and his brother Fernando Lopez (the Philippine Vice President for three terms from 1949 to 1953 and 1965 to 1973). The two companies were merged and incorporated as ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation on February 1, 1967, and renamed as ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010 to reflect the company's diversification. The common shares of ABS-CBN was first traded on the Philippine Stock Exchange in July 1992 under the ticker symbol ABS.|$|E
500|$|Although the post-boom years {{represent}} just a {{small fraction}} of the peak levels of venture investment reached in 2000, they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from 1980 through 1995.
