5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, <b>Government</b> <b>delegate</b> for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E

25|$|In Poland the communists, {{more active}} after the 1941 Nazi {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, and the right wing extremists, neither joined the broad coalition nor recognized the <b>Government</b> <b>Delegate.</b> The situation of the Polish armed resistance was made more difficult {{by the fact that}} the Allies now assigned Poland to the Soviet sphere of operations, and Britain refrained from or limited direct support of resistance movements in central-eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} the plot, Emilio Mola, had ordered the Army of Africa to revolt at 5 a.m. on July 18, but the plan was {{discovered}} by Republican officers of Melilla on July 17, and the {{leader of the}} plot in the city, Colonel Segui, decided to start the rising on Melilla and arrested General Romerales. The rebels seized the radio station and proclaimed the estado de guerra. The Legionnaries, the Regulares, and the Assault Guards in Melilla joined to the rising. Seizing key buildings, they crushed the resistance in the working class quarters. General Romerales, the major of Melilla, the <b>government</b> <b>delegate,</b> the aerodrome commander, Virgilio Lerez Ruiz, and all those who resisted the rebellion were shot. When General Morato discovered the rising, he took an airplane to Melilla, but he was arrested by the rebels as soon as he landed.|$|E

500|$|The communists {{refused to}} deal with the Underground State just like they refused {{to deal with}} the {{government}} in exile; its leaders and soldiers in [...] "liberated" [...] Polish territories were persecuted. A number of prominent leaders of the Underground State, including the <b>Government</b> <b>Delegate,</b> Jan Stanisław Jankowski and the last AK Commander-in-Chief, General Leopold Okulicki, who decided to reveal themselves and upon the Soviet invitation begun open negotiations with the communist authorities, were arrested and sentenced by the Soviets in Moscow in the infamous Trial of the Sixteen (arrests were carried out in March 1945, and the trial itself took place in June that year). On 27 June 1945 the Council of National Unity held its last session, issuing a 12-point declaration demanding that the Soviet army leave Poland and the repression of the non-communist political parties cease. The Government Delegate's Office at Home, restructured after the arrests of its leadership and headed by the last Delegate, Stefan Korboński, disbanded on 1 July, after the creation in Moscow of the Provisional Government of National Unity (Tymczasowy Rząd Jedności Narodowej, TRJN) on 28 June 1945. The disbanding of those structures marked the end of the Underground State.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the civil}} unrest in autumn 2005 put law {{enforcement}} in the spotlight again. Sarkozy was accused of having provoked the unrest by calling young delinquents from housing projects a [...] "rabble" [...] ("") in Argenteuil near Paris, and controversially suggested cleansing the minority suburbs with a Kärcher. After the accidental death of two youths, which sparked the riots, Sarkozy first blamed it on [...] "hoodlums" [...] and gangsters. These remarks were sharply criticised by many on the left wing and {{by a member of}} his own <b>government,</b> <b>Delegate</b> Minister for Equal Opportunities Azouz Begag.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Government</b> <b>Delegate</b> Jan Stanisław Jankowski, {{chairman}} of the Council of National Unity Kazimierz Pużak and thirteen other Polish Underground State leaders were invited to and on 27 March 1945 attended talks with General Ivan Serov of the NKVD. [...] They were all arrested and taken to Moscow to await a trial. The Polish communist Provisional Government and the Western leaders were not informed by the Soviets of the arrests. The British and the Americans were notified by the Polish government in exile. After the belated Soviet admission, they unsuccessfully pressured the Soviet government {{for the release of}} the captives. In June 1945, the Trial of the Sixteen was staged in Moscow. They were accused of anti-Soviet subversion and received lenient by Soviet standards sentences, presumably because of the ongoing negotiations on the formation of Polish government and Western interventions. Okulicki was condemned to ten years in prison.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1945 a staged {{trial of}} 16 {{leaders of the}} Polish Underground State, who had been {{captured}} and imprisoned by the Soviet Union took place in Moscow (the Trial of the Sixteen). [...] The <b>Government</b> <b>Delegate,</b> together with {{most members of the}} Council of National Unity and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armia Krajowa, were invited by Soviet general Ivan Serov, with the agreement of Joseph Stalin, to a conference on their eventual entry into the Soviet-backed Provisional Government. They were presented with a warrant of safety, but the NKVD arrested them in Pruszków on 27 and 28 March. [...] Leopold Okulicki, Jan Stanisław Jankowski and Kazimierz Pużak were arrested on the 27th and 12 more the following day. Alexander Zwierzynski had already been detained earlier. They were all taken to the Lubyanka prison in Moscow for interrogation prior to the trial. After several months of brutal interrogation and torture they were charged with false accusations of [...] "collaboration with Nazi Germany" [...] and of [...] "planning a military alliance with Nazi Germany".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944, as the Soviet forces {{approached}} Warsaw, the AK prepared an uprising in the city, {{with the intention of}} preventing a communist takeover of the Polish government. The supreme Polish commander in London General Sosnkowski was pessimistic about the uprising's chances and sent General Leopold Okulicki to Warsaw, instructing him not to allow the uprising to proceed. In Warsaw Okulicki soon developed ideas of his own and became the uprising's most ardent proponent, pushing for a quick commencement of anti-German hostilities. The government in exile approved the uprising and on 27 July Prime Minister Stanisław Mikołajczyk cabled Jan Stanisław Jankowski, the <b>government</b> <b>delegate,</b> authorizing an uprising proclamation at a moment chosen by the authorities in Warsaw. To some of the Polish underground commanders the German collapse and the entry of the Soviets appeared imminent, and the AK, led by Bór-Komorowski, launched the Warsaw Uprising on August 1. The insurgents' equipment and supplies would suffice for only several days of fighting and the uprising was planned to last no longer than that. On August 3 Mikołajczyk, conferring with Stalin in Moscow, announced an upcoming [...] "freeing of Warsaw any day now" [...] and asked for military help.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{military}} {{defeat of the}} Polish Army in September 1939, the Polish government itself never surrendered, instead evacuating West, where it formed the Polish government in Exile. The government in exile was represented in the occupied Poland by the Government Delegation for Poland, headed by the <b>Government</b> <b>Delegate</b> for Poland. The main role of the civilian branch of the Underground State was to preserve {{the continuity of the}} Polish state as a whole, including its institutions. These institutions included the police, the courts, and schools. [...] By the final years of the war, the civilian structure of the Underground State included an underground parliament, administration, judiciary (courts and police), secondary and higher level education, and supported various cultural activities such as publishing of newspapers and books, underground theatres, lectures, exhibitions, concerts and safeguarded various works of art. It also dealt with providing social services, including to the destitute Jewish population (through the Council to Aid Jews, or Żegota). Through the Directorate of Civil Resistance (1941–1943) the civil arm was also involved in lesser acts of resistance, such as minor sabotage, although in 1943 this department was merged with the Directorate of Covert Resistance, forming the Directorate of Underground Resistance, subordinate to Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa).|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} welfare and other {{consequences}} of tax policy {{in a third}} market export model where duopolists located in two countries compete in prices. With tax competition between governments, we allow for welfare-maximizing governments {{in the two countries}} to delegate tax setting responsibility to policy-makers who have different objectives than the governments. The unique equilibrium in the tax competition environment involves both <b>governments</b> <b>delegating</b> tax setting responsibility to tax revenue-maximizing policy-makers. This equilibrium yields higher welfare for both countries than the outcome when the <b>governments</b> <b>delegate</b> to welfare-maximizing policy-makers. The paper also compares tax competition with tax harmonization and shows that when the entire export market is served, tax harmonization improves the welfare of the country that houses the low cost firm, while the other country may be immiserized...|$|R
