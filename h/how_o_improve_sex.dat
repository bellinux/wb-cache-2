40|$|A quantum {{compiler}} is {{a software}} program for decomposing (“compiling”) an arbitrary unitary matrix into a sequence of elementary operations (SEO). The author {{of this paper is}} also the author of a quantum compiler called Qubiter. Qubiter uses a matrix decomposition called the Cosine-Sine Decomposition (CSD) that is well known in the field of Computational Linear Algebra. One way of measuring the efficiency of a quantum compiler is to measure the number of CNOTs it uses to express an unstructured unitary matrix (a unitary matrix with no special symmetries). We will henceforth refer to this number as ǫ. In this paper, we show <b>how</b> to <b>improve</b> <b>ǫ</b> for Qubiter so that it matches the current world record for ǫ, which is held by another quantum compiling algorithm based on CSD. 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{presence}} of molecular oxygen {{left in the}} voids of a deep geological repository of high level radioactive waste (HLW) after backfilling could affect the corrosion of canisters and the migration of radionuclides eventually released from a damaged canister. Knowing <b>how</b> <b>O</b> 2 is consumed is therefore important for safety analyses. Available data from laboratory and in situ experiments indicate that microbes play a substantial role to restore redox condition near the HLW repository. The REX in situ experiment was conducted at the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory by the Swedish Nuclear Waste Management Company to investigate microbial nutrients, organism diversity, microbial activity and O 2 reduction. This paper presents a hydro-bio-geochemical model to evaluate <b>how</b> <b>O</b> 2 is consumed after backfilling of a HLW repositor...|$|R

The issues are: <b>o</b> <b>How</b> are appropriate words chosen <b>o</b> <b>o</b> <b>How</b> is conciseness ensured? o When does choice stop? <b>o</b> <b>How</b> are patterns of lexicalization respected? <b>o</b> <b>How</b> are interactions among choices handled? <b>o</b> <b>How</b> are the correct pans of speech chosen? <b>o</b> <b>How</b> are words chosen to satisfy constituency? o What ensures that a word stands in the correct relation to its neighbors? <b>o</b> <b>How</b> is word order determined? o Are all words chosen in the same way? o In what order are the factors considered? This paper also discusses FIG, a generator which incorporates novel solutions to many of these issues. FIG violates common assumptions about the roles of modularity and grammar in generator design. Analysis of FIG leads to 4 principles for generator design, as follows: o Have an explicit representation {{of the status of}} the generation protess at each point in time. o Use a single, unified representation. o Do not rely on the details {{of the structure of the}} input. o Treat most choices as emergent...|$|R
