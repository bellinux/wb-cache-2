40|$|Proteoglycans: cell {{biologists}} {{have had a}} love-hate relationship with these molecules almost since their discovery. Their biochemical properties, dominated by heterogeneous and highly charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) 1 chains, can make purification challenging and structural analysis painful. Their ability to bind scores of growth factors, growth factor-binding proteins, extracellular proteases, protease inhibitors, extracellular matrix molecules, and other proteins takes the concept of molecular promiscuity to new heights. On top of this, they seem always to be underfoot, showing up on plasma membranes in {{hundreds of thousands of}} copies per cell and in extracellular matrices at milligram per milliliter concentrations. And yet despite these peculiarities (or perhaps because of them) proteoglycans have inspired an extraordinary range of models, theories, and speculation. Since the 1960 s, proteoglycans have been credited, in one system or another, with controlling the following: cell division, adhesion, spreading, migration, chemoattraction, axon guidance, matrix assembly, lipoprotein uptake, extracellular proteolysis, and viral entry. Do proteoglycans do all of these things? Progress on this question during the past decade has been recently <b>kicked</b> <b>into</b> <b>high</b> <b>gear</b> by a flurry of in vivo results (in mice, frogs, flies, and worms), in many cases coming from investigators who never intended to become involved with such difficult molecules. Here, we review some of these findings and discuss how they both confirm old notions of proteoglycan function and suggest new ones. We have chosen to focus exclusively on the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), in part because new data on these molecules have been particularly plentiful, but mostly because those data speak more directly about the functions of GAGs, the moieties that make proteoglycans unique. However, {{it should be noted that}} in vivo studies of proteoglycans that primarily bear chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and keratan sulfate (the other families of GAG) are also providing important new insights (Fässler et al., 1994; Danielson et al. ...|$|E

Years ago, these tempestuous thespians had been romantic partners, but quarrelled violently and had become the central figures in a famous feud. The feud extended to Blythe's daughter Bonnie and John's son Ty, both young movie actors—and Jacques Butcher is now engaged to Bonnie.

The bounce in Bounce is never very high...Much of the music, while whispering of earlier, more flashily complex Sondheim scores, has a conventional surface perkiness that suggests a more old-fashioned, crowd-pleasing kind of show than is this composer's wont.

50|$|California, Florida {{and several}} other states in the US, {{concerned}} with public safety and the danger posed by counterfeit and diverted medicines, issued pedigree laws requiring participants in the value chain to demonstrate and document the ownership and custody history of medicines. Forced to handle complex serialisation and data gathering and formatting requirements, pharmaceutical manufacturers <b>kicked</b> their efforts <b>into</b> <b>high</b> <b>gear</b> spurring innovation in the industry. SAP responded with additional investment {{in the area that}} rendered a full solution for serialisation and track and trace which was rapidly adopted by leaders like Novartis, Cephalon, Roche, and many others. In addition, in 2007 SAP unveiled its Auto-ID Enterprise offering which allows companies to manage serialised data and events at the enterprise level and also at manufacturing, distribution, or retail nodes. The solution is compliant with the EPCGlobal’s EPCIS standard and provides a platform for enabling cross company collaborative applications like ePedigree, recall and deduction management, and product tracking and authentication.The US Department of Defense (DoD) has also seen the advantages that new technologies could bring to its own supply chain and maintenance operations. In 2005 the DoD issued serialisation and Auto-ID requirements -iUID program- covering many of its 43,000 suppliers. SAP quickly grasped the requirements and created a solution for its customers, such as Pratt and Whitney.Several other companies reaped the rewards offered by Real-World Aware technologies in other areas: chemical manufacturer BASF had deployed SAP Event Management to monitor ocean shipments - especially through unplanned events - and gain visibility and responsiveness in its transportation processes. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, BASF was able to quickly redirect in-transit shipments to safe ports and suffered minor disruption in its operations. British Petroleum worked with SAP Research to use a self-aware wireless mesh sensor network to prevent in real-time storage of dangerous combinations of chemical substances in the same facility. BP and SAP also worked in using RFID to enforce environmental, health and safety directives, for example automating real-time verification that a worker has taken the appropriate training and is wearing the mandatory equipment while working in a dangerous zone. On another project, SAP installed a “proof-of-presence” solution for Frankfurt Airport to ensure that the worker in charge of maintaining hard-to-reach assets was in fact physically present doing the work. Airbus and SAP worked together creating a solution that used RFID to more effectively manage the tools loaned to airlines for the maintenance of their planes.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{response}} to the work has been mixed. Reviewing the premiere, Tim Ashley of The Guardian regarded the piece as [...] "lushly scored" [...] and [...] "attractively played," [...] but nevertheless opined that the work [...] "outstayed its welcome." [...] Richard Fairman of Financial Times similarly wrote, [...] "The music laps back and forth languidly, washing over the somnolent listener. Almost nothing happens, as if some crucial visual element is missing." [...] Glyn Môn Hughes of The Arts Desk further commented: [...] Pas de Deux required a big orchestra - two pianos, two harps and no fewer than seven horns. But did it work? It certainly had its attractions, mainly as a rhapsody reminiscent of Vaughan Williams, Holst or early Britten. Its opening was hypnotic, mesmerising almost, until a great crash moved the work into new, livelier territory. The soloists were intertwined with the orchestra {{and there were no}} showy cadenzas or passages of musical bravado. What the work failed to do was develop. There was precious little modulation and the same formulas were worked to death. Over a nearly half-hour span, that was hard going. But the audience loved it, many giving the piece a standing ovation. It looks like there’s every chance it could be programmed again, which is not something that always happens to every new piece which gets an airing. However, the piece was more favorable reviewed by Christian Clemmensen of the website Filmtracks.com, who wrote, [...] "The overall highlight of the concerto for Horner's enthusiasts will be the final five minutes, during which he <b>kicks</b> the piece <b>into</b> <b>high</b> <b>gear</b> for a percussively rhythmic extension of his more engaging music for films. Not surprisingly, this is where Horner's rambling chord shifts and percussive tapping dating from Sneakers to A Beautiful Mind are referenced, with the violin in a particularly powerful position to express the key shifts." [...] He added, [...] "Even for collectors of Horner's music, long parts of the concerto will languish in pensive understatement despite their lovely recording, and with the lack of definitive 'themes,' the lively third part {{may not be enough to}} save the whole for some. Those five minutes will merit a purchase of the whole for most listeners, however, the spirited send-off a fitting conclusive statement to Horner's career." ...|$|R
5000|$|The two concocted {{a plan to}} make Roger {{believe he}} was losing his mind. Dinah decided not to divorce Roger and then she and Hart did {{all kinds of things}} to make Roger {{question}} his mental faculties. Roger didn't realize what was happening because he thought Dinah and Hart hated each other and that she was an airhead. For him, Dinah and Hart began to fall in love. It was a slow process, but it drove Roger mad and violent. He attacked Hart several times, choked Dinah with a scarf, began drugging Dinah and tried to convince her to kill herself while on it. Hart eventually caught on to his father's malevolent plot and saved Dinah. Now, they both decided to <b>kick</b> their plan <b>into</b> <b>high</b> <b>gear.</b> Hart confronted Roger at Laurel Falls with a vial of the drugs and threatened to the police Roger had been trying to drive his wife insane in an effort to cover up the fact he robbed her blind ever since he had married her. A fearful Roger pulled a gun on Hart and the two struggled. The gun went off and Hart was shot. A despondent Roger, believing he had [...] "murdered" [...] his own son, buried Hart. However, this was merely part of the clever plot against him; Hart was not dead, the bullet had been a blank and he had been wearing a blood pack. Roger's mental state dramatically declined and got worse after he accidentally drank an entire vial of the drugs he had been poisoning Dinah with. The drug was pumped out of his system, but he was left strapped down to a hospital bed after he had tried to strangle Dinah. Finally, at a fair, Hart revealed himself to Roger in front of the entire town. A whacked-out Roger couldn't believe his eyes and admitted to everyone that he had shot Hart. Suddenly after Dinah refused to corroborate Roger's story, he realized he'd been set up all along and attacked his son. It took two cops to subdue him and Roger was eventually sent to a mental institution. After learning Dinah had retrieved her money from the Cayman Islands, Roger set out to escape the mental hospital and prove he'd been set up. After escaping, he then disguised himself and broke into Hart's apartment and found a picture of Hart and Dinah together in the Caymans, disproving their claim they hated each other and validating his argument they had been in collusion all along. Bridget Reardon (fearing that Hart, the father of her child, might go to jail) switched photos and when Roger showed it to the judge, it was really a picture of Peter. Roger was carted back off to the loony bin. After a failed escape attempt, Dinah authorized the psychiatrists to give Roger [...] "shock treatment" [...] to cure him of violent impulses. At a second competency hearing, Hart and Dinah were discovered together and a [...] "kind, benevolent" [...] Roger, he had never undergone the shock therapy and was pretending, was finally released from the mental hospital.|$|R
