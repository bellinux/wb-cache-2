40|$|<b>Generality</b> is a {{defining}} modelling {{virtue of the}} economic tradition. It is often assumed that <b>generality</b> {{is not only a}} normative standard but also a costless commitment. This paper takes up a criticism of this assumption: degree of <b>generality</b> of a model is a choice which comes with costs under certain conditions. It is argued that if economic systems are heterogeneous, then <b>generality</b> trades-off with empirical fidelity. Trade-offs have the net effect of supporting virtue pluralism. The degree to which trade-offs bite, and thus the degree of virtue pluralism, depends on the degree of ontological heterogeneity of economic systems. <b>Generality</b> as a normative standard is undermined because it is a gamble on ontology...|$|R

A few species, including N.ampullaria, prefer the dense, shaded forests, but most other species thrive {{on the margins}} of tree/shrub communities or clearings. Some species (e.g. N.mirabilis) have been found growing in clear-cut forest areas, roadsides, and disturbed fields. Other species have adapted to growing in savanna-like grass communities. The soils in which Nepenthes species grow are usually acidic and low in nutrients, being composed of peat, white sand, sandstone, or volcanic soils. Exceptions to these <b>generalities</b> include species that thrive in soils with high heavy metal content (e.g. N.rajah), on sandy beaches in the sea spray zone (e.g. N.albomarginata). Other species grow on inselbergs and as lithophytes, while others, such as N.inermis, can grow as epiphytes with no soil contact.|$|E

25|$|Familial hyperinsulinism, {{linked to}} {{mutations}} in GLUD1, {{is characterized by}} hypoglycemia that ranges from severe neonatal-onset, difficult-to-manage disease to childhood-onset disease with mild symptoms and difficult-to-diagnose hypoglycemia. Neonatal-onset disease manifests within hours to two days after birth. Childhood-onset disease manifests during the first months or years of life. In the newborn period, presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, including seizures, hypotonia, poor feeding, and apnea. In severe cases, serum glucose concentrations are typically extremely low and thus easily recognized, whereas in milder cases, variable and mild hypoglycemia may make the diagnosis more difficult. Even within the same family, disease manifestations can range from mild to severe. Individuals with autosomal recessive familial hyperinsulinism, caused by mutations in either ABCC8 or KCNJ11 (FHI-KATP), tend to be large for gestational age and usually present with severe refractory hypoglycemia in the first 48 hours of life; affected infants usually respond only partially to diet or medical management (i.e., diazoxide therapy) and thus may require pancreatic resection. Individuals with autosomal dominant FHI-KATP tend to be appropriate for gestational age at birth, to present at approximately age one year (range: 2 days - 30 years), and to respond to diet and diazoxide therapy. Exceptions to both of these <b>generalities</b> have been reported. FHI-GCK, caused by mutations in GCK, may be much milder than FHI-KATP; however, some persons have severe, diazoxide-unresponsive hypoglycemia. FHI-HADH, caused by mutations in HADH, tends to be relatively mild, although severe cases have been reported. Individuals with FHI-HNF4A, caused by mutations in HNF4A, are typically born large for gestational age and have mild features that respond to diazoxide treatment. FHI-UCP2, caused by mutations in UCP2, is a rare cause of diazoxide-responsive FH1. Hyperammonemia/hyperinsulinism (HA/HI) is associated with mild-to-moderate hyperammonemia and with relatively mild, late-onset hypoglycemia; most but not all affected individuals have mutations in GLUD1.|$|E
