40|$|AbstractSubjective speech {{intelligibility}} tests {{were carried out}} in order to investigate strategies to improve {{speech intelligibility}} in binaural voice transmission when listening from different <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles</b> under adverse listening conditions. Phonetically balanced bi-syllable meaningful words in Spanish were used as speech material. The speech signal was played back through headphones, undisturbed, and also {{with the addition of}} high levels of disturbing noise or reverberation, with a signal to noise ratio of SNR = – 10 dB and a reverberation time of T 60 = 10 s. Speech samples were contaminated with interaurally uncorrelated noise and interaurally correlated reverberation, which previous studies have shown the more adverse. Results show that, for speech contaminated with interaurally uncorrelated noise, intelligibility scores improve for <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles</b> around ± 30 ° over speech intelligibility at 0 °. On the other hand, for interaurally correlated reverberation, binaural speech intelligibility reduces when listening at <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles</b> around ± 30 °, in comparison with listening at 0 ° or <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles</b> around ± 60 °...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} to produce {{flattening}} spectral transmittance for a birefringent interleaver filter {{based on the}} interference of polarized light is presented. In previous publications, each birefringent crystal was required to be of equal thickness and only one group of crystal <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles</b> was obtained. In addition, {{the shape of the}} spectral transmittance was not sufficiently flat and the flatness width of the passband and stopband was not sufficiently wide. The proposed method has advantages over previously published methods. It is based on the Fourier transform, and the thickness of each crystal can be different. All numerical solutions can be obtained for crystal <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles</b> provided ripples are small in relation to the relatively wide passband and the stopband. Three birefringent crystals are used and all the <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles</b> of the crystals are obtained when ripples are limited to a uniform 0. 1 % in both the passband and stopband, with widths greater than 2 / 11 of the period. The influence of the change of <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> and crystal thickness on the spectral transmittance of the system is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{displays}} {{have been}} extensively used at various {{indoor and outdoor}} venues to provide updated information to the audiences. With the pervasiveness of the smartphones nowadays, {{it is possible to}} utilize smartphones to design new interactive display systems. Although many such systems have been proposed, none of them address the issue of supporting interaction with multiple displays. A new solution is proposed in this paper to allow users to use smartphone sensors to intuitively interact with multiple displays at one venue. This approach is based on <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> measured by the smartphone's orientation sensor, and situation abstraction which eliminates the use of location information. Each display at the venue is optimally assigned with an <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> range. A smartphone constantly measures its <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle.</b> If it is within the <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> ranges of a particular display, the smartphones presumes the user is interested to interact with this display. As a result, a user can interact with the desired display intuitively by pointing his/her smartphone at it, and switch smoothly from one display to another by changing smartphone's orientation. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|In usual {{measurement}} {{with the}} Senarmont method using a conventional polarization microscope, the <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> of the analyzer at extinction {{of the emerging}} light is detected by naked eyes. If the intensity of light is measured {{as a function of}} the <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> of the analyzer, one can find the direction at which the intensity is minimized more accurately by fitting.

To circumvent this problem a setting with which the intensity is measured {{as a function of the}} <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> of the analyzer is constructed with rotation of the analyzer through a computer control. As a result, the time required for the measurement has been greatly decreased. Comment: 16 pages, 3 figures; Instrumentation Science & Technology, accepte...|$|R
