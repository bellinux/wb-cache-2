5|$|After the South Carolina debate, Biden campaigned in California {{to begin}} May 2007 {{attending}} events in San Francisco. Later {{in the month}} after President George W. Bush enacted <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Sudan to pressure the government to end the genocide in Darfur, Biden momentarily shifted focus from Iraq to the crisis in Darfur. He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued that it was not enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian War {{began in}} 1992, {{as a result}} of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The deteriorating {{situation}} led to United Nations Security Council Resolution 816 on 9October 1992, ordering a no-fly zone over central Bosnia and Herzegovina, which NATO began enforcing on 12April 1993 with Operation Deny Flight. From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.|$|E

5|$|The United Nations instituted {{mandatory}} <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Rhodesia in December 1966. Over {{the next}} year British diplomatic activity regarding Rhodesia was diminished; the UK government's stated policy shifted towards NIBMAR—"no independence before majority rule". Beadle grappled with the Rhodesian problem privately and in correspondence, attempting to reconcile the Smith administration's control over {{the country with the}} unconstitutional nature of UDI. Erwin Griswold, the United States Solicitor General, wrote to him that as he saw it the Rhodesian judges could not recognise the post-UDI government as de facto while also claiming to act under the Queen's commission.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was in the building, meeting Stjepan Mesić, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and Ante Marković, then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, but none of them were injured in the attack. In {{immediate}} aftermath, Tuđman remarked that the attack was apparently meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia. Marković blamed Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević, who denied the accusation and suggested the event was staged by Croatia. The attack prompted international condemnation and consideration of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Yugoslavia. The presidential residence was immediately moved to the Presidential palace, which was formerly known as Villa Zagorje. The Banski dvori sustained significant damage, but repairs started only in 1995. The building later became the seat of the Croatian Government.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{staged a}} tiring, dangerous, and {{high-profile}} trip to South Africa in January 1985. He defied both the apartheid government's wishes and militant leftist AZAPO demonstrators by spending {{a night in}} the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela. Upon returning, Kennedy became {{a leader in the}} push for <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship, and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{founding}} of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Tsai continued his cooperation with the new government. The Korean War broke out a year later. The U.S. and its allies’ <b>economic</b> <b>sanction</b> <b>against</b> Mainland China sealed Mayar’s fate. Facing the sanction together with industrial nationalization in China, Tsai retreated and retired to Hong Kong. Nevertheless, his legacy of industrial ambition and entrepreneurial zest has continued in his family by Yang Yuan-loong and Marjorie Yang Mun-tak who have since built up a world-class textile company, Esquel Group.|$|R

5|$|Makeba's {{music was}} also popular in Europe, and she {{travelled}} and performed there frequently. Acting {{on the advice}} of Belafonte, she added songs from Latin America, Europe, Israel, and elsewhere in Africa to her repertoire. She visited Kenya in 1962 in support of the country's independence from British colonial rule, and raised funds for its independence leader Jomo Kenyatta. Later that year she testified before the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid about the effects of the system, asking for <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> South Africa's National Party government. She requested an arms embargo against South Africa, on the basis that weapons sold to the government would likely be used against black women and children. As a result, her music was banned in South Africa, and her South African citizenship and right to return were revoked. Makeba thus became a stateless person, but she was soon issued passports by Algeria, Guinea, Belgium and Ghana. In her life, she held nine passports, and was granted honorary citizenship in ten countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the {{foundation}} of the Arab Maghreb Union, uniting Libya in an economic pact with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, viewing it as beginnings of a new Pan-Arab union. Meanwhile, Libya stepped up its support for anti-Western militants such as the Provisional IRA, and in 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans – Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah – as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that Libya hand them over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the Montreal Convention, the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution 748 in March 1992, initiating <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Libya which had deep repercussions for the country's economy. The country suffered an estimated $900 million financial loss as a result. Further problems arose with the West when in January 1989, two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the U.S. off the Libyan coast. Many African states opposed the UN sanctions, with Mandela criticizing them on a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997, when he praised Libya for its work in fighting apartheid and awarded Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. They would only be suspended in 1998 when Libya agreed to allow the extradition of the suspects to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, in a process overseen by Mandela.|$|E

50|$|Iran did not {{originally}} support China's bid for United Nations membership {{but did not}} veto it. It wasn't until 1969 that Iran displayed open {{support for}} China's membership. Now, it is seen that Iran relies upon China's membership and especially Chinese veto power on the Security Council {{to protect it from}} UN or U.S.-led action. China is known for its opposition to <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> another state and favors diplomatic efforts. This tradition includes China's position on UN <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Iran in the past. In 1980, China refused to support the UN arms embargo against Iran and abstained from voting on U.S.-based <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Iran as well. It was not until 2010 that China entertained the idea of joining in on the <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> presented <b>against</b> Iran. China supported the 2010 UN sanctions which caused some tension and reevaluation of Iranian-Chinese relations. In retaliation, Iran briefly aroused interest in the plight of Muslims in China.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the transatlantic <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> levied <b>against</b> Iran following the US embassy hostage crisis. It charts their shifting objectives and notes their integration with US-Iranian relations, transatlantic dynamics and Cold War concerns. Two main conclusions are drawn. Firstly, that the sanctions pursued multiple objectives besides efforts to coerce the Iranian regime. Secondly, that their economic scope is an unreliable indicator of their effectiveness or transatlantic cooperation. The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan enhanced the tactical value of sanctions {{as a substitute for}} actions that posed greater geo-political risks for the United States. The European allies, though eager to protect their substantial financial investments in Iran, eventually acquiesced to demonstrate transatlantic solidarity and prevent a US military intervention that threatened their vital interests...|$|R
