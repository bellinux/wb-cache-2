30|$|Enhanced oil {{recovery}} refers to several processes conducted to increase oil production from a reservoir after {{primary and secondary}} recoveries, which are typically performed by <b>injecting</b> <b>water</b> or gas.

3000|$|The plots {{show that}} the {{reservoir}} production is more effective when more zones of the reservoir can produce oil and <b>inject</b> <b>water,</b> with case ZONES 4 – 5 having the highest cumulative oil production for all periods after waterflooding. This is because production is largely a function of voidage. The more the zones <b>injecting</b> <b>water,</b> the higher the voidage replacement of reservoir fluids, and thus, a decline in production rate is curtailed. However, {{this is not good}} practice as it can also lead to very high water production.|$|R
50|$|In {{extraction}} of petroleum, a technique of enhanced oil recovery is implemented {{to increase the}} amount of oil to be extracted from an oil field. The <b>injected</b> <b>water</b> displaces the oil in the reservoir which is transported to recovery wells. As the reservoir is not uniform in permeability, <b>injected</b> <b>water</b> tends to go through high permeable zone, and does not go through the zone where oil remains. In this situation, bacterial profile modification technique, which injects bacteria into the high permeable zone to promote bioclogging can be employed. It is a type of microbial enhanced oil recovery.|$|E
50|$|Polymer {{flooding}} {{consists in}} mixing long chain polymer molecules with the <b>injected</b> <b>water</b> {{in order to}} increase the water viscosity. This method improves the vertical and areal sweep efficiency as a consequence of improving the water/oil Mobility ratio.|$|E
50|$|To achieve maximum oil recovery, {{waterflooding}} {{is often}} implemented, in which water is {{injected into the}} reservoirs to help force the oil to the production wells.

50|$|Following a {{comprehensive}} review in 2002 {{that led to a}} sweeping change programme, PDO laid out ambitious production-recovery plans based not only on waterflooding but also on enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques: the application of heat, chemicals or gas solvents to alter the way oil or <b>injected</b> <b>water</b> flows in a reservoir. But, {{in order for them to}} be sustainable in the long run, the plans had to be executed for substantially less money than originally envisaged, making them all the more challenging. A total of $2 billion in cost savings over the five-year period 2002-2008 were incorporated into the Company’s budget. Fortunately, because of the long-term nature of investments that would be required, the Omani Government agreed at the end of 2004 to extend PDO’s exploration and production concession and operating agreements for 40 years - until 2044.|$|E
