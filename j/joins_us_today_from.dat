40|$|In this paper, we {{continue}} to examine the fundamental basis for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric and its application to cosmology, specifically addressing the question: What is the proper size of the visible universe? There are several ways of answering the question of size, though often with an incomplete understanding of how far light has actually traveled in reaching <b>us</b> <b>today</b> <b>from</b> the most remote sources. The difficulty usually arises from an inconsistent use of the coordinates, or an over-interpretation of the physical meaning of quantities such as the so-called proper distance R(t) =a(t) r, written {{in terms of the}} (unchanging) co-moving radius r and the universal expansion factor a(t). In this paper, we use the five non-trivial FRW metrics with constant spacetime curvature (i. e., the static FRW metrics, but excluding Minkowski) to prove that in static FRW spacetimes in which expansion began from an initial signularity, the visible universe today has a proper size equal to R_h(t_ 0 / 2), i. e., the gravitational horizon at half its current age. The exceptions are de Sitter and Lanczos, whose contents had pre-existing positions away from the origin. In so doing, we confirm earlier results showing the same phenomenon in a broad range of cosmologies, including LCDM, based on the numerical integration of null geodesic equations through an FRW metric.

This narrative inquiry study sought to understand how, if at all, Latino students in a fifth grade two-way immersion program experienced anxiety about the ways they believe to be perceived in the classroom and school settings by their teachers and other classmates. Finding of this study confirmed the relative success of two-way immersion programs educating Latino students and highlighted the urgent need to conduct more research in bilingual settings trying to understand the role stereotype threat might play in the educational experience of Latino students. The fact that Latino students were still lagging behind their native English-speaking counterparts in the TWI program is a reality that must be researched further to understand the lived experiences of Latino students in bilingual programs...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{hearing is}} the first in a two-part series that will examine the issues {{surrounding}} the treatment of migrants by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And the first of the series, this hearing today, we will have two panels, which will primarily focus on the issue of detention. I would like to begin by thanking our witnesses: Mr. John Torres, Mr. Richard Seiter, Ms. Michelle Brane´, Ms. Christina Fiflis, and Mr. Michael Cutler. And thank you for <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>today</b> to discuss these important issues. With the end of the ‘‘catch and release’’ program, the Department of Homeland Security faces a daunting challenge: how to deal with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of migrants that have been detained in recent enforcement actions. But the challenge is not only for law enforcement. It is also a humanitarian challenge. Our goal must not only be to detain migrants, but also to make sure that their detention is humane. And at the same time, we must explore alternatives to detention that meet our law enforcement goals and that may provide more humane conditions for these detainees. Recently, reports have signaled that detention conditions and the treatment of detainees in administrative immigration detection have not been acceptable. I have found these reports very disturbing, and so have many of my colleagues. And I hope that this hearing will shed some light on the situation and lead to action points by which we can improve the conditions of these detainees. And I am particularly interested in learning more about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement standards for care and custody of these detainees. These standards need to include a guarantee for detainees to be treated humanely and, of course, to have access to counsel. It is also critical that the subcommittee {{gain a better understanding of}} how ICE and their detention contractors work together to meet these minimum standards. In addition, I am looking forward to hearing about alternatives to detention that can appropriately monitor individuals but ensure that they show up to all the necessary hearings. As a nation, we must be committed to treating detainees appropriately, with respect for their dignity as fellow human beings and in accordance with our laws, our traditions, and, quite frankly, the idea of this great country. Recent reports indicate that we have some work to do before we achieve all of this, and I hope this hearing gives us some sense of the progress that we have made on these issues...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The task of {{preserving}} the Hadith was undertaken, according to the classical Muslim view, by the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad and, thereafter, the Tabicun (Successors), and then from generation to generation. Thus, we find this great amount of Hadith in front of <b>us</b> <b>today.</b> <b>From</b> amongst these Hadith we find as it is alleged a great proportion narrated by the Companion Abu Hurayra (d. 57 / 58 / 59 AH/ 681 / 682 / 683 CE). He has narrated various kinds of narration, from those on creed to those on the ethics of Islam. However, his narrations have been looked upon with certain scepticism and criticism, as has his own personality, in both Classical Hadith scholarship and Modern Hadith scholarship. This research, entitled: â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 Abu Hurayraâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 a Narrator of Hadith Revisited: An Examination into the Dichotomous Representations of an Important Figure in Hadith with special reference to Classical Islamic modes of Criticism, will discuss specifically Abu Hurayra the Companion of the Prophet Muhammad and his alleged status as a prolific narrator of the Hadith. The {{aim of this study}} is to highlight how Abu Hurayra is depicted and perceived by both Classical Hadith Scholarship and Modern Hadith Scholarship. Furthermore, the central argument of this thesis is that the charge of Abu Hurayra being a Mukthir (a prolifically active narrator who embellished his reports) is unfair for the simple reason that those traditions he uniquely transmits are rather small in number. Most of the other traditions with which his name is associated have concomitant and parallel isnads (Chains of Narration). This study therefore sets out to critically examine and analyse the life and narrations of Abu Hurayra in view of the academic debates on the wider issues of the authenticity of the sources and how they affect the arguments put forward by this research.
