Dear old Dot, she's got strong moral views and odd {{religious}} beliefs, but her heart's {{in the right}} place. She has that awful worried {{expression on her face}} the whole time". Brown has noted the changes within Dot since the show's inception, saying that initially Dot was sharp and selfish, but since her character remarried in 2002, she has gained security and has [...] "no reason to have the hypochondria she had in the past [...] She's become more caring over the years. She enjoys the company of young people. She loves her church. She can get in an anxious state– <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> when Dot's hysterical!

However, her Quattro later incurred gearbox problems and she retired from fifth place after sliding {{off the road}} into a snow-filled ditch. Mouton would later state: [...] "For me, rallying is England. No pacenotes – just you in the car having to do the fastest time. This, to me, is rallying.

500|$|Cake {{incorporates}} {{a wide range}} of genres into its music, including country music, Mariachi, new wave, college rock, jazz, funk, Iranian folk music, Brazilian music and hip hop. McCrea himself cites Hank Williams, Tom Zé, the Golden Gate Quartet and Sly and the Family Stone as particular influences. The band is most often noted for three things: the prominence of DiFiore's trumpet lines, McCrea's ironic, sarcastic lyrics, and his [...] "droll, deadpan...monotone" [...] vocals. DiFiore's trumpet work originated with McCrea's desire for a second melodic instrument to go with a song he had written; [...] "A lead guitar playing those lines would have been really hokey. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> when it's a contrapuntal thing, where the guitar is doing one melody, the vocal is doing another melody, and the trumpet plays this third melody. If the music can be transparent enough, you can hear all three at the same time".|$|E

When she is last seen in the film, she is in France {{in the back seat of}} a limousine with an elderly wealthy gentleman being driven along by the same chauffeur.

500|$|At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich {{appeared}} with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized {{the idea of}} using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's [...] "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just [...] "sharing" [...] by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was [...] "borrowing things that were not yours without asking". He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, [...] "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> I'll buy one of my own." [...] Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.|$|E
500|$|Before {{talking with}} his brother, Max wrote a song {{entitled}} [...] "Inflikted," [...] inspired by Sepultura's visit in 1992 to Indonesia where {{they saw a}} [...] "crazy ritual". Describing what he saw, Max said, [...] "There was self-inflicted pain, knives, blood, fire. It was insane. It stuck in my head." [...] Max stated that [...] "Inflikted" [...] {{was supposed to go}} towards Soulfly's sixth studio album Conquer, but he wanted to do the song with Igor. For legal reasons, they could not use Inflikted as the band name. According to Max, [...] "A lot of people had used it before, so he {{had to come up with}} something else." [...] When trying to find a name, he [...] "blurted out" [...] Cavalera Conspiracy, and Igor liked it. Max added, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> better than Inflikted. It has a ring to it that connects me and Igor as two brothers back together." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} [...] "In the Presence of Enemies" [...] was {{inspired}} by a Korean manhwa named Priest, as Petrucci explains that not being a manga fan, precisely, [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> though. This one, I just stumbled upon and I really liked the content. It inspired me to take a different approach lyrically. You have to keep things interesting for yourself when writing new material so I just took this and ran with it. [...] Those types of lyrics are fun to write, you know? The dark subject matter, the dark master stuff. It's another way of writing, a fresh one to me." [...] He also summarizes the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about somebody who loses himself and end struggles with the darkness, symbolized by the Dark Master. And the story ends up really being the darkness within and goes through the different phases where he has to fight demons and things like that.|$|E

500|$|Stephanie McGrath of Jam! {{said the}} song is [...] "a nice break from the 'baby babys', 'yeah yeahs' and insistent drum beats that pepper the other songs" [...] of Oops!. David Veitch of the Calgary Sun {{compared}} the backing vocals to [...] "nicely old-fashioned shoo-be-doo-doos". Lyrically, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] alludes to how Spears wants to hear her boyfriend say he needs her {{all the way and}} that he loves her. Spears considered it a [...] "pure and delicate" [...] song. [...] "It's just one of those songs that pull you in.

[...] "I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, if you really listen... they're more of what I can relate to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think.

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{talks about}} a scorned lover rediscovering their inner strength, with Madonna [...] "shooting a few poison arrows {{into the heart of}} some dude who's done her wrong," [...] as noted by Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield. During the song, she {{repeatedly}} labels an ex's bad behavior as [...] "bullshit" [...] and tells him, [...] "fuck you". In another part, she mocks, [...] "When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> is." [...] The song was allegedly written about Madonna's ex-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat. She told Rolling Stone that the song [...] "it's like, fuck you, I'm going to have fun.

[...] While commenting to Billboard over the usage of the word [...] "bitch" [...] numerous times in two songs from the album, Madonna explained: ...|$|E
500|$|Smith's first album, Faryl, was {{recorded}} at Air Studios, London, in December 2008, during Smith's Christmas holiday; it was completed on 3 January 2009 and features a 60-piece orchestra. Smith described the song [...] "River of Light" [...] {{by saying that}} The Blue Danube [...] "music now has words put to it. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> because it's different. Everyone knows the tune and everybody has got high hopes for it." [...] Smith said that her favourite song on the album was her version of the Welsh hymn, [...] "Calon Lân". Other songs include Smith's version of [...] "Amazing Grace", a cover of John Denver's [...] "Annie's Song", and a version of [...] "The Way Old Friends Do", rewritten for Smith by Björn Ulvaeus. Smith spoke about the song, saying [...] "It was about divorce ... They didn't think it was appropriate for me to sing about that, so Björn changed the lyrics so it's about friendship." [...] The album was produced by Jon Cohen, who had previously worked with artists including the Operababes and Vanessa Mae.|$|E

500|$|As {{stated by}} Scott Shetler of AOL Radio and Matthew Horton of BBC, the song {{features}} an aggressive tone, and dizzying percussion and electro elements create a [...] "frenzied pace that Hilson matches with an intense vocal delivery." [...] During {{the bridge and}} the chorus, she utters gasps and groans, like 'oohs and aahs' while singing the lyrics. As the first verse begins, Hilson sings: [...] "Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / You know how <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> Daddy {{when you hit the}} spot / Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / Imma take control when I climb up on top". As the song progresses, Hilson sings that she is [...] "so good, I'll make you think the bed is my workplace [...] Yeah, it's me, that's where you wanna be / I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] just before Ross's verse begins, seemingly summing up the image Hilson is going for: [...] "She looks like an angel, but she's sexy as hell." [...] As a whole, the lyrical arrangements are about sexual desire and not holding back.|$|E
500|$|It {{was this}} concept which {{intrigued}} Madonna, {{while she was}} developing her third studio album True Blue (1986). She said, [...] "I hate it when people do master mixes of my records. I don't want to hear my songs changed like that. I don't know that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> people screwing with my records. The jury is out on it for me. But the fans like it, and really, this one was for the fans, for {{the kids in the}} clubs who wanted to hear these songs in a fresh new way." [...] She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune. From Warner's point of view, the rise of remix was a commercial boon, because it meant making more money out of the same piece of music. Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks, they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly. Hence they decided to release the album, but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick spent {{extensive}} hours editing, often working {{seven days}} a week, and more hours a day as he got closer to deadlines. For Kubrick, written dialogue was one element {{to be put in}} balance with mise en scène (set arrangements), music, and especially, editing. Inspired by Pudovkin's treatise on film editing, Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often [...] "re-direct" [...] a film, and he remarked: [...] "I love editing. I think <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> more than any other phase of filmmaking... Editing is the only unique aspect of filmmaking which does not resemble any other art form—a point so important it cannot be overstressed... It can make or break a film". Biographer John Baxter stated that [...] "Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line. Then over months... he arranged and rearranged {{the tens of thousands of}} scraps of film to fit a vision that really only began to emerge during editing".|$|E
