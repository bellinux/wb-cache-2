25|$|<b>Geogrids</b> {{represent}} {{a rapidly growing}} segment within geosynthetics. Rather than being a woven, nonwoven or knitted textile fabric, <b>geogrids</b> are polymers formed into a very open, gridlike configuration, i.e., they have large apertures between individual ribs in the transverse and longitudinal directions. <b>Geogrids</b> are (a) either stretched in one, two or three directions for improved physical properties, (b) made on weaving or knitting machinery by standard textile manufacturing methods, or (c) by laser or ultrasonically bonding rods or straps together.

5000|$|The {{development}} of methods of preparing relatively rigid polymeric materials by tensile drawing, {{in a sense}} [...] "cold working," [...] raised the possibility that such materials {{could be used in}} the reinforcement of soils for walls, steep slopes, roadway bases and foundation soils. The principal function of geogrids is for reinforcement. This area, as with many other geosynthetics, is very active, with a number of different products, materials, configurations, etc., making up today's <b>geogrid</b> market. The key feature of all geogrids is that the openings between the adjacent sets of longitudinal and transverse ribs, called “apertures,” are large enough to allow for soil strike-through {{from one side of the}} <b>geogrid</b> to the other. The ribs of some geogrids are often quite stiff compared to the fibers of geotextiles. As discussed later, not only is rib strength important, but junction strength is also important. The reason for this is that in anchorage situations the soil strike-through within the apertures bears against the transverse ribs, which transmits the load to the longitudinal ribs via the junctions. The junctions are, of course, where the longitudinal and transverse ribs meet and are connected. They are sometimes called “nodes”.|$|E
5000|$|Currently {{there are}} three {{categories}} of geogrids. The first, and original, geogrids (called unitized or homogeneous types, or more {{commonly referred to as}} 'punched and drawn geogrids') were invented by Dr Frank Brian Mercer in the United Kingdom at Netlon, Ltd., and were brought in 1982 to North America by the Tensar Corporation. A conference in 1984 was helpful in bringing geogrids to the engineering design community. [...] A similar type of drawn <b>geogrid</b> which originated in Italy by Tenax is also available, as are products by new manufacturers in Asia.|$|E
50|$|The second {{category}} of <b>geogrids</b> are more flexible, textile-like <b>geogrids</b> using bundles of polyethylene-coated polyester fibres as the reinforcing component. They were first developed by ICI Linear Composites LTD in the United Kingdom around 1980. This {{led to the}} development of polyester yarn <b>geogrids</b> made on textile weaving machinery. In this process hundreds of continuous fibers are gathered together to form yarns which are woven into longitudinal and transverse ribs with large open spaces between. The cross-overs are joined by knitting or intertwining before the entire unit is protected by a subsequent coating. Bitumen, latex, or PVC are the usual coating materials. Geosynthetics within this group are manufactured by many companies having various trademarked products. There are possibly as many as 25 companies manufacturing coated yarn-type polyester <b>geogrids</b> on a worldwide basis.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Most {{research}} on the long term behavior of geosynthetics has focused on creep; very little data {{is available on the}} stress relaxation behavior of <b>geogrids.</b> Con-sideration of both creep and stress relaxation in design may ultimately produce a more efficient structure while allowing for the use of a smaller creep reduction factor. The results of an initial effort to experimentally identify the stress relaxation behavior of nine typical <b>geogrids</b> used to reinforce soil structures is presented.

50|$|For reinforced-soil gravity walls, {{the soil}} {{reinforcement}} {{is placed in}} horizontal layers throughout {{the height of the}} wall. Commonly, the soil reinforcement is <b>geogrid,</b> a high-strength polymer mesh, that provide tensile strength to hold soil together. The wall face is often of precast, segmental concrete units that can tolerate some differential movement. The reinforced soil's mass, along with the facing, becomes the gravity wall. The reinforced mass must be built large enough to retain the pressures from the soil behind it. Gravity walls usually must be a minimum of 30 to 40 percent as deep (thick) as the height of the wall, and may have to be larger if there is a slope or surcharge on the wall.|$|E

Irish geotechnical company Maccaferri executed the project that envisaged a 550 m wide, 1.7 km long corridor on which the runway and airport buildings are to be constructed. The company, which completed the project with partners Mott MacDonald and Punj Lloyd, won the 'International Project of the Year' award at the Ground Engineering Awards 2012 for its work in constructing 70 m high reinforced soil walls and slopes at the site.

5000|$|Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are factory {{manufactured}} hydraulic barriers {{consisting of}} a layer of bentonite or other very low-permeability material supported by geotextiles and/or geomembranes, mechanically held together by needling, stitching, or chemical adhesives. [...] Due to environmental laws, any seepage from landfills must be collected and properly disposed off, otherwise contamination of the surrounding ground water could cause major environmental and/or ecological problems. The lower the hydraulic conductivity the more effective the GCL will be at retaining seepage inside of the landfill. Bentonite composed predominantly (>70%) of montmorillonite or other expansive clays, are preferred and most commonly used in GCLs. A general GCL construction would consist of two layers of geosynthetics stitched together enclosing a layer of natural or processed sodium bentonite. Typically, woven and/or non-woven textile geosynthetics are used, however polyethylene or geomembrane layers or <b>geogrid</b> geotextiles materials have also been incorporated into the design or {{in place of a}} textile layer to increase strength. GCLs are produced by several large companies in North America, Europe, and Asia.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Due to the {{perceived}} complexity of relaxation tests, the relaxation re-sponse of geosynthetics has, in the past, been predicted from isochronous curves gener-ated from creep tests.

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{transportation infrastructure}} has become utmost priority for global economic reforms. Railways {{are designed to}} provide high speed passenger and heavy haul freight transportation. Ballast is one of important constituents of the rail track however, it experiences excessive deformation and degradation from trains operating at high speeds. In addition, tracks built along coastal areas often undergo large settlements due to soft compressible clay deposits. This leads to progressive track deterioration and necessitates frequent and costly track maintenance. The use of artificial inclusions such as <b>geogrids,</b> geocomposites, shock mats and prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) is often an attractive design alternative for track practitioners. However performances of these inclusions are predominantly governed by their technical specifications in addition to geotechnical characterization of the track substructure including ballast and subgrade. Therefore, full scale field trials were conducted on instrumented track sections built along the south-east coast of Australia (e. g. Bulli and Singleton). The performance of <b>geogrids</b> and geocomposite was demonstrated in terms of specific key parameters such as stiffness and aperture size of <b>geogrids,</b> placement location of <b>geogrids,</b> as well as subgrade types.
