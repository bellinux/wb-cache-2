50|$|The {{structural}} carpentry of {{the walls}} are of several types and are discussed in detail below. French settlers called placing studs or posts on a sill spaced slightly apart poteaux-sur-sol {{which is similar to}} the English close studding. These are examples of <b>half</b> <b>timbering</b> where the framing is infilled with another material such as a mud mixture, stones, or bricks. <b>Half</b> <b>timbering</b> in America is found in limited areas, mostly of German settlement, including Old Salem, North Carolina, parts of Missouri, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania.
