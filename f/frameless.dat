5|$|VAT {{delivered}} {{its first}} mid-engined bus chassis to Ajokki Oy coach works in April 1958. It was {{powered by a}} horizontally mounted 164-hp AEC diesel engine. The end customer was bus operator Väinö Paunu Oy, which also participated in the development work. In 1960, VAT introduced the VLK500 chassis with air suspension and dual-circuit air brakes. VAT returned to building rear-engined buses in 1966–67, but sales did not reach {{the level of the}} mid- and front-engined models. The company conducted a number of experiments with the construction; one example was a bus with a <b>frameless</b> structure in which the beams were replaced by a lighter solution.|$|E
25|$|Knock-down {{fasteners}} {{are typically}} used for carcase joinery; furniture designs using them are usually of <b>frameless</b> construction.|$|E
25|$|Some outdoor packs, {{particularly}} those sold for day hikes, ultralight backpacking and mountaineering are sometimes <b>frameless</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} Acura TL had standard features including dual airbags, antilock brakes, automatic climate control, a cassette/CD player sound system, and power windows and locks. Leather was standard {{on the more}} upscale 3.2 TL, while the 2.5 TL featured a firmer suspension setup. Like its predecessor, the Vigor, this generation TL was a 4-door pillared hardtop, with <b>frameless</b> windows.|$|E
25|$|A daypack is a smaller, <b>frameless</b> {{backpack}} {{that can}} hold enough contents {{for a day}} hike, or a day's worth of other activities. They are not large enough for average wilderness backpacking that use full-sized sleeping bags and backpacking tents, but may be large enough for ultralight backpacking. Padded or unpadded waist straps may be provided to distribute weight across the body.|$|E
25|$|The second {{generation}} was more refined {{than the first}} generation car. It was advertised that the {{second generation}} Neon had over 1,000 refinements from the original generation. The first generation's <b>frameless</b> windows were replaced with a full-framed door. Other NVH refinements were implemented. The new interior and greater size increased weight. The DOHC engine (Chrysler code name ECC) was no longer available.|$|E
25|$|The bumpers {{were very}} small, {{no more than}} trim pieces. A strange and sour-looking front gave way to an ovoid rear end, {{culminating}} in an engine cover perforated by at least 50 vent openings. On the rear fenders two louvered vents allow air to the engine compartment; the right-hand one also opens to allow access to the fuel filler. Finally, a <b>frameless</b> opening rear glass provides a measure of hatchback practicality.|$|E
25|$|The J-20 has a {{long and}} wide fuselage, with the chiseled nose section and a <b>frameless</b> canopy {{resembling}} that of the F-22 Raptor. Immediately behind the cockpit are low observable intakes. All-moving canard surfaces with pronounced dihedral are placed behind the intakes, followed by leading edge extensions merging into delta wing with forward-swept trailing edges. The aft section features twin, outward canted all-moving fins, short but deep ventral strakes, and conventional round engine exhausts.|$|E
25|$|External frame packs were {{designed}} to carry heavy loads (>20kg or 40lb), giving the wearer more support and protection and better weight distribution than a simple, <b>frameless</b> strapped bag. Wooden pack frames were used for centuries around the world. Ötzi the Iceman may have used one in Copper Age Alpine Italy, though some archaeologists believe the frame found with the body {{was part of a}} snowshoe. Such packs are common in military and mountaineering applications; metal versions first appeared in the mid-20th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the balloon led directly to the {{invention of}} the parachute. André-Jacques Garnerin, who had flown in a Montgolfier balloon in 1790, wanted to find a vehicle by which a pilot could abandon a balloon in case of an accident. On 22 October 1797 he made the first descent with a <b>frameless</b> silk parachute, dropping from a balloon seven hundred meters above Parc Monceau. On 10 November 1798 his future wife, Jeanne-Genevieve Labrousse, became the first woman to ascend alone in a balloon, and the first woman to make a parachute jump.|$|E
25|$|A type {{of linear}} {{accelerator}} therapy {{which uses a}} small accelerator mounted on a moving arm to deliver X-rays to a very small area which {{can be seen on}} fluoroscopy, is called Cyberknife therapy. Several generations of the <b>frameless</b> robotic Cyberknife system have been developed since its initial inception in 1990. It was invented by John R. Adler, a Stanford University professor of neurosurgery and radiation oncology, and Russell and Peter Schonberg at Schonberg Research, and is sold by the Accuray company, located in Sunnyvale, California, US. Many such CyberKnife systems are available worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Many {{features}} of the EMB-312 became standard in later basic-training aircraft designs. It was the first turboprop trainer developed from the beginning with military jet capability. A Martin-Baker Mk8L was fitted. It was Embraer's first aircraft with tandem seats designed with a raised rear seat optimized for an uninterrupted view from the rear cockpit and a <b>frameless</b> bubble canopy for unobstructed visibility. Major aircraft features include an automatic torque control system and the jet-like, single-lever throttle which combined both engine power and propeller pitch, assuring smooth and rapid acceleration and deceleration.|$|E
25|$|Early {{design work}} {{on what would}} become the Aurora began as early as the late 1980s and {{manifested}} itself with a 1989 engineering concept known as the Oldsmobile Tube Car designed by Bud Chandler. Beyond the overall similar shape, the Tube Car featured many detailed elements that were later found on the production automobile, including a full-width taillamp, wraparound rear windshield, and <b>frameless</b> windows. Unlike the eventual production car, the Tube Car was of a pillarless hardtop design with suicide doors. The final production design was signed off on in July 1989, originally set for a 1992 start of production.|$|E
25|$|Backpacks {{in general}} fall {{into one of}} four categories: <b>frameless,</b> {{external}} frame, internal frame, and bodypack. A pack frame, when present, serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately, by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs. Most of the weight is therefore taken off the shoulders, reducing the chance of injury from shoulder strap pressure (many backpacks equipped solely with shoulder straps can affect the posture of a person carrying more than 14kg (30lbs)), as well as being less restrictive of the upper body range of motion. Most backpacks are capable of being closed with either a buckle mechanism, a zipper, or a dry-bag type closure though a few models use a drawstring fitted with a cord lock for the main compartment.|$|E
500|$|Canterbury Castle was {{a private}} , three-story house located in Arlington Heights near Washington Park, {{offering}} views of downtown Portland. Constructed from basalt stone quarried from Rocky Butte, the house featured characteristics of a castle such as a moat, a drawbridge and a copper-topped turret. The wooden drawbridge covered a moat seven feet wide by more than three feet deep. A single-car garage, built into the hillside, was constructed {{during the same time}} as the house. The concrete foundation supported a rectangular ground plan. Canterbury featured [...] "buttressing wing walls, cylindrical corner bays and a crenellated parapet of uncut stone". Round, arched and straight-topped <b>frameless</b> windows were often fitted with steel sashes. Doorways were also <b>frameless,</b> narrow and round or parabolic in shape. Doors had wrought iron hinges, handles and lock plates. The leaded glass slit window at the stair tower's top level featured a spiderweb pattern, a signature element of castle designer Jeter O. Frye's work. Windmill palms surrounding the property added to its exotic appearance.|$|E
500|$|Wood {{engraving}} is {{a demanding}} process, and Howard was a virtuoso. [...] echo the floating, <b>frameless</b> engravings pioneered by Thomas Bewick in the 18th century, {{and yet they}} are startlingly modern. As much about form as they are about anatomical accuracy, they hover at the brink of typology but have nothing of zoological rendering's reduction to taxonomy. Her counterintuitive use of colour upholds the monochrome dignity inherent in the technique.|$|E
500|$|Completed in November 1933 and costing about $4,500 in total, the House is {{a single}} story [...] by [...] {{rectangular}} steel prefabricated home that rests upon a concrete slab. The house is <b>frameless,</b> with the weight borne by [...] by [...] steel panels; the exterior panels are flanged and vertically bolted through wooden T-shaped pieces. The interior wall panels are made of steel and filled with insulation. Originally the house had a flat roof, but it changed to a gable roof at an unknown time. The house has two bedrooms, one bathroom, and an open living-dining-kitchen space. The house also has an attached garage.|$|E
500|$|The Fighting Falcon's key {{features}} include a <b>frameless</b> bubble canopy for better visibility, side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering, a seat reclined 30 degrees {{to reduce the}} effect of g-forces on the pilot, and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system which helps {{to make it a}} nimble aircraft. The F-16 has an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 locations for mounting weapons and other mission equipment. The F-16's official name is [...] "Fighting Falcon", but [...] "Viper" [...] is commonly used by its pilots and crews, due to a perceived resemblance to a viper snake as well as the Colonial Viper starfighter on Battlestar Galactica.|$|E
500|$|The F-16 is a single-engine, highly maneuverable, supersonic, {{multi-role}} tactical fighter aircraft; it {{was designed}} to be a cost-effective combat [...] "workhorse" [...] that can perform various missions and maintain around-the-clock readiness. It is much smaller and lighter than predecessors, but uses advanced aerodynamics and avionics, including the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire (RSS/FBW) flight control system, to achieve enhanced maneuver performance. Highly nimble, the F-16 was the first fighter aircraft purpose-built to pull 9-g maneuvers and can reach a maximum speed of over Mach 2. Innovations include a <b>frameless</b> bubble canopy for better visibility, side-mounted control stick, and reclined seat to reduce g-force effects on the pilot. It is armed with an internal M61 Vulcan cannon in the left wing root and has multiple locations for mounting various missiles, bombs and pods. It has a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than one, providing power to climb and accelerate vertically.|$|E
500|$|When the Canadair Sabre was {{no longer}} a viable option, the Fábrica Militar de Aviones seriously {{considered}} having the Pulqui II enter series production. A new prototype was ordered in 1957, despite the United States having offered 100 combat-proven F-86 Sabre fighters that were available immediately. The fifth IAe 33 Pulqui II (No. 05) prototype, designated Pulqui IIe, was constructed in 1959 (visually identical to the fourth prototype although retaining the original <b>frameless,</b> clear canopy) and entered flight testing after its first flight on 18 September 1959, with Lt. Roberto Starc flying. The continual evolution of the Pulqui II had resulted in the design team solving its inherent instability at high angles of attack, as well as increasing fuel capacity {{through the use of a}} wet wing, to provide sufficient range. However the fighter was now considered obsolete, in addition to its being tainted politically by its association with Perón. Consequently, the Argentine Government decided to cancel the IAe 33 project at the zenith of its development, instead acquiring 28 F-86F-40 Sabres from the United States at a [...] "bargain-basement price" [...] under the Mutual Defense Assistance Act.|$|E

2500|$|... "Solar Reserve" [...] was {{displayed}} on an artist-designed <b>frameless</b> LED {{wall on the}} Lincoln Center's Josie Robertson Plaza in New York in October–December 2014. Public response was favourable, with many visitors disseminating images of the work via Instagram (public images of [...] "Solar Reserve" [...] at Lincoln Centre).|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} models was reduced from 14 models in 1971 to 9 in 1972. The {{convertible}} was discontinued, and the 4-door hardtops and sedans were replaced with 4-door [...] "pillared hardtops." [...] This was Ford's term for 4-door sedans with <b>frameless</b> door glass. Wagons {{got the same}} <b>frameless</b> door glass and thin [...] "B" [...] pillar as the sedan. [...] All other body styles remained, including the fastback, which Ford continued to dub [...] "SportsRoof". [...] "Torino" [...] remained the base series, but the mid-level Torino 500 was renamed [...] "Gran Torino". The Torino Brougham was reduced to an option package for the Gran Torino, and Torino GT became [...] "Gran Torino Sport." [...] The Torino and Gran Torino were available as a 2-door hardtop and a 4-door sedan; the Gran Torino Sport was available as a 2-door hardtop and SportsRoof. The station wagon line-up consisted of three models: [...] "Torino," [...] "Gran Torino," [...] and [...] "Gran Torino Squire." [...] The Cobra model was discontinued as the Torino line was refocused toward luxury and de-emphasized performance.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2000s Wayfarer revival, many {{sunglasses}} designs {{inspired by}} the original Wayfarers were produced by designers unaffiliated with Ray-Ban. Grey Ant's Grant Krajecki designed a larger, cartoonish version of the glasses [...] "so extreme that [...] are best worn by those with {{a good sense of}} humor". Other Wayfarer-inspired sunglasses included Oliver Peoples' Hollis, REM Eyewear's Converse, and various designs in Juicy Couture, Hugo Boss, Kate Spade, [...] Marc Jacobs's and Kaenon Polarized 2008 lines. Between July and September 2008, retailers began selling <b>frameless</b> Wayfarers.|$|E
2500|$|On the exterior, the ES 250 {{shared the}} same general body style and overall {{dimensions}} as its Toyota counterparts, but had a more prominent grille, bigger tail lights, chrome trim, <b>frameless</b> windows, and distinct wheel design similar to its LS brethren. Inside the cabin, the ES 250 featured a six-speaker Pioneer sound system, genuine wood trim, one-touch power windows, and leather seats. A four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission was offered. The Electronically Controlled Automatic Transmission (ECT) featured [...] "normal" [...] and [...] "power" [...] modes.|$|E
2500|$|A highly trimmed, two-door coupe, {{the first}} Regal shared its {{front and rear}} styling with its Century parent with distinctions amounting to differing grilles and {{taillight}} lenses. The Regal shared the same [...] "Colonnade" [...] pillared hardtop roofline (a hardtop with B-pillars (center pillars) but <b>frameless</b> doors unlike a sedan body) and greenhouse (window area) with the Grand Prix, Monte Carlo, and Cutlass Supreme {{as well as the}} lower-priced Buick Century Luxus coupe. Like its corporate cousins, the Regal (and Luxus) featured the newly fashionable opera windows, which were small fixed rear-side windows surrounded by sheetmetal, instead of the traditional roll-down windows.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{structure}} was a <b>frameless</b> plexiglas moulding which ballooned outwards {{at the top}} and sides, increasing the headroom and allowing increased visibility to the sides and rear. Because the {{new structure}} slid backward on runners, it could be slid open in flight. The aerial mast behind the canopy was replaced by a [...] "whip" [...] aerial which was mounted further aft and offset to the right. Most British Mk IIIs were equipped with Malcolm hoods. Several American service groups [...] "acquired" [...] the necessary conversion kits and some American P-51B/P-51Cs appeared with the new canopy, although the majority continued to use the original framed canopies.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the last}} Bel Air 2-door sedan was {{available}} in the USA in 1969, Chevrolet introduced a Canadian market-only two door hardtop, the Bel Air Sport Coupe, from 1970-75. [...] Based on the Impala Sport Coupe, this new model featured Bel Air trim {{at a lower price}} than the Impala. [...] Each year through 1975, this model's body followed the design of the contemporary Impala Sport Coupe. [...] The 4-door sedan and station wagon continued in production, identical to the U.S. models. [...] For 1976, the Canadian Bel Air Coupe featured the same body as the Impala Custom Coupe, with the large fixed rear quarter window and <b>frameless</b> front door glass.|$|E
2500|$|The oval-section {{fuselage}} was a <b>frameless</b> monocoque shell {{built in}} two vertically-separate halves formed over a mahogany or concrete mould. Pressure was applied with band clamps. The shell sandwich skins comprised birch three-ply outers, with cores of Ecuadorean balsa. In many generally smaller but vital areas, such as around apertures and attachment zones, stronger timbers, including aircraft-quality spruce, replaced the balsa core. The main {{areas of the}} sandwich skin were only [...] thick. Together with various forms of wood reinforcement, often of laminated construction, the sandwich skin gave great stiffness and torsional resistance. The separate fuselage halves speeded construction, permitting access by personnel working in parallel with others, as the work progressed.|$|E
2500|$|The 1973 {{model was}} {{marginally}} shorter than previous models, {{but had a}} heavier, bulker appearance. Three towing packages were optional, each with increasing towing capacity. For law men, there were multiple Police package versions available with engines ranging from the 351 2v to the powerful 460 Police Interceptor. Taxi packages continued to be offered as well. All 1973 full-sized Fords now came with a 351 2v V8-engine and SelectShift automatic transmission as their base driveline. [...] Four-door sedans with metal door frames were replaced with a new [...] "Pillared Hardtop" [...] model which featured a thin [...] "B" [...] post and <b>frameless</b> door glass. [...] This body style was offered together with the traditional pillarless four-door hardtop.|$|E
2500|$|All A-bodies, {{including}} the Grand Prix, were redesigned for 1973. This generation was larger and heavier, due partly to the federally mandated [...] crash bumpers. Although large V8s were still available, performance {{was on the}} decline due to another federal standard—a new emissions control system. The most notable styling feature of this generation was {{the appearance of the}} fixed opera window, replacing the previous disappearing rear side glass. This year's Grand Prix switched from pillarless hardtop design to a pillared [...] "Colonnade" [...] hardtop with <b>frameless</b> door glass as did all GM intermediates in response to proposed federal safety standards regarding roll-over protection that would have ultimately spelled the end of pillarless and convertible bodystyles, a mandate that never materialized.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973–75 and in 1986, {{there was}} a Century Gran Sport. For 1973, Buick renamed its {{intermediate}} line from Skylark to Century, a nameplate previously used on Buick's full-sized performance cars from 1936 to 1942 and 1954 to 1958. Like all GM intermediates, the 1973 Century received new Colonnade styling, which amounted to pillared hardtop sedans, coupes and station wagons - each of which utilized <b>frameless</b> windows along with fixed rear side windows, and convertibles were discontinued. The GS became the [...] "Gran Sport" [...] and was now an option package on the semi-fastback Century 350 Colonnade coupes. The [...] "Gran Sport" [...] option included decals on the rear fenders and trunk lid reading [...] "gran sport" [...] along with suspension and appearance upgrades.|$|E
2500|$|Once again {{an option}} {{package for the}} Le Mans, the 1973 GTO shared the reskinned A-body with its [...] "Colonnade" [...] hardtop styling, which {{eliminated}} true hardtop design because of {{the addition of a}} roof pillar but retention of <b>frameless</b> doorwork. Rear side windows were now of a fixed design that could not be opened and in a triangular shape. New federal laws for 1973 demanded front bumpers capable of withstanding 5-mile-per-hour (8km/h)impacts with no damage to the body (5mph rear bumpers became standard in 1974). The result was the use of prominent and heavy chrome bumpers front and rear. The overall styling of the 1973 Pontiac A-body intermediates (Le Mans, Luxury Le Mans, GTO and Grand Am) was generally not well received by the car buying public.|$|E
2500|$|A linear {{accelerator}} (linac) produces x-rays {{from the impact}} of accelerated electrons striking a high z target (usually tungsten). [...] A Linac therefore can generate x-rays of any energy, though usually 6MV photons are used. [...] With a Linac the gantry moves in space to change the delivery angle. Linear accelerator equipment can also move the patient lying on the treatment couch to change the delivery point. [...] These treatments involve using a stereotactic frame to restrict the patient's movement. The Novalis Shaped Beam Radiosurgery system and Tx Radiosurgery platform, from Brainlab, implement a <b>frameless,</b> non-invasive technique with X-ray imaging that {{has proven to be}} both comfortable for the patient and accurate. The Trilogy from Varian, or CyberKnife from Accuray, can also be used with non-invasive immobilization devices coupled with real-time imaging to detect any patient motion during a treatment.|$|E
2500|$|All GM {{passenger}} vehicles received a major redesign in 1965 dominated by flowing [...] "Coke bottle" [...] lines and fastback roof profiles on its coupe models, and the 6 window-body style was eliminated. For 1965, Buick also changed its marketing strategy and offering the Electra 225 in two trim levels, base and Custom. Along {{with the new}} body came a new chassis with a full perimeter frame including side rails that replaced the previous [...] "X" [...] frame used since 1961. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1964 including the standard 325-horsepower 401 V8, and {{two versions of the}} larger 425 V8 that were rated at [...] with a four-barrel carburetor or [...] with two four barrels. The three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission was standard equipment. [...] A new body style introduced for 1965 was the thin-pillar 4-door sedan, which featured <b>frameless</b> window glass with a thin, chrome fixed [...] "B" [...] pillar.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dawn of the}} {{aviation}} age brought inevitable accidents coupled with a growing interest in safety measures, most notably {{in the development of}} an effective parachute. Early parachuting successes, such as those by Louis-Sébastien Lenormand in 1783 and by balloonist Jean-Pierre Blanchard, had used fixed-canopy parachutes (that were already [...] "open" [...] before the jump began), and although André-Jacques Garnerin had invented a <b>frameless</b> parachute suitable for use from high altitudes, by 1910 a parachuting solution that was suitable for use when jumping from a plane or at low altitude had yet to be developed. Reichelt seems to have become interested in parachute design after hearing some of the stories of fatal accidents among the early aeronauts and aviators. His early tests with dummies equipped with foldable silk [...] "wings" [...] were a resounding success: dropped from the fifth floor, they touched down lightly. Attempts to convert the initial prototype parachutes into a workable suit proved difficult. Reichelt's original design weighed around [...] and used [...] of material. He presented his design to the leading aeronautic organization, La Ligue Aérienne at the Aéro-Club de France, hoping that they would test it, but they rejected his designs {{on the grounds that the}} construction of the canopy was too weak, and they attempted to dissuade him from wasting his time on further development. Undaunted by the rejection, Reichelt persevered and conducted experimental drops with dummies from the courtyard of his building at rue Gaillon. None of his tests proved successful.|$|E
