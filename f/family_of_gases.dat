40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} 20 years, {{there has been}} growing {{development}} in gas detection systems using micro-sensors. In contrast to classic analysis methods, these systems must be simple, small and cheap. Whilst they may not perform as well as classic analysis methods, they perform well enough {{for a number of}} applications, such as pollution control alarms or process automization. Sensor performance is often measured against the " 3 S", i. e. sensitivity, selectivity and stability. Sensitivity is the easiest aspect of performance to satisfy as sensors are generally sensitive enough for the majority of applications. However, the same cannot be said for selectivity and stability. The latter affects all information processing inside the sensor and we obviously cannot process a temporally derived signal, {{as is often the case}} with "chemical" sensors. The lack of selectivity is the current main limitation of industrially developed micro-sensors. In contrast to purely physical methods of analysis, the physicochemical principles used in the majority of micro-sensors allow only partial selectivity: we can detect a specific gas in relation to one or other <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> but this still provides a more or less significant result. In the majority of cases, this governs the use of micro-sensors. On the one hand, different performances are often interdependent and in some cases it is preferable to choose working points that decrease sensitivity in exchange for increased stability and selectivity. However, the areas of application for micro-sensors change according to improvements in selectivity: with almost zero selectivity, only applications based on major gases are possible (detection of a threshold level in process automization), whilst sensors with partial selectivity are currently successfully used for "selective" detection of a number of gases (CO, CH 4, hydrocarbons, etc.) to control pollution in domestic and atmospheric environments...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe study <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> seepages in New Caledonia {{has shown}} the {{occurrence}} <b>of</b> two <b>gas</b> <b>families,</b> one is N 2 -H 2 -CH 4 -rich, the other is N 2 -rich. The N 2 -H 2 -CH 4 -rich gases are bubbling in hyperalkaline springs (OH–-rich) knownin the peridotite massif of {{the southern part of}} the island. This <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> shows contents <b>of</b> N 2 between 50 and 62 %, H 2 between 26 and 36 %, and CH 4 between 11 and 16 %. δ 13 C values of methane are ranging from − 39 to− 32 ‰. We interpret the origin of H 2 as a product of fluid-rock interaction between basic-ultrabasic rocks andwater with oxidation of Fe 2 + and reduction of underground water in the fracture system of the peridotitesnappe. Methane is interpreted as the result of a reduction of dissolved inorganic and/or organic carbon in subsurfaceaquifers. The second <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> emissions was found in thermal springs in the sedimentary units locatedstructurally below the peridotites nappe. The gas is composed mostly of N 2 (between 97 and 98 %) associatedwith relatively high concentration <b>of</b> He. Both <b>gas</b> <b>families</b> show notably high N 2 vs fossil noble gas contents(36 Ar, 20 Ne, 84 Kr) suggesting that N 2 is not directly issued from gas dissolved in aquifers equilibrated with atmospherebut most likely finds its origin in a deep source, probably within metamorphic sediments which are tectonicallyburied belowthe ophiolitic nappe. Weinterpret the N 2 -H 2 -CH 4 -rich <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> as a result of a mixingbetween two end-members, (1) a H 2 -CH 4 -rich pole issued fromthe weathering of peridotite rocks and (2) a N 2 -rich pole which would be issued from the metamorphosed sediments buried below the ophiolitic units.

It {{has recently been}} proposed that the genera Chlorobium and Pelodictyon are synonymous. Findings: To investigate generic boundaries for the two species, protein families were predicted computationally based on sequence similarity across the genome-wide protein sets of Chlorobium tepidum TLS and Pelodictyon phaeoclathratiforme BU- 1. The distribution of the resulting protein families across the two species was summarized. The largest number <b>of</b> <b>families</b> exhibited 1 : 1 putative orthology between the two species (1468 <b>families).</b> <b>Of</b> <b>families</b> unique {{to one of the}} species, the largest number was unique to P. phaeoclathratiforme (113 <b>families),</b> <b>of</b> which the largest family contained pentapeptide repeat proteins (16 proteins). Families unique to P. phaeoclathratiforme also included a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> vesicle synthesis proteins (four proteins). Although only 7 families were identified as containing paralogous proteins in both species (with two or more proteins in each species), this group included <b>families</b> <b>of</b> major biochemical importance. One such family, with three members in each species, contained magnesium chelatase, an enzyme involved in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. Conclusion: The unique protein family groups in both C. tepidum and P. phaeoclathratiforme mirror the occupancy of different environments, while key shared family groups provide evidence for a common origin for the species, as previously suggested in the literature. The current study only uses sequence similarity-based protein families for the two species. This, alone, does not permit a firm conclusion to be drawn on the taxonomic question, of whether the two species belong in one genus or two. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: I {{report a}} model for the {{formation}} <b>of</b> Saturn’s <b>family</b> <b>of</b> mid-sized icy moons to coincide with the first flypast of Rhea by the Cassini spacecraft on 2005 November 26. It is proposed that the moons had condensed from a concentric <b>family</b> <b>of</b> orbiting <b>gas</b> rings that were shed some 4. 66109 yr ago by the proto-Saturnian (hereafter p-Sat) cloud. The p-Sat cloud is made up <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> and residual grains <b>of</b> the <b>gas</b> ring that was shed by the proto-Solar cloud (hereafter PSC) at Saturn’s orbit. The bulk of the condensate within this proto-Solar ring accumulates to form Saturn’s central core of mass ~ 10 – 20 M (M = Earth mass). The process of formation of Saturn’s solid core thus provides an opportunity for the p-Sat cloud to become depleted in rock and water ice relative to the usual solar abundances of these materials. Nitrogen, which exists as uncondensing N 2 in the PSC and as NH 3 in the p-Sat cloud, retains its solar abundance relative to H 2. If the depletion factor of solids relative to gas is zdep = 0. 25, as suggested by the low mass of Rhea relative to solar abundance expectations, the mass-percent ratio of NH 3 to H 2 O in the dense p-Sat cloud is 36 : 64. Numerical and structural models for Rhea are constructed {{on the basis of a}} ‘cosmogonic’ bulk chemical composition of hydrated rock (mass fraction 0. 385), H 2 O ice (0. 395), and NH 3 ice (0. 220).

We monitored urea uptake using [14 C]urea and measured osmotic water permeability (Pf) using video microscopy. To obtain a semiquantitative measure <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> permeability, we used microelectrodes to record the maximum transient change in surface pH (∆pHS) caused by exposing oocytes to 5 % CO 2 / 33 mM HCO 3 - (pHS increase) or 0. 5 mM NH 3 /NH 4 + (pHS decrease). UT-B expression increased oocyte permeability to urea by > 20 -fold, and Pf by 8 -fold vs. H 2 O-injected control oocytes. UT-B expression {{had no effect on}} the CO 2 -induced ∆pHS but doubled the NH 3 -induced ∆pHS. Phloretin reduced UT-B-dependent urea uptake (Jurea *) by 45 %, Pf * by 50 %, and (- ∆pHS *) NH 3 by 70 %. p-Chloromercuribenzene sulfonate reduced Jurea * by 25 %, Pf * by 30 %, and (∆pHS *) NH 3 by 100 %. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of membrane-embedded models of UT-B identified the monomeric UT-B pores as the main conduction pathway for both H 2 O and NH 3 and characterized the energetics associated with permeation of these species through the channel. Mutating each of two conserved threonines lining the monomeric urea pores reduced H 2 O and NH 3 permeability. Our data confirm that UT-B has significant H 2 O permeability {{and for the first time}} demonstrate significant NH 3 permeability. Thus the UTs become the third <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> channels.
