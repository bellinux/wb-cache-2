5|$|In {{an article}} in the May 9, 1936 issue of Puerto Rico Ilustrado, Eugenio Astol {{described}} an 1823 incident between Cofresí and Puerto Rican physician and politician Pedro Gerónimo Goyco. The 15-year-old Goyco traveled alone on a schooner to a Santo Domingo school for his secondary education. In mid-voyage, Cofresí intercepted the ship and the pirates boarded it. Cofresí assembled the passengers, asking their names and those of their parents. When he learned that Goyco was among them, the pirate ordered a change of course; they landed on a beach near Mayagüez, where Goyco was freed. Cofresí explained that he knew Goyco's father, an immigrant from Herceg Novi named Gerónimo Goicovich who had settled in Mayagüez. Goyco returned home safely, later attempting the voyage again. The elder Goicovich had favored members of Cofresí's family, despite their association with a pirate. Goyco <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> become a militant abolitionist, similar to Ramón Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{education}} system was {{enhanced by the}} establishment of the University of Mysore in 1916 by Maharaja Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV. Until reorganisation and renaming of Mysore State, Mysore University was the supreme university and prescribed education in and around the Kingdom of Mysore. Various disciplines were, later, delegated to subsidiary institutions, which later <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> universities. Owing to rapid increase in the student population, department of medicine was transferred to Rajiv Gandhi University in 1984. Later, in 1998, a surge in engineering disciplines and students forced the spawning of Visvesvaraya Technological University. Old institutes that were affiliated of the University in these disciplines now continue to operate in affiliation to the new ones or in autonomy: Mysore Medical College & Research Institute is affiliated to Rajiv Gandhi University, while engineering and technical institutions like the National Institute of Engineering and SJCE function autonomously.|$|E

5|$|The {{son of a}} {{military}} mandarin from central Vietnam, Định moved south {{when his father was}} posted to Gia Định as the provincial commander. Định <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> lead {{a military}} colony, overseeing the settlement and economic development of his constituency. He gained a reputation for being an able leader and land developer who cared for his people. When France began its invasion of southern Vietnam in 1859, Định organised local militia to reinforce the imperial army. As the regular army units suffered defeats on the battlefield, its remnants joined Định's partisans, and by 1861, he had around 6,000 men under his command. Định built his own resistance base and organised guerrilla attacks against the French. His success led Tự Đức to grant Định command of the southern partisans and to order the regular commanders to coordinate their plans with him. Định's forces quickly gained the respect of the French. They focused on disrupting the French bureaucracy and military posts in addition to the transportation of rice. Their most notable attack was the sinking of L'Espérance in December 1861.|$|E
5|$|A {{handful of}} pub rock acts managed to achieve {{mainstream}} success after {{the advent of}} punk rock, often being re-categorised as new wave music, including Graham Parker and the Rumour, Nick Lowe, Squeeze and Elvis Costello. London-based R pub rock bands received a major boost when The Jam kicked off the mod revival in 1977 with their debut album In the City, which mixed R standards with originals modelled on The Who's early singles. They confirmed their status as the leading mod revival band with their third album All Mod Cons (1978), on which Paul Weller's song-writing drew heavily on the British-focused narratives of the Kinks. Pub rock bands like Red Beans and Rice, The Little Roosters, The Inmates, Nine Below Zero and Eddie and the Hot Rods, became major acts in the growing mod revival scene in London. Other bands <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> feed the desire for mod music, often combining the music of 60s mod groups with elements of punk music, including The Lambrettas, The Merton Parkas, Squire, and Purple Hearts. These acts managed to develop cult followings and some had pop hits, before the revival petered out in the early 80s. Weller broke up The Jam in 1982 and formed The Style Council, who abandoned most {{of the elements of}} punk to adopt music much more based in R and early soul. Some major figures of the movement, including Robert Palmer and Steve Winwood, re-emerged as solo artists in the early 1980s, being as defined as blue-eyed soul singers.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for Harry and Ron, Hagrid left {{a set of}} {{instructions:}} {{to follow}} the spiders currently fleeing into the Forbidden Forest, which they do, {{only to find the}} monster blamed for the attacks fifty years before, a massive spider named Aragog, who explains to the duo that the real monster is one that spiders fear above all others. Hermione provides the last set of clues that inform them of the monster’s identity: It is a basilisk, (hence Harry’s ability to understand it,) that kills with a stare (although no one is dead because of various devices through which they indirectly saw the monster) and which spiders (such as Aragog and his offspring) fear above all others. Harry figures out from hints Aragog dropped that a student who died during the previous attacks is Myrtle, and when Ginny is apparently taken by the monster into the Chamber, they discover that the entrance is in the bathroom they’ve been using to make Polyjuice Potion. Harry, Ron, and Lockhart enter the Chamber, but the dunderheaded professor (who reveals that he’s a fraud) causes a rockfall upon attempt to modify the boys’ memories with Ron’s damaged wand, and Harry must enter alone. He arrives to find Ginny in a weakened state being watched over by a shadowy, ghostly Riddle, who explains that he is not only the heir of Slytherin, but also <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> become Voldemort himself, before setting the basilisk upon Harry; Harry defeats the monster, with the help of Dumbledore's Phoenix, and the Sword of Gryffindor drawn from the Sorting Hat, and destroys the diary, which makes Riddle disappear.|$|E
