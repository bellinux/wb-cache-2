5|$|In the {{meantime}} Bulgarians and Byzantines had clashed again in 1364. In 1366, when Emperor John V Palaiologos was returning from <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the west, the Bulgarians {{refused to let}} him pass through Bulgaria. This stance backfired, as another Byzantine ally, Count Amadeus VI of Savoy, leading the Savoyard crusade, captured several Bulgarian maritime cities in retaliation, including Ankhialos (Pomorie) and Mesembria (Nesebǎr), though he failed to take Varna. Outmanoeuvred, Ivan Alexander was forced to make peace.|$|E
5|$|On <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Germany, Ruisdael {{encountered}} water mills {{which he}} turned into a principal subject for painting, the first artist to ever do so. Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice, dated 1653, is a prime example. The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery, of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against the built environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.|$|E

5|$|One {{ordinary}} day, 19-year-old Mercer White (Lou Taylor Pucci) steals a Volvo {{station wagon}} {{from a car}} wash, and leaves Eugene, Oregon to find his estranged half-brother Arlen, who is unaware that their mother has recently died.

5|$|The Germans {{had seen}} {{some success in}} uniting {{disparate}} groups under single individuals called paramount chiefs (Oberhäuptlinge). Atangana was chosen for this position among the Ewondo and Bane either before <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Germany or soon after. This was technically only a temporary appointment; his subjects would have to approve it a year later to make it permanent. They had little alternative; Atangana was already the primary conduit of information {{to and from the}} Germans.|$|E
5|$|The Skye Cuillin {{mountains}} provide classic {{examples of}} glacial topography {{and were the}} subject of an early published account by James Forbes in 1846 (who had become a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh aged only nineteen).

While Jack tries to solve the conflicts, he starts seeing Christian in the jungle, and chases the hallucination of his dead father.|$|E
5|$|Bok was {{aided by}} people of diverse {{cultures}} and faiths in his journey to freedom. His earliest steps towards the United States were helped by a Northern Sudanese Muslim family that believed that slavery was wrong and provided him a bus ticket to Khartoum. Upon arriving in Khartoum, Bok was aided by a fellow Dinka tribesman {{and members of the}} Fur people, and <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the United States was paid for by members of the Lutheran church. His first point of contact in the United States was a refugee from Somalia who helped him get settled in Fargo, North Dakota.|$|E
5|$|In fall 1903, {{the flood}} of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks. The gold was deeper than in the Klondike, and it had taken time to dig to it. At Cleary Creek, miner Jesse Noble {{discovered}} what became the richest vein of gold in Alaska. Gold extraction was slow, because almost no heavy machinery was available to remove the overburden above the layers of gold. The gold discoveries of 1903 reversed the trend of people away from the Tanana Valley. By Christmas 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley. Another food shortage arose {{during the winter of}} 1903, alleviated only by the food Barnette had brought in after <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the Lower 48.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December 1956, outside Satara, India, the car {{in which}} Baba was being driven went {{out of control and}} a second serious {{automobile}} accident occurred. Baba suffered a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries. Dr. Nilu, one of Baba's mandali, was killed. This collision seriously incapacitated Baba. Despite his physicians' predictions to the contrary, after great effort Baba managed to walk again, but from that point on he was in constant pain and was severely limited in his ability to move. In fact, during <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the West in 1958 he often needed to be carried from venue to venue.|$|E
5|$|On <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Israel in October 1985, Weizsäcker {{was greeted}} on arrival by his Israeli counterpart, President Chaim Herzog. The {{president}} {{was given a}} full honor-guard welcome at Ben-Gurion Airport; among Cabinet ministers who lined up {{to shake his hand}} were right-wingers of the Herut party, the main faction of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party, who had previously refused to greet German leaders. Weizsäcker's visit was the first by a head of state, but not the first by a West German leader, as Chancellor Willy Brandt had paid a visit to Israel in June 1973. During a four-day state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1986, Weizsäcker addressed a joint session of the Houses of Parliament, the first German to be accorded that honor.|$|E
5|$|The five {{locomotives}} {{and spare}} parts acquired by Roger Broggie {{were sent to}} the Tampa Ship Repair & Dry Dock Company in Tampa, Florida, to receive the aesthetic and mechanical restorations necessary to run on the planned Walt Disney World Railroad (WDWRR). At the time, this was the closest facility to the Walt Disney World site in Bay Lake, Florida with the space and equipment needed to accommodate full-size railroad rolling stock. Here Transportation Superintendent Earl Vilmer, who had accompanied Broggie on <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Mexico, along with Project Engineer Bob Harpur and the facility's Machinist Supervisor George Britton were tasked with the project's completion.|$|E

5|$|The prologue to {{the novel}} is Carpentier’s most often quoted text, in which he coins the term lo real maravilloso ("marvellous reality") in {{reference}} to seemingly miraculous occurrences in Latin America. This is contrasted {{with the lack of}} magic and imagination in European folklore. Furthermore, <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Haiti in 1943 is recounted, {{as well as some of}} the research he did to gather facts for the novel. Carpentier also denounces the commonplace and formulaic instances of the marvellous that is found in surrealist novels due to its inorganic and false origins, as opposed to the natural magic that is found in Latin America.|$|E
5|$|With another presidential {{election}} {{taking place in}} 2000, Jennings had some more political reporting duties that year. On January 5, Jennings moderated the Democratic primary debate, held at the University of New Hampshire. He hosted the primetime news special The Dark Horizon: India, Pakistan, and the Bomb, which ABC broadcast on March 22, as then-President Clinton began <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the region. Jennings was the only American news anchor to travel to India for Clinton's trip. Paul A. Slavin became the new executive producer for World News Tonight in April.|$|E
5|$|Wyoming's {{territorial}} Governor Francis E. Warren visited Rock Springs on September 3, 1885, the {{day after}} the riot, to make a personal assessment. After <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Rock Springs, Warren traveled to Evanston, where he sent telegrams to U.S. President Grover Cleveland appealing for federal troops. Back in Rock Springs, the riot had calmed, but the situation was still unstable. Two companies of the United States Army's 7th Infantry arrived on September 5, 1885. One company, under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, was stationed in Evanston, Wyoming; the other, under a Colonel Chipman, was stationed in Rock Springs. At Camp Murray, Utah Territory, Colonel Alexander McDowell McCook was ordered to augment the garrison sent to Wyoming with six more companies.|$|E

5|$|After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Florida was {{dispatched}} to Europe; she departed the United States in December 1917. After {{arriving in the}} North Sea, she {{was assigned to the}} Grand Fleet, where she served with her British counterparts. The ship, part of the US Navy's Battleship Division Nine, under the command of Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman, arrived on 7 December and was assigned to the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. Following training exercises with the British fleet, 6th Battle Squadron was tasked with convoy protection duty on the route to Scandinavia. Following the end of the war, in December 1918, the ship escorted President Woodrow Wilson on <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Europe to participate in the peace negotiations at Versailles. Later in December, Florida returned to the United States to participate in the Victory Fleet Review in New York harbor.|$|E
5|$|Gray was {{a leading}} {{opponent}} of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities. A {{large percentage of the}} original 50 members of the National Academy of Sciences were Lazzaroni members. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was opposed to the National Academy and collectively elected Gray and his friend, colleague, and fellow Charles Darwin supporter William Barton Rogers to the National Academy. Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is one of the areas where Gray and his friend and colleague, Louis Agassiz, were in disagreement; Agassiz {{was a member of the}} Lazzaroni group. Agassiz had come to lecture at the Lowell Institute in 1846 and got hired by Harvard in 1847. Gray befriended him the way he had been befriended during <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Europe.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 Stalin {{dispatched}} Mikoyan, {{along with}} Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria, {{with a list}} of 300 names to Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), to oversee the liquidation of the Communist Party of Armenia (CPA), which was largely made up of Old Bolsheviks. Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one from being executed during <b>his</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Armenia. That person was arrested during one of his speeches to the CPA by Beria. Over a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office. In several instances, he intervened on behalf of his colleagues; this leniency towards the persecuted may have been one reason why he was selected by Stalin to oversee the purges in the ASSR.|$|E
