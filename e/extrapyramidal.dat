5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of <b>extrapyramidal</b> symptoms to haloperidol. It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effects}} include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, pruritus, confusion, agitation, tremor, <b>extrapyramidal</b> {{symptoms}} (dystonia, akathisia), headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, paresthesia, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, collapse, hyperventilation, sweating, hyperthermia and problems with urine retention. The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and seizure. Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or {{as part of}} a medicolegal death investigation.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for <b>extrapyramidal</b> symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the <b>extrapyramidal</b> system.|$|E
25|$|As {{haloperidol}} is a high-potency typical antipsychotic, {{it tends}} to produce significant <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effects. According to a 2013 meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs {{it was the most}} prone of the 15 for causing <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effects.|$|E

Risperidone has a similar rate of <b>extrapyramidal</b> symptoms to haloperidol.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine {{may cause}} side effects. Some are serious and {{potentially}} fatal. Common side effects include constipation, bed-wetting, night-time drooling, muscle stiffness, sedation, tremors, orthostatic hypotension, hyperglycemia, and weight gain. The {{risk of developing}} <b>extrapyramidal</b> symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia is below that of typical antipsychotics; {{this may be due}} to clozapine's anticholinergic effects. <b>Extrapyramidal</b> symptoms may subside somewhat after a person switches from another antipsychotic to clozapine.|$|E
25|$|The mode {{of action}} of olanzapine's {{antipsychotic}} activity is unknown. It may involve antagonism of dopamine and serotonin receptors. Antagonism of dopamine receptors is associated with <b>extrapyramidal</b> effects such as tardive dyskinesia (TD), and with therapeutic effects. Antagonism of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is associated with anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth and constipation, in addition it may suppress or reduce the emergence of <b>extrapyramidal</b> effects {{for the duration of}} treatment, however it offers no protection against the development of tardive dyskinesia. In common with other second generation (atypical) antipsychotics, olanzapine poses a relatively low risk of <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effects including TD, due to its high affinity for the D1 receptor over the D2 receptor.|$|E
25|$|Has {{antidopaminergic}} {{effects and}} hence can cause <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effects, tardive dyskinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
25|$|No {{medication}} {{is effective in}} controlling the <b>extrapyramidal</b> motor features of the disease. Spasticity, however, can be reduced by the administration of baclofen or benzodiazepines.|$|E

25|$|The term <b>extrapyramidal</b> motor {{system is}} {{used to refer to}} tracts within the spinal cord {{involved}} in involuntary movement but not part of the pyramidal tracts. Their functions include the control of posture and muscle tone.|$|E
25|$|M1 and M2 muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (causing anticholinergic {{symptoms such as}} dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, difficulty or {{inability to}} urinate, sinus tachycardia, electrocardiographic changes and loss of memory, but the anticholinergic action may attenuate <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effects).|$|E
25|$|Haloperidol, {{when given}} to {{lactating}} women, {{is found in}} significant amounts in their milk. Breastfed children sometimes show <b>extrapyramidal</b> symptoms. If the use of haloperidol during lactation seems indicated, the benefit for the mother should clearly outweigh the risk for the child, or breastfeeding should be stopped.|$|E
25|$|Diphenhydramine is a first-generation {{antihistamine}} used {{to treat}} a number of conditions including allergic symptoms and itchiness, the common cold, insomnia, motion sickness, and <b>extrapyramidal</b> symptoms. Diphenhydramine also has local anesthetic properties, and {{has been used as}} such in people allergic to common local anesthetics such as lidocaine.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin receptors: Its {{action at}} these receptors may be {{responsible}} for its lower <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effect liability (via the 5-HT2A/2C receptors) and improved negative symptom control compared to typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol for instance. Its antagonistic actions at the 5-HT2C receptor may account, in part, for its weight gain liability.|$|E
25|$|The {{atypical}} antipsychotics {{have found}} favor among clinicians {{and are now}} considered to be first-line treatments for schizophrenia and are gradually replacing the typical antipsychotics. In the past, most researchers have agreed that the defining characteristics of atypical antipsychotics are the decreased incidence of <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effects (EPS) and an absence of sustained prolactin elevation.|$|E
25|$|CP {{in general}} is a non-progressive, {{neurological}} condition that results from brain injury and malformation occurring before cerebral development is complete. ADCP is associated with injury and malformations to the <b>extrapyramidal</b> tracts in the basal ganglia or the cerebellum. Lesions to this region principally arise via hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HIBI) or bilirubin encephalopathy.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane review {{concluded}} that aripiprazole {{is similar to}} other typical and atypical antipsychotics with respect to benefit. Compared to typical antipsychotics, there are fewer <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effects, but higher rates of dizziness. With respect to other atypicals, {{it is difficult to}} determine differences in adverse effects as data quality is poor.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes classed {{with the}} tetracyclic antidepressants. Has {{atypical}} antipsychotic actions too. Not available in Australia, Canada or the UK but {{available in the}} US. May be faster acting. Antidopaminergic, which means that it can cause <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effects, tardive dyskinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Causes kidney failure and seizures in overdose, although it usually does not cause cardiotoxic effects in overdose.|$|E
25|$|Chlorpromazine is {{classified}} as a low-potency typical antipsychotic {{and in the past}} was used in the treatment of both acute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia and the manic phase of bipolar disorder, as well as amphetamine-induced psychoses. Low-potency antipsychotics have more anticholinergic side effects, such as dry mouth, sedation, and constipation, and lower rates of <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effects, while high-potency antipsychotics (such as haloperidol) have the reverse profile.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{side effects}} {{related to the}} use of 5-HT3 antagonists; the most common are {{constipation}} or diarrhea, headache, and dizziness.) Receptor Antagonists | year = 2003 | publisher = Oregon State University College of Pharmacy | accessdate = 2007-05-15}} Unlike antihistamines with antiemetic properties such as cyclizine, 5-HT3 antagonists do not produce sedation, nor do they cause <b>extrapyramidal</b> effects, as phenothiazines (such as prochlorperazine) sometimes do.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of clozapine (Clozaril) represents {{a breakthrough in}} the treatment of psychotic symptoms of PD. Prior to its introduction, treatment of psychotic symptoms relied on reduction of dopamine therapy or treatment with first generation antipsychotics, all of which worsened motor function. Other atypical antipsychotics useful in treatment include quetiapine (Seroquel), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprazole (Abilify), and paliperidone (Invega). Clozapine is believed to have the highest efficacy and lowest risk of <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effect.|$|E
25|$|A Lancet review {{found that}} it is in the middle range of 15 {{antipsychotics}} for effectiveness, approximately as effective as haloperidol and quetiapine and slightly more effective than ziprasidone and chlorpromazine, with better tolerability compared to the other antipsychotic drugs (4th best for weight gain, 5th best for <b>extrapyramidal</b> symptoms, best for prolactin elevation, 2nd best for QTc prolongation, and 5th best for sedation). The authors concluded that for acute psychotic episodes aripiprazole results in benefits in some aspects of the condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{side effect}} of olanzapine is weight gain, which may be profound in some cases and/or associated with derangement in the blood lipid and blood sugar profiles (see section metabolic effects). A recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerance of 15 antipsychotic drugs (APDs) found that it had the highest propensity for causing weight gain out of the 15 APD compared with a SMD of 0.74 <b>Extrapyramidal</b> side effects, although potentially serious, are infrequent to rare from olanzapine but may include tremors and muscle rigidity.|$|E
25|$|The current {{mainstay}} of manganism treatment is levodopa and chelation with EDTA. Both have limited and at best transient efficacy. Replenishing the deficit of dopamine with levodopa {{has been shown}} to initially improve <b>extrapyramidal</b> symptoms, but the response to treatment goes down after 2 or 3 years, with worsening condition of the same patients noted even after 10 years since last exposure to manganese. Enhanced excretion of manganese prompted by chelation therapy brings its blood levels down but the symptoms remain largely unchanged, raising questions about efficacy of this form of treatment.|$|E
25|$|The British National Formulary {{recommends}} a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. While withdrawal symptoms can occur, {{there is no}} evidence that tolerance develops to the drug's antipsychotic effects. A patient can be maintained for years on a therapeutically effective dose without any decrease in effectiveness being reported. Tolerance appears to develop to the sedating effects of chlorpromazine when it is first administered. Tolerance also appears to develop to the <b>extrapyramidal,</b> parkinsonian and other neuroleptic effects, although this is debatable.|$|E
25|$|PET imaging {{studies have}} {{suggested}} low doses are preferable. Clinical response was associated with at least 65% occupancy of D2 receptors, while greater than 72% was likely to cause hyperprolactinaemia and over 78% associated with <b>extrapyramidal</b> side effects. Doses of haloperidol greater than 5nbsp&mg increased the risk of side effects without improving efficacy. Patients responded with doses under even 2nbsp&mg in first-episode psychosis. For maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, an international consensus conference recommended a reduction dosage by about 20% every 6 months until a minimal maintenance dose is established.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{is merely}} {{symptomatic}} and involves intensive care with stabilization of vital functions. In early detected cases of oral overdose, induction of emesis, gastric lavage, {{and the use}} of activated charcoal can all be tried. Epinephrine is avoided for treatment of hypotension and shock, because its action might be reversed. In the case of a severe overdose, antidotes such as bromocryptine or ropinirole may be used to treat the <b>extrapyramidal</b> effects caused by haloperidol, acting as dopamine receptor agonists. ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for QT prolongation and severe arrhythmias should be treated with antiarrhythmic measures.|$|E
25|$|Irritability is {{most often}} noticed along with {{the first signs of}} nervous system impairment. Within {{the first few years of}} life, <b>extrapyramidal</b> {{involvement}} causes abnormal involuntary muscle contractions such as loss of motor control (dystonia), writhing motions (choreoathetosis), and arching of the spine (opisthotonus). Signs of pyramidal system involvement, including spasticity, overactive reflexes (hyperreflexia) and extensor plantar reflexes, also occur. The resemblance to athetoid cerebral palsy is apparent in the neurologic aspects of LNS. As a result, most individuals are initially diagnosed as having cerebral palsy. The motor disability is so extensive that most individuals never walk, and become lifelong wheelchair users.|$|E
25|$|Only SSRI that's not Australian {{pregnancy}} category C but {{is rather}} category D {{due to an}} increased risk of Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn. The FDA of the US has placed it in category D. It is associated with a higher risk of sexual dysfunction, weight gain, anticholinergic side effects and drowsiness than the other SSRIs. Has a short half life compared to other SSRIs and hence is the most prone to causing withdrawal effects whenever a dose is missed. Paroxetine has the lowest affinity for the sigma-1 receptors of all the SSRIs. It also possesses the highest propensity of any SSRI for causing <b>extrapyramidal</b> symptoms. Less hepatotoxic than most other antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|Haloperidol is {{a typical}} {{butyrophenone}} type antipsychotic that exhibits high affinity dopamine D2 receptor antagonism and slow receptor dissociation kinetics. It has effects similar to the phenothiazines. The drug binds preferentially to D2 and α1 receptors at low dose (ED50 = 0.13 and 0.42mg/kg, respectively), and 5-HT2 receptors at a higher dose (ED50 = 2.6mg/kg). Given that antagonism of D2 receptors is more beneficial on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors on the negative symptoms, this characteristic underlies haloperidol's greater effect on delusions, hallucinations and other manifestations of psychosis. Haloperidol's negligible affinity for histamine H1 receptors and muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptors yields an antipsychotic with a lower incidence of sedation, weight gain, and orthostatic hypotension though having higher rates of treatment emergent <b>extrapyramidal</b> symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The {{utility of}} broadly {{grouping}} the antipsychotics into first generation and atypical categories has been challenged. It {{has been argued}} that a more nuanced view, matching the properties of individual drugs to the needs of specific patients is preferable. While the atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics were marketed as offering greater efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms while reducing side effects (and <b>extrapyramidal</b> symptoms in particular) than typical medications, the results showing these effects often lacked robustness, and the assumption was increasingly challenged even as atypical prescriptions were soaring. In 2005 the US government body NIMH published the results of a major independent (not funded by the pharmaceutical companies) multi-site, double-blind study (the CATIE project). This study compared several atypical antipsychotics to an older typical antipsychotic, perphenazine, among 1,493 persons with schizophrenia. The study found that only olanzapine outperformed perphenazine in discontinuation rate (the rate at which people stopped taking it due to its effects). The authors noted an apparent superior efficacy of olanzapine to the other drugs in terms of reduction in psychopathology and rate of hospitalizations, but olanzapine was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects such as a major weight gain problem (averaging 9.4lbs over 18 months) and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. No other atypical studied (risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone) did better than the typical perphenazine on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic perphenazine (a result supported by a meta-analysis by Leucht et al. published in The Lancet), although more patients discontinued perphenazine owing to <b>extrapyramidal</b> effects compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%, P=0.002). A phase 2 part of this CATIE study roughly replicated these findings. Compliance has not been shown to be different between the two types. Overall evaluations of the CATIE and other studies have led many researchers to question the first-line prescribing of atypicals over typicals, or even to question the distinction between the two classes.|$|E
25|$|The reticulospinal tracts, {{also known}} as the {{descending}} or anterior reticulospinal tracts, are <b>extrapyramidal</b> motor tracts that descend from the reticular formation in two tracts to act on the motor neurons supplying the trunk and proximal limb flexors and extensors. The reticulospinal tracts are involved mainly in locomotion and postural control, although they do have other functions as well. The descending reticulospinal tracts are one of four major cortical pathways to the spinal cord for musculoskeletal activity. The reticulospinal tracts works with the other three pathways to give a coordinated control of movement, including delicate manipulations. The four pathways can be grouped into two main system pathways – a medial system and a lateral system. The medial system includes the reticulospinal pathway and the vestibulospinal pathway, and this system provides control of posture. The corticospinal and the rubrospinal tract pathways belong to the lateral system which provides fine control of movement.|$|E
