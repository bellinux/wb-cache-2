40|$|A self-latching jaw {{assembly}} is described {{which includes a}} pair of jaws for latching a fitting of an associated structure such as the keel fitting of a space telescope. The {{jaw assembly}} automatically locates the fitting received on a positioning pedestal and latches it in its original location on the pedestal without need of precision alignment. The first jaw is actuated {{and moved to the}} right whereupon a reciprocating plunger, extended from the nose of the jaw senses the <b>hub</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spool.</b> A jaw position responsive switch is then actuated to terminate the drive motor of the jaw. The astronaut will then actuate the drive motor of the jaw and the jaw will move to the left, whereupon the standoff will engage the face of the jaw in a latching position. In the latching position, the noses of the jaws will be under the flanges <b>of</b> the <b>spool...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{spool valve}} as a flow {{direction}} control valve has usually been used in a hydraulic system. In recent years, some hydraulic actuator systems need high accuracy control <b>of</b> the <b>spool</b> valve {{in order to control}} the delivery precisely. For the reason, it is very important practically to know dynamic motion <b>of</b> the <b>spool.</b> To analyze the dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>spool</b> valve, it is necessary to consider the dynamic motion <b>of</b> the <b>spool.</b> Springs, solenoids and working fluid, which is pressurized by the pump in the circuit, support the <b>spool.</b> The motion <b>of</b> the <b>spool</b> is governed complicatedly by pressure force, flow force, electromagnetic force and mechanical spring force acting on itself. As a result, it is difficult to analyze the dynamic motion <b>of</b> the <b>spool,</b> and therefore, any commercial code to calculate the dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>spool</b> valve dose not exist at present. Final target {{of this study is to}} develop numerical code to predict precisely the dynamic motion <b>of</b> the <b>spool</b> valve. As the first step, dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> a <b>spool</b> valve coupled with electromagnetic and mechanical effects have been conducted in the present paper...|$|R

A spool is used to make a solid connection between both drive wheels, which is simpler and less likely to break under very heavy acceleration. [...] Racing on dirt or mud tracks also allows the use <b>of</b> <b>spools,</b> because the loose surface gives way while cornering. [...] NASCAR mandates the use <b>of</b> <b>spools</b> in their cars, which does cause axle wind-up, and degrades handling in turns.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the effect on orifice {{discharge}} characteristic by the round angle of electro-hydraulic servo valve spool metering edge. The machining method <b>of</b> <b>spool</b> metering edge can cause micro round angle on the edge. This paper firstly provides 3 D geometry model and computational grids <b>of</b> <b>spool</b> valve where the round angle’s range is 0 - 10 µm and orifice opening is 0 - 40 µm. Secondly calculates the flow rate of the orifice on the constant differential pressure circumstances. The numerical analysis is performed by using the commercial code ‘‘Fluent’’, and the numerical results show the complete flow field inside the valve. The analysis result is to obtain the influence of round angle on discharge characteristic, quantitatively. An experimental result is used in this paper to evaluate and validate the numerical analysis of the valve.

40|$|Abstract: Pipe spool {{fabrication}} is {{an early}} stage in industrial construction projects and is crucial for the successful delivery of a project. Pipe spool fabrication is a complex and uncertain process due to the uniqueness of its products. The productivity of the fabrication process and the factors affecting productivity are therefore of great importance to project managers and construction researchers alike. Being able to identify all of the sig-nificant factors affecting productivity {{is critical to the}} ability to accurately estimate productivity and ultimately improve the fabrication process. This paper introduces the factors that affect the productivity <b>of</b> the pipe <b>spool</b> fabrication process that are not accounted for in the production unit <b>of</b> <b>spools.</b> In addition, the impact of each factor on productivity is illustrated, and different methods for modeling these factors are proposed. This paper provides a framework for a more comprehensive approach to estimating the productivity using the production unit <b>of</b> <b>spools...</b>|$|R

40|$|Unstable valve is a {{new concept}} that is {{concerned}} with implementing fast responsive and cost effective single stage direct acting electrohydraulic valves. The main issue is that in high ow rate and high bandwidth operations, the force and power required of the solenoid actuator for stroking the spool become prohibitive. Our approach is to utilize ow force induced instability to enhance the spool agility, so that the demand on the solenoids can be alleviated. However, the open loop instability and the nonlinear nature of the valve make the controller design more challenging. In this paper, a sliding mode controller is designed to stabilize the system and to achieve the displacement trajectory tracking. A case study validates the controller. The simulation also shows that this control scheme provides unstable valves with a benet of saving the electrical energy.
