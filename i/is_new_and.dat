25|$|A novel {{approach}} for testing the weak {{form of the}} Efficient Market Hypothesis is using quantifers derived from Information Theory. In this line, Zunino et al. found that informational efficiency is related to market size and the stage of development of the economy. Using a similar technique, Bariviera et al. uncover the impact of important economic events on informational efficiency. The methodology proposed by econophysicists Zunino, Bariviera and coauthors <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> alternative to usual econometric techniques, {{and is able to}} detect changes in the stochastic and or chaotic underlying dynamics of prices time series.|$|E

25|$|Galileo is {{to provide}} a new global search and rescue (SAR) {{function}} as part of the MEOSAR system. Satellites will be equipped with a transponder which will relay distress signals from emergency beacons to the Rescue coordination centre, which will then initiate a rescue operation. At the same time, the system is projected to provide a signal, the Return Link Message (RLM), to the emergency beacon, informing them that their situation has been detected and help is on the way. This latter feature <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> is considered a major upgrade compared to the existing Cospas-Sarsat system, which does not provide feedback to the user. Tests in February 2014 found that for Galileo's search and rescue function, operating as part of the existing International Cospas-Sarsat Programme, 77% of simulated distress locations can be pinpointed within 2km, and 95% within 5km.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} {{study showed}} that higher levels of media exposure are associated with lower reputations for companies, even when the mere exposure is mostly positive. A subsequent review of the research concluded that exposure leads to ambivalence because it brings about {{a large number of}} associations, which tend to be both favorable and unfavorable. Exposure is most likely to be helpful when a company or product <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> unfamiliar to consumers. An 'optimal' level of exposure to an advertisement may or may not exist. In a third study, experimenters primed consumers with affective motives. One group of thirsty consumers were primed with a happy face before being offered a beverage, while a second group was primed with an unpleasant face. The group primed with the happy face bought more beverages, and were also willing to pay more for the beverage than their unhappy counterparts. This study bolsters Zajonc's claim that choices are not in need of cognition. Buyers often choose what they 'like' instead of what they have substantially cognized.|$|E

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the accident, safety concerns were raised over the new AC72 class of yachts which had been chosen to compete in the 2013 America's Cup. This was the second accident involving the class; in October 2012 an Oracle Team USA AC72 also capsized in San Francisco Bay during training, causing substantial damage but no serious injuries. Christopher Clarey, writing in The New York Times, described the class as [...] "high-speed and high-risk." [...] Stephen Park, who heads the British Olympic sailing team, commented: [...] "they're very high powered and the loads on them are huge... these boats are untrodden waters for sailing. A lot of the loads {{and a lot of the}} equipment <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> there are a lot of unknowns and things being tested."

500|$|The game's story {{received}} a generally favourable reception. Brett Makedonski from Destructoid praised it as offering a very entertaining experience and engaging the player {{from start to}} finish, while Takahashi thought that the narration was [...] "ambitious". Orry further added that the story was very [...] "complicated". The game's narrative objects were praised for providing players new insight on the game's story by Buchholtz, though Houghton and Brown criticized that they broke the flow of gameplay and contain too much significant story information. Some critics believe that as the story progresses with the player's choices, it becomes easier to connect emotionally with the characters. The choices {{were thought to be}} important, weighty, and significant, and many claimed that they add replayability to the game and more control to players. Gies [...] added that this approach to choice <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> unique to this game. However, some critics were disappointed that these choices do not alter the outcome of the story.|$|E

As he completed his fifth trip to Iowa, party officials in the state remarked that he was [...] "making inroads" [...] in the state, commenting that [...] "Democrats are looking for somebody who <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> fresh." [...] The candidate revealed his economic goals during a speech, stating [...] "that creating opportunity for middle-class Americans will be a centerpiece of my campaign." [...] He then listed his objectives including: tax credits to pay for college tuition of low to mid-level income Americans, covering insurance costs of small businesses for its sickest employees, and incentives for saving and buying automobiles with [...] "good gas mileage." [...] However, in order to pay for these proposals, Bayh stated that raising taxes would be [...] "a decision worth making".|$|E

500|$|When {{writing on}} her {{personality}} in [...] "Alice on the Stage" [...] (April 1887), Carroll described her as [...] "loving and gentle", [...] "courteous to all", [...] "trustful", and [...] "wildly curious, {{and with the}} eager enjoyment of Life that comes only in the happy hours of childhood, when all <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> fair, and when Sin and Sorrow are but names — empty words signifying nothing!" [...] Commentators characterise her as [...] "innocent", [...] "imaginative", introspective, generally well-mannered, critical of authority figures, and clever. Others see less positive traits in Alice, writing that she frequently shows unkindness in her conversations with the animals in Wonderland, takes violent action against the character Bill the Lizard by kicking him into the air, and reflects her social upbringing in her lack of sensitivity and impolite replies. According to Donald Rackin, [...] "In spite of her class- and time-bound prejudices, her frightened fretting and childish, abject tears, her priggishness and self-assured ignorance, her sometimes blatant hypocrisy, her general powerlessness and confusion, and her rather cowardly readiness to abandon her struggles {{at the ends of}} the two adventures— many readers still look up to Alice as a mythic embodiment of control, perseverance, bravery, and mature good sense." ...|$|E
