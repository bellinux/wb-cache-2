5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies a cheap talk {{model in}} which two senders having partial and nonoverlapping private {{information}} simultaneously communicate with an uninformed receiver. The sensitivity of the receiver’s ideal action to one sender’s private information depends on the other sender’s private information. When senders have type-independent biases, their <b>information</b> <b>transmissions</b> exhibit strategic complementarity: more information transmitted by one sender leads to more information being transmitted by the other sender. When senders have type-dependent biases, their <b>information</b> <b>transmissions</b> can exhibit strategic substitutability. We also study delegation when senders have type-independent biases. When the two senders have like-biases, it is always optimal for the receiver to delegate decision rights to the sender with the smaller bias. When the senders have opposing biases, simultaneous communication {{is more likely to}} dominate delegation...|$|R

25|$|The {{uncertainty}} principle implies that individual photons may travel for short distances at speeds somewhat faster (or slower) than c, {{even in a}} vacuum; this possibility {{must be taken into}} account when enumerating Feynman diagrams for a particle interaction. However, it was shown in 2011 that a single photon may not travel faster than c. In quantum mechanics, virtual particles may travel faster than light, and this phenomenon is related to the fact that static field effects (which are mediated by virtual particles in quantum terms) may travel faster than light (see section on static fields above). However, macroscopically these fluctuations average out, so that photons do travel in straight lines over long (i.e., non-quantum) distances, and they do travel at the speed of light on average. Therefore, this does not imply the possibility of superluminal <b>information</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E

We propose a bivariate analysis with China as benchmark. By testing the constancy of the conditional correlations, we use an extended constant or dynamic conditional correlation GARCH model. The empirical findings show that across the daytime <b>information</b> <b>transmissions,</b> the relationships between China and Asian markets are closer than China and non-Asian markets, whereas through the overnight <b>information</b> <b>transmissions</b> these relationships are inverse. The analysis provides, before the crisis, that the overnight volatility spillover effects are from China to the United States and the United Kingdom. During the crisis, China affects the United Kingdom in terms of daytime volatility spillovers, whereas in terms of overnight volatility spillovers China affects the United States and is influenced by Japan. After the crisis, daytime volatility spillovers are from Taiwan to China, whereas the overnight volatility spillover effects are from China to the United States and the United Kingdom...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} the impact of the introduction of foreign investments on the <b>information</b> <b>transmissions</b> between the futures and spot markets in terms of volatility spillovers when macroeconomic factors are controlled in emerging futures markets. We find evidence of significant bi-directional volatility spillovers across the two markets, but volatility spillovers from the futures to spot markets are stronger than vice versa following the opening up of Taiwan's futures markets to foreign investments. This pattern suggests that the futures market leads the spot market in order to incorporate the arrival of new information after the liberalization and deregulation policies have been adopted in Taiwan futures markets. The volatility transmission mechanism is asymmetric in some instances, suggesting that the spot market has become more sensitive to innovations originating in futures market after the foreign investments (FIs) are introduced in the local futures market. Overall, these results document that increased participation of FIs in emerging futures market may enhance the rate of information flow and improve the quality and reliability of <b>information</b> <b>transmissions</b> of the local futures market, supporting that deregulation is appropriate. ...|$|R

40|$|Wireless powered {{communication}} network (WPCN) {{is a novel}} networking paradigm that uses radio frequency (RF) wireless energy transfer (WET) technology to power the <b>information</b> <b>transmissions</b> of wireless devices (WDs). When energy and information are transferred in the same frequency band, a major design issue is transmission scheduling to avoid interference and achieve high communication performance. Commonly used centralized scheduling methods in WPCN may result in high control signaling overhead and thus are not suitable for wireless networks constituting {{a large number of}} WDs with random locations and dynamic operations. To tackle this issue, we propose in this paper a distributed scheduling protocol for energy and <b>information</b> <b>transmissions</b> in WPCN. Specifically, we allow a WD that is about to deplete its battery to broadcast an energy request buzz (ERB), which triggers WET from its associated hybrid access point (HAP) to recharge the battery. If no ERB is sent, the WDs contend to transmit data to the HAP using the conventional $p$-persistent CSMA (carrier sensing multiple access). In particular, we propose an energy queueing model based on an energy decoupling property to derive the throughput performance. Our analysis is verified through simulations under practical network parameters, which demonstrate good throughput performance of the distributed scheduling protocol and reveal some interesting design insights that are different from conventional contention-based {{communication network}} assuming the WDs are powered with unlimited energy supplies.
