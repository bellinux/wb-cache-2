40|$|Abstract Background A {{recent review}} {{highlighted}} important relationships between combinations of movement behaviours (i. e., sleep, sedentary behaviour, and physical activity) and health indicators among school-aged {{children and youth}} (aged 5 - 17  years). It is unclear whether similar relationships exist in younger children. Therefore, this review sought to examine the relationships between combinations of movement behaviours and health indicators {{in the early years}} (1. 00  month to 4. 99  years). Methods Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and SportDiscus were searched for relevant studies up to November 2016, with no date or study design limits. Included studies met the a priori-determined population (apparently healthy children aged 1. 00  month to 4. 99  years), intervention (combination of ≥ 2 movement behaviours [i. e., sleep and sedentary behaviour; sleep and physical activity; sedentary behaviour and physical activity; and sleep, sedentary behaviour, and physical activity]), comparator (various levels and combinations of movement behaviours), and health outcome/indicator (Critical: adiposity, motor development, psychosocial health/emotional regulation, cognitive development, fitness, and growth; Important: bone and skeletal health, cardiometabolic health, and risks). For each health indicator, quality of evidence was assessed by study design using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Results Ten articles (n =  7436  participants; n =  5 countries) were included. Across observational and experimental study designs, the most <b>ideal</b> <b>combinations</b> of sedentary behaviour and physical activity were: favourably associated with motor development and fitness among preschool-aged children (3. 00 to 4. 99  years); both favourably and not associated with adiposity among toddlers (1. 10 to 2. 99  years) and preschool-aged children; and not associated with growth among toddlers and preschool-aged children. The most <b>ideal</b> <b>combinations</b> of sleep and sedentary behaviour were favourably associated with adiposity among infants (1. 00  month to 1. 00  years) and toddlers. Quality of evidence ranged from “very low” to “moderate”. Conclusions The most <b>ideal</b> <b>combinations</b> of movement behaviours (e. g., high sleep, low sedentary behaviour, high physical activity) may be important for optimal health in the early years. Findings can help inform movement behaviour guidelines for the early years. Given the limited evidence, future {{research is needed to determine}} the ideal distribution of daily movement behaviours for optimal health throughout the early years...|$|R

Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man, but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church; he was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister, mustn't you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive; but Mrs. Lynde says he isn't married, or even engaged, because she made special inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have a young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the congregation and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing woman, isn't she, Matthew? I'm very glad they've called Mr. Allan. I liked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he meant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it. Mrs. Lynde says he isn't perfect, but she says she supposes we couldn't expect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year, and anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly on all the points of doctrine.

6000|$|Isabel, as a dispassionate witness, had {{not been}} struck {{with the force of}} Mrs. Touchett's {{characterisation}} of her visitor, who had an expressive, communicative, responsive face, by no means of the sort which, to Isabel's mind, suggested a secretive disposition. It was a face that told of an amplitude of nature and of quick and free motions and, though it had no regular beauty, was in the highest degree engaging and attaching. Madame Merle was a tall, fair, smooth woman; everything in her person was round and replete, though without those accumulations which suggest heaviness. Her features were thick but in perfect proportion and harmony, and her complexion had a healthy clearness. Her grey eyes were small but full of light and incapable of stupidity--incapable, according to some people, even of tears; she had a liberal, full-rimmed mouth which when she smiled drew itself upward to the left side in a manner that most people thought very odd, some very affected and a few very graceful. Isabel inclined to range herself in the last category. Madame Merle had thick, fair hair, arranged somehow [...] "classically" [...] and {{as if she were a}} Bust, Isabel judged--a Juno or a Niobe; and large white hands, of a perfect shape, a shape so perfect that their possessor, preferring to leave them unadorned, wore no jewelled rings. Isabel had taken her at first, as we have seen, for a Frenchwoman; but extended observation might have ranked her as a German--a German of high degree, perhaps an Austrian, a baroness, a countess, a princess. It would never have been supposed she had come into the world in Brooklyn--though one could doubtless not have carried through any argument that the air of distinction marking her in so eminent a degree was inconsistent with such a birth. It was true that the national banner had floated immediately over her cradle, and the breezy freedom of the stars and stripes might have shed an influence upon the attitude she there took towards life. And yet she had evidently nothing of the fluttered, flapping quality of a morsel of bunting in the wind; her manner expressed the repose and confidence which come from a large experience. Experience, however, had not quenched her youth; it had simply made her sympathetic and supple. She was in a word a woman of strong impulses kept in admirable order. This commended itself to Isabel as an <b>ideal</b> <b>combination.</b>|$|E

40|$|The biomechanical and {{metabolic}} {{demands of}} human running are distinctly affected by velocity and body weight. As runners increase velocity, ground reaction forces (GRF) increase, which {{may increase the}} risk of an overuse injury, and more metabolic power is required to produce greater rates of muscular force generation. Running with weight support attenuates GRFs, but demands less metabolic power than normal weight running. We used a recently developed device (G-trainer) that uses positive air pressure around the lower body to support body weight during treadmill running. Our scientific goal was to quantify the sepa-rate and combined effects of running velocity and weight support on GRFs and metabolic power. After obtaining this basic data set, we identified velocity and weight support combinations that resulted in dif-ferent peak GRFs, yet demanded the same metabolic power. <b>Ideal</b> <b>combinations</b> of velocity and weight could potentially reduce biomechanical risks by attenuating peak GRFs while maintaining aerobic and neuromuscular benefits.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{understanding of}} industry dynamics {{is critical to}} strategy research because individual firm performance dynamics both reflect and affect change at the industry level. Descriptive research on industry dynamics has identified a dominant pattern where prices fall, output rises, {{and the number of}} firms rises and then falls over time. A number of models have been advanced to explain these patterns with a particular focus on explaining why a shakeout in the number of firms occurs. In the most prominent models, shakeout is generated by rising realized heterogeneity among firms that is either assumed to be unrecognized but determined ex ante or is generated by stochastic innovation outcomes coupled with convex adjustment costs and scale advantages in innovation and learning. In this paper, we develop an alternative model where heterogeneity develops among firms over time (leading to a shakeout) because firms must make choices over highly interdependent productive activities where the <b>ideal</b> <b>combinations</b> cannot be easily deduced or imitated. By combining two established models (a Cournot model of competition with an NK model of interdependency in production activities) we are able to advance an alternative explanation for the observed patterns of industry behavior including shakeout.
