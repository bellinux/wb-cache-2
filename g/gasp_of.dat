5|$|The killing {{process at}} Treblinka {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} method used at Auschwitz and Majdanek, where the poison gas Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide) was used. At Treblinka, Sobibór, Chełmno, and Bełżec, the victims died from suffocation and carbon monoxide poisoning. After visiting Treblinka on a guided tour, Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss concluded that using exhaust gas was inferior to the cyanide used at his extermination camp. The chambers became silent after 12 minutes and were closed for 20 minutes or less. According to Jankiel Wiernik, who survived the 1943 prisoner uprising and escaped, when {{the doors of the}} gas chambers had been opened, the bodies of the dead were standing and kneeling rather than lying down, due to the severe overcrowding. Dead mothers embraced the bodies of their children. Prisoners who worked in the Sonderkommandos later testified that the dead frequently let out a last <b>gasp</b> <b>of</b> air when they were extracted from the chambers. Some victims showed signs of life during the disposal of the corpses, but the guards routinely refused to react.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no effort}} {{to end the war}} by {{diplomatic}} means between 6 November 1870 and 23 January 1871. During that period Favre and Ernest Picard were the only voices in the government advocating a capitulation or a sortie torrentielle, a major military undertaking. By 27 December, when howitzers had begun to strike the Parisian fortresses, the city was facing famine and loss of morale. On 5 January the residential areas of the city fell under bombardment. The last <b>gasp</b> <b>of</b> French military resistance came at the battle of Buzenval on 19 January. They were defeated. On 20 January Trochu asked for a local armistice to bury the dead, but Bismarck refused. The French president resigned, and on 22 January when a council of war proposed a second mass sortie, there was no officer willing to lead it.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} [...] "No One Knows" [...] was generally positive. In The Guardian review of Songs for the Deaf, Dave Simpson said [...] "'No One Knows' has killer riffs to spare". Playlouder were similarly enthused, calling the song [...] "soulful, {{like the last}} <b>gasp</b> <b>of</b> the hero in an old western". Eric Carr of Pitchfork Media called it an [...] "easy groove" [...] and [...] "four-to-the-floor slime of the highest quality".|$|E

500|$|Madonna's {{version of}} the song begins {{with the sound of}} {{acoustic}} guitars and synth strings. Madonna's voice sounds high-pitched, eluding the deeper resonance of the tune. After the first verse, Tony Thompson starts playing the drums, which moves along the rhythm of the song. Towards the end, Madonna sings the song like a soul singer and the song ends with a <b>gasp</b> <b>of</b> breath. The song was recorded at Power Station Studio in Manhattan, New York. Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. I was very much into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, you go out there and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record." ...|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{analyzed}} the film within {{a discussion of}} the genre of blaxploitation: [...] "As the audience for blaxploitation dwindled, it seemed as if Car Wash and The Wiz might be the last <b>gasp</b> <b>of</b> what had been a steadily expanding black presence in mainstream filmmaking." [...] The St. Petersburg Times noted, [...] "Of course, it only took one flop like The Wiz (1978) to give Hollywood an excuse to retreat to safer (i.e., whiter) creative ground until John Singleton and Spike Lee came along. Yet, without blaxploitation there might not have been another generation of black filmmakers, no Denzel Washington or Angela Bassett, or they might have taken longer to emerge." [...] The Boston Globe commented, [...] "the term 'black film' should be struck from the critical vocabulary. To appreciate just how outmoded, deceptive and limiting it is, consider the following, all of which have been described as black films, [...] [...] [...]" [...] and characterized The Wiz in a list which also featured 1970s films Shaft, Blacula, and Super Fly.|$|E
500|$|A {{journalist}} wrote, in {{the late}} 1890s, that Leno was [...] "probably the highest paid funny man in the world". In 1898, Leno, Herbert Campbell and Johnny Danvers formed a consortium to build the Granville Theatre in Fulham, which was demolished in 1971. Leno published an autobiography, Dan Leno: Hys Booke, in 1899, ghostwritten by T. C. Elder. Leno's biographer J. Hickory Wood commented: [...] "I can honestly say that I never saw him absolutely at rest. He was always doing something, and had {{something else to do}} afterwards; or he had just been somewhere, was going somewhere else, and had several other appointments to follow." [...] That year, Leno performed the role of [...] "waxi omo" [...] (a slang expression for a black-face performer) in the Doo-da-Day Minstrels, an act that included Danvers, Campbell, Bransby Williams, Joe Elvin and Eugene Stratton. [...] The troupe's only performance was at the London Pavilion on 29 May 1899 as part of a benefit. [...] Leno's song [...] "The Funny Little Nigger" [...] greatly amused the audience. His biographer Barry Anthony considered the performance to be [...] "more or less, the last <b>gasp</b> <b>of</b> black-face minstrelsy in Britain".|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{the first major}} American bands began appearing, like Blue Öyster Cult and Aerosmith, and musicians like Eddie Van Halen began their career. Heavy metal remained, however, a largely {{underground}} phenomenon. During the 1980s, a pop-based form of hard rock, with a party-hearty spirit and a glam-influenced visual aesthetic (sometimes referred to as [...] "hair metal") dominated the music charts, led by superstars like Poison, Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe, and Ratt. The 1987 debut of Guns N' Roses, a hard rock band whose image reflected the grittier underbelly of the Sunset Strip, was {{at least in part}} a reaction against the overly polished image of hair metal, but that band's wild success was in many ways the last <b>gasp</b> <b>of</b> the hard-rock and metal scene. By the mid-1980s, as the term [...] "heavy metal" [...] became the subject of much contestation, the style had branched out in so many different directions that new classifications were created by fans, record companies, and fanzines, although sometimes the differences between various subgenres were unclear, even to the artists purportedly belonging to a given style. The most notable of the 1980s metal subgenres in the United States was the swift and aggressive thrash metal style, pioneered by bands like Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, so you really didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first <b>gasp</b> <b>of</b> life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be. And I just thought he did that so great." ...|$|E
500|$|From August 1975 to May 1976, the Allman Brothers Band played 41 {{shows to}} some of the biggest crowds of their career. Gradually, the members of the band grew apart during these tours, with sound checks and rehearsals [...] " [...] a thing of the past." [...] Allman later pointed to a benefit for presidential {{candidate}} Jimmy Carter (an avowed fan of the group) as the only real [...] "high point" [...] in an otherwise [...] "rough, rough tour." [...] The shows were considered lackluster and the members were excessive in their drug use. The [...] "breaking point" [...] came when Gregg Allman testified in the trial of security man Scooter Herring. Bandmates considered him a [...] "snitch", and he received death threats, leading to law-enforcement protection. Herring was convicted on five counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and received a 75-year prison sentence, which was later reduced prior to a presidential pardon from Carter. For his part, Allman always maintained that Herring had told him to take the deal to turn state's evidence and that he (Herring) would take the fall; nevertheless, the band refused to communicate with Allman after the incident. As a result, the band finally broke up; Leavell, Williams, and Jaimoe continued playing together in Sea Level, Betts formed Great Southern, and Allman founded the Gregg Allman Band. The 1976 live album Wipe the Windows, Check the Oil, Dollar Gas was seen as [...] "the last <b>gasp</b> <b>of</b> a dying band," [...] which was unfortunate for the now-foundering Capricorn Records, which desperately needed the band together to stay afloat.|$|E

2500|$|An eclectic album, Kamaal/The Abstract {{serves as}} a {{departure}} from Q-Tip's debut album Amplified (1999), which is more mainstream-oriented in its style and production approach. The album has Q-Tip rapping, singing, and exploring his jazz influences. While it contains elements of hip hop, pop, and rock music, the album's improvisational sound is generally rooted in jazz and funk. The album's songs mostly feature loose arrangements that provide space for improvisation. Its instrumentation is characterized by electric piano, flute playing, deep organs, guitar-fuelled grooves, and improvised solos. On its musical style, music critic John Bush wrote that Kamaal/The Abstract [...] "pays homage to the last <b>gasp</b> <b>of</b> organically produced mainstream pop in the '70s and '80s, paying a large compliment to Prince and Stevie Wonder".|$|E
2500|$|In February 2013, Yorke {{told the}} Guardian that though Radiohead {{had hoped to}} subvert the {{corporate}} music industry with In Rainbows, he feared they had instead played {{into the hands of}} content providers such as Apple and Google: [...] "They have to keep commodifying things to keep the share price up, but in doing so they have made all content, including music and newspapers, worthless, in order to make their billions. And this is what we want?" [...] Later that year, Yorke and Godrich made headlines for their criticism of the music streaming service Spotify. In July, they removed Atoms for Peace and Yorke's solo music from the service. In a series of tweets, Yorke wrote: [...] "Make no mistake, new artists you discover on Spotify will not get paid. Meanwhile shareholders will shortly be rolling in it... New artists get paid fuck-all with this model." [...] Yorke called Spotify [...] "the last <b>gasp</b> <b>of</b> the old industry", accusing it of only benefiting major labels with large back catalogues, and encouraged artists to build their own [...] "direct connections" [...] with audiences instead.|$|E
