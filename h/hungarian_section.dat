[...] The pro-Czechoslovak Hungarian National Party (not {{to be confused with}} a different Hungarian National Party formed later) participated in the parliamentary elections of 1920, but failed. In 1922, the Czechoslovak government proposed correction of some injustices against minorities in exchange for absolute loyalty and recognition of the Czechoslovak state. Success of activism culminated in the mid-1920s. In 1925, the Hungarian National Party participated in the adoption of several important laws, including those regulating state citizenship. In 1926, the party unsuccessfully held negations about participation in government. Left-wing Hungarian activists were active in the Hungarian-German Social Democratic Party and later in the Hungarian Social Democratic Labor Party. Hungarian social democrats failed in competition with communists but were active as a <b>Hungarian</b> <b>section</b> of the Czechoslovak Social Democracy Party (ČSDD). In 1923, Hungarian activists with agrarian orientation founded the Republican Association of Hungarian Peasants and Smallholders but this party failed similarly to the Hungarian-minority's Provincial Peasant Party. Like social-democrats, Hungarian agrarians created a separate section within the statewide Agrarian Party (A3C). Hungarian activism had a stable direction but was not able to become dominant power due to various reasons like land reform or revisionist policies of the Hungarian government.|$|E

40|$|The world {{exhibition}} as is typical phenomena of the 19 th century western culture represented {{a powerful tool}} for self-representation of economical and cultural power. During the decades of the existence of the Austro-Hungarian Empire one of the main goals of the Hungarian political elite was to elaborate the image of an economically, politically and culturally independent country. The selection of fine art works depended strongly on conservative taste the selection criteria for applied works were mainly influenced by their capacity of representational power. Since originality and national style was a leitmotiv of the turn-of-the-century cultural policies applied art objects had not only an economical but also a cultural goal. “Hungarian style” works served to show up the image of a culturally independent country and to gain new markets for Hungarian entrepreneurs. The paper deals with the first cultural representation of Hungary at the 1867 Paris {{world exhibition}} from the aspect of ethnography and Hungarian cultural policy. This universal exhibition is widely recognized of how folk art has influenced on applied arts (Deneke 1964). This leaded to the renewal of the definition, practice and style of the applied art artifacts in the following decades therefore represents the root of the flourishing turn-of-the-century arts and crafts. The <b>Hungarian</b> <b>sections</b> of the 1867 Paris Universal Exhibition were insufficient for cultural representation largely due the political changes occurring during the year. The exhibition of Hungarian folk culture especially the folk costumes has drawn special interest from foreign critics. This interest in Hungarian costumes has its origin in the exhibition of photographs representing peasants of different nationality from Hungary wearing traditional costumes at the London Universal Exhibition (Kresz 1968). From this moment exhibiting peasant culture (costumes, objects, housing) composed {{an important part of the}} <b>Hungarian</b> <b>sections</b> at universal exhibitions between 1862 - 1878 emphasizing not only rich folk traditions but the ethnic/ethnographical diversity of the country. It is worth examining the reception of the Hungarian folk exhibition at the 1867 Paris universal exhibition through the writings of the official French critic Victor Cosse. Cosse had a considerable influence on his contemporaries he wrote and edited the official journal of the exhibition entitled: Exposition Universelle de 1867, (Paris, 1868). In his writings he argued for the assimilation of the nationalities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, supporting the idea of a politically and culturally homogenized Austrian culture in which the “existing nationalities will soon be dissolved in the corps of the Austrian nation” (Cosse 1867). This conception is mainly based on the consideration of Austria-Hungary and Germany as being both empires of German langue and culture. The paper intends to examine the critical reception of the Hungarian ethnographic exhibition by comparing the message of the installation and the exhibited objects with its foreign critical reception. The analyze of the interpretations and misinterpretations shall include the political contexts of the 1860 ’: the effects of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise and the political negotiations leading towards the creation of the unified Germany. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{debate over}} the best {{position}} for the GSSP of {{the base of the}} Ladinian remained intense throughout the last decade. The main topics of this debate have been summarized in a recent STS/IGCP meeting in Veszprém, Hungary (September 2002). A major problem on the definition of the GSSP was there emphasized by Vörös (2002), and is related to the physical recognition of the boundary in stratigraphic sections of historical meaning in various regions. Among the proposed possibilities: the highest position (FAD of Eoprotrachyceras curionii) is probably accetable for researchers of the Alpine region, but cannot be identified with confidence in Hungary; on the contrary, low positions (i. e., base of Reitzi Zone, or FAD of Reitziites reitzi) are clearly identified in <b>hungarian</b> <b>sections</b> but are rarely seen in the Southern Alps. Vörös (2002) points out that at least five possible criteria exist for the Anisian – Ladinian boundary, all more or less satisfactory from the scientific point of view. He thus suggests to move towards a compromise, i. e., a criterion which allows the physical recognition of the boundary in the largest number of stratigraphic sections. Following these suggestions, in November 2002 we endeavoured an integration of the ammonoid biostratigraphy in the classical section of Bagolino in Lombardy (Brack and Rieber, 1986, 1993), that resulted successful (Mietto et al., in press). We are thus able to raise a compromise proposal for the GSSP of the base of the Ladinian at the FAD of Aplococeras avisianum at Bagolino. This boundary can be positively recognized at least in Hungary, in the Southern Alps, and in Nevada. According to Brack et al. (this volume), we accept Bagolino as a reliable stratigraphic section for the base of the Ladinian. Readers are invited to refer to Brack et al. (this volume) for the description of the section and the geology of the area; only minor adjustments to this part are here proposed...|$|R

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of flow structures in groyne fields interacting with the flow generated by navigation. Groynes are traditionally constructed to ensure adequate water depth for navigation, so the interaction of navigation and groyne fields is nearly guaranteed. The <b>Hungarian</b> Danube <b>section</b> – {{which is part of}} the 7 th European transport corridor – has a great importance, however, there are several places where the minimum 25 dm navigational water depth is not available in low water regime. As the River Waal (a branch of River Rhine), which falls in the same category of navigable waterways as River Danube, in my TU Delft based research I used that particular Dutch river as case study. The goal of this graduation project is formulated as follows: What kind of effects does navigation have on river morphology? This was investigated on physical basis by means of a numerical model. First, the influence of push towing on morphology is investigated by analyzing the bed shear stress distributions, then the impacts on groyne fields. It could be concluded that primary waves caused by push tows increase the bed shear stresses around the ship, moreover, groyne fields are also affected, especially their zone close to the main stream. The impact of different ship sets on shear stresses was also studied. It was found that the most significant effect was caused by the ship velocity, the sailing distance between ship and groynes, a moderate one by the ship’s width and a minor one by the ship’s length. A numerical morphological model could offer a more detailed insight in the morphological changes than analyzing the bed shear-stress distribution, only, a recommendation for future studies is therefore the implementation of such a model. FINEL 2 D’s capability of predicting the flow changes at groyne fields caused by navigation have been shown, although FINEL 2 D only uses advective momentum transport (but suffering from some numerical viscosity) to predict the flow, while in the groyne fields inhomogeneous turbulent processes are supposed to be dominating. Nevertheless, FINEL 2 D showed a sufficient match with physical model results. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Az értekezés magában foglalja a jelenlegi clevelandi magyarság templomainak és társadalmi szervezeteinek ismertetését, valamint az idők során magyar szervezetei feloszlását, jelenlegi magyar vállalkozóit és cégeit, rendszeres és kimagasló eseményeit, lakosságának létszámának becslését, és a második világháború után menekült hullám hatását a jelenlegi clevelandi magyar társadalomra. A kutatás vázolja továbbá az elmúlt 60 év Clevelandben szerkesztett és kiadott magyar folyóiratokat és a magyar könyvkiadást, valamint néhány clevelandi magyar író munkáját, köztük Eszterhás István és Somogyi Ferenc néhány művét. A clevelandi Magyar Kongresszus rendszeres látogatója, Gábor Áron irodalmát ismerteti és irodalmilag elemzi, végül a jelenlegi magyar publikációkat és rádióprogramokat mutatja be. Nyelvhasználati szemszögből a kutatás kilenc reprezentativ személy átgondolt észrevételeit mutatja be, hogy mik azok a tényezők, amelyek miatt meg lehet tartani külföldön is a magyar nyelv használatát második és harmadik generációban is, holott a kivándorlóknak 90 %-a beolvad, feladja anyanyelvét. Végezetül, a kutatás a clevelandi magyar közösség hazafiasságát méri fel abból a szemszögből, hogy hány clevelandi magyar szolgált az amerikai hadseregben 1951 -től mostanáig, és közülük néhány katonai és életpályáját, motivációjukat ismerteti. A clevelandi magyarok 2011 -ben egy zsugorodó, de mégis élénk és hazafias közösséget formáló csoportot alkotnak, mely továbbra is fenntartja magyar nyelvét és hagyományait. The {{state of}} Hungarians in Cleveland in 2011 {{is that of}} a {{shrinking}} yet still vibrant and patriotic community with extended roots significantly shaped by the DP generation, a community that continues to maintain its Hungarian language and traditions. The dissertation’s methodology is qualitative, comparative, and interdisciplinary to give the academic scholar familiarity with what it is like {{and what it means to}} be Hungarian in Cleveland. Research entails mostly primary sources and personal interviews, with the use of some secondary sources. The dissertation addresses the vibrancy of Cleveland’s Hungarian community, beginning with a snapshot of life in 1951 to compare to today, showing neighborhoods, churches, organizations, businesses, and ongoing and major galvanizing community events. It shows that despite a shrinking Hungarian population, it nevertheless remains an active and vibrant community, continuing to maintain its traditions and to retard assimilation for the second and third generations. The dissertation shows a new way of ascertaining the Hungarian population, going beyond traditional census figures and delving into funeral and organizational mailing list statistics. It also traces the legacy of the DP generation, showing its impact on Cleveland’s most viable Hungarian organizations. The dissertation addresses the literature of Cleveland’s Hungarians, what they read and what they published. It includes case studies of István Eszterhás, Ferenc Somogyi, local Cleveland Hungarian authors, as well as Áron Gábor, an emigre author and recurring visitor who shared many of the values of Hungarians in Cleveland. The next section analyzes how Cleveland’s Hungarian community maintains its Hungarian language, specifically showing the factors that impact Hungarian language maintenance and use. Nine in-depth interviews were conducted with a variety of second and third generation members of Cleveland’s Hungarian community to ascertain the factors impacting their language use in the family and in the community. Using their own insights garnered from the interviews, the chapter shows the importance of parenting, friends, and community. In addition, the study shares linguistic insights, reasons for assimilation and the role of American spouses. The dissertation then shows the patriotism of Cleveland’s Hungarian community. It shows the values of Hungarians in Cleveland vis-à-vis their Hungarian ancestry and heritage as evidenced by the Hungarian statues, gardens, and memorials they have placed and dedicated through the years. It also shows their relationship to their adopted and/or native country from the perspective of their U. S. military service, looking at Cold War historical events through the personal life stories of hundreds of Cleveland <b>Hungarians.</b> One <b>section</b> is devoted to the 1950 ’s and the Korean war, and another to the Vietnam war. The patriotism of the community is also shown by the volunteers who continued to serve through the end of the Cold War and into today’s conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as by those Cleveland Hungarians who served in the U. S. military for over twenty years. The bulk of this study is the author’s own primary historical research. Finally, the conclusion of the dissertation addresses recent developments in Cleveland, including the reopening of St. Emeric church in 2012, a Facebook group as well as a playgroup, and the outlook for the future...|$|R
