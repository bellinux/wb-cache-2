25|$|The {{crevalle jack}} reaches sexual {{maturity}} at different lengths in males and females, with estimates suggesting males reach maturity at 55cm and {{four to five}} years of age, and females at 66cm and five to six years of age. Reproduction is thought to occur year round in most areas, although there are peaks in activity. South of Florida, this period is between March and September, in Cuba it is April and May, while in Jamaica no definitive peak has yet been identified. The species also has a protracted spawning in Ghana, although a peak in activity occurs between October and January. Juveniles are also present in lagoons year round in this location, indicating year round spawning and recruitment. The place of spawning also appears to be variable, with the act occurring offshore south of Florida, while in Colombia and Belize, they have been observed spawning over inshore reefs and bays. Large aggregations of crevalle jack form prior to spawning, with these schools containing upward of 1000 individuals. Pairs break off from the school to spawn, with one individual turning a much darker color during this exchange. Once spawning has occurred, the pair rejoins the main school. Fecundity in the species has been estimated as up to one million eggs, with these being pelagic, and spherical in shape. They have a diameter of 0.7 to 0.9mm, and contain a pigmented yolk and one yellow oil globule with dark pigments. The larvae have been extensively described in the scientific literature, although the sequence of fin formation is still not well known. Defining features of the larval crevalle jack include a relatively <b>deep</b> <b>body,</b> heavily pigmented head and body, and more detailed meristic characteristics, with flexion occurring at 4 to 5mm in length.|$|E
2500|$|Designs were {{tendered}} by Saunders-Roe (S.36), Supermarine (Type 314), Blackburn Aircraft (b. 20) and Shorts. The Blackburn B.20 was {{a radical}} design that offered much better performance, {{by reducing the}} drag associated with a flying boat hull and so a prototype was ordered to test the concept. Of the other designs the Supermarine was the first choice with Saro and Shorts tied in second place. The Supermarine was ordered [...] "off the drawing board" [...] i. e. without requiring prototypes to be produced and flown first. Supermarine's commitment to the Spitfire meant that work was not expected to start {{for two years and}} so the Ministry looked to the other designs. Saunders-Roe had redesigned the S.36 in the meantime—replacing low hull and gull wing with a <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> and high wing—and the Supermarine order was transferred to the S.36. The contract was issued in June 1937 to buy 21 of the S.36, receiving the service name Lerwick (after the town of Lerwick). The aircraft was a compact twin-engined, high-winged monoplane of all-metal construction.|$|E

2500|$|Sonic's {{greatest}} strength is his running speed, being {{known as the}} game's universe as the world fastest hedgehog. Many of his abilities are variations on the tendency for hedgehogs to roll into tight balls for protection {{with the addition of}} spinning his body. Since his introduction in 1991's Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic's primary offensive maneuver is the basic [...] "Spin Attack" [...] (or [...] "Sonic Spin Attack"). Later games in the series expanded on this basic attack and two of these enhancements have become mainstays of his: the Spin Dash which was introduced in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and involves Sonic spinning on the spot before blasting off at full speed, and the Homing Attack, officially introduced in Sonic Adventure, in which Sonic dashes toward a target in midair. Sonic's only weakness is that he cannot swim, sinking like a rock if plunged to a <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> of water. When the seven Chaos Emeralds are collected and used, Sonic transforms into [...] "Super Sonic", a faster and invulnerable version of himself that can fly. In Super Sonic form, Sonic's eyes change to red and his body becomes golden.|$|E
2500|$|The crevalle jack, Caranx hippos (also {{known as}} the common jack, black-tailed trevally, couvalli jack, black cavalli, jack crevale and yellow cavalli) is a common species of large marine fish {{classified}} within the jack family, Carangidae. The crevalle jack is distributed across the tropical and temperate waters of the Atlantic Ocean, ranging from Nova Scotia, Canada to Uruguay in the west Atlantic and Portugal to Angola in the east Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea. It is distinguishable from similar species by its <b>deep</b> <b>body,</b> fin colouration {{and a host of}} more detailed anatomical features, including fin ray and lateral line scale counts. It {{is one of the largest}} fish in the genus Caranx, growing to a maximum known length of 124cm and a weight of 32 kg, although is rare at lengths greater than 60cm. The crevalle jack inhabits both inshore and offshore waters to depths of around 350 m, predominantly over reefs, bays, lagoons and occasionally estuaries. Young fish dispersed north by currents in the eastern Atlantic are known to migrate back to more tropical waters before the onset of winter; [...] however, if the fish fail to migrate, mass mortalities occur as the temperature falls below the species' tolerance limits.|$|E
2500|$|This {{theory is}} false. [...] RF current does tend to flow {{on the surface}} of conductors, but the depth to which it penetrates, called skin depth, depends on the {{resistivity}} and permittivity of the material as well as the frequency. [...] Although skin effect limits currents of Tesla coil frequencies to the outer fraction of a millimeter in metal conductors, the skin depth of the current in body tissue is much deeper due to its higher resistivity and lower permittivity. [...] The depth of penetration of currents of Tesla frequency (0.1 - 1MHz) in human tissues is roughly 24 to 72cm (9 to 28 inches). [...] Thus skin effect has little influence on the path of the current through the body; it takes the path of lowest electrical impedance to ground, and can easily pass through the core of the body. [...] In the medical therapy called longwave diathermy, RF current of Tesla frequencies was used for decades for deep tissue warming, including heating internal organs such as the lungs. [...] Modern shortwave diathermy machines use a higher frequency of 27MHz, which would have a correspondingly smaller skin depth, yet these frequencies are still able to penetrate <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> tissues.|$|E

2500|$|However {{this does}} not mean the current is harmless. [...] Even a small Tesla coil {{produces}} many times the electrical energy necessary to stop the heart, if the frequency happens to be low enough to cause ventricular fibrillation. [...] A minor misadjustment of the coil could result in electrocution. [...] In addition, the RF current heats the tissues it passes through. Tesla coil currents, applied directly to the skin by electrodes, were used in the early 20th century for <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> tissue heating in the medical field of longwave diathermy. [...] The amount of heating depends on the current density, which depends on the power output of the Tesla coil and the cross-sectional area of the path the current takes through the body to ground. [...] Particularly if it passes through narrow structures such as blood vessels or joints it may raise the local tissue temperature to hyperthermic levels, [...] "cooking" [...] internal organs or causing other injuries. [...] International ICNIRP safety standards for RF current in the body in the Tesla coil frequency range of 0.1 - 1MHz specify a maximum current density of 0.2mA per square centimeter and a maximum power absorption rate (SAR) in tissue of 4W/kg in limbs and 0.8W/kg average over the body. [...] Even low power Tesla coils could exceed these limits, and it is generally impossible to determine the threshold current where bodily injury begins. [...] Being struck by arcs from a high power (> 1000 watt) Tesla coil is likely to be fatal.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the reason}} for the {{frequent}} choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts, even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York—and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States. Commercial contracts almost always include a [...] "choice of law clause" [...] to reduce uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, contracts throughout the world (for example, contracts involving parties in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) often choose the law of New York, even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the United States' commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States. Similarly, American corporations are often formed under Delaware corporate law, and American contracts relating to corporate law issues (merger and acquisitions of companies, rights of shareholders, and so on.) include a Delaware choice of law clause, because of the <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> of law in Delaware on these issues. On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (for example, England and Wales, and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law. Outside the United States, parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales, particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth. The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations, and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law to achieve that result.|$|E

60|$|Elizabeth Endorfield had a repute {{among women}} {{which was in}} its nature {{something}} between distinction and notoriety. It was founded on the following items of character. She was shrewd and penetrating; her house stood in a lonely place; she never went to church; she wore a red cloak; she always retained her bonnet indoors {{and she had a}} pointed chin. Thus far her attributes were distinctly Satanic; and those who looked no further called her, in plain terms, a witch. But she was not gaunt, nor ugly in the upper part of her face, nor particularly strange in manner; so that, when her more intimate acquaintances spoke of her the term was softened, and she became simply a <b>Deep</b> <b>Body,</b> who was as long-headed as she was high. It may be stated that Elizabeth belonged to a class of suspects who were gradually losing their mysterious characteristics under the administration of the young vicar; though, during the long reign of Mr. Grinham, the parish of Mellstock had proved extremely favourable to the growth of witches.|$|E
60|$|Quentin {{now found}} little {{difficulty}} in singling him out, for the commanding situation {{of which he}} had possessed himself, and the use he made of his terrible mace, caused many of the assailants to seek safer points of attack than that where so desperate a defender presented himself. But Quentin, to whom the importance attached to victory over this formidable antagonist was better known, sprung from his horse {{at the bottom of the}} breach, and, letting the noble animal, the gift of the Duke of Orleans, run loose through the tumult, ascended the ruins to measure swords with the Boar of Ardennes. The latter, as if he had seen his intention, turned towards Durward with mace uplifted; and they were on the point of encounter, when a dreadful shout of triumph, of tumult, and of despair, announced that the besiegers were entering the city at another point, and in the rear of those who defended the breach. Assembling around him, by voice and bugle, the desperate partners of his desperate fortune, De la Marck, at those appalling sounds, abandoned the breach, and endeavoured to effect his retreat towards a part of the city from which he might escape to the other side of the Maes. His immediate followers formed a <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> of well disciplined men, who, never having given quarter, were resolved now not to ask it, and who, in that hour of despair, threw themselves into such firm order that their front occupied the whole breadth of the street, through which they slowly retired, making head from time to time, and checking the pursuers, many of whom began to seek a safer occupation, by breaking into the houses for plunder. It is therefore probable that De la Marck might have effected his escape, his disguise concealing him from those who promised themselves to win honour and grandeur upon his head, but for the stanch pursuit of Quentin, his uncle Le Balafre, and some of his comrades. At every pause which was made by the lanzknechts, a furious combat took place betwixt them and the Archers, and in every melee Quentin sought De la Marck; but the latter, whose present object was to retreat, seemed to evade the young Scot's purpose of bringing him to single combat. The confusion was general in every direction. The shrieks and cries of women, the yelling of the terrified inhabitants, now subjected to the extremity of military license, sounded horribly shrill amid the shouts of battle--like the voice of misery and despair contending with that of fury and violence, which should be heard farthest and loudest.|$|E
