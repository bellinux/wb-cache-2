5|$|After Fielding {{returned}} {{to working with}} the Royal Theatre, Drury Lane, he wrote The Lottery, which first ran on 1 January 1732 alongside Addison's Cato. The play was successful and was performed 15 times during January. He altered the play in February, and the revised form ran for 14 more nights during that season and was put on each year until 1740 and occasionally thereafter until 1783. The story deals with Chloe's desire to play the lottery and pokes <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> the London lottery system and those who support it.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan scored {{their first}} {{international}} hit with H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), satirising {{the rise of}} unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in The Sorcerer, love between members of different social classes). As {{with many of the}} Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically {{near the end of the}} story.|$|E

5|$|On November 1, 2008, Fey {{once again}} portrayed Palin, {{this time in}} a sketch {{featuring}} the real John McCain, the last of numerous sketches featuring the Arizona Senator. In the sketch, McCain poked <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> himself and his campaign, as well as Barack Obama's purchase of airtime on several major networks earlier in the week. In the sketch, McCain and Palin can only afford to buy airtime on QVC, a home-shopping channel. McCain's wife, Cindy, also made an appearance in the sketch as herself.|$|E
5|$|Students {{publish a}} campus comedy magazine, The Plague. Like many college humor magazines, this often pokes <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> popular culture {{as well as}} campus life and the idiosyncrasies of New York University. The Plague was founded in 1978 by Howard Ostrowsky along with Amy Burns, John Rawlins, Joe Pinto and Dan Fiorella, and is {{currently}} published once per semester. It is not NYU's first humor magazine, as The Medley was a humor magazine published by the Eucleian Society from 1913 to 1950.|$|E

5|$|The {{expanded}} and altered version of The Welsh Opera, The Grub-Street Opera, was first rehearsed in May 1731, {{but it never}} ran on stage. It was printed and exists in a complete printed format, {{and it is possible}} that it was not performed because of government intervention. Its original printing was done without Fielding's consent, and it is uncertain as to when Fielding's official version of the play was printed. The plot focuses on a standard love story but with characters that exhibit less than virtuous characteristics. The title pokes <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> the Grub Street Journal and also links to the theme within the plot of attacking theatre in general.|$|E
5|$|Cyrus {{hosted the}} March 5, 2011, episode of Saturday Night Live, {{during which she}} {{performed}} {{in a number of}} skits and poked <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> her recent controversies. She later made an appearance on the MTV series Punk'd, appearing with Kelly Osbourne and Khloé Kardashian. Cyrus starred in the independent film LOL (2012) with Demi Moore. The film had a limited release, and was critically and commercially unsuccessful. She then starred in the comedy film So Undercover, appearing as an FBI agent who is required to go undercover at a college sorority. It was also reported on August 2, 2011, by Contact Music that Cyrus had signed on to star in an untitled comedy in which she plays a woman who breaks a promise to God. It was later announced that Cyrus would star in the film Family Bond, portraying a girl who tracks down her estranged spy father in an attempt to save her kidnapped mother.|$|E
5|$|Keate was {{followed}} by other romantic poets including William Sotheby (Ode, Netley Abbey, Midnight, 1790). Sotheby's view of the abbey was gothic; he peoples the ruins with spectral processions and ghostly Cistercians. Nor was he the only one; in 1795 Richard Warner wrote a potboiler entitled Netley Abbey, a Gothic Story in two volumes, featuring skullduggery at the abbey during the middle ages. Dark deeds before the Dissolution also appeared in the section of Richard Harris Barham's Ingoldsby Legends (1847) covering Netley. This complex satire pokes <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> the medieval church and the monks (whom he accuses of having walled up an erring nun {{in one of the}} vaults and ensuring God’s revenge upon them) and the tourists who crowded contemporary Netley, {{while at the same time}} showing appreciation of the beauty of the ruins.|$|E

5|$|Otaku often {{participate}} in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga otaku {{are the subject}} of numerous self-critical works, such as Otaku no Video, which contains a live-interview mockumentary that pokes <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> the otaku subculture and includes Gainax's own staff as the interviewees. Other works depict otaku subculture less critically, such as Genshiken and Comic Party. A well-known novel-cum-manga-cum-anime is Welcome to the N.H.K., which focuses on the subcultures popular with otaku and highlights other social outcasts such as the hikikomori and NEETs. Works that focus on an otaku character include WataMote, the story of an unattractive and unsociable otome game otaku who exhibits delusions about her social status. Watamote is a self-mocking insight that follows the heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, Otaku Unite!, focuses on the American side of the otaku culture.|$|E
5|$|She was {{assigned}} {{to try to stop}} the MTV Movie Awards from featuring a South Park satire which poked <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> Scientology and the film based on a book by its founder L. Ron Hubbard, titled Battlefield Earth. Christman repeatedly called the New York City office of MTV in an attempt to get them to stop the satire from airing. In the eventual broadcast, which ran June 8, 2000, the South Park character Cartman was shown using a Scientology personality test as toilet paper. Christman believed she had succeeded in her mission, for she thought that her efforts prevented the book Dianetics from being used by Cartman, instead of the personality test.|$|E
5|$|The Orb's album art {{features}} much of {{the same}} imagery as their live act. Graphic design group The Designers Republic created the cover art for the earlier work, including Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld, U.F.Orb, and the singles from those two albums. For their next album, the Orb poked <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> their Pink Floyd comparisons with the cover of Live 93 featuring a floating stuffed sheep over the Battersea Power Station, which had appeared on the cover of Pink Floyd's Animals. The artwork found in Badorb.com releases was similar to the Orb's odd artwork of the mid-1990s, as it was stylistically similar and contained little writing. Paterson has also dabbled in the creation of cover art himself, designing the cover of Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt.|$|E

5|$|The Simpsons Game is {{an action}} {{platformer}} video game {{based on the}} animated television series The Simpsons and loosely on the film, made for the Nintendo DS, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The game was developed, published, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by The Simpsons writers Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton. In the self-referential plot, the family discovers that {{they are forced to}} participate in another The Simpsons video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> popular culture, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{group that}} would become the Round Table began meeting in June 1919 {{as the result of}} a {{practical}} joke carried out by theatrical press agent John Peter Toohey. Toohey, annoyed at The New York Times drama critic Alexander Woollcott for refusing to plug one of Toohey's clients (Eugene O'Neill) in his column, organized a luncheon supposedly to welcome Woollcott back from World War I, where he had been a correspondent for Stars and Stripes. Instead Toohey used the occasion to poke <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> Woollcott on a number of fronts. Woollcott's enjoyment of the joke and the success of the event prompted Toohey to suggest that the group in attendance meet at the Algonquin each day for lunch.|$|E
