5|$|Spermaceti, {{obtained}} {{primarily from}} the spermaceti organ, and sperm oil, obtained {{primarily from the}} blubber in the body, were much sought after by eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth century whalers. These substances found a variety of commercial applications, such as candles, soap, cosmetics, machine oil, other specialised lubricants, lamp oil, pencils, crayons, leather waterproofing, rust-proofing materials and many pharmaceutical compounds. Ambergris, a solid, waxy, <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> produced in the digestive system of sperm whales, was also sought as a fixative in perfumery.|$|E
5|$|During the British Civil Wars (mid-17th {{century in}} Great Britain), both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used various {{incendiary}} devices to attack enemies and destroy property {{that might be}} used for military purposes, according to historian Stephen Porter in Destruction in the English Civil Wars. The flaming arrow attack was used to set fire to buildings at a distance. An arrow with a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> attached to the shaft, close to the tip, was shot from a bow or short-muzzled musket. Such arrows shot from a musket had their feathers removed, to fit inside the muzzle, and were called fire-darts. These devices were cheap to make and easy to prepare. Although used infrequently during the wars, the flaming arrows and darts proved to be destructive. The Royalists shot flaming arrows into the thatched homes {{in the suburbs of}} Chester causing extensive damage. Lyme Regis was partly razed using flaming arrows.|$|E
25|$|A Molotov {{cocktail}} is a {{breakable glass}} bottle containing a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> such as gasoline, alcohol or a napalm-like mixture, with some motor oil added, and usually {{a source of}} ignition such as a burning cloth wick {{held in place by}} the bottle's stopper. The wick is usually soaked in alcohol or kerosene, rather than petrol.|$|E

25|$|The Molotov {{cocktail}} is {{a generic}} name {{used for a}} variety of improvised incendiary weapons. Due to the relative ease of production, they are frequently used by amateur protesters and non-professionally equipped fighters in urban guerrilla warfares. They are primarily intended to set targets ablaze rather than instantly destroy them. A Molotov cocktail is a breakable glass bottle containing a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> such as gasoline/petrol or a napalm-like mixture, with some motor oil added, and usually a source of ignition such as a burning cloth wick held in place by the bottle's stopper. The wick is usually soaked in alcohol or kerosene, rather than gasoline.|$|E

2500|$|The rate of {{decomposition}} {{increases with}} rising temperature, concentration and pH, with cool, dilute, acidic solutions showing the best stability. Decomposition is catalysed by various compounds, including most transition metals and their compounds (e.g. manganese dioxide, silver, and platinum). Certain metal ions, such as [...] or , {{can cause the}} decomposition {{to take a different}} path, with free radicals such as (HO·) and (HOO·) being formed. Non-metallic catalysts include potassium iodide, which reacts particularly rapidly and forms the basis of the elephant toothpaste experiment. Hydrogen peroxide can also be decomposed biologically by the enzyme catalase. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide liberates oxygen and heat; this can be dangerous, as spilling high-concentration hydrogen peroxide on a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> can cause an immediate fire.|$|E
50|$|One {{scenario}} {{consists of}} the reactor pressure vessel failing all at once, with the entire mass of corium dropping into {{a pool of water}} (for example, coolant or moderator) and causing extremely rapid generation of steam. The pressure rise within the containment could threaten integrity if rupture disks could not relieve the stress. Exposed <b>flammable</b> <b>substances</b> could burn, but there are few, if any, <b>flammable</b> <b>substances</b> within the containment.|$|R

50|$|A BLEVE {{need not}} be a {{chemical}} explosion—nor does there need to be a fire—however if a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> is subject to a BLEVE it may also be subject to intense heating, either from an external source of heat which may have caused the vessel to rupture in the first place or from an internal source of localized heating such as skin friction. This heating can cause a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> to ignite, adding a secondary explosion caused by the primary BLEVE. While blast effects of any BLEVE can be devastating, a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> such as propane can add significantly to the danger.|$|E
