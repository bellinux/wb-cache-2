5|$|After {{destroying}} <b>his</b> <b>workshop,</b> Hoffman is {{attacked and}} subdued by three pig-masked figures, {{one of whom}} is Lawrence. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Lawrence has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, a videotape in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. To this end, Lawrence has Hoffman brought to the disused bathroom and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence appears, throws the hacksaw he used to sever his own foot out the door, and then turns off the lights and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.|$|E
5|$|Confusion {{over the}} {{colouration}} of the Mascarene parrot {{has also been}} furthered by a plate by French engraver and naturalist François-Nicolas Martinet in Buffon's 1779 Histoire Naturelle Des Oiseaux, the first coloured illustration of this species. It shows the bird as brown with a purplish head, {{and the strength of}} these colours differs considerably between copies, a result of having been hand-coloured by many different artists who worked under Martinet in <b>his</b> <b>workshop.</b> Across these copies, the body ranges from chestnut brown to greyish chocolate, the tail from light grey to blackish grey-brown, and the head from bluish grey to dove-grey. The plate also lacks two dark central tail feathers without white bases, a feature described by Brisson, and these features have been repeated by subsequent artists. Martinet's illustration and Buffon's description were perhaps based on the Paris specimen.|$|E
5|$|El Greco made Toledo his home. Surviving {{contracts}} mention him as {{the tenant}} from 1585 onwards of a complex consisting of three apartments and twenty-four rooms which belonged to the Marquis de Villena. It was in these apartments, which also served as <b>his</b> <b>workshop,</b> that he passed {{the rest of his}} life, painting and studying. He lived in considerable style, sometimes employing musicians to play whilst he dined. It is not confirmed whether he lived with his Spanish female companion, Jerónima de Las Cuevas, whom he probably never married. She was the mother of his only son, Jorge Manuel, born in 1578, who also became a painter, assisted his father, and continued to repeat his compositions for many years after he inherited the studio. In 1604, Jorge Manuel and Alfonsa de los Morales gave birth to El Greco's grandson, Gabriel, who was baptized by Gregorio Angulo, governor of Toledo and a personal friend of the artist.|$|E
50|$|Peter Pearson is an American icon painter, author, {{and teacher}} of icon painting. He has created {{hundreds}} of icons for private collectors, churches, {{and other institutions}} throughout the world. Through <b>his</b> <b>workshops</b> and seminars, he has worked with more than 2,500 students. <b>His</b> <b>workshops</b> give even the most inexperienced painter the skills to paint their own icon.|$|R

5|$|Sheffield has an {{international}} reputation for metallurgy and steel-making. Many innovations in these fields {{have been made}} in Sheffield, for example Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique in the 1740s at <b>his</b> <b>workshop</b> in Handsworth. This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter. Thomas Boulsover invented Sheffield Plate (silver-plated copper) in the early 18thcentury. Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in 1912, and the work of F. B. Pickering and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels. Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the Advanced Manufacturing Park by Sheffield's universities and other independent research organisations. Organisations located on the AMP include the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between the Boeing Company and the University of Sheffield), Castings Technology International (CTI), The Welding Institute (TWI), and William Cook Group.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti also pursued an {{abortive}} {{project to}} install a second giant equestrian statue in Old Palace Yard, this time portraying Edward, the Black Prince. He envisaged the two statues facing each other {{on either side of}} the entrance to the House of Lords. Although the scheme was reported in several journals, including the Illustrated London News, the Art Journal and the Athenaeum, and was strongly criticised for its perceived thematic inappropriateness, nothing came of it. Three different versions of the model for Marochetti's Black Prince came to light at the turn of the 21st century. They appear to have been designed at the same time as his Richard I, demonstrating their common origins; models of the two statues almost certainly would have co-existed in <b>his</b> <b>workshop</b> and Marochetti probably intended to seek a commission from Prince Albert. However, the death of the Prince Consort in 1861 deprived him of his most influential patron, and Marochetti's own death was to follow in 1867. Queen Victoria purchased one of Marochetti's statuette versions of the Black Prince following the sculptor's death and gave it to her son Edward, Prince of Wales. It is still part of the Royal Collection.|$|E

25|$|But in the meantime, a few {{innovative}} craftsmen {{could still}} give new impulses {{to the production}} of black-figure vases. The most imaginative potter of the time, also a talented businessman, was Nikosthenes. Over 120 vases bear his signature, indicating that they were made by him or in <b>his</b> <b>workshop.</b> He seems to have particularly specialized in producing vases for export to Etruria. In <b>his</b> <b>workshop</b> the usual neck amphoras, Little Masters, Droop and eye cups were produced, but also a type of amphora reminiscent of Etruscan bucchero pottery, named the Nikosthenic amphora after its creator. These pieces were found particularly in Caere, the other vase types usually in Cerveteri and Vulci. The many inventions in <b>his</b> <b>workshop</b> were not limited to forms. In Nikosthenes’ workshop {{what is known as the}} Six’s technique was developed, in which figures were painted in reddish brown or white atop a black glossy slip. It is not clear whether Nikosthenes also painted vases, in which case he is usually presumed to be identical with Painter N. The BMN Painter and the red-figure Nikosthenes Painter are also named after Nikosthenes. In <b>his</b> <b>workshop</b> he employed many famous vase painters, including the elderly Lydos, Oltos and Epiktetos. The workshop tradition was continued by Nikosthenes’ successor, Pamphaios.|$|E
25|$|Undeterred, Roach {{negotiated}} {{the use of}} a boiler in a neighbouring factory, ran 200 feet of pipe from their boiler to <b>his</b> <b>workshop,</b> and was back in production within 48 hours.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the above-mentioned bow makers, most 19th-century Parisian violin makers worked in <b>his</b> <b>workshop,</b> including Hippolyte Silvestre, Jean-Joseph Honoré Derazey, Charles Buthod, Charles-Adolphe Maucotel, Télesphore Barbé, Paul Bailly and George Gemünder.|$|E
50|$|Pamphaios {{signature}} survives on {{more than}} fifty vases - spelled different ways by various artists, it probably functioned as a trademark on <b>his</b> <b>workshop's</b> products.|$|R

25|$|Nestor Audinot, a pupil of Sébastien Vuillaume, himself Jean-Baptiste's nephew, succeeded him in <b>his</b> <b>workshop</b> in 1875. Vuillaume died at {{the height}} of his career, widely {{regarded}} as the pre-eminent luthier of his day.|$|E
25|$|In 1943-1955 Dushkin {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} mainline railroads and chaired the Architectural Department and Workshop of Ministry of Railways.

25|$|Vuillaume was an {{innovative}} violin maker and restorer, and a tradesman who traveled all of Europe {{in search of}} instruments. Due to this fact, most instruments by the great Italian violin makers passed through <b>his</b> <b>workshop.</b> Vuillaume then made accurate measurements of their dimensions and made copies of them.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the great}} bow makers of the 19th century collaborated with <b>his</b> <b>workshop.</b> Jean Pierre Marie Persois, Jean Adam, Dominique Peccatte, Nicolas Rémy Maire, François Peccatte, Nicolas Maline, Pierre Simon, François Nicolas Voirin, Charles Peccatte, Charles Claude Husson, Joseph Fonclause, Jean Joseph Martin, and Prosper Colas {{are among the most}} celebrated.|$|E

50|$|In Bath Patrick Alexander set up {{the first}} of a series of <b>workshops.</b> <b>His</b> most prestigious <b>workshop</b> wasThe Mount at Batheaston {{purchased}} in 1900 and here he had a gas supply brought into the garden and a balloon inflation valve installed. Town gas, although not as light as Hydrogen, was readily available and very much less expensive; it was, of course, highly flammable. <b>His</b> <b>workshops</b> were fully equipped and employed several people, there he designed and manufactured experimental balloons and meteorological instruments.|$|R
25|$|Brabham's {{early career}} {{continued}} the engineering theme. At {{the age of}} 15 he left school to work, combining {{a job at a}} local garage with an evening course in mechanical engineering. Brabham soon branched out into his own business selling motorbikes, which he bought and repaired for sale, using his parents' back veranda as <b>his</b> <b>workshop.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{other works}} have been {{attributed}} to him or <b>his</b> <b>workshop,</b> but without being generally accepted. In particular six scenes (two panels are painted on both sides) from an altarpiece from Champmol, now equally divided between Antwerp and Baltimore, have often been attributed to him, although iconographic and stylistic details suggest a Mosan origin.|$|E
25|$|<b>His</b> <b>workshop</b> {{became the}} most {{important}} in Paris and within twenty years, it led Europe. A major factor in his success was his 1855 purchase of 144 instruments made by the Italian masters for 80,000 francs, from the heirs of Luigi Tarisio, an Italian tradesman. These included the Messiah Stradivarius and 24 other Stradivari.|$|E
