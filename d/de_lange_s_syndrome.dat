40|$|Long {{will they}} live, work and learn. A scheme for {{understanding}} and influencing employability {{during the life}} span A. Nauta, A. H. <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> en <b>S.</b> Gortz, Gedrag & Organisatie, volume 23, June 2010, nr. 2, pp. 136 - 157 To stimulate employees' employability until high age, knowledge is needed about what people of different ages want with regard to work; this knowledge is discussed in this article. Calendar age {{appears to be a}} weak predictor of employability. More important are specific indicators of 'age', namely the ages of (1) professionalism; (2) private situation; (3) psycho-social experience; and (4) health-both physical and neuro-cognitive. We describe how these four 'ages' change over a lifetime and to what changes in work-related needs they may lead. Professionalism is rather stable during peoples' careers; private situation becomes salient as soon as employees have children; most people want to feel young; and the likelihood of health complaints grows with increasing age. Nevertheless, complaints can stay away for a long time when employees live a healthy life and keep on learning. We recommend organisations to align their HR-practices with changes in all four 'ages'. These HR-practices are summarised in a scheme for employability and life span, which also gives guidelines for future research...|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{contribution}} of the Dutch economist Dr. H. M. <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> to the ecumenical debate on social-ethics. To this end, the first part gives a description of the work of <b>De</b> <b>Lange.</b> Through the individual <b>De</b> <b>Lange</b> the study provides an insight in the worldwide ecumenical movement and the ecumenical work in the Netherlands. The contribution of <b>De</b> <b>Lange</b> to ecumenical social ethics is that he consistently elaborated, propagated and practised the ideas that were developed in the ecumenical movement. To that end, <b>De</b> <b>Lange</b> built a huge network of people. To show the importance of <b>De</b> <b>Lange,</b> this network, the discussions he had in this network and the actions he set in motion, are described. This first part is as such an outline of recent history based on the interaction between <b>De</b> <b>Lange</b> and his time. In order not to loose sight of the thinking of <b>De</b> <b>Lange,</b> the second part goes into three elements of them. First, <b>De</b> <b>Lange,</b> student of Jan Tinbergen, is positioned as an economist. <b>De</b> <b>Lange</b> wanted to exercise his profession in a normative way. We can position <b>De</b> <b>Lange</b> in the circles of institutional economists, like Galbraith. Two of <b>De</b> <b>Langes</b> books are analysed. In his dissertation Shaping a Responsible Society (1966) he aims to find out whether the ecumenical concept of the Responsible Society (which in fact is a criterion) can {{play a role in the}} building process of an economic order and in the creation of economic policy. The book Beyond Poverty and Affluence (1986, with Goudzwaard) shows that structural flaws in economic theory lead to losses in society. It aims at an economy where the need for care is central and where the choice of production, consumption and income is subservient to that need. The next chapter is a description of <b>De</b> <b>Langes</b> anthropology. <b>De</b> <b>Lange</b> was challenged by the personalism of Banning and by the way Berdjajew spoke hopefully of men. Jewish authors are appreciated by him for their emphasis on the relational aspects of human being, their way of approaching ethics and theology (‘to know God is to know what one has to do’) and their fundamental optimism. He criticizes people who, under the influence of the Catechism of Heidelberg, think negatively of men. <b>De</b> <b>Lange</b> speaks of hope as a duty. The concept of the Responsible Society, developed within the World Council of Churches, is at the heart of <b>De</b> <b>Lange’s</b> thinking. If people are called by God to be responsible, society must offer room to practice responsibility. ‘Where social structures restrain man from answering God, we have the duty to cooperate in the process of liberation’. The concept was criticized and replaced, but close reading shows that not all this criticism does justice to the concept. <b>De</b> <b>Lange</b> opposes all talk of responsibility that rejects government intervention. To him, the central themes of the ecumenical social ethics remained justice, participation and sustainability, concepts with great relevance also for the problems of today...|$|R

40|$|Aim Children with Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> {{syndrome}} frequently {{present to}} otolaryngology services with hearing problems. Airway problems have not previously been reported. We wish to describe {{our experience of}} the overall management {{in a series of}} children with Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome. Methods Retrospective case note review of children diagnosed with Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome presenting to our department between 2005 and 2014. Results Six patients were seen. Airway problems consisted of laryngeal overspill with severe gastroesophageal dysmotility and reflux despite structurally normal airway (1 case), laryngomalacia requiring supraglottoplasty (2 cases), reflux laryngitis with secondary laryngomalacia and coincidental tracheal diverticulum (1 case) choanal atresia requiring stents (1 case) and obstructive sleep apnoea (1 case). Supraglottoplasty produced a dramatic improvement in feeding and breathing in both children who underwent the procedure. Two children had palatal anomalies and one underwent cochlear implantation for a profound sensorineural hearing loss. Conclusion Children with Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome have multifaceted ENT problems. Airway pathology has not previously been described in Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome but has been common in our experience.

40|$|Background: Recent {{literature}} on the behavioural phenotype of Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome suggests that the trajectory {{of a number of}} behaviours may be atypical in the syndrome, including mood and sociability however {{there is a lack of}} quantitative research to support these findings. Methods: Three empirical studies were conducted. The first study employed a questionnaire design to follow up mood, interest and pleasure over a two-year period in individuals with Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome. The second study involved the development of an informant-based questionnaire to examine the trajectory of sociability in Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome. The third study employed an experimental design to examine indicators of social anxiety in adolescents and adults with Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome. Results: Low mood and reduced initiation of social interactions with unfamiliar people is characteristic of older adolescents and adults with Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome. Reduced verbalisation is also evident in this group when demands involving the initiation of speech are placed upon these individuals and this is related to impairments in both planning and working memory. A high rate of selective mutism is also characteristic of Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome. Conclusion: The trajectory of both mood and sociability appears atypical in Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome. Cognitive impairments may underpin these behavioural differences in adolescents and adults with the syndrome. A hypothetical model of the pathway from genes to behaviour via cognition is proposed for older adolescents and adults with the syndrome.

40|$|Abstract Background Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} dysmorphic facial features, hirsutism, severe growth and developmental delay. Germline mutations in the NIPBL gene with an autosomal dominant pattern and in the SMC 1 A gene with an X-linked pattern {{have been identified in}} Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome. Case presentation A two-month-old Iranian boy who showed multiple congenital anomalies was referred to the genetic center of a welfare organization in southwest Iran. He was the second child of a non-consanguineous marriage, born after full term with normal delivery. His birth weight was 3110 g, his length was 46 cm and his head circumference was 30 cm. Both parents were clinically asymptomatic, with no positive history of any deformity in their respective families. Conclusions Sequencing of the NIPBL gene from our patient revealed a single-base deletion of thymidine in exon 10 (c. 516 delT). This mutation presumably results in premature termination at codon 526. We did not observe this mutation in the parents of our patient with Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome. The results presented here enlarge the spectrum of NIPBL gene mutations associated with Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome by identifying a novel de novo mutation in an Iranian patient with Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome and further support the hypothesis that NIPBL mutations are disease-causing mutations leading to Cornelia <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> syndrome. </p...|$|R
