5|$|In 1924 {{the family}} moved to Mount Vernon, New York, a popular Jewish area of Westchester County. Nevelson was upset with the move, which removed her from city life and her artistic environment. During the winter of 1932–1933 she {{separated}} from Charles, unwilling to becoming the socialite wife he <b>expected</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be. She never sought financial support from Charles, and in 1941 the couple divorced.|$|E
5|$|As {{her health}} went downhill, Emmeline Pankhurst {{moved into a}} nursing home in Hampstead. She {{requested}} that she be treated by the doctor who attended to her during her hunger strikes. His use of the stomach pump had helped her feel better while in prison; her nurses were sure that the shock of such treatment would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request. Before the procedure could be carried out, however, she fell into a critical condition from which none <b>expected</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> recover. On Thursday 14 June 1928 Pankhurst died, {{at the age of}} 69. She was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London.|$|E
5|$|Despite the one-sided {{national}} loss in 1984, Ferraro {{was still}} viewed as {{someone with a}} bright political future. Many <b>expected</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> run in the 1986 United States Senate election in New York against first-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato, and during 1985 she did Upstate New York groundwork towards that end. A Senate candidacy had been her original plan for her career, before she was named to Mondale's ticket. But in , {{she said she would}} not run, due to an ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe on her and her husband's finances stemming from the 1984 campaign revelations.|$|E

5|$|Ellie Victoria Cole {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Lilydale on 12 December 1991. Her mother and {{grandfather}} were both swimmers, and her father was athletic. At two years of age, she was diagnosed with a rare tumour, a sarcoma that was wrapped around the nerves of her right leg. After unsuccessful attempts to treat her cancer with chemotherapy, her right leg was amputated above the knee on 14 February 1994. Eight weeks after the surgery, as part of her rehabilitation, Cole's mother Jenny enrolled her in swimming lessons. Cole's instructors <b>expected</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> take up to a year to learn how to swim in a straight line, but it took her two weeks.|$|E
25|$|Slowly, Koen {{rose to the}} top. In 1938, she ran {{her first}} world record (11.0seconds in the 100yards), and she also won her first {{international}} medals. At the European Championships in Vienna, she won the bronze in both the 100 and 200m, which were both won by Stanisława Walasiewicz. Many observers, and Koen herself, <b>expected</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> do well at the upcoming Olympics, which were due {{to be held in}} Helsinki in July 1940.|$|E

It was Tate who first suggested he read Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which she thought would make a good film; he subsequently <b>expected</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> star in it. Nearly a decade after Tate's death, he met Nastassja Kinski, a model and aspiring young actress who had already been in a number of European films. He offered her the starring role, which she accepted. Her father was Klaus Kinski, a leading German actor, who had introduced her to films.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} her 77th year, Coretta began {{experiencing}} health problems. Her husband's former secretary, Dora McDonald, assisted her part-time in this period. Hospitalized in April 2005, a {{month after}} speaking in Selma at the 40th anniversary of the Selma Voting Rights Movement, she was diagnosed with a heart condition and was discharged on her 78th and final birthday. Later, she suffered several small strokes. On August 16, 2005, she was hospitalized after suffering a stroke and a mild heart attack. Initially, she was unable to speak or move her right side. King's daughter Bernice reported that she had been able to move her leg on Sunday, August 21 while her other daughter and oldest child Yolanda asserted that the family <b>expected</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> fully recover. She was released from Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta on September 22, 2005, after regaining some of her speech and continued physiotherapy at home. Due to continuing health problems, Mrs. King cancelled a number of speaking and traveling engagements throughout the remainder of 2005. On January 14, 2006, Coretta made her last public appearance in Atlanta at a dinner honoring her husband's memory. On January 26, 2006, King checked into a rehabilitation center in Rosarito Beach, Mexico under a different name. Doctors did not learn her real identity until her medical records arrived the next day, and did not begin treatment due to her condition.|$|E

However, Pritzker took {{herself out of the}} running. According to the Chicago Tribune, she withdrew her name from consideration [...] "due to obligations to her family, for whom she was still overseeing billions in assets, and the financial crisis, which was putting some of those assets at risk". As a result of her public support for President Obama, Pritzker found herself the target of labor groups for Hayatt Hotels' practices. The president of Unite Here cited her connection to Obama as a reason why the group <b>expected</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> use better labor practices as the group staged demonstrations against Pritzker.|$|E

Barbauld's penchant for study worried her mother, who <b>expected</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> end up a spinster because of her intellectualism; the two were never as close as Barbauld and her father. Yet Barbauld's mother was proud of her accomplishments and in later years wrote of her daughter: [...] "I once indeed knew a little girl who was as eager to learn as her instructors could be to teach her, and who at two years old could read sentences and little stories in her wise book, roundly, without spelling; and in half a year more could read as well as most women; but I never knew such another, and I believe never shall." ...|$|E

[...] "I wanted to die," [...] she says, close to tears.

500|$|In August 2002, Baptiste {{was fined}} £500 after being {{found guilty of}} {{deliberately}} failing to attend the inquiry. Climbié's parents, speaking through a family friend, said, [...] "we, the family, <b>expected</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be dealt with more severely". This {{was the first time}} a person had been prosecuted for not attending a public inquiry. In September 2002, Arthurworrey and Mairs were sacked following disciplinary procedures. The education secretary, Charles Clarke, also added them to the Protection of Children Act 1999 List, banning them from working with children. In October 2004, Arthurworrey appealed against her dismissal, saying that she was duped by Kouao and Manning, misled by medical reports, badly advised by her managers, and that she was a scapegoat for other people's failures, but the appeal was rejected. In 2005, she appealed the ban preventing her from working with children and won the case. In 2004, Mairs appealed her ban preventing her from working with children and won; this decision was challenged in the High Court but she prevailed. In 2004, six police officers involved in the case faced misconduct charges. All six kept their jobs, and some received reprimands and cautions. In 2004, the General Medical Council dropped misconduct charges against Dr. Schwartz.|$|E

The carrier, Guido Antonini Wilson (who is referred to in the press by both Antonini and Wilson and who is sometimes referred to by the nicknames [...] "El Gordo" [...] or [...] "The Fat Man"), is an interpreter and was part of a delegation of executives that traveled to Argentina in advance of Chávez' energy deal signing.

When forced to open it, he began to stammer and show signs of nervousness, and he said the suitcase only contained about $60,000. The blocks turned out to be US$790,550. The delegation, which arrived on a Cessna Citation jet from Caracas, Venezuela, chartered by Energía Argentina, SA, carried five Venezuelans and three Argentines who represented their respective governments' energy companies.
