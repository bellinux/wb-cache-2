5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus, {{he placed his}} hands to his temples, fingers {{extended}}; with the final words, he extended <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole possessed his own coat of arms, {{to which}} he proved his {{entitlement}} by descent from armigerous ancestors, expressed in heraldic terminology as Quarterly, Gules and Or a Fleur de lis Argent {{in the first quarter}} with a Greyhound courant for the crest. After the Restoration, Ashmole was granted a new crest in place of the greyhound, one which reflected his interest in astrology: On a wreath Sable and Or the Planet Mercury collocated {{in the middle of the}} caelestiall Signe Gemini Proper his right hand extended toward Heaven and left holding a caducan Rod Or. The new grant also altered the tinctures of <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> Quarterly Sable and Or a Fleur de lis in the first quarter.|$|E

25|$|The two {{officials}} {{near the}} play conferred and then simultaneously made separate signals; side judge Lance Easley raised <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> signal touchdown, while back judge Derrick Rhone-Dunn waved <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> signal stoppage of the clock. Because Rhone-Dunn signaled timeout {{so as to}} stop the already expired game clock, Rhone-Dunn indicated that he desired further investigation of the play before rendering a verdict whereas Easley, from his angle, found sufficient evidence of a simultaneous catch with which to call a touchdown. The ruling on the field was officially a touchdown, with Tate and Jennings maintaining simultaneous possession.|$|E

When the woman's vagina is sufficiently lubricated, which may involve fingering her vulva or clitoris in particular, the man will level his erect penis with her vagina for penetration, and may use fingers to open the woman's labia and guide the penis in.|$|E
25|$|Located on the riverfront of Hart Plaza, the Gateway to Freedom International Memorial to the Underground Railroad commemorates Detroit's {{role in the}} Underground Railroad. It was sculpted by Edward Dwight, {{after winning}} a {{competition}} to design the International Memorial to the Underground Railroad, and dedicated on October 20, 2001. The project was a collaboration between Detroit 300 and the International Underground Railroad Monument Collaborative. The companion monument by the same sculptor, Tower of Freedom, is located in Windsor, Ontario's Civic Esplanade, on Pitt Street East near Caesars Windsor, and features a former slave raising <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> celebrate his emancipation while a Quaker woman offers assistance to {{a woman and her}} child as another child looks back toward Detroit.|$|E
500|$|Ubayd Allah {{was killed}} during the assault, and Ibn al-Ashtar himself {{is said to have}} slew him, [...] "cut him in two, so that his feet had gone to the east and <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> the west", {{according}} to the report of a certain al-Dahhak ibn Abdallah al-Mishraqi. At the same time, a Kufan soldier named Sharik ibn Jadir al-Taghlibi had attacked and killed Husayn ibn Numayr, mistaking the latter for Ubayd Allah. Shurahbil ibn Dhi'l Kala' was also killed, as was another of Ubayd Allah's lieutenants, al-Rabi'a ibn al-Mukhariq al-Ghanawi. Ibn al-Ashtar's troops seized the Umayyad camp and pursued their defeated army to the river. Apparently, more Umayyad troops drowned in the Khazir River than were slain in battle.|$|E

500|$|Heyward {{still has}} {{a hole in his}} swing that has yet to resolve. [...] While he was in the minor leagues, his unorthodox swing was not {{regarded}} as a significant issue, but rather was perceived to have worked for him because of his enormous talent. [...] To the contrary, one scout compared it to an awkward golf swing. [...] "You watch him, he really stiff-arms the bat out there", noting Heyward almost fully extends <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> attempt to power the head of the bat through the strike zone. [...] He does not protect the inside of part of the strike zone as well as the outside. [...] That creates a weakness that allows pitchers – especially power pitchers – to throw inside, thus exploiting an inability to attain contact on inside pitches efficiently.|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly {{was one of}} {{the best}} spin bowlers ever to play cricket. He {{delivered}} the ball from a two-fingered grip at close to medium pace with great accuracy, and could produce leg breaks, googlies, and top spinners, with no discernible change in his action. A tall man for a spinner (around 188cm, 6ft 2in), he whirled <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> an unusual extent and had a low point of delivery that meant it was very difficult for the batsman to read the flight of the ball out of his hand. When O'Reilly died, Sir Donald Bradman said that he was the greatest bowler he had ever faced or watched. In 1935, Wisden wrote of him: [...] "O'Reilly {{was one of the}} best examples in modern cricket of what could be described as a 'hostile' bowler." [...] In 1939, Wisden reflected on Bill O'Reilly's successful 1938 Ashes tour of England: [...] "He is emphatically one of the greatest bowlers of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1500m final race, {{with one}} lap {{remaining}} and currently in second place, Ohno {{attempted to make}} a pass on the leader Kim Dong-Sung, who then drifted to the inside and as a result, Ohno raised <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> signal he was blocked. Kim finished first ahead of Ohno but was disqualified for impeding, awarding the gold medal to Ohno. Fourth-place finisher of the race, Fabio Carta of Italy, showed his disagreement with the disqualification decision saying it was [...] "absurd that the Korean was disqualified". China's Jiajun Li, who moved from bronze to silver, remained neutral saying: [...] "I respect {{the decision of the}} referee, I'm not going to say any more". Steven Bradbury, the 1000m gold-medal winner, also shared his views: [...] "Whether Dong-Sung moved across enough to be called for cross-tracking, I don't know, he obviously moved across a bit. It's the judge's interpretation. A lot of people will say it was right {{and a lot of people}} will say it's wrong. I've seen moves like that before that were not called. But I've seen them called too".|$|E

500|$|Yet {{the use of}} a teasing {{mechanical}} puppet in this wine-serving device wasn't {{exactly a}} novel invention of the Tang, since the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the Qin dynasty (221–207 BC). In the 3rd century Ma Jun had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel. There was also an automatic wine-server known in the ancient Greco-Roman world, a design of the Greek inventor Heron of Alexandria that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of automatons used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the amount of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> deposit them in a satchel. This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny slot machine. Other devices included one by Wang Ju, whose [...] "wooden otter" [...] could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a spring trap of some kind was employed here.|$|E
500|$|Stanton wanted WALL-E to be {{a box and}} EVE to be like an egg. WALL-E's {{eyes were}} {{inspired}} {{by a pair of}} binoculars Stanton was given when watching the Oakland Athletics play against the Boston Red Sox. He [...] "missed the entire inning" [...] because he was distracted by them. The director was reminded of Buster Keaton and decided the robot would not need a nose or mouth. Stanton added a zoom lens to make WALL-E more sympathetic. Ralph Eggleston noted this feature gave the animators more to work with and gave the robot a childlike quality. Pixar's studies of trash compactors during their visits to recycling stations inspired his body. His tank treads were inspired by a wheelchair someone had developed that used treads instead of wheels. The animators wanted him to have elbows, but realized this was unrealistic because he is only designed to pull garbage into his body. His arms also looked flimsy when they did a test of him waving. Animation director Angus MacLane suggested they attach <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> a track on the sides of his body to move them around, based on the inkjet printers his father designed. This arm design contributed to creating the character's posture, so if they wanted him to be nervous, they would lower them. Stanton was unaware of the similarities between WALL-E and Johnny 5 from Short Circuit until others pointed it out to him.|$|E
500|$|Mars first {{performed}} [...] "It Will Rain" [...] {{with his}} band at The Ellen DeGeneres Show, on November 18, 2011. Mars wore {{a hat and}} sunglasses as props, signing while fog appeared [...] "throughout the dimly-lit studio". Idolator's Becky Bain declared [...] "the man proves again that he's got some killer pipes". Madison Vanderberg from Stereotude also praised the singers' voice [...] "soulful croons and amazing voice". On the following week, the single {{was performed on the}} first season of the American X Factor, which for Mars would be one of his career highlights. The singer, who was wearing a fedora hat, raised <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> the audience as the song started and a digital screen projecting a giant broken heart-shaped neon light as background appeared during the show. Mars performed [...] "It Will Rain" [...] on his 2010 [...] "The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour", where it was the fourteenth song on the setlist. During the European leg, it was sang live with Skylar Grey. Mars performance with Grey drew the attention of some reviewers. Becky Bain of Idolator noted that the two [...] "have melancholia perfected". PopDust felt that [...] "Grey's contribution is soft and minimal; it's all about Bruno and his rain-slick voice." [...] the website concluded, [...] "it's a shame that here, she feels so invisible". On his second worldwide tour, Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013-2014), interpolated with [...] "If I Knew", a song included on his second studio album, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), in most concerts.|$|E
