50|$|This {{example only}} {{provides}} insight into optimised liquid infrastructures {{to explain the}} concepts of Temperature Chaining and how different liquid technologies can fit into this concept. For simplification purposes, there are no redundant scenarios outlined. Return loops, buffer tanks and intermediate pumps to deal with volumetric and pressure aspects within different stages are not detailed.The open circuit heat reuse infrastructure is the most sustainable infrastructure by far. In this situation, the datacentre receives water of a certain temperature and all the heat generated by the IT equipment is delivered to another user with this water circuit. This means that the facility does not only reject the heat, but also the water which contains the heat to allow an external party to transport and use the warmed-up liquid. This results in a complete lack of cooling installations and the datacentre effectively acts like a large water <b>heater.</b> <b>Water</b> flows into the datacentre and comes out at high temperatures.|$|E
40|$|Summary &mdash; A wet {{condensation}} heater has been modified to disinfect drain water in greenhouses {{in addition to}} pro-viding heating and CO 2. Various kinds of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) and one virus (tobacco mosaic virus [TMV]) originating from either pure cultures or substrate extracts were introduced into the disinfection circuit above the <b>heater.</b> <b>Water</b> was checked downstream {{for the number of}} microorganisms surviving the heat treatment. Fungi were destroyed after 30 s at 58. 9 °C, and most of the bacteria except some spore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus polymyxa were destroyed after 45 s at 65. 2 °C. Complete elimination of TMV particles was more difficult to achieve but their number was greatly reduced, limiting the probability of plant infection. The microbial density was significantly decreased at relatively low temperatures (less than 75 °C for 2 min) and so the efficacy of the heater was attributed to a combined effect of both temperature and UV irradiation from the flame. Addition of a nonpathogenic microorganism to the substratum is proposed to compensate for the lack of complete efficiency observed with high flow rates of drain water. This introduced microorganism could occupy the free space and limit an invasion by a pathogen surviving the treatment...|$|E
