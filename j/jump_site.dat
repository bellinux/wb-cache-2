50|$|The {{failure was}} {{investigated}} by the National Park Service with assistance from Chris Harmston, Quality Assurance Manager at Black Diamond Equipment. Harmston concluded that a change in <b>jump</b> <b>site</b> angle probably caused the main jump rope, which consisted of several ropes tied together, to cross and catch on itself at a knot during his fall. This caused the rope to cut itself by melting. Harmston also noted that Osman's rope was in excellent condition, despite it having been left outdoors for some time.|$|E

The different excavations unearthed numerous {{human remains}} and an important bone accumulation. Level 6 c, attributed to the Denticulate Mousterian, {{is characterized by a}} faunal spectrum largely dominated by bison. The particular position of the site above the highest cliff in the region led several authors to propose the use of La Quina as a Buffalo <b>Jump</b> <b>site.</b> This article proposes a skeletochronological analysis of the bison with the aim of establishing its hunting season. These data help us to discuss the hunting strategies more precisely and to better understand the function of the site...|$|E
40|$|Solid {{electrolytes}} in all solid-state batteries, provide higher attainable {{energy density}} and improved safety. Ideal solid electrolytes require high ionic conductivity, a high elastic modulus to prevent dendrite growth, chemical compatibility with electrodes, {{and ease of}} fabrication into thin films. Although various materials types, including polymers, ceramics, and composites, are under intense investigation, unifying design principles have not been identified. In this thesis, we study the key ion transport mechanisms {{in relation to the}} structural characteristics of polymers and glassy solids, and apply derived material design strategies to develop polymer-silica hybrid materials with improved electrolyte performance characteristics. Poly(ethylene) oxide-based solid electrolytes containing ceramic nanoparticles are attractive alternatives to liquid electrolytes for high-energy density Li batteries. We compare the effect of Li 1. 3 Al 0. 3 Ti 1. 7 (PO 4) 3 active nanoparticles, passive TiO 2 nanoparticles and fumed silica. Up to two orders of magnitude enhancement in ionic conductivity is observed for composites with active nanoparticles, attributed to cation migration through a percolating interphase region that develops around the active nanoparticles, even at low nanoparticle loading. We investigate the structural origin of elastic properties and ionic migration mechanisms in sodium borosilicate and sodium borogermanate glass electrolyte system. A new statistical thermodynamic reaction equilibrium model is used in combination with data from nuclear magnetic resonance and Brillouin light scattering measurements to determine network structural unit fractions. The highly coordinated structural units are found to be predominantly responsible for effective mechanical load transmission, by establishing three-dimensional covalent connectivity. A strong correlation exists between bulk modulus and the activation energy for ion conduction. We describe the activated process in glasses as involving a jump by the migrating cation and transient reversible isotropic displacement of atoms in the immediate vicinity, and express the activation energy as a sum of Coulomb and elastic terms. By fitting our experimental data to this model, we find that the number of affected atoms in the vicinity ranges between 20 and 30. Furthermore, elastic deformations in ion jumping are almost purely hydrostatic and hardly shear. Considering that the energy required for the cation jump is made available by concentrating thermal phonons at the <b>jump</b> <b>site,</b> we establish a relationship between structural stiffness and activation energy. Moreover, the more atoms that partake in the cation jump, the more degrees of freedom for atomic motion can be relied upon to achieve the required net outward expansion to facilitate the passage of the jumping cation, lowering the activation energy. To combine the flexibility of polymers and the good mechanical and electrochemical properties of silica, we use sol-gel methods for fabricating silica-based hybrid organic-inorganic electrolytes. Polyethylene glycol is covalently grafted onto the silica backbone as the organic filler that provides the environment for ion conduction. We developed synthesis methods in which grafting and polycondensation occur concurrently, or the grafting occurs after the silica backbone has formed. Small angle x-ray scattering measurements reveal that different structures are achieved depending on the method used. The two-step procedure allows for a larger amount of conducting polymer to be embedded into network pores than in the one-pot method. This greatly enhances the ionic conductivity without sacrificing mechanical stability afforded by the continuous silica backbone. Here we provide a cumulative account of a systematic materials design efforts, in which we sequentially implement several important design aspects to identify their respective importance and influence on the materials performance characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Rates {{of suicide}} by jumping show large {{regional}} differences. Barriers on bridges may prevent suicides but also {{may lead to}} a substitution of <b>jumping</b> <b>site</b> or method. The aim of our study was to compare suicide data from regions with and without suicide bridges and to estimate the effects on method and site substitution if bridges were to be secured. In a national survey, suicide data for the years 1990 to 2003 were collected. Regions with high rates of bridge suicides were identified and compared with regions with low rates, and the analysis revealed that only about one third of the individuals would be expected to jump from buildings or other structures if no bridge was available. The results suggest no method substitution for women. For men, a trend of a substituting jumping by overdosing in regions without suicide bridges was found. We conclude that restricted access to suicide bridges will not automatically lead suicidal individuals to choose another <b>jumping</b> <b>site</b> or suicide method. The results support the notion that securing bridges may save lives...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of present thesis {{is to develop}} novel and inexpensive solid polymeric electrolytes capable of conducting protons at intermediate temperatures and anhydrous conditions. Such materials are interesting in view of potential applications {{for a variety of}} emerging electrochemical technologies such as high-temperature-polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFC). Polymer electrolytes are prepared based on proper acid-base interactions between host polymers and guest molecules as an effective route to distribute modifier within the matrix structure. In anhydrous condition protons hop from site to site in a dense hydrogen bonding network formed among amphoteric <b>jumping</b> <b>sites</b> (Grotthhus mechanism). According to amphoteric nature, these <b>jumping</b> <b>sites</b> can be simply divided into two main categories: amine based- and phosphonic based sites. Solid electrolytes of both categories are prepared. All samples are systematically characterized as to morphological, thermal and structural properties. IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are applied to reveal any considerable structural interactions between functional groups. By means of thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), important information is collected on thermal stabilities and glass transition temperatures (Tg) of composite membranes. Proton conductivity is investigated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which allows determination of proton conductivity and the activation energy of proton transfer in anhydrous state. An extended investigation is carried out in order to establish a correlation between proton conductivity and the content of modifiers in prepared materials. Additionally, compositional information of material is obtained from solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR). Based on preparation and processing conditions, following important values are achieved: I. All composite membranes were thermally stable within intermediate temperature range (100 - 200 °C), II. Proton conductivities in excess of 0. 01 Ω- 1 cm- 1 at 190 °C and anhydrous condition are obtained, III. For the first time, positive effect of phosphonic condensation reaction on proton conductivity is reported and IV. Phosphonic groups and aromatic amines are recommended as the most efficient proton conductive functional groups for intermediate temperatures applications...|$|R
50|$|The Vore Buffalo Jump is an archeological site in Crook County, Wyoming. A sinkhole, formed where gypsum {{soil was}} eroded, leaving a steep-sided pit about 40 ft deep and 200 ft in diameter. Native American hunters could stampede bison in the {{direction}} of the pit, which was deep enough to kill or disable the animals that were driven into it. The location is one of a number of buffalo <b>jump</b> <b>sites</b> in the north central United States and southern Canada. The Vore site was used as a kill site and butchering site from about 1500 AD to about 1800 AD. Archeological investigations in the 1970s uncovered bones and projectile points to a depth of 15 ft. About ten tons of bones were removed from the site. About five percent of the site has been excavated, and the pit is estimated to contain the remains of 20,000 buffalo.|$|R
