5|$|Malawi {{has adopted}} task {{shifting}} strategies {{to overcome the}} shortage of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Task shifting, which {{has been successful in}} many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform health-related tasks that do not require professional training, such as the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. For example, at Thyolo District Hospital, health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under Ministry of Health guidelines) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Another form of task shifting involves training health-oriented counselors in <b>HIV</b> <b>testing</b> and counseling, which relieves nurses of this additional task.|$|E
5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of <b>HIV</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The DoDSR, {{along with}} its {{precursor}} repositories, were designated as the ultimate storage facility for all serologically negative HIV specimens obtained through military <b>HIV</b> <b>testing</b> programs. Growing initially through the routine screening of all civilian applicants, and then through the continued screening of retained military personnel (at approximate two year intervals), by 1990 the DoDSR inventory had grown to contain over six million serum specimens, and by 1996 over 17 million specimens. Standardized processes {{in place at the}} contracted military <b>HIV</b> <b>testing</b> laboratories ensured efficient management of the growing inventory, permitting the DoDSR to enforce standards in specimen labelling, configuration, and shipment of specimens which facilitated their physical integration into the DoDSR inventory. Contracts for <b>HIV</b> <b>testing,</b> negotiated by the individual military services, covered all specimens shipped from Military Treatment Facilities for <b>HIV</b> <b>testing</b> within the United States; for this reason unless specifically removed, serum from military beneficiaries (i.e. spouses and children) would also find their way into the DoDSR inventory.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the same}} time, {{voluntary}} testing and counseling was made available in some communities, but, even where available, was rarely used.

40|$|Abstract Background Considering {{the high}} {{percentage}} of couples in which one or both members are HIV negative, the frequency of transmission among non-regular partners and the probabilities of non-disclosure, attention should be paid to people getting a negative <b>HIV</b> <b>test</b> at the Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT).

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where most HIV infections occur, there are few studies that have analysed the factors associated with changes in sexual risk behaviours after a negative <b>HIV</b> <b>test</b> at the VCT clinic. The aim of this project is to evaluate the specific factors associated with changes in sexual behaviours, three months after a negative result in an <b>HIV</b> <b>test,</b> and to analyse the effect of counseling and testing on HIV-related knowledge of participants in an outpatient centre of Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo).

We hypothesized that a substantial proportion of patients going through an elective surgery falsely believed that an <b>HIV</b> <b>test</b> was performed on a routine basis and {{that the lack of}} transmission of result was interpreted as being HIV negative. Method: All patients with elective orthopedic surgery during 2007 were contacted by phone in 2008. A structured questionnaire assessed their belief about routine preoperative blood analysis (diabetes, coagulation function, <b>HIV</b> <b>test</b> and cholesterol level) as well as result awareness and interpretation. Variables included age and gender. Analysis were conducted using the software JMP 6. 0. 3. Results: 1123 patients were included. 130 (12 %) were excluded (Le. unreachable, unable to communicate on the phone, not operated). 993 completed the survey (89 %). Median age was 51 (16 - 79). 50 % were female. 376 (38 %) patients thought they had an <b>HIV</b> <b>test</b> performed before surgery but none of them had one. 298 (79 %) interpreted the absence of result as a negative <b>HIV</b> <b>test.</b> A predictive factor to believe an <b>HIV</b> <b>test</b> had been done was an age below 50 years old (45 % vs 33 % for 16 - 49 years old and 50 - 79 years old respectively, p < 0. 001).

Conclusion: ln Switzerland, nearly 40 % of the patients falsely thought an <b>HIV</b> <b>test</b> had been performed on a routine basis before surgery and were erroneously reassured about their HIV status. These results should either improve the information given to the patient regarding preoperative exams, or motivate public health policy to consider HIV opt-out screening instead of VCT strategy...|$|R
