40|$|Abstract: Cold ring rolling {{is a kind}} of {{advanced}} manufacturing technology. During rolling process the ring may be collapsed or deformed unexpectedly under the pressure of <b>guide</b> <b>roll</b> because the stiffness condition is not met. The force of <b>guide</b> <b>roll</b> to ring was obtained by analyzing the forces to ring. The stiffness condition expressions of ring during rolling were shown after constructing the mechanical model. According to the expressions, the effects of several parameters on the stiffness condition were discussed and analyzed in detail, such as position angle of <b>guide</b> <b>roll,</b> friction coefficient and feed rate, etc, which revealed essential reasons of some cases occurring in cold ring rolling. Then the ring blank dimension was deduced based on the ring stiffness condition. The dimensions of ring blank should meet a relationship to ensure the ring stiffness condition to be satisfied during rolling, which can conduct the practical manufacturing effectively. Finally the analysis and effect laws were proved by finite element simulation experiments. The researches could be helpful to control parameter in cold ring rolling effectively for high quality products...|$|E

The required functions include many things from a grasping to a manipulation of fine object. The design condition of EMG prosthetic hand {{is different from the}} industrial robot hand concerning on the three points of view: weight limit, water resistance, and autonomous portability. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop the Robot hand with multifunction, lightweight, water resistance and autonomous portability. In this study, we extend the tendon wire mechanism and propose adaptive joint for interference-driven mechanism in order to use some outputs of actuator effectively. Adaptive joint for interference-driven mechanism A schematic diagram of an adaptive joint mechanism is shown in Fig. 3. A spring connects a frame and a <b>guide</b> <b>roll</b> of wire. The <b>guide</b> <b>roll</b> can shift proportionally to the load. In the case of a light load, as shown in Fig. 3 (b), the spring approaches the fulcrum, making its angular velocity high and its torque low. On the other hand, in the case of a heavy load, as shown in Fig. 3 (c), the <b>guide</b> <b>roll</b> leaves the fulcrum, making its angular velocity low and its torque high. Accordingly, the spring-connected <b>guide</b> <b>roll</b> provides an adjustable power-transmitting function. From another viewpoint, the adaptive joint provides a “passive adaptive grasp. ” Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 show the robot hand comprised by proposed method...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Guide</b> <b>rolls</b> play an {{important}} role in controlling both the ring circularity and the stability of cold ring rolling process. However, it is difficult to predict and control the motion of the <b>guide</b> <b>rolls</b> due to the complexity of process associated with the coupled effects of multi-factors. In this paper, a reasonable controlling model of the <b>guide</b> <b>rolls</b> is proposed, and the functional relationship between the motion track of the <b>guide</b> <b>rolls</b> and their setup parameters and process ones is established, by which the <b>guide</b> <b>rolls</b> motion track can be determined. On this basis, a 3 D-FE simulation model for cold ring rolling is developed under the ABAQUS software environment and the effects of the initial position and motion track of the <b>guide</b> <b>rolls</b> on the forming stability, ring circularity, rolling force, and oscillating are investigated. Taking the forming stability and ring circularity as objects, the optimum initial position and motion track of the <b>guide</b> <b>rolls</b> are obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The <b>guiding</b> <b>roll</b> is an {{important}} part of the ring rolling equipment which plays {{an important}} part in stabilizing the rolling and ensuring the quality of product. This paper obtained the formula for instant diameter of ring during the rolling process and established the motion equation of <b>guiding</b> <b>roll.</b> The angular velocity, instant displacements in X and Y direction of <b>guiding</b> <b>roll</b> center were calculated by MATLAB software. The numerical simulation of ring rolling of ring with rectangular cross sections was completed under the ABAQUS/Explicit environment after importing the instant displacement of <b>guiding</b> <b>roll</b> center. The simulation results indicate that the <b>guiding</b> <b>roll</b> could be controlled accurately by the proper method. These research conclusions can provide scientific basis for ensuring the quality of product and accurately controlling the movement of <b>guiding</b> <b>roll</b> during the ring rolling...|$|R

To improve the dynamic performance of the deviation control system and solve the motor vibration problem, the deviation control algorithm is proposed, which is related to intelligent PD feedback control combined with the feed-forward regulation for the system deviation, and its MatLab simulation results show its good performances and advantages. Furthermore, a technical approach for the deviation controller using DSP processor chip TMS 320 F 2812 is presented.

40|$|Radial-axial ring rolling (RARR) is an {{industrial}} forging process that produces seamless metal rings with uniform cross-section using one radial and one axial rolling stage. Conventionally, the ring products are circular {{and the process}} is tightly constrained using <b>guide</b> <b>rolls</b> for stability, and to ensure the circularity and uniformity of the ring. Recent work has shown that when <b>guide</b> <b>rolls</b> are omitted, stability can be maintained using differential speed control of the roll pairs. However, achieving uniform curvature in this unconstrained configuration was not always possible when the controller only centred the ring within the rolling mill. In addition to the regulation of constant curvature in circular rings, differential speed control in unconstrained rolling offers an opportunity to bend the ring about the mandrel to create shapes with nonuniform curvature, for example: squares, hexagons, rings with flat sections, etc. We describe a control technique for creating non-circular rings using the rolling hardware of a conventional RARR mill, machine-vision sensing and differential speed control of the rolling stages. The technique has been validated for {{an industrial}} material in numerical simulations using the finite element method and also demonstrated on a desktop-scale RARR mill using modelling clay to simulate metal at elevated process temperatures...|$|R

Operating variables such as ingot addition, line speed, and inductor mixing were evaluated {{in order to determine}} their effect on the velocity and temperature distribution in the bath. The simulations were carried out using high-performance computational fluid-dynamics software developed at the Industrial Materials Institute of the National Research Council Canada (IMI-NRC) in solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for steady-state and transient turbulent flow using the k- 3 ̆b 5 model. Cases with and without temperature-dependent density conditions were considered. It was found that the strip velocity does not alter the global flow pattern but modifies the velocities in the snout, near the strip, and near the sink and <b>guide</b> <b>rolls.</b> At a low inductor capacity, the effect of induced mixing is small but is considerably increased at the maximum inductor capacities used during ingot-melting periods. When considering the thermal effects, the flow is affected by variations in density especially near the inductors and the ingot, while little effect is observed near the sheet-and-roller region. Thermal effects are also amplified when the inductor operates at high capacity during ingot melting. The simulations allow visualization of regions of varying velocity and temperature fields and clearly illustrate the mixed and stagnant zones for different operating conditions.
