Whereas the base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off after dark, there was no such problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E

5|$|The abolishment of the apothecaries' system {{meant that}} doctors' {{prescriptions}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place {{in terms of}} the current civil weight: grammes and kilograms. This was considered unfeasible by many, and the state received numerous protests and asked for expertises. Nevertheless, by 1868 §4 of the earlier reform was finally put into force.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclusion}} of the British Mandate of Iraq caused considerable unease among the Assyrians who felt betrayed by the British.

5|$|The winter had {{political}} ramifications {{and caused}} {{the public to}} lose faith in a Labour government who could not maintain food and electricity supplies. Long-time Labour activist Manny Shinwell {{was in charge of}} the coal supply. He repeatedly denied there were problems. He blamed the climate, the railway system, or capitalism generally.

5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E

Athletes from 10 of the 16 participating NOCs won at least one medal; eight won at least one gold medal. Many of the athletes who won these medals had already returned to their home countries {{by the time the}} medals were awarded, on 5 February, and other participants from their countries <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the medals to the winning athletes.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E

He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Fan {{attention}} {{became so}} intense that Tolkien <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his phone number {{out of the public}} directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.|$|E

5|$|His successors as coach, Giovanni Trapattoni and Otto Rehhagel, both {{finished}} trophyless after a season, {{not meeting}} the club's high expectations. During this time, Bayern's players frequently {{appeared in the}} gossip pages of the press rather than the sports pages, resulting in the nickname FC Hollywood. Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned {{at the end of}} the 1995–96 season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the UEFA Cup, beating Bordeaux in the final. For the 1996–97 season, Trapattoni returned to win the championship. In the following season, Bayern lost the title to newly promoted 1.
