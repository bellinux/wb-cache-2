25|$|Intertidal ecology is {{the study}} of {{ecosystems}} between the low- and <b>high-water</b> <b>lines</b> along a shore. At low water, the intertidal zone is exposed (or emersed), whereas at high water, it is underwater (or immersed). Intertidal ecologists therefore study the interactions between intertidal organisms and their environment, as well as among the different species. The most important interactions may vary according to the type of intertidal community. The broadest classifications are based on substrates — rocky shore or soft bottom.|$|R
30|$|The {{grid spacing}} of 1  m {{preserves}} details {{that may affect}} use of the DEM for tsunami simulation. These details include the tide-gauge location (Figs.  5 and 6) and a narrow sea wall (Kiamari Groyne, Fig.  1 b). A much wider spacing would otherwise be warranted by the density of soundings in the navigable waters area. This area contains 1763 soundings in 58  km 2, or {{an average of about}} 30 soundings per square kilometer, excluding the depths obtained from low-water <b>lines,</b> <b>high-water</b> <b>lines,</b> and mangrove margins. Randomly distributed data with an average density of 30 per square kilometer justifies a grid spacing of about 45  m (Eq.  13 of Hengl 2006).|$|R

30|$|The DEM {{incorporates}} shorelines {{from the}} 1951 Guide Map. We used a scan that {{was provided by}} the National Library of Australia, and which is reproduced as Additional file 1 : Figure S 2. The 1951 edition covers nearly twice the area of the 1944 edition, by extending westward from Karachi Harbour into mudflats and mangroves. These intertidal features are built into the DEM, as partial coverage of the “western backwaters” in Fig.  1 b. The DEM also uses, from the 1951 edition, <b>high-water</b> and low-water <b>lines</b> outside the harbour near Manora and Kiamari, particularly to supersede the nineteenth century low-water line on BA 40 south of Kiamari.|$|R
40|$|Lasaea rubra is an {{inbreeding}} bivalve species, {{living at}} most heights on rocky shores. Freshly collected animals from different shore heights showed significantly different upper median lethal temperatures (MLTs), with upper shore animals having higher MLTs than lower shore specimens. Experiments with animals acclimated {{for at least}} one month to a single temperature (15 °C) demonstrated that these differences in upper MLT were unaffected by thermal acclimation. Electrophoretic investigation showed that the differences in thermal response had a genetic basis. Homogeneous populations of the <b>high-water</b> inbred <b>line</b> (‘Inbred line A’) had a higher MLT than homogeneous populations of ‘Inbred line C’ which was found on the middle and lower shore. No differences were detected between the MLTs of separate populations of Inbred lines A or C. A third inbred line (‘Inbred line B’) was found on the middle shore, but no homogeneous populations were found. However, indirect evidence suggests that Inbred line B has a thermal response intermediate between those of Inbred lines A and C. Study of populations made up of mixtures of inbred lines confirmed the relationship between upper MLTs and genetic composition of the population...|$|R
5000|$|A {{clutch of}} 1-3 eggs is laid from August to March, which {{includes}} also {{the peak of}} the Austral summer tourist season in its range and it is thereby heavily impacted by human activities. The eggs are a matte beige or cream colour heavily sprinkled with dark brown and lavender markings, especially at the larger end of the egg. [...] in shape, they measure 37 x 27 mm. Eggs hatch in about 30 days. The eastern population eats a variety of invertebrates but little is known of the diet of the western population. Specifically it eats insects, bivalves, and sandhoppers. It is usually seen in pairs or small groups near the water. For breeding it will dig a shallow scrape in sand or gravel above <b>high-water</b> mark and <b>line</b> it with pebbles, seaweed, and other debris.|$|R
50|$|Llanddona {{fish weir}} is a V-shaped trap, {{typically}} used when trapping fish in tidal waters. The two {{arms of the}} V run down the beach, starting below the <b>high-water</b> <b>line</b> and almost meet {{at the tip of}} the V just above the low-water line, where the fish are caught in a net or a trap when the tide recedes. The sides of the V-shaped trap can be made of stone, wattle fencing, or both.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Boreholes {{drilled in}} the &ech Bay area during July to Novembcr 1929 {{indicated}} that a sill of permafrost had extended below the <b>high-water</b> <b>line,</b> tapering in depth towards low water. The boreholes revealed thick layers of fine sediments on top of deep underlain bedrock. Recent bor-ings determined the upper limits of permafrost in 1981, Examination of the data shows that here has been a permafrost expansion into the emerging tidal tone. TheSc observations suggest an additional mwhanism for accelerated uplift of coastal exposed “soft ” sediments: the vertical expansion of refrozen. water-saturated silts and clays as new permafrost forms. The existing rates of isostatic uplift are enhanced by the process...|$|E
30|$|This upland {{topography}} is {{not intended}} for use in modeling the 1945 tsunami, for two main reasons. First, the Karachi landscape was reshaped by urbanization between 1945 and 2000 (Inskeep 2011). Second, the Karachi topography resolved by SRTM is unlikely to affect simulations of the 1945 tsunami, which in Karachi Harbour crested no more than about 1  m above {{the level of the}} highest astronomical tides. This limiting height, consistent with the tide-gauge record and with eyewitness accounts of flooding on Bhit Island, is derived primarily from newspaper accounts of localized flooding of oil installations at Kiamari. To reach the oil installations, the tsunami overtopped a seawall that separated them from the tidal flat to the south. Relative heights plotted on the 1951 Guide Map suggest that this seawall stood 3 – 4  ft above the adjacent <b>high-water</b> <b>line</b> (“ 3 r” and “ 4 r” in Additional file 1 : Figure S 2).|$|E
40|$|The Holocene {{coastal plain}} of Suriname is a chenier plain. Its actual sedimentological {{development}} has been studied during three field-work periods (1966, 1967 / 1968, 1972). Clay is the predominant sediment in this low- to medium-energy environment. It accumulates in extensive shoreface-attached mudflats (sometimes considered as giant mudwaves), which migrate continuously to the west due to deposition of slingmud at their west side and simultaneous erosion of the east side. In between the mudflats cheniers may develop. Thin-section analysis of the clay deposits revealed that they are built up of an alternation of thick clayey laminae and thin laminae of silt and fine sand. The clayey laminae chiefly show a unistrial plasmic fabric. Disturbaces in the upper zone are caused by bioturbation. Two types of cheniers can be distinguished. One type contains fine sand which has been winnowed out of the pelite deposits. Since this sand is brought from the shelf the chenier formation begins at approximately mean low-water level. Longshore bars are formed and these are driven shoreward by wave action. The other type is built up of medium to coarse sand supplied by a local river. It is transported westward by beachdrift in a narrow zone around the mean <b>high-water</b> <b>line.</b> These cheniers develop therefore at or just above the mean high-tide level. The sedimentary structures of both types of cheniers have many characteristics in common. However, each type also has its own distinct features...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{will examine}} three established, {{or at least}} {{commonly}} claimed, rights of coastal (littoral) property owners in the United States: (1) the right to receive sediments seaward of the mean <b>high-water</b> <b>line</b> deposited by accretions and ownership of new land uncovered by relictions, (2) the right to exclusive use of their dry sand property, and (3) the right to build what they wish on their oceanfront lot. Each of these asserted “rights” at times butts heads with laws designed to preserve and protect the public’s right to enjoy the coast and the ocean, including the public trust doctrine, environmental statutes, and zoning regulations. Taking each of these property claims in turn, {{my goal is to}} see who, if anybody, is winning the battle between property owners and the general public for the use of littoral zones. Does the answer vary with location? What factors are giving the winner the upper hand? When these public and private rights are at odds, can the two be reconciled in a manner that respects the owner’s desires while concomitantly maintaining public utility, or is this a fruitless endeavor because the two are diametrically opposed? In what respects does the law need to be clarified to potentially obviate issues? Starting with “It’s All Mine,” I will explore how the phenomena of accretion, dereliction, and avulsion, both natural and artificial, affect the extent of an owner’s title to his or her coastal lot. I will also extensively discuss a fairly recent United States Supreme Court case, Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v. Florida Department of Environmental Protection, that has important ramifications for determining the boundary of an owner’s littoral lot. Next, with “Stay Off,” I will examine how different states have found or created public access and use rights over private littoral property and dealt with issues arising from owners’ assertions of exclusivity. Lastly, under “Let Me Do What I Please,” I will look at how zoning ordinances and environmental laws, as well as condemnation, have been used in different states to limit an owner’s ability to build certain structures on their lots—from buildings to sea walls and piers— {{for the benefit of the}} general public. In what cases have the courts found the government went too far in restricting the owner’s use of his or her littoral property, and in what cases have they said the danger to the environment or the public’s entitled use outweighed the owner’s desire to construct what he or she wishes? Each of these disputes has important political, economic, and social implications because it pits a select group of private property owners, who are often wealthy and influential, against the general public, whose desire to be near the ocean is steadily growing. On a grander scale, these legal issues highlight the continuing debate over how to best utilize our natural resources and the corresponding struggle for control...|$|E
