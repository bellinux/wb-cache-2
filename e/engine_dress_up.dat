50|$|Mattel's <b>Dress</b> <b>Up</b> line of {{dolls and}} horses {{is the most}} sought after part of the entire Mattel line, {{particularly}} Moonglow who was only sold in Germany. Although Stormy's doll was shown in the Mattel catalog and {{on the backs of}} the <b>Dress</b> <b>Up</b> doll boxes, she was never produced for retail even though the character did appear in some cartoon episodes and several German comic books. There was also a line of cataloged clothing for the <b>Dress</b> <b>Up</b> dolls, but like Stormy, it was never produced. The two horses, Starlight and Sunriser, were made from hard plastic rather than being stuffed. They were in fact from Mattel's line of 'Barbie' merchandise. The <b>Dress</b> <b>Up</b> line was only made for about one year. That makes the two horses and Moonglow very difficult to find today, especially MIB. The Tickled Pink and Rainbow Brite <b>Dress</b> <b>Up</b> dolls are somewhat difficult to find these days compared to the rest of the Gen 1 line.|$|R
