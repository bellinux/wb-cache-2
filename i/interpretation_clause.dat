50|$|Each Bill {{consists}} of five main parts: the long title, the short title, the <b>interpretation</b> <b>clause,</b> {{the main body}} of the Bill and the objects and reasons. The long title is a description of the nature of the Bill and covers the intent of the Bill. The Short title follows the long title and labels the Bill for identification purposes. The short title sometimes also, contains the commencement clause, which states when the Bill will have legal force. The short title in turn is followed by the <b>interpretation</b> <b>clause,</b> which defines certain words and phrases used in the Bill. The body of the Bill {{consists of}} all of the other clauses, which contain the provisions of the Bill, that is, they contain all of the measures that the Bill is enacting. The objects and reasons is the final part of a Bill and it seeks to explain in layman’s terms the purpose of the Bill and the reason why it is necessary.|$|E

40|$|South Africa was {{in need of}} a {{comprehensive}} framework of legislation, policies and government authorities to regulate consumer-supplier interaction. The Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008, which was signed by the President of the Republic of South Africa on 29 April 2009 and published in the Government Gazette on 29 April 2009, now provides an extensive framework for consumer protection and aims to develop, enhance and protect the rights of consumers and to eliminate unethical suppliers and improper business practices. Certain areas of the common law regarding consumer rights have been codified by the Act and certain unfair business practices that were previously unregulated are now governed by the Act. The Act has a wide field of application. It applies to every transaction occurring within South Africa for the supply of goods or services or the promotion of goods or services and the goods or services themselves, unless the transaction is exempted from the application of the Act. The Act also specifically regulates aspects of franchise agreements. In terms of the Act, consumers obtain several new rights and some existing rights are broadened and reinforced. These rights are: the right to equality in the consumer market; privacy; choice; disclosure and information; fair and responsible marketing; fair and honest dealing; fair, just and reasonable terms and conditions; and fair value, good quality and safety. The last right in terms of the Act deals with a supplier's accountability to consumers. The authors critically analyse and discuss these rights. It is clear that the Act is written in favour of the consumer. Various provisions of the Act make inroads into the common-law position to strengthen the position of the consumer vis-à-vis the supplier and suppliers are undoubtedly facing an onerous task to prepare to comply, and eventually attempt to comply, with the Act. Although the Act has its own <b>interpretation</b> <b>clause,</b> which provides that it must be interpreted in a manner that gives effect to the purposes of the Act, the Act poses many uncertainties and interpretational and practical challenges. Many questions are therefore raised, some of which remain unanswered. These questions illustrate some of the uncertainties concerning the scope and possible interpretation of the fundamental consumer rights...|$|E

Crucially, however, the reading difficulty asymmetry between subject and object relative clause sentences disappeared when the sentences were presented with a local or a global discourse context that favored the objects in the object relative clauses. These findings demonstrate that the evidence for a syntax-based account of sentence processing is found when sentences are presented in isolation. However, if sentences are placed more naturally, in context, discourse factors outweigh the initial structural assignment...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} semantics of tense and the temporal interpretation of tensed and tenseless predicates in natural language. The central question {{we are concerned}} with is whether natural language employs explicit quantification over times in the object language. Our {{answer to the question}} is “yes, but to a limited extent. ” We argue (i) that the evaluation time of tense operators is represented by what we call the distinguished time variable, and (ii) that the event time of simple tensed predicates is represented by tense morphemes. Tense morphemes are analyzed as temporal variables that saturate the time argument slot of the predicates they are affixed to. As a consequence, the proposal implies that the event time of tensed predicates is realized in syntax as a temporal variable while the event time of tenseless predicates is not. Evidence for this distinction is provided from the temporal interpretation of nouns, differences between the temporal <b>interpretations</b> of relative <b>clauses</b> and participles, and cross-linguistic differences regarding the temporal <b>interpretation</b> of relative <b>clauses.</b> Evidence for explicit quantification over the evaluation times of tense operators is also provided from the tense <b>interpretation</b> of relative <b>clauses,</b> and from cross-linguistic differences regarding the distribution of tense and its interpretation in temporal adjunct clauses. ^ The introductory Chapter 1 presents background assumptions and reviews the previous literature. Cross-linguistic data regarding tense in relative clauses and temporal adjunct clauses are also introduced. Special attention is paid to a previously relatively unnoticed difference among languages that do not exhibit the so-called sequence of tense phenomena, such as Japanese, Polish, and Russian. In Chapter 2, a theory of tense is proposed that employs explicit quantification over times. The temporal <b>interpretation</b> of relative <b>clauses</b> and participle constructions in English, Japanese, Polish, and Russian is examined. Cross-linguistic differences are shown to follow from the proposed tense system and structural differences in relative clauses among these languages. Chapter 3 examines the distribution of tense and its interpretation in temporal adjunct clauses. Again, cross-linguistic differences are derived from our proposal regarding the tense system in conjunction with differences in the structure of temporal adjunct clauses. ...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{consider}} the prospects for developing a consistent variant of the Theory of Constructions originally proposed by Georg Kreisel and Nicolas Goodman in light of two developments which have been traditionally associated with the theory—i. e. Kreisel’s second <b>clause</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the intuitionistic connectives, and an antinomy about constructive provability sometimes referred to as the Kreisel-Goodman paradox. After discussing the formulation of the theory itself, we then discuss how it can be used to formalize the BHK interpretation in light of concerns about the impredicativity of intuitionistic implication and Kreisel’s proposed amendments to overcome this. We next reconstruct Goodman’s presentation of a paradox pertaining to a “naive” variant of the theory and discuss the influence this had on its subsequent reception. We conclude by considering various means of responding to this result. Contrary to the received view that the second <b>clause</b> <b>interpretation</b> itself contributes to the paradox, we argue that the inconsistency arises in virtue of an interaction between reflection and internalization principles similar to those employed in Artemov’s Logic of Proofs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAlternation of {{forward and}} {{backward}} analyses is a standard technique in abstract interpretation of programs, which is in particular useful when we wish to prove unreachability of some undesired program states. The current state-of-the-art technique for combining forward (bottom-up, in logic programming terms) and backward (top-down) abstract <b>interpretation</b> of Horn <b>clauses</b> is query-answer transformation. It transforms a system of Horn clauses, such that standard forward analysis can propagate constraints both forward, and backward from a goal. Query-answer transformation is effective, but has issues that we wish to address. For that, we introduce a new backward collecting semantics, which is suitable for alternating {{forward and backward}} abstract <b>interpretation</b> of Horn <b>clauses.</b> We show how the alternation {{can be used to}} prove unreachability of the goal and how every subsequent run of an analysis yields a refined model of the system. Experimentally, we observe that combining forward and backward analyses is important for analysing systems that encode questions about reachability in C programs. In particular, the combination that follows our new semantics improves the precision of our own abstract interpreter, including when compared to a forward analysis of a query-answer-transformed system...|$|R
