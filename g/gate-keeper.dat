In 1959, a shrine was created outside the Shiva temple, from where the stone image of Nandanar looks eternally at Shiva. Nandanar is depicted with his hands joined above his head, praying to Shiva. Scenes of Bharati's opera and the local legend of Nandanar and Ganesha digging the temple tank are seen on the shrine.|$|E

Boros died April 27, 2007. The Tower was controversial in the neighborhood; some viewed it as a masterpiece, others as an eyesore. It was a makeshift structure, 65 feet high, assembled of wooden planks. The [...] "toys" [...] suspended from it were an amalgamation of fanciful objects found on the street (Boros was a strong voice for reusing and recycling). The fantastical, childlike feeling of this installation was fitting, considering that the garden boasts a children's adventure playground and garden. The tower appeared in the opening credits for the television show NYPD Blue and also appears in the musical Rent. In May 2008, it was dismantled. According to NYC Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe, the tower was rotting and thus a safety hazard. Its removal was seen by some {{as a symbol of the}} neighborhood's fading past.|$|E

More and more, medical suppliers are incorporated into the process of guiding patients to medical specialists and hospitals and thus managing the course of disease. In this context, the role of medical <b>gate-keepers</b> and case managers may provide opportunities for undesirable behavior (from the network's point of view). Therefore, compensation-induced incentives for gatekeepers and case managers are in {{the main focus of}} the paper. Different health care payment systems and the impact of financial and non-financial incentives on case managers and <b>gate-keepers</b> in medical networks are analyzed. Another focus is laid on medical suppliers that are not involved in managing diseases and guiding patients. Due to their smaller margin of actions and possibilities to take advantage of it, reimbursement should emphasize different aspects than for case managers. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{successful}} organizations grow market presence through incremental product development, {{new product}} lines and radical innovation, {{they end up}} with a portfolio of products. In such an environment, new product ideas come {{from a variety of sources}} and at different rates, requiring varying forms of idea assessment criteria and models. The individuals responsible for screening the new product ideas face a unique engineering and technology management challenge in terms of being proficient in many aspects and methods of idea screening. Stage-gate™ is an innovation lifecycle or idea screening process that inserts gates, or Go/No-Go decision points between phases where the idea is developed before finally launching into the development of the idea into a marketable product. At these gates, <b>gate-keepers</b> or decision-makers make the Go/No-No decisions on whether the idea should be allowed to progress into the next phase. This study delves into the complexities that decision-makers face during the innovation lifecycle in a product portfolio environment. The gates are challenging in today’s fast-paced technology evolution model as the <b>gate-keepers</b> need to make the decision quickly. First, the key influencing factors that the gatekeepers face are established. Through interviews with three <b>gate-keepers</b> across different technology markets, a basic relationship between some of the key the influencing factors and the decisionmaking modeling used during the idea screening process is developed. The key contribution from this study is establishing the relationship between the influencing factors and the screening process or method that is employed by the decision-makers based upon the idea in consideration...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as an {{international}} standard-setter and an inter-governmental body established in 1989 and has set various measures consisting of legal, regulatory and operational ones in governing money laundering and terrorism financing. Given the threats of such crimes and the vulnerabilities of some professions and businesses to such crimes, in 2003 the FATF included them under the AML/CFT regime. Since then, those professions and businesses became the <b>gate-keepers</b> and known as the designated non-financial business and professions (DNFBPs). As a consequence of such inclusion, several mandatory obligations were imposed on these <b>gate-keepers,</b> involving customer due diligence, record-keeping, reporting obligation, the compliance function and training programme for employees. It is within this context that {{the objective of this}} paper is to examine the extent to which the FATF is moulding the AML/CFT regime in Malaysia, which in turn, is shaping the compliance of legal profession, who now have to “police” their clients for evidence of money laundering and terrorist financing. The authors contend that the gate-keeping role of the legal practitioners inevitably raises controversial issues involving the violation of ethical conduct, professional legal privilege and also the independence of the legal profession...|$|R
