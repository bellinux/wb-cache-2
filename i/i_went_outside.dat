500|$|......<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> {{on hearing}} enemy planes. I counted them aloud. Ten. They dived {{straight}} on Southampton, without any preliminaries, through {{a barrage of}} gunfire, one after the other. Alfred saw a bomb released, then handed the glasses (Binoculars) to me. The aircraft had twin-rudders, and might have been Dorniers or Jaguars [...] The dives were fast but shallow, and they pulled out of them at about 2,000 feet. It was not a dive-bombing attack proper. Soldiers passing made inane remarks about 'nothing could live in that barrage', although the Germans were living in it, too. The barrage was quite good, {{but none of the}} Huns were brought down....Very quickly and efficiently the Germans re-formed and disappeared into the cloud. I have never seen a better bit of flying than those Nazi pilots [...] put up – they got into formation like a well-drilled team, in the teeth of guns.|$|E
2500|$|McGreavy {{was arrested}} by police at 3:50 am, {{walking on a street}} near the Ralphs' home. Upon his arrest, McGreavy {{reportedly}} said, [...] "What's this all about?" [...] At first, McGreavy denied any responsibility, but, several hours later said, [...] "It was me, but, it wasn’t me," [...] after which he described in graphic detail what he had done. He told police, [...] "I put my hand over her (Samantha's) mouth, and it went from there. It's all in the house. On Paul, I used a wire. I was going to bury him, but I couldn't. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside,</b> {{and put them on the}} fence. All I could hear is kids, kids, kids." [...] McGreavy's only explanation for the murders was that the baby would not stop crying.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside,</b> where a {{group of}} elderly men were {{discussing}} the tax rates; and after remaining a few minutes with them, I {{came to the conclusion that}} the pleasantest thing I could do would be to take a stroll over the country.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside,</b> {{not knowing}} whether {{to be angry}} or amused with these queer people. In the broad light of day Holston looked {{as bad as it}} had made me feel by night. All I could see were the station and freight-sheds, several stores with high, wide signs, glaringly painted, and a long block of saloons. When I had turned a street corner, however, a number of stores came into view with some three-storied brick buildings, and, farther out, many frame houses.|$|E

One is apt to sleep too long when one is tired. When I wakened he was not in bed and a whisky bottle I had taken from him was nearly empty. I think he must have {{disturbed}} me as he moved about, because when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> I saw him making for the river. I ran, but I came too late, and you know the rest." ...|$|E

60|$|One night--I {{think it}} was our third or fourth on the island--Barrington Cowles and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> the cottage before {{retiring}} to rest, to enjoy a little fresh air, for our room was small, and the rough lamp caused an unpleasant odour. How well I remember every little circumstance in connection with that night! It promised to be tempestuous, for the clouds were piling up in the north-west, and the dark wrack was drifting {{across the face of}} the moon, throwing alternate belts of light and shade upon the rugged surface of the island and the restless sea beyond.|$|E
60|$|The place fascinated me. I had not {{dreamed that}} a sawmill {{could be brought}} to such a pitch of {{mechanical}} perfection, and I wondered how long the timber would last at that rate of cutting. The movement and din tired me, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> upon a long platform. Here workmen caught the planks and boards as they came out, and loaded them upon trucks which were wheeled away. This platform was a world in itself. It sent arms everywhere among the piles of lumber, and once or twice I was as much lost as I had been up in the forest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Snow; by all that's lucky!" [...] I exclaimed, remembering Jones' hopes. Straightway my langour {{vanished}} {{and getting into}} my boots and coat <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside.</b> Navvy's bed lay in six inches of snow. The forest was beautifully white. A fine dazzling snow was falling. I walked to the roaring camp-fire. Jim's biscuits, well-browned and of generous size, had just been dumped {{into the middle of}} our breakfast cloth, a tarpaulin spread on the ground; the coffee pot steamed fragrantly, and a Dutch oven sizzled with a great number of slices of venison. [...] "Did you hear the Indian chanting?" [...] asked Jones, who sat with his horny hands to the blaze.|$|E

Toiv has collaborated with Heshy Walfish on 15 humorous music albums on Orthodox Jewish themes for children. Many songs are parodies of mainstream songs that Toiv has adapted to convey Jewish messages. Toiv created the characters Kivi and Tuki, and the Shteeble-Hoppers, for these albums.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Jack, {{you missed}} a little {{scrimmage}} this morning. Wetzel got in at daybreak. The storm and horses held {{him up on}} the other side of the river until daylight. He told me of your suspicions, with the additional news that he'd found a fresh Indian trail on the island just across from the inn. We went down not expecting to find any one awake; but Metzar was hurriedly packing some of his traps. Half a dozen men were there, having probably stayed all night. That little English cuss was one of them, and another, an ugly fellow, a stranger to us, but evidently a woodsman. Things looked bad. Metzar told a decidedly conflicting story. Wetzel and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> to talk over the situation, with the result that I ordered him to clean out the place." ...|$|E
60|$|When I awoke, {{the morning}} after this episode, I found the house darkened with deep, soft snow, which had blown against the large west windows, {{covering}} them with a screen. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside,</b> and saw the valley all white and ghastly below me, the trees beneath black and thin looking like wire, the rock-faces dark between the glistening shroud, and the sky above sombre, heavy, yellowish-dark, much too heavy for the world below of hollow bluey whiteness figured with black. I felt I was in a valley of the dead. And I sensed I was a prisoner, for the snow was everywhere deep, and drifted in places. So all the morning I remained indoors, looking up the drive at the shrubs so heavily plumed with snow, at the gateposts raised high with a foot or more of extra whiteness. Or I {{looked down into the}} white-and-black valley, that was utterly motionless and beyond life, a hollow sarcophagus.|$|E
60|$|This {{dialogue}} made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal {{wind was}} muttering round the house, {{the tide was}} flapping at the shore, and I {{had a feeling that}} we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced Provis to go up to bed, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> with my two companions (Startop by this time knew the state of the case), and held another council. Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer's time, which would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off early in the morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an hour or so of the steamer's time, and then to get out in her track, and drift easily with the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into the house and went to bed.|$|E

60|$|Frank's {{face was}} a study for a {{psychologist}} when Jim actually apologized to Wallace for being so careless with his pans. I did not betray Frank, but I resolved to keep a still closer watch on him. It was partially because of this uneasy sense of his trickiness in the fringe of my mind that I made a discovery. My sleeping-bag rested on a raised platform in one corner, and at a favorable moment I examined the bag. It had not been tampered with, but I noticed a string turning out through a chink between the logs. I found {{it came from a}} thick layer of straw under my bed, and had been tied {{to the end of a}} flatly coiled lasso. Leaving the thing as it was, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> and carelessly chased the hounds round the cabin. The string stretched along the logs to another chink, where it returned into the cabin at a point near where Frank slept. No great power of deduction was necessary to acquaint me with full details of the plot to spoil my slumbers. So I patiently awaited developments.|$|E
60|$|When I was a {{very little}} lad, I had a very little dog called Punch. I saw to his feeding myself. Some one in the {{household}} had shot a lot of ducks, {{and we had a}} fine meat dinner. When I had finished, I prepared Punch's dinner--a large plateful of bones and tidbits. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> to give it to him. Now it happened that a visitor had ridden over from a neighboring ranch, and with him had come a Newfoundland dog as big as a calf. I set the plate on the ground. Punch wagged his tail and began. He had before him a blissful half-hour at least. There was a sudden rush. Punch was brushed aside like a straw in the path of a cyclone, and that Newfoundland swooped down upon the plate. In spite of his huge maw he must have been trained to quick lunches, for, in the fleeting instant before he received the kick in the ribs I aimed at him, he completely engulfed the contents of the plate. He swept it clean. One last lingering lick of his tongue removed even the grease stains.|$|E
60|$|When I awoke {{yesterday}} morning {{there was a}} strange tremor in the air. A gang of platelayers and navvies were making a new siding by the station, and sounds of hammering also came from the engine shed. But this tremor made itself felt above these {{and all the other}} noises of a waking camp, a silent thudding, a vibration which scarcely seemed to constitute what is called sound, yet which left an intense impression on the ear. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> the tent to listen. Morning had just broken, and the air was still and clear. What little wind there was came from the northwards, from the direction of Ladysmith, and I knew that it carried to Estcourt the sound of distant cannon. When once the sounds had been localised it was possible to examine them more carefully. There were two kinds of reports: one almost a boom, the explosion evidently of some very heavy piece of ordnance; the other only a penetrating whisper, that of ordinary field guns. A heavy cannonade was proceeding. The smaller pieces fired at brief intervals, sometimes three or four shots followed in quick succession. Every few minutes the heavier gun or guns intervened. What was happening? We could only try to guess, nor do we yet know whether our guesses were right. It seems to me, however, that Sir George White must have made an attack at dawn on some persecuting Boer battery, and so brought on a general action.|$|E
