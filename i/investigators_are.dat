25|$|Scientists {{discount}} {{the existence of}} Bigfoot and consider {{it to be a}} combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax, rather than a living animal. They note the lack of physical evidence after centuries of investigation, despite the fact that numerous creatures would have to exist in order to maintain a breeding population. A small group of <b>investigators</b> <b>are</b> sustained in their interest by occasional new reports of sightings. Such reports are attributed to persons seeing various animals, particularly black bears.|$|E
25|$|Criminals {{have been}} known to wear leather gloves during the {{commission}} of crimes. Gloves are worn by criminals because the tactile properties of the leather allow for good grip and dexterity. These properties are the result of a grain present {{on the surface of the}} leather.

25|$|The {{incident}} {{resulted in}} the first fatality on a spacecraft in flight since the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. The survival of pilot Peter Siebold also {{marks the first time}} in history that anyone has survived the destruction of a spacecraft during a flight when others on board have died. <b>Investigators</b> <b>are</b> trying to determine how Siebold managed to get out of the rocket plane and parachute to the ground from an altitude of roughly 50,000 feet, an altitude virtually devoid of oxygen. On November 7, Siebold told investigators that the aircraft broke up around him. He was still strapped into his seat. He released the straps and his parachute later deployed automatically. Siebold was not wearing a pressure suit during the flight.|$|E
25|$|Six {{months before}} his murder, Bermúdez Zacarías issued a {{complaint}} to the CJF for several irregularities he found in his job when he joined as an appeals judge in 2016. According to Bermúdez Zacarías' findings, Mayumi Guadalupe Sánchez Torres, the wife of his predecessor Jorge Arturo Porras Gutiérrez, was visiting several inmates at Altiplano prison without justification. Her job was to legally notify inmates of their cases in person, but Bermúdez Zacarías also discovered that she was abusing this right and visiting other inmates who were not in their itinerary. Sánchez Torres was an actuary at the appeals court and was accompanied by another actuary, Ana Lilia Coyote Colín, during her prison visits. They were taken to prison by Alejandro Coyote Colín, {{who served as the}} driver. Bermúdez Zacarías discovered that the driver also spoke with the inmates and posed as an actuary. This complaint led the CJF to investigate and suspend Sánchez Torres, Ana Lilia, and two other people. <b>Investigators</b> <b>are</b> considering this line of investigation as a possible motive for his murder.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{learning}} about Hsu's proposed investment scheme, Irvine, California, businessman Jack Cassidy became concerned and warned the California Democratic Party that Hsu's activities {{may not have}} been legitimate.

500|$|The mu wave is of {{interest}} {{to a variety of}} scholars. Scientists who study neural development are interested in the details of the development of the mu wave in infancy and childhood and its role in learning. [...] Since a group of researchers believe that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is strongly influenced by an altered mirror neuron system and that mu wave suppression is a downstream indication of mirror neuron activity, many of these scientists have kindled a more popular interest in investigating the mu wave in people with ASD. Assorted <b>investigators</b> <b>are</b> also in the process of using mu waves to develop a new technology: the brain-computer interface (BCI). With the emergence of BCI systems, clinicians hope to give the severely physically disabled population new methods of communication and a means to manipulate and navigate their environments.|$|E
500|$|Following Fight Clubs release, several fight clubs were {{reported}} to have started in the United States. A [...] "Gentleman's Fight Club" [...] was started in Menlo Park, California in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry. Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers. An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus. The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002. Helder's goal was to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in Fight Club in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior. On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop in the Upper East Side. The New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate [...] "Project Mayhem". In September 2015, two employees at Lightbridge Academy, a New Jersey daycare center, were charged with instigating [...] "Fight Club–style" [...] brawls between children aged four to six years of age. The fights {{were reported}}ly filmed and uploaded to Snapchat, a video messaging application, and involved approximately a [...] "dozen boys and girls". In the videos, one of the perpetrators, Erica Kenny, can be heard making references to Fight Club. The charges stem from an incident that occurred on August 13, 2015, but <b>investigators</b> <b>are</b> looking into whether the fights were ongoing.|$|E
