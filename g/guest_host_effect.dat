In U.S. radio, the concept of a <b>guest</b> <b>host</b> is known as a [...] "swing jock".|$|R

5000|$|Carson's contract, {{that took}} effect in 1981, reduced his work {{schedule}} to three nights a week, 37 weeks a year. [...] "Best of Carson" [...] reruns aired on Tuesdays {{in the weeks}} that Carson was hosting new shows. Monday night shows and shows for most of the 15 weeks that Carson had off were <b>hosted</b> by <b>guest</b> <b>hosts.</b> Due to the frequent need for substitutes, starting in 1983 permanent <b>guest</b> <b>hosts</b> were hired in order to give the program more stability. The permanent <b>guest</b> <b>hosts</b> were Joan Rivers (1983-86), then, after about a year where a wide range of <b>guest</b> <b>hosts</b> were used, Garry Shandling alternating with Jay Leno (1987-88) and finally Leno alone (1988-92) after Shandling left to focus on his Showtime series It's Garry Shandling's Show.

Leno joked that although other <b>guest</b> <b>hosts</b> had upped their fees, he had kept his low, assuring himself more bookings. Eventually, Monday night was for Leno, Tuesday for The Best of Carson—rebroadcasts usually dating from a year earlier, but occasionally from the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|In this section, {{members of}} the {{audience}} are invited to ask the <b>guest</b> <b>host</b> some questions. These questions range from simple things about the <b>guest</b> <b>host's</b> career, to cruder questions about topics such as the host's sex life, whether they have committed a crime etc. From Series 5 there were also questions on VT from celebrity friends of the <b>guest</b> <b>host</b> and from special guests in the audience.

This morphed into My Question Time after the removal of the next segment and leading directly into the musical guest performance.|$|R
