5|$|A {{far-reaching}} <b>generalization</b> <b>of</b> {{addition of}} natural numbers is {{the addition of}} ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers in set theory. These give two different generalizations of addition of natural numbers to the transfinite. Unlike most addition operations, addition of ordinal numbers is not commutative. Addition of cardinal numbers, however, is a commutative operation {{closely related to the}} disjoint union operation.|$|E
5|$|He {{articulated}} {{the principle of}} relativity. This was understood by Hermann Minkowski to be a <b>generalization</b> <b>of</b> rotational invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are the principle of equivalence, general covariance and the principle of adiabatic invariance of the quantum number.|$|E

5|$|The {{configuration}} {{of a circle}} tangent to four circles in the plane has special properties, which have been elucidated by Larmor (1891) and Lachlan (1893). Such a configuration is also the basis for Casey's theorem, itself a <b>generalization</b> <b>of</b> Ptolemy's theorem.|$|E
5|$|This {{and related}} {{predictions}} follow {{from the fact}} that light follows what is called a light-like or null geodesic—a <b>generalization</b> <b>of</b> the straight lines along which light travels in classical physics. Such geodesics are the <b>generalization</b> <b>of</b> the invariance of lightspeed in special relativity. As one examines suitable model spacetimes (either the exterior Schwarzschild solution or, for more than a single mass, the post-Newtonian expansion), several effects of gravity on light propagation emerge. Although the bending of light can also be derived by extending the universality of free fall to light, the angle of deflection resulting from such calculations is only half the value given by general relativity.|$|E
