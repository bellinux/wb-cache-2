40|$|Abstract. This paper solves two puzzles {{about the}} {{interpretation}} of appositive constructions in English: (i) it explains why appositives robustly PROJECT {{even though they are}} interpreted in situ with respect to order-dependent phenomena such as discourse anaphora; (ii) it analyzes certain non-projective readings of appositives as instances of PERSPECTIVE SHIFT, a phenomenon that bears striking similarities with the phenomenon of shifted indexical pronouns. To solve the first puzzle, I assume that appositives are interpreted in surface position but adopt a less standard mech-anism of operator scope according to which operators can bind lexical predicates or other operators. Since appositives form <b>ForcePs</b> and Force operators cannot be bound, it follows that appositives project even when placed in the syntactic scope of a higher operator. With respect to the second puzzle, I argue that shifted appositives are evaluated with respect to a secondary speech context introduced by a verb of saying or inferred from the larger discourse. Since the two mechanisms of projection and perspective shift are independent, they can be given a uniform analysis...|$|R

When a <b>forcep</b> was used to manually move a wing up and down, {{not only did the}} opposite wing move in synchrony, the halteres also beat in antiphase with both wings. The source of this coupling however, was not between the muscles which control the halteres and those that control the wings.

50|$|Labidura riparia is {{a species}} of earwig in the family Labiduridae, {{formerly}} Forficula riparia , characterized by their modified cerci as forceps, and light tan color.

They are sometimes wrongly referred to as Labidura japonica, although said species is actually a subspecies, Labidura riparia japonica, found only in Japan. L. riparia are a cosmopolitan species primarily in tropical to subtropical regions. Body size varies greatly, ranging from 16 mm to 30 mm, with 10 abdominal segments. Males and females differ in <b>forcep</b> size, with males having much larger and stronger curve, while females have smaller, straighter forceps with a slight curve at the end. Earwigs use these forceps to assist in predation, defense, sexual selection, courting and mating, and wing folding.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Delayed colonic postpolypectomy {{bleeding}} is the commonest serious complication after polypectomy. This study {{aimed to}} utilize massive sampling data of polypectomy to analyze {{risk factors for}} delayed postpolypectomy bleeding. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The endoscopic data of 5600 patients with 15553 polyps removed (2005 to 2013) were analyzed retrospectively through univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis to evaluate the risk factors for delayed bleeding. RESULTS: Delayed postpolypectomy bleeding occurred in 99 polyps (0. 6 %). The rates of bleeding for different polypectomy methods including hot biopsy <b>forcep,</b> biopsy <b>forcep,</b> Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC), Endoscopy piecemeal mucosal resection (EPMR), Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR), and snare polypectomy were 0. 1 %, 0. 0 %, 0. 0 %, 6. 9 %, 0. 9 % and 1. 0 %, respectively. The risk factors for delayed bleeding were the size of polyps over 10 mm (odds ratio [OR] = 4. 6, 95 % CI, 2. 9 - 7. 2), pathology of colonic polyps (inflammatory/hyperplastic, OR = 1; adenomatous, OR = 1. 4, 95 % CI, 0. 7 - 2. 6; serrated, OR = 1. 5, 95 % CI, 0. 2 - 11. 9; juvenile, OR = 4. 3, 95 % CI, 1. 8 - 11. 0; Peutz-Jegher, OR = 3. 3, 95 % CI, 1. 0 - 10. 7), and immediate postpolypectomy bleeding (OR = 2. 9, 95 % CI, 1. 4 - 5. 9). In addition, although polypectomy method was not a risk factor, compared with hot biopsy <b>forcep,</b> snare polypectomy, EMR, and EPMR had increased risks of delayed bleeding, with ORs of 3. 2 (0. 4 - 23. 3), 2. 8 (0. 4 - 21. 7) and 5. 1 (0. 5 - 47. 7), respectively.

40|$|Background- Lung Cancer is {{the leading}} cause of cancer deaths around the world. Lung cancer has been the most common cancer {{worldwide}} since 1985 and is the largestcontributor to new cancer diagnosis and death from cancer. Lung cancer accounts for 13. 8 % of all cancer diagnosis in India. Due to high prevalence of smoking behavior inrural and urban zones Lung cancer is the dominant category found in western part ofRajasthan. Since its introduction; fiberoptic bronchoscope has become an increasinglyimportant diagnostic and therapeutic tool in respiratory diseases including lung cancer. Various diagnostic techniques like <b>Forcep</b> biopsy, bronchial washing and bronchialbrushing, transbronchial needle aspiration cytology (TBNA) are employed duringfiberoptic bronchoscopy to increase the diagnostic yield. Methods- This is a prospective study conducted during March 2011 - Sept. 2012 atBronchoscopy unit of K N Chest Hospital Jodhpur, to find the role of TBNA techniqueduring Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and was compared to other CDTs in Diagnosing Lungmalignancies, included 210 patients on the basis of clinical and radiological features ofmalignancy. Fiberoptic Bronchoscopic abnormalities were categorized as ExophyticEndobronchial Lesions, Submucosal Lesions, Peribronchial Lesions and Noabnormality. TBNA and other CDTs like <b>Forcep</b> Biopsy, Bronchial Brush andBronchial Wash were performed during bronchoscopy procedure. Histopathologicaland cytological examinations of specimens were performed at Pathology department. The statistical analysis was done using Chi Square test. Results- In Exophytic Endobronchial Lesions, yield of TBNA, CDTs and TBNA plusCDTs were 62. 60 %, 79. 67 % and 84. 55 % respectively. Yield difference of all thesetechniques is highly significant (p 0. 8). In Peribronchial Lesions TBNA hassignificant yield i. e. 63. 41 % individually as compared to <b>Forcep</b> biopsy 26. 82 % andCDT 39. 02 % (p< 0. 001). Total yield of all fiberoptic bronchoscopy guided procedureswhen no documented abnormality was 20. 00 %, which was documented with BronchialWash only. Squamous cell carcinoma was most common histological type observed. Overall diagnostic yield of Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy in confirming the diagnosis was 71. 95 %. Conclusion- Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy procedure continues to be safe even withinclusion of TBNA to routine Conventional Diagnostic techniques. Transbronchialneedle aspiration (TBNA) is a beneficial, safe, and minimally invasive bronchoscopictechnique and to be considered routinely during Fiberoptic bronchoscopy procedure toincrease the yield with insignificant side effect in the diagnosis of Bronchogeniccarcinoma. _____________________________________________________________________...|$|E

40|$|Andrea Anderloni, Manol Jovani, Cesare Hassan, Alessandro RepiciDigestive Endoscopy Unit, Division of Gastroenterology, Humanitas Research Hospital, Rozzano, Milan, ItalyAbstract: The {{major role}} of {{colonoscopy}} with polypectomy {{in reducing the}} incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer has been firmly established. Yet there is cause to be uneasy. One {{of the most striking}} recent findings is that there is an alarmingly high incomplete polyp removal rate. This phenomenon, together with missed polyps during screening colonoscopy, is thought to be responsible for the majority of interval cancers. Knowledge of serrated polyps needs to broaden as well, since they are quite often missed or incompletely removed. Removal of small and diminutive polyps is almost devoid of complications. Cold snare polypectomy seems to be the best approach for these lesions, with biopsy <b>forcep</b> removal reserved only for the tiniest of polyps. Hot snare or hot biopsy <b>forcep</b> removal of these lesions is no longer recommended. Endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection have proven to be effective in the removal of large colorectal lesions, avoiding surgery in the majority of patients, with acceptably low complication rates. Variants of these approaches, as well as new hybrid techniques, are being currently tested. In this paper, we review the current status of the different approaches in removing polypoid and nonpolypoid lesions of the colon, their complications, and future directions in the prevention of colorectal cancer.
