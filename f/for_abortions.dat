5|$|Agnes Mary Mansour (April 10, 1931 – December 17, 2004) was an American Roman Catholic nun who {{was given}} a choice from the Vatican in 1983 to end her {{religious}} vows or to resign from her position {{as the director of}} the Michigan Department of Social Services which required her to support and allocate public funding <b>for</b> <b>abortions.</b> The controversy involved her belief that abortion was tragic but should be legal, despite her vows as a religious and the teachings of the Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|After {{the general}} {{election}} in November 1982, the incoming Michigan governor, James Blanchard, appointed Mansour in December to the directorship of the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS); Michigan's biggest agency. The administrative position involved oversight of public health programs including disbursement of some $5million in federal monies from Medicaid <b>for</b> <b>abortions.</b> To accept the appointment, she asked for and received permission from her order and from Szoka. Szoka asked Mansour to publicly state her opposition to abortion; he said he originally gave his approval on this condition. Mansour did not follow his request. Though she personally disapproved of abortion, she knew that many others felt differently, and she determined that the poor should have equal access to abortion {{as long as it}} was legal.|$|E

After rejecting Democratic Rep. Lois Capps's amendment to segregate abortion funding, the House or Representatives voted for tighter restrictions on federal funding for elective abortions via the Stupak Amendment.|$|E
