5|$|Classifying {{aluminium}} as a metalloid {{has been}} disputed given its many metallic properties. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore,</b> arguably, {{an exception to}} the mnemonic that elements adjacent to the metal–nonmetal dividing line are metalloids.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, at {{the extreme}} edge of the fieldfare's {{breeding}} range, {{only a handful of}} pairs breed. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> classified by the RSPB as a Red List species as of January 2013.|$|E
5|$|As {{this tournament}} takes {{place during the}} same time period as the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs, NHL players {{generally}} only become available if their respective NHL team did not make the playoffs, or once they have been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> common for several NHL players to join the World Championships while the tournament is already in progress.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{reliable}} geostationary satellite coverage in 1966, the number of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> very possible that there are additional Category5 hurricanes other than those listed, {{but they were not}} reported and therefore not recognized. However, the lack of Pacific Category5 hurricanes during the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, is certain.|$|E
5|$|Breeding over a huge area, the Siberian accentor has a {{large and}} {{apparently}} stable population. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although, as a northern breeding species, it may be affected by climate change in the long term. October and November 2016 saw an unprecedented influx of this species into western Europe, reaching {{as far as the}} United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Nikephoros is {{no longer}} {{mentioned}} by name after 792; instead, the brothers are mentioned collectively. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> questionable whether he is {{to be included in}} subsequent events, although traditionally (including in reference works like the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium) it is held that he did share in his brothers' fate and died after 812.|$|E

5|$|Parrotfinches may be preyed upon by {{indigenous}} {{birds of}} prey such as the endemic Fiji goshawk, or by introduced mammals such as the small Asian mongoose, rats, and mice, {{and they may be}} susceptible to disease. The Fiji species, despite being both uncommon and endemic to one island group, appears to be stable in numbers. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and it is protected under Fijian law.|$|E
5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware of}} which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{amounts of}} iron {{occur in the}} iron sulfide mineral pyrite (FeS2), but it is {{difficult}} to extract iron from it and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> not used. In fact, iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it. During weathering, iron tends to leach from sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate. Both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even mildly elevated pH as iron(III) oxide.|$|E

5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{suggested}} that the Games were alluded to in playwright William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, and used that as evidence to suggest that Shakespeare may have seen the Games. But the allusion is not present in the quarto edition of 1602, making its first appearance in the posthumous First Folio of 1623, edited by Henry Condell and John Hemminges. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> uncertain {{whether or not it was}} written by Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|The E3 Harelbeke {{is part of}} {{the spring}} {{classics}} season. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> suited to the riders who ride in the several other similar races through {{the early part of the}} season, such as the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, the Tour of Flanders and the Dwars door Vlaanderen, which are often raced over the same roads.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or {{act as an}} {{involuntary}} host to the common cuckoo, but overall its population is large and stable, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

5|$|The {{blackcap}} has a {{very large}} range, and its population in Europe is estimated at 25–49million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Africa and Asia, the total population is between 80–196million individuals. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{has been}} linked with genetic mutations in genes that code for certain ion channels that transport electrolytes (sodium and potassium) across cell membranes. The main ones are the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit and potassium inward rectifier 2.6; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> classified as a channelopathy. The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into cells, under conditions of high thyroxine (thyroid hormone) levels, usually with an additional precipitant.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{king of the}} third kingdom is Ibbit-Lim, who {{described}} himself as the Mekim of Ebla. A basalt votive statue bearing Ibbit-Lim's inscription was discovered in 1968; this helped to identify the site of Tell-Mardikh with the ancient kingdom Ebla. The name of the king is Amorite {{in the view of}} Pettinato; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> probable the inhabitants of third kingdom Ebla were predominantly Amorites, as were most of the inhabitants of Syria at that time.|$|E

5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{has a large}} range, {{estimated at}} 13.2millionkm2 (5.1millionmi2) and a total population estimated at 80–200million individuals, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. There was some northward range expansion in Scotland, Belgium, Norway, and Finland during the 20th century, assisted by the spread of conifer plantations. The population is currently stable, although there may be temporary marked declines in harsh winters.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} pintail {{has a large}} range, estimated at , and a population estimated at 5.3–5.4 million individuals. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> not believed to meet the IUCN Red List threshold criterion of a population decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations, and is evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E
