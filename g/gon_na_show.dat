40|$|Currently, {{there are}} two {{categories}} of antiviral drugs used for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) : interferons (IFNs) and nucleos(t) ide analogues (<b>NAs).</b> IFNs <b>showed</b> lower efficacy and more adverse effects, although they achieved some anti-HBV results. <b>NAs</b> <b>showed</b> stronger antiviral activity and a lower incidence rate of adverse effects; however, {{there are also some}} problems, such as high risk of relapse after the NAs are discontinued and increased rate of drug resistance with a longer course of treatment. Therefore, it is very important for clinicians to investigate the optimal therapy against HBV to further improve efficacy and safety in the treatment of CHB. In this paper, the research on combination therapy and sequential therapy against HBV is reviewed, in the hope that clinicians may have a deeper knowledge of combination therapy and sequential therapy against HBV, so as to provide more choices for antiviral therapy of CHB patients...|$|R

40|$|Ambient {{particles}} {{have been}} consistently associated with adverse health effects, yielding mainly high cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. Diesel engines represent {{a major source}} of particles in the urban scenario. We aimed to modify the composition of diesel particles, by means of different extraction procedures, to relate changes in chemical profile to corresponding indicators of respiratory toxicity. Male BALB/c mice were nasally instilled with saline, or with diesel particles, treated or not, and assigned to five groups: saline (SHAM), intact diesel particles (DEP), and diesel particles previously treated with methanol (METH), hexane (HEX), or nitric acid (NA). Elemental composition and organic compounds were analyzed. Twenty-four hours after nasal instillation, respiratory parameters were measured and lung tissue was collected for histological analysis. Static elastance was significantly increased in groups DEP and MET in relation to the other groups. HEX and NA were different from DEP but not significantly different from SHAM and METH groups. The difference between dynamic and static elastance was increased in DEP, METH, and NA treatments; HEX was not statistically different from SHAM. DEP and METH groups presented significantly increased upper airways resistance, while DEP, METH, and <b>NA</b> <b>showed</b> higher peripheral airways resistance values. All groups had a higher total resistance than SHAM. DEP, METH, and <b>NA</b> <b>showed</b> significant increased infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells. In conclusion, diesel particles treated with hexane (HEX) resulted in a respiratory-system profile very similar to that in SHAM group, indicating that hexane treatment attenuates pulmonary inflammation elicited by diesel particles...|$|R

The lowest levels of discomfort were expressed by males within the categories of non- perceived abuse, thereby implying a high level of tolerance regarding violent conduct within their relationships, and thus also supposing great risk. This was demonstrated when men were asked the question regarding consequences of aggression (slapping, shoving and punching) within a relationship. Notably, aggressive individuals expect positive consequences (such as winning an argument) and less negative consequences (such as ending the relationship) than non-aggressive individuals (Leisring 2009; Riggs and Caufield 1997).|$|R
40|$|Construction {{industry}} is making progress {{at a high}} pace. The trend {{of the world is}} getting more biased towards the high rise buildings. Deep beams {{are one of the most}} common elements in modern construction having small span to depth ratio. Deep beams are mostly used as transfer girders. This experimental study consists of 16 reinforced concrete (RC) deep beams. These beams were divided into two groups; A and B. Groups A and B consist of eight beams each, having 381 mm (15 in) and 457 mm (18 in) depth respectively. Each group was further subdivided into four sub groups each consisting of two identical beams. Each subgroup was comprised of solid/control beam (without opening), opening above neutral axis (NA), at NA and below NA. Except for control beams, all beams with openings were strengthened with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) vertical strips. These eight groups differ from each other based on depth and location of openings. For testing sake, all beams have been loaded with two symmetrical point loads. All beams have been designed based on strut and tie model concept. The outcome of experimental investigation elaborates the difference in the shear behaviour of deep beams based on depth and location of circular openings variation. 457 mm (18 in) deep beam with openings above <b>NA</b> <b>show</b> the highest strength and 381 mm (15 in) deep beam with openings below <b>NA</b> <b>show</b> the least strength. CFRP sheets played a vital role in increasing the shear capacity of beams...|$|R

Coulomb {{breakup of}} {{unstable}} neutron rich nuclei 29, 30 Na around the ’island of inversion’ {{has been studied}} at energy around 434 MeV/nucleon and 409 MeV/nucleon respectively. Four momentum vectors of fragments, decay neutron from excited projectile and γ-rays emitted from excited fragments after Coulomb breakup are measured in coincidence.

The analysis for Coulomb breakup of 29, 30 <b>Na</b> <b>shows</b> that large amount of the cross section yields the 28 Na, 29 Na core in ground state.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of {{standard penetration test}} methods on bearing capacity analysis of shallow foundations on sand using analytical methods proposed by Parry, Meyerhof and modified Meyerhof has been carried out. The results showed three bound limits; upper, middle and lower bonds of net allowable bearing capacity, q n(a), values for isolated pad foundations placed on sand. Perry’s method gave higher values followed by the modified Meyerhof’s method and lastly by the Meyerhof’s method. Generally, q <b>n(a)</b> <b>showed</b> a decreasing trend as foundation breadth and depth increased. The q n(a) of modified Meyerhof’s model can be approximated by applying a factor of safety, FS, of 3. 25 on Perry’s model.

30|$|This {{makes it}} clear that those males or females who do not {{perceive}} themselves as abused find it difficult to define aggressive behaviour as abusive (Rodríguez-Franco et al. 2012).These results, in turn, indicate a low level of discomfort in regard to abusive conduct of their partners, which {{can be found in the}} work of Leisring (2009), which informs us that violent acts have different effects on the victims, depending on whether they were committed by a man or by a woman. Women offer results that differ from those of men: firstly, because the diverse categories of self-perception of abuse, A, NA and NPA, already offer four different forms of victimization, Sexual, Physical, Emotional Punishment and Instrumental, and secondly, with respect to the self-perception of abuse by Emotional Punishment and Instrumental Abuse, where <b>NA</b> <b>shows</b> a significantly lower level of tolerance.|$|R

In order to address such cross-verb variation while maintaining relatively simple model structures, we decided to model the two verbs separately and compare the model results in a discussion of verb-specific features in word order variation (see Section 4.2). Importantly, doing so allows us to avoid the use of higher-order interactions (e.g., the interaction between weight, givenness, and verb), which can be hard to interpret.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{tested the}} hypothesis that individuals high in negative affectivity (<b>NA)</b> <b>show</b> increased stress reactivity to stressors. There were three predictor variables: NA (measured 1 week prior to experimental participation), and two manipulated variables—demand (high/low) and behavioral control (high/low). First-year psychology students (n= 256) were randomly allocated {{to one of the}} four experimental conditions. Measures obtained were initial and post-task negative mood, coping strategies, task satisfaction, and performance (subjective and objective). Participants with high levels of NA reported more post-task negative mood in response to high demand conditions, compared to participants with low NA. A similar pattern of results emerged for task satisfaction, particularly in response to high demand-low behavioral control situations. Mediation analyses suggested this was because participants with high NA used more emotion-focused coping strategies. The study provides support for the stress reactivity role of NA in the stressor-strain process...|$|R
