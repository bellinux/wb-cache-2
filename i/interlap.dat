50|$|The {{wings of}} two angels, the Father and the Son, <b>interlap.</b> The blue colour of the Son's robe symbolizes divinity, the brown colour {{represents}} earth, his humanity, {{and the gold}} speaks of kingship of God. The wings of the Holy Spirit do not touch the Son's wings, they are imperceptibly divided by the Son's spear. The blue colour of the Holy Spirit's robe symbolizes divinity, the green colour represents new life. The poses and the inclinations of the Holy Spirit and the Son's heads demonstrate their submission to the Father, yet their placement on the thrones {{at the same level}} symbolizes equality.|$|E
5000|$|Durrell {{initially}} {{titled the}} book Justine II in his drafts. The novel includes several last minute {{changes to the}} publisher's proofs, perhaps most significantly the replacement and expansion of the novel's introductory Note. The NOTE begins: [...] "The characters and situations in this novel, the second of a group - a sibling, not a sequel to JUSTINE...." [...] And later: [...] "Three sides of space and one of time constitute the soup-mix recipe of a continuum. The four novels follow this pattern. the three first parts, however, are to be deployed spatially...and are not linked in a serial form. They <b>interlap,</b> interweave, in a purely spatial relation. Time is stayed. The fourth part alone will represent time and be a true sequel...." [...] The corrected proofs are held in the McPherson Library at the University of Victoria.|$|E
5000|$|Thieves was {{directed}} by André Téchiné {{in the style of}} film noir. Its fragmented structure has been compared to a William Faulkner's novel, particularly to The Sound and the Fury (1929). [...] The narrative — consisting of a prologue, five sections, and an epilogue — leaps around in time and switches between the viewpoints of Justin, Alex, Marie, and Juliette. The Sound and the Fury unfolds over four days, likewise, switching narrative perspectives. Both The Sound and the Fury and Thieves also have a central female character who is loved obsessively by two of the narrators: Faulkner’s novel has Caddie, who is loved by her brothers Benjy and Quentin, and Téchiné’s film has Juliette, who is the love interest of both Alex and Marie. [...] The divided time structure emphasize the <b>interlapping</b> relationships between the characters.|$|R
