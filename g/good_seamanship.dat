60|$|The workman {{of the new}} {{generation}} is full of distrust the most demoralising of social influences. He is like a sailor who believes no longer either in the <b>good</b> faith or <b>seamanship</b> of his captain, and, between desperation and contempt, contemplates vaguely but persistently the assumption of control by a collective forecastle. He is like a private soldier obsessed {{with the idea that}} nothing can save the situation but the death of an incompetent officer. His distrust is so profound that he ceases not only to believe in the employer, but he ceases to believe in the law, ceases to believe in Parliament, as a means to that tolerable life he desires; and he falls back steadily upon his last resource of a strike, and--if by repressive tactics we make it so--a criminal strike. The central fact of all this present trouble is that distrust. There is only one way in which our present drift towards revolution or revolutionary disorder can be arrested, and that is by restoring the confidence of these alienated millions, who visibly now are changing from loyalty to the Crown, from a simple patriotism, from habitual industry, to the more and more effective expression of a deepening resentment.|$|R

The exact cause of the arrest remains unknown, but it may be presumed that he came under suspicion of corresponding with the king's supporters. It is highly probable that he did so, for until the Restoration of 1660, he was regularly in communication with the Royalists, while serving the parliament, or Cromwell, so long as their service was profitable, and making no scruple of applying for grants of the confiscated lands of the king's Irish friends.|$|E

In addition, attempts to increase shipboard productivity have resulted in fewer personnel on board the vessel. This paper reports on the development and evaluation of a prototype expert system to support the cognitive processes involved in piloting: maneuvering and collision avoidance, and the practice of <b>good</b> <b>seamanship.</b> A model was constructed and implemented in a frame- and rule-based representation. The system was assessed using gaming with novice pilots in a merchant marine training facility. The results showed significant improvement in the bridge watch team performance, but no significant improvement in vessel performance in terms of trackkeeping. The paper concludes with a discussion of the motor, perceptual, and cognitive skills needed for piloting and how they could be supported by expert system technology as part of an integrated bridge system, an operational center for navigational and supervisory tasks aboard a ship. decision aids, expert systems, maritime industry...|$|E
40|$|In higher {{education}} programs that aim {{to prepare students}} for professional performance in safety-critical work activities, the introduction of simulators is seen as a fundamentally restructuring {{of the ways in which}} professional skills are developed and assessed. This, in turn, creates new challenges and possibilities for both teaching and learning a profession. This thesis examines maritime instructors’ work in supporting students’ collaborative training to become professional seafarers in simulator-based learning environments. The empirical material is based on ethnographic fieldwork and video data of simulator-based training sessions in a navigation course. The thesis consists of four studies. Study I is a literature review and synthesis of previous research on the use of simulators in master mariner training. Study II focuses on the overall organisation of simulator-based training (i. e. briefing–scenario–debriefing) and the instructor’s work throughout the three training phases. Study III examines the organisation of instructions during the scenario phase, while exploring the practice of training to apply “the rules of the road at sea” in the simulator. Study IV connects to an on-going debate on the realism and knowledge transfer of simulator-based training with respect to the work practices on board seagoing vessels for which the students are training. While previous research on the use of simulators in maritime training argues that the current training system favours training towards simulator-based tests rather than to help students become competent professionals, the findings of this thesis point in a different direction. The results of the empirical studies reveal an instructional practice and training model founded on the need to account for the general principles of <b>good</b> <b>seamanship</b> and the anti-collision regulations in maritime operations. The meaning of <b>good</b> <b>seamanship</b> and the rules of the sea are difficult to teach in abstraction, since their application involves an infinite number of contingencies that must be considered in every specific case. Based on this premise, the thesis stresses the importance of both in-scenario instruction and post-simulation debriefing in order for the instructor to demonstrate how general rules for action apply to practical situations in ways that develop students’ professional competences. Moreover, based on the findings, I argue that the relevance of simulator-based training to work contexts is a dialogical phenomenon of relating between practices. Such interactional accomplishments draw on both the students’ access to work contexts and the instructor’s ability to systematically address the similarities, differences and irregularities between practices during training in the simulator...|$|E

40|$|Several recent {{maritime}} accidents {{suggest that}} modern technology sometimes {{can make it}} difficult for mariners to navigate safely. A review of the literature also indicates that the technological remedies designed to prevent maritime accidents at times can be ineffective or counterproductive. To understand why, problem-oriented ethnography was used to collect and analyse data on how mariners understand their work and their tools. Over 4 years, 15 ships were visited; the ship types studied were small and large archipelago passenger ships and cargo ships. Mariners and others who work in the maritime industry were interviewed. What I found onboard were numerous examples of what I now call integration work. Integration is about co-ordination, co-operation and compromise. When humans and technology have to work together, the human (mostly) has to co-ordinate resources, co-operate with devices and compromise between means and ends. What mariners have to integrate to get work done include representations of data and information; rules, regulations and practice; human and machine work; and learning and practice. Mariners largely have to perform integration work themselves because machines cannot communicate in ways mariners see as useful. What developers and manufacturers choose to integrate into screens or systems is not always what the mariners would choose. There are other kinds of ‘mistakes ’ mariners have to adapt to. Basically, they arise from conflicts between global rationality (rules, regulations and legislation) and local rationality (what gets defined as <b>good</b> <b>seamanship</b> at a particular time an...|$|E

The operation of watercraft in these sensitive environments increases the hydrodynamic energy of the site through the generation of surface wakes and propeller wash. When this energy exceeds the shear force of sediment material, sediment resuspension occurs. The degree and pattern of resuspension determine the impact to resident biota. In this study, a variety of common recreational watercraft were operated in the navigable headwaters of seven creeks in the mid-Chesapeake Bay area. The craft were operated according to existing regulations and the rules of <b>good</b> <b>seamanship</b> along an established course that ranged in depth from 0. 3 to 1. 8 m. Bottom sediments from the courses on each creek were analyzed for texture prior to testing. During testing, turbidity was measured in Nephelometer Turbidity Units (NTU) at the surface, middle, and bottom of the water column at each of the depths. No significant differences in turbidity were found among the 10 watercraft (ranging from a personal watercraft to a 235 hp displacement hull vessel) tested on the different creeks; however, when resuspension was intentionally induced, only turbidity at the lower portions of the water column was significantly increased. This suggests that studies of this type require sampling throughout the water column in order to fully evaluate potential adverse effects on sediment stability, regardless of the source.

40|$|Ship {{navigation}} {{is determined}} by the ship’s position on a certain part of the fairway from the place of departure to the place of arrival. During the voyage, in a given period of time ship changes the course and the speed. Navigation itself can be viewed from the aspect when during the voyage all onboard systems are functioning properly and the person managing the ship practices <b>good</b> <b>seamanship,</b> and from the aspect when an extraordinary event occurs, which affects the possibility of maintaining the desired course and/or speed. This paper analyzes the movement of the ship in case of an extraordinary event with the assumption that the malfunction occurred in the steering system. Depending on the navigation area and the sea traffi c, such an event generates two basic maritime navigation risks, the risk of ship grounding and the risk of collision. This paper explores ship movement that, depending on the scenario, may result in ship grounding. For the purposes of conducting research on ship movement due to the assumed extraordinary event onboard, various scenarios were defi ned. To create a track model, an Euler spiral/clothoid was chosen. By modifying the parametric clothoid equation, a curve was obtained which very well approximated the curve of a turning ship. Furthermore, developed was the speed change model that can show the speed change at any point of the curve of a turning ship when the rudder defl ection was constant, and the engine was stopped. The designed models were tested in 60 scenarios in accordance to which the research on the navigation simulator was carried out. Ship track model can be used in the fi eld of research for simulation model development, the result of which will enable determining the extent of grounding damage, and after determining the extent of grounding consequences, it will enable the defi ning of acceptable risk as well...|$|E
