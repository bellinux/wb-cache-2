40|$|We {{show that}} the star {{formation}} activity of spiral galaxies has a great variety. The star formation variation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> scale <b>of</b> 10 8 yr and the mechanism responsible for the variation are discussed. Key Words : star formation, spiral galaxies I. INTRODUCTION The outline of the star formation history <b>of</b> spiral galaxies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> scale <b>of</b> Gyr is established (e. g., Sandage 1986). The star formation rate (SFR) has been deceased continuously <b>in</b> <b>an</b> exponential way, and the <b>time</b> scale <b>of</b> the decrease depends on the Hubble type of morphology. Many starburst and post-starburst galaxies exist in the Local Universe. It suggests that the SFR <b>in</b> <b>a</b> galaxy could vary greatly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> scale <b>of</b> 10 8 yr, which is a quite different view <b>of</b> the history <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> scale <b>of</b> Gyr.
