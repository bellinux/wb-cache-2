2500|$|Seismographic systems {{used for}} {{petroleum}} or other mineral exploration historically used an explosive and a wireline of <b>geophones</b> unrolled behind a truck. [...] Now most short-range systems use [...] "thumpers" [...] {{that hit the}} ground, and some small commercial systems have such good digital signal processing that a few sledgehammer strikes provide enough signal for short-distance refractive surveys. [...] Exotic cross or two-dimensional arrays of <b>geophones</b> are sometimes used to perform three-dimensional reflective imaging of subsurface features. [...] Basic linear refractive geomapping software (once a black art) is available off-the-shelf, running on laptop computers, using strings as small as three <b>geophones.</b> [...] Some systems now come in an 18" [...] (0.5 m) plastic field case with a computer, display and printer in the cover.|$|E
2500|$|Accelerographs and <b>geophones</b> {{are often}} heavy {{cylindrical}} magnets with a spring-mounted coil inside. [...] As case moves, the coil tends to stay stationary, so {{the magnetic field}} cuts the wires, inducing current in the output wires. [...] They receive frequencies from several hundred hertz down to 1Hz. [...] Some have electronic damping, a low-budget way {{to get some of}} the performance of the closed-loop wide-band geologic seismographs.|$|E
2500|$|Modern sensitivities come {{in three}} broad ranges: <b>geophones,</b> 50 to 750 V/m; local {{geologic}} seismographs, about 1,500 V/m; and teleseismographs, used for world survey, about 20,000 V/m. Instruments come in three main varieties: short period, long period and broadband. [...] The {{short and long}} period measure velocity and are very sensitive, however they 'clip' the signal or go off-scale for ground motion that {{is strong enough to}} be felt by people. [...] A 24-bit analog-to-digital conversion channel is commonplace. [...] Practical devices are linear to roughly one part per million.|$|E
30|$|A {{distributed}} {{fiber optic}} interferometric <b>geophone</b> array based on draw tower grating (DTG) array is proposed. The DTG <b>geophone</b> array {{is made by}} the DTG array fabricated based on a near-contact exposure through a phase mask during the fiber drawing process. A distributed sensing system with 96 identical DTGs in an equal separation of 20 m and an unbalanced Michelson interferometer for vibration measurement has been experimentally validated compared with a moving-coil <b>geophone.</b> The experimental {{results indicate that the}} sensing system can linearly demodulate the phase shift.

2500|$|Early seismometers used optical levers or {{mechanical}} linkages {{to amplify}} the small motions involved, recording on soot-covered paper or photographic paper. Modern instruments use electronics. [...] In some systems, the mass is held nearly motionless {{relative to the}} frame by an electronic negative feedback loop. [...] The motion of the mass relative to the frame is measured, and the feedback loop applies a magnetic or electrostatic force to keep the mass nearly motionless. The voltage needed to produce this force is {{the output of the}} seismometer, which is recorded digitally. In other systems the weight is allowed to move, and its motion produces a voltage in a coil attached to the mass and moving through the magnetic field of a magnet attached to the frame. This design is often used in the <b>geophones</b> used in seismic surveys for oil and gas.|$|E
50|$|Deflection sensors (geophones; force-balance seismometers) mounted {{radially}} {{from the}} center of the load plate measure the deformation of the pavement in response to the load. Some typical offsets are 0mm, 200mm, 300mm, 450mm, 600mm, 900mm, 1200mm 1500mm. The deflections measured at these sensors are termed D0, D200, D300 etc. The advantages of seismometers compared to <b>geophones</b> are built-in calibration devices and higher range (5 mm vs 2 mm). <b>Geophones</b> are more sensitive to disturbance immediately before the impact since the initial error is integrated. <b>Geophones</b> however are much cheaper than seismometers. Dynatest, Carl Bro, Jils and PaveTesting use <b>geophones</b> while KUAB have seismometers in their standard FWD's and <b>geophones</b> in their low-cost models.|$|E
50|$|Analog <b>geophones</b> {{are very}} {{sensitive}} devices which can respond to very distant tremors. These small signals can be drowned by larger signals from local sources. It is possible though to recover the small signals caused by large but distant events by correlating signals from several <b>geophones</b> deployed in an array. Signals which are registered only at one or few <b>geophones</b> {{can be attributed to}} unwanted, local events and thus discarded. It can be assumed that small signals that register uniformly at all <b>geophones</b> in an array can be attributed to a distant and therefore significant event.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} 10 {{stations of}} co-located seismometer, QuakeFinder/infrasound to observe co-seismic signatures {{triggered by the}} 6 February 2016 M 6. 6 Meinong Earthquake. Each QuakeFinder system consists of a 3 -axes induction magnetometer, an air conductivity sensor, a <b>geophone,</b> and temperature/relative humidity sensors. There are no obvious charges in the positive/negative ions, the temperature, and the humidity, while the magnetometer, the <b>geophone,</b> and infrasound data detect clear co-seismic signatures, similar to seismic waves recorded by seismometers. The magnetometers register high-frequency pulsations, like seismic waves, and superimpose with low-frequency variations, which could be caused by the magnetometer shaking/tilting and/or the underground water level change, respectively, upon the arrival of seismic waves. The spectrum centering around 2. 0 Hz of the co-seismic <b>geophone</b> fluctuations {{is similar to that}} of the seismic waves. However, the energy of co-seismic <b>geophone</b> fluctuations (also magnetometer pulsations) yields an exponential decay to the distance of a station to the epicenter, while the energy of the seismic waves is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. This suggests that the mechanisms for detecting seismic waves of the QuakeFinder system and seismometers are different. In general, the <b>geophone</b> and magnetometer/infrasound system are useful to record high- and low-frequency seismic waves, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The Swiss plate <b>geophone</b> {{system is}} a bedload {{surrogate}} measuring technique {{that has been}} installed in more than 20 streams, primarily in the European Alps. Here we report about calibration measurements performed in two mountain streams in Austria. The Fischbach and Ruetz gravel-bed streams are characterized by important runoff and bedload transport during the snowmelt season. A total of 31 (Fischbach) and 21 (Ruetz) direct bedload samples were obtained during a  6 -year period. Using the number of <b>geophone</b> impulses and total transported bedload mass for each measurement to derive a calibration function results in a strong linear relation for the Fischbach, whereas there is only a poor linear calibration relation for the Ruetz measurements. Instead, using <b>geophone</b> impulse rates and bedload transport rates indicates that two power law relations best represent the Fischbach data, depending on transport intensity; for lower transport intensities, the same power law relation is also in reasonable agreement with the Ruetz data. These results are compared with data and findings from other field sites and flume studies. We further show that the observed coarsening of the grain size distribution with increasing bedload flux can be qualitatively reproduced from the <b>geophone</b> signal, when using the impulse counts along with amplitude information. Finally, we discuss implausible <b>geophone</b> impulse counts that were recorded during periods with smaller discharges without any bedload transport, and that are likely caused by vehicle movement very near to the measuring sites...|$|R
