It is found that {{the composition of the}} <b>straw</b> <b>flax,</b> flax fibre bundles and woody parts, together with the cutting process strongly affects the initial fibre morphology and its variability. In the initial fibres, small particles as well as long fibres with large width were found. A filter was used to reject the fibres with an aspect ratio below 15 before calculating statistics because these fibres have a negligible contribution to the composite reinforcement. After processing, the initial fibre length and width decrease strongly (− 38 % to − 66 % for length and − 22 % to − 72 % for width). Also, the variability is affected resulting in a standard deviation shifted towards lower fibre lengths and widths (− 55 % for length and − 71 % for width). The improvement of mechanical properties of the flax compound compared to the pure matrix material for the injection-moulded samples is found to be similar to the results for compounds with further processed flax fibres such as scutched and hackled fibres. An increase of tensile strength by 20 % was found, for stiffness the increase is in the order of 50 – 70 %.

40|$|Flax (Linum usitatissimum) fibers {{have the}} {{advantages}} of low density, low cost, and recyclability and are considered as a potential material to reinforce plastic materials. Though Canada {{is one of the}} largest seed flax growing countries in the world, the utilization of flax fibers as reinforcement in composites is not as developed as in Europe. Indeed, in Canada, a large amount of <b>flax</b> <b>straws</b> are left in the fields and burned by farmers each year. Therefore, development of technologies to make use of <b>flax</b> <b>straws</b> for reinforcement in composites and for other purposes has huge benefits to both the material industries and flax farmers in Canada. This thesis presented a study of flax fibers reinforced biocomposites by injection molding through modeling and optimization. The focus of the study was to understand the relationships between the properties of biocomposites and the processing conditions through the experiment and improve the qualities of biocomposites by optimizing the processing conditions. In this thesis, biocomposites were successfully produced by injection molding with a proposed processing scheme. The influence of flax fiber loading and processing conditions, including injection temperature and pressure on the mechanical properties (tensile properties and flexural properties), and water absorption of biocomposites was investigated. The study also experimentally investigated the effect of the processing conditions (fiber content and temperature) on the rheological properties of biocomposites. In order to implement the simulation analysis of injection molding for biocomposites, the Cross-WLF model was employed to obtain the rheological information of biocomposites. Further, a systematic approach on simulation analysis and optimization of injection molding was proposed to minimize the shrinkage and warpage of biocomposites. Several conclusions are drawn from this study: 1) With respect of the influence of the processing conditions on the properties of biocomposites, (a) Fiber content is the most significant impact factor influencing the mechanical properties of biocomposites compared with the other two processing conditions and the tensile properties and flexural properties of biocomposites dreamingly increased with flax fiber content; (b) lower injection temperature led to higher tensile properties and flexural properties; (c) Water absorption of biocomposites was significantly dependent on fiber content and injection temperature; (d) Injection pressure had no significant effect on either mechanical properties or water absorption. 2) In the study on the rheological characteristics, (a) The shear viscosity of biocomposites increased with fiber content, but at very high shear rates (from 5, 000 to 10, 000 S− 1), the shear viscosities of biocomposites with various fiber content (from 0 to 30 %) tended to be the same; (b) The shear viscosity of biocomposites decreased with temperature, and at higher shear rate, all the shear viscosity variations as function of shear rates followed the same rate for different temperatures; (c) At high shear rate, the shear viscosity mostly depended on the shear rate rather than fiber content and temperature; (d) A method was presented to determine the seven parameters of the Cross-WLF model for biocomposites. 3) For minimizing the shrinkage and warpage of injection molded biocomposites, (a) The significant factors on the shrinkage and warpage of biocomposites by injection molding were injection temperature, packing time, and packing pressure; (b) The optimization of the injection molding of biocomposites for reducing the shrinkage and warpage of biocomposites was successful by integrating design of experiment (DOE) and simulation technique. The contribution of this thesis includes: 1) In the field of biocomposites reinforcement, the study has shown a great promise to use flax fibers to enhance the mechanical properties of thermoplastics, in particular an increase of 41. 83 % in tensile strength and an increase of 47. 13 % in flexural strength. In addition, this work has provided a mathematical relationship between the processing condition of injection molding and the mechanical properties of biocomposites, which would be important to control the manufacturing process to reach desired mechanical properties. 2) In the field of optimal design and manufacturing of flax fiber biocomposites, this work has provided: (a) an effective method to determine the parameters in the rheology model of the biocomposites melt, which has been an important step in simulating the process, and this method has a generalized implication to other types of biocomposites; and (b) a systematic approach to optimize the injection molding process for minimizing the shrinkage and warpage of biocomposites, which are the two most important quality issues in biocomposites...|$|R

40|$|Flax fibers {{can be used}} as {{environmentally}} friendly alternatives to conventional reinforcing fibers (e. g., glass) in composites. The interest in natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites is growing rapidly due to its high performance in terms of mechanical properties, significant processing advantages, excellent chemical resistance, low cost and low density. These advantages place natural fiber composites among the high performance composites having economic and environmental advantages. In the field of technical utilization of plant fibers, flax fiber-reinforced composites represent {{one of the most important}} areas. On the other hand, lack of good interfacial adhesion and poor resistance to moisture absorption make the use of natural fiber-reinforced composites less attractive. In order to improve their interfacial properties, fibers were subjected to chemical treatments, namely, mercerization, silane treatment, benzoylation, and peroxide treatment. Selective removal of non-cellulosic compounds constitutes the main objective of the chemical treatments of flax fibers to improve the performance of fiber-reinforced composites. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of pre-treated flax fibers on the performance of the fiber-reinforced composites. Short flax fibers were derived from Saskatchewan-grown <b>flax</b> <b>straws,</b> for use in fiber-reinforced composites. Composites consisting of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) or HDPE/LLDPE mix, chemically treated fibers and additives were prepared by the extrusion process. Extrusion is expected to improve the interfacial adhesion significantly as opposed to simple mixing of the two components. The extruded strands were then pelletized and ground. The test samples were prepared by rotational molding. The fiber surface topology and the tensile fracture surfaces of the composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy to determine whether the modified fiber-matrix interface had improved interfacial bonding. Mechanical and physical properties of the composites were evaluated. The differential scanning calorimetry technique was also used to measure the melting point of flax fiber and composite. Overall, the scanning electron microscopy photographs of fiber surface characteristics and fracture surfaces of composites clearly indicated the extent of fiber-matrix interface adhesion. Chemically treated fiber-reinforced composites showed better fiber-matrix interaction as observed from the good dispersion of fibers in the matrix system. Compared to untreated fiber-reinforced composites, all the treated fiber-reinforced composites had the same tendency to slightly increase the tensile strength at yield of composites. Silane, benzoylation, and peroxide treated fiber-reinforced composites offered superior physical and mechanical properties. Strong intermolecular fiber-matrix bonding decreased the high rate of water absorption in biocomposites. The incorporation of 10 % untreated or chemically treated flax fibers also increased the melting point of composites.

This {{study was conducted to}} determine the comparative properties of WCBs containing various amounts of discontinuous inorganic fiber materials, such as alkali-resistant glass fiber, normal glass fiber, mineral wool, and nonwood plant materials such as retted <b>flax</b> <b>straw</b> and wheat straw particles. Tested cement-bonded boards were made at wood/additive compositions of 100 / 0, 90 / 10, 80 / 20, 70 / 30, 60 / 40, and 50 / 50 (weight percentages). Seventy-eight laboratory-scale WCBs were produced. Various board properties, such as the modulus of rupture (MOR), internal bonding strength (IB), water absorption (WA), thickness swelling (TS), and linear expansion (LE), were studied. The test results showed that three types of discontinuous inorganic fiber used as reinforcing materials in composites significantly enhanced and modified the performance of WCBs. The mechanical properties and dimensional stability of cement-bonded board were significantly improved with increasing amounts of the additives. MOR and IB were increased; and WA, TS, and LE of boards were reduced by combination with the inorganic fiber materials. The results also indicated that combination with retted <b>flax</b> <b>straw</b> particles only slightly increased the MOR of boards, and wheat straw particles led to marked decreases in all the mechanical properties and the dimensional stability of WCBs.|$|E
40|$|Fibrous {{holocellulose}} pulps {{were prepared}} in approximately quantitative yield from flax shives and wheat, oat, and fiber <b>flax</b> <b>straw</b> {{that had been}} macerated in a buhrstone mill and delignified by sodium chlorite. Paper hand sheets that were formed from pulps subjected to prolonged beating were glassinelike in character. Strength of all straw holocelluloses developed slowly on beating. All papers had relatively low densities compared with the usual values for papers from wood pulps. Tear resistance was initially low for all straw holocelluloses, especially flax shives, and decreased with beating. Color reversion, due almost entirely to light, was rapid in all test sheets. Possible uses for straw holocellulose papers are suggested, although, at present, the process is too expensive to be commercially feasible. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Interest in {{recovering}} and valorizing {{agricultural biomass}} residues {{has increased in}} recent years in response to emerging economic opportunities and the potential for more sustainable use of renewable and nonrenewable resources. Agricultural crop residues are a major source of lignocellulose, with considerable potential for use as a renewable resource and lignin’s polyphenolic structure makes it a potential source of high value products such as fine chemicals. To achieve this requires characterization of the chemical composition of biomass and in this study we determined the lignin and structural carbohydrate content of various sources of agricultural biomass such as <b>flax</b> shives, wheat <b>straw,</b> wheat bran, triticale straw, triticale bran, barley straw, oat straw and mustard straw along with selected lignin samples that were isolated using an environmentally benign ionic liquid (1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate ([emim]Ac)). Pyrolysis-GC/MS was used to determine the thermal degradation products of the select biomass and lignin samples. The main phenolic compounds obtained from pyrolysis included catechol, guaiacol, 4 -vinyl guaiacol, eugenol, vanillin and isoeugenol. We quantified the lignin content of the select biomass samples directly from pyrolysis-GC/MS measurements. Lignin values obtained from pyrolysis-GC/MS (Py-lignin) were compared against conventional acid insoluble lignin values and good correlation was found between lignin values obtained from pyrolysis-GC/MS and acid insoluble lignin 2 2 content within species (R = 0. 98). Also a good correlation was established between species (R = 0. 97). This work provides information that demonstrates that pyrolysis is a depolymerization technology capable of producing high value phenolic molecules from crop residues. This work also provides information demonstrating that analytical pyrolysis can be used to assess the lignin content in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous herbaceous crop residues.

40|$|The meals {{from many}} oilseed crops contain {{biocidal}} chemicals {{that are known}} to inhibit the growth and activity of several soil pathogens, though little is known concerning impacts on whole soil microbial communities. We investigated the effect of oilseed meals (SMs) from both brassicaceous plants, including mustard and camelina, as well as non-brassicaceous plants, including jatropha and flax, on P. omnivora (the casual agent of cotton root rot) in Branyon clay soil (at 1 and 5 % application rates). We also investigated the effect of SMs from camelina, jatropha, <b>flax,</b> and wheat <b>straw</b> on microbial communities in Weswood loam soil. We also used four types of isothiocyanates (ITCs) including allyl, butyl, phenyl, and benzyl ITC to test their effects on P. omnivora growth on potato dextrose agar (PDA), {{as well as on}} soil microbial communities in a microcosm study. Community qPCR assays were used to evaluate relative abundances of soil microbial populations. Soil microbial community composition was determined through tag-pyrosequencing using 454 GS FLX titanium technology, targeting ITS and 16 S rRNA gene regions for fungal and bacterial communities, respectively. The results showed that all tested brassicaceous and jatropha SMs were able to inhibit P. omnivora sclerotial germination and hyphal growth, with mustard SM being the most effective. Flax didn't show any inhibitory effects on sclerotial germination. All tested ITCs inhibited P. omnivora OKAlf 8 hyphal growth, and the level of inhibition varied with concentration and ITC type. Total soil fungal populations were reduced by ITC addition, and microbial community compositions were changed following SM and ITC application. These changes varied according to the type of SM or ITC added. Our results indicated that SMs of several brassicaceous species as well as jatropha may have potential for reducing cotton root rot as well as some other pathogens. Different SMs releasing varied ITCs may result in differential impacts on soil microorganisms including some pathogens...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} awareness of sustainable production in our society in recent decades {{has led to the}} search for new environmentally-friendly products. Natural fibres from flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), which are renewable and can be degraded biologically after their use, are an alternative that has been considered as a replacement for synthetic fibres in many industrial applications, for example, as reinforcement in composites, rubber and concrete. The objective of` this work was to carry out a thorough literature review on the production and use of flax for non-textile applications in general, and on aspects related to harvest and handling in particular. The report starts with a review of earlier Swedish research and development projects and then focuses on harvest and handling methods. Thereafter, quality aspects related to harvest and handling of <b>flax,</b> i. e. <b>straw</b> moisture contents and degree of retting, are reviewed. A summarising discussion and proposals for future research are presented in the last chapter. After the closure of the last flax long fibre processing plant in 1966, there has been no commercial production of flax fibres in Sweden. However, interest in using flax fibres in non-textile applications was stimulated in the late 1980 s, and a number of projects started in the 1990 s with the aim of restoring Swedish flax fibre production. Today, there are no flax processing plants in operation, but it is recommended that new research and development projects be directed towards the creation of a demand for biofibres before such plants are established. This would be a first step towards creating a future market for short natural fibres obtained from flax, and also from other fibre crops such as hemp. The harvest and handling operations constitute {{an important part of the}} total production costs, Computer simulation of these operations is recommended in order to find more cost-effective and reliable delivery systems, Such simulations should include quality aspects regarding the straw moisture content and the degree of retting, provided that reliable, quick and inexpensive methods to assess the degree of retting are developed, and that models describing the moisture content changes and the progress of retting are constructed...|$|R
