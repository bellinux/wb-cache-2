At {{the beginning of the}} thesis we charakterize operation of medium voltage distribution system in general. We begin with definition and characteristics of earth fault and its compartmentalization by the type of the fault, size of the transition resistance and duration. We also mention grounding methods of node winding transformer on medium voltage distribution network and we describe the most common of them in detail, i. e. network grouded through the arc suppression coil and its operation with automatic switching auxiliary resistor. In this part of the thesis we discuss the localization of the earth fault using passive static methods in compensated systems, which include wattmetric, admittance and conductance method.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{comprehensive}} investigation {{of the influence of}} current transformer (CT) saturation on restricted <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> (REF) <b>protection</b> during power transformer magnetization inrush are presented. Since the inrush current during switch-on of unloaded power transformer is stochastic, its values are obtained by: (i) laboratory measurements and (ii) calculations based on the input data obtained by the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. To make a detailed assessment of the current transformer performance the uncertain input data for the CT model were obtained by applying the MC method. In this way, different levels of remanent flux in CT core are taken into consideration. By the generated CT secondary currents, the algorithm for REF protection based on phase comparison in time domain is tested. On the basis of the obtained results, a method of adjustment of the triggering threshold in order to ensure safe operation during transients, and thereby improve the algorithm security, has been proposed.

40|$|Protection schemes of {{electricity}} distribution networks {{are designed to}} limit {{the damage to the}} network {{in the event of a}} fault, and to provide some security and safety to the network. This thesis examines the electrical characteristics of the Source Isolated <b>Earth</b> (SIE) <b>Fault.</b> The Source Isolated <b>Earth</b> <b>Fault</b> is a type of high impedance <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> that can occur on overhead electricity networks. SIE faults are caused by a broken overhead conductor falling to ground on the load side of the span with the source end of the span isolated from the ground. A simplified model for calculation of the <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> levels in SIE faults was developed by circuit reduction of the fault schematic. The SIE fault was reduced to the equivalent of a Phase to Phase to Ground fault. Results obtained from the simplified model were compared to two peer reviewed models for SIE fault calculations in order to validate the simplified method. The comparison was undertaken in two stages, by first varying one factor at a time to determine the most significant factors and then by carrying out designed experiments on the significant factors and analysing the interactions between these factors. The results of the one factor at a time analysis identi�ed which of the factors had the largest effect on the <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> current. The most significant factor in determining the <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> level in SIE faults is the pre-fault load beyond the fault location. This knowledge can be used to identify areas where SIE fault levels may be low. Computational effciency of the three models was compared using MATLAB profiling. The simplified model was found to be significantly faster than the other methods. Confidence in the theory was bolstered by the calculation of fault levels for a case study. The results were compared between all three models and data captured during an actual SIE fault event. A process was developed that allowed existing 11 kV network feeder models to be analysed using the SIE fault models. Sections of feeder where SIE fault levels may be below conventional Sensitive <b>Earth</b> <b>Fault</b> (SEF) <b>protection</b> pickup levels were identifed. Attempts to optimise the feeder analysis led to methods of reducing the number of network nodes to be tested to find the limit of the protection zone. The extreme case analysis led to the discovery of the circuit conditions that must exist for these types of faults to be undetectable by conventional SEF protection schemes. It was discovered that the maximum possible SIE fault current can be easily estimated by applying a factor to the pre-fault load downstream of the fault location. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{takes place}} in the context of {{distribution}} power system protection and tries to improve the detection and location of <b>earth</b> <b>faults.</b> The <b>protection</b> problem is vast and many ideas emerge every year to enhance the reliability of the grid. The author has focused his energy into the compensated and isolated network protection in the specific case of single phase <b>earth</b> <b>fault.</b> This PhD thesis is divided in two main parts that might be considered as independent. The first part studies the detection of single phase <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> and the second analyzes the fault location of such fault. Pragmatism was asked during these three years because a product development was necessary especially regarding the fault detection problem. The first part of the thesis took 18 months of research and development to obtain a prototype of transient protection able to detect single phase <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> in compensated and isolated network. The sensitivity of the algorithm has been emphasized regarding the fault impedance and to detect <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> up to 5 kOhm depending on the network characteristic. The fault location problem has been much more theoretical although the problem links to the accuracy of the algorithm and its robustness regarding wrong fault location indication has been strongly considered. Compensated networks and in some conditions isolated networks are distribution from 12 kV up to 110 kV mostly used in East and North Europe but also in China. Others areas also work with such networks but they also have others systems and they do not use them on all the territory. These networks have the particularity to obtain very small fault current in case of single phase <b>earth</b> <b>fault.</b> Low current means the difference between a faulty and a sound feeder is not significant. Therefore classic overcurrent protection is completely useless to protect the network, forcing the development of more complex algorithm. A possibility to overcome the problem of the small fault current is to develop a transient protection. The transient occurring {{at the beginning of the}} fault has strong information to distinguish a faulty from a sound feeder. In this work I have chosen to use not only the transient but also the steady state to get the best sensitivity. Then the fault location has been investigated but the small information coming from the faulty feeder is not sufficient to have a precise enough position of the fault. Therefore, active system has been suggested to be implemented in the grid to increase the faulty current and have enough power for a precise location. Different existing algorithms based on the steady state at the nominal frequency are compared using a tool developed during this work. Recommendations are then made depending on the topology, the network parameters, the measurements precision, etc. Due to the complexities of the problem, a simulator has been coded in Matlab. The user of a possible fault location must then use this tool to understand and see the future fault location precision that he could obtain from different algorithm on his network.

The decision of utilization cable lines rather than overhead lines were made, which brings new features to distribution networks. The main idea of this work is a complex analysis of medium voltage distribution networks with long cable lines. High value of cable’s specific capacitance and length of lines determine such problems as: high values of earth fault currents, excessive amount of reactive power flow from distribution to transmission network, possibility of a high voltage level at {{the receiving end of}} cable feeders.

In order to provide justify solution or evaluation of mentioned above problems corresponding calculations were made and in order to analyze behavior of relay protection principles PSCAD model of the examined network have been created. Evaluation of the voltage rise in the end of a cable line have educed absence of a dangerous increase in a voltage level, while excessive value of reactive power can be a reason of final penalty according to the Finish regulations.
