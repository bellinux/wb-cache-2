40|$|AbstractThe <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> {{system can}} be viewed as a system {{composed}} of a set of concurrently interacting subsystems to generate, transmit, and distribute electric power. The complex interaction among sub-systems makes the design of <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> system complicated. Furthermore, in order to guarantee the safe generation and distribution of <b>electronic</b> <b>power,</b> the fault tolerant mechanisms are incorporated in the system design to satisfy high reliability requirements. As a result, the incorporation makes the design of such system more complicated. We propose a dependable <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> system architecture, which can provide a generic framework to guide the development of <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> system to ease the development complexity. In order to provide common idioms and patterns to the system *designers, we formally model the <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> system architecture by using the PVS formal language. Based on the PVS model of this system architecture, we formally verify the fault tolerant properties of the system architecture by using the PVS theorem prover, which can guarantee that the system architecture can satisfy high reliability requirements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFrequency is a {{standard}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> quality, and is important parameter of <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> system running state. System's frequency reflects active power supply and demand balance's basic state of <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> system. The frequency fluctuation of an <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> system is mainly affected by 10 s∼ 3 min pulse sub-component load or continuous sub-component in very slowly changing. So, adopting frequency software tracking method is very necessary. Because virtual instrument technology can largely reduce hardware cost in completing frequency tracking, and add instrument flexibility, This system uses virtual instrument LabVIEW to design a kind of frequency tracking measurement frame diagram procedure, and through system simulation, we prove this method of calculating frequency's accuracy by using virtual instrument technology...|$|R
