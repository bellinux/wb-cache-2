The fact that it is clever and the fact that the meaning of Spork could be said to be obvious once it is explained does not mean that it is obvious what it is.

5000|$|Jerry Fodor, {{considered}} one of the fathers of the computational theory of mind, criticized the book. Fodor wrote a book called The Mind Doesn't Work That Way, saying [...] "There is, in short, every reason to suppose that the Computational Theory is part of the truth about cognition. But it hadn't occurred to me that anyone could suppose that it's a very large part of the truth; still less that it's within miles of being the whole story about how the mind works". He continued, [...] "I was, and remain, perplexed by an attitude of ebullient optimism that's particularly characteristic of Pinker's book. As just remarked, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the last forty or fifty years have demonstrated pretty clearly that there are aspects of higher mental processes into which the current armamentarium of computational models, theories and experimental techniques offers vanishingly little insight." ...|$|E
50|$|Even the {{provisional}} {{conclusions of the}} report are interesting. I should like to give them to the House {{so that we may}} be reminded what the supervisory body itself decided at the end of such investigation as it was able to make. It stated on page 250:::"Barings' collapse was due to the unauthorised and ultimately catastrophic activities of, it appears, one individual (Leeson) that went undetected as a consequence of a failure of management and other internal controls of the most basic kind".The words I venture to emphasise to your Lordships are these:::"as a consequence of a failure of management and other internal controls of the most basic kind".Noble Lords who have read through paragraph 14.2 of the report will be aware that it specifies these deficiencies. The report states:::"Management teams have a duty to understand fully the businesses they manage".Really! They really have to understand the businesses! <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it was an elementary assumption to make that the controllers should understand the nature of the businesses they are trying to control.The next requirement is this:::"Responsibility for each business activity has to be clearly established and communicated".Hooray for that! I wonder how businesses in this country manage in their generality to continue without that qualification.The third requirement is:::"Clear segregation of duties is fundamental to any effective control system".Tut, tut! We are now treating the real elementum of the whole art and science of management, {{and it needs to be}} repeated here.The report continues:::"Relevant internal controls, including independent risk management, have to be established for all business activities".Hooray for that! These are matters of plain, ordinary common sense. One does not need to be an accountant or a management consultant to be aware of that.Finally:::"Top management and the Audit Committee have to ensure that significant weaknesses, identified to them by internal audit or otherwise, are resolved quickly".Well, well, well! These are all respects which this control body finds were absent from Barings. Do noble Lords really know what is being said? It is being said that Barings ought not to have been authorised bankers from the beginning, because any business — I do not care whether it is a whelk stall (one must not insult whelk stall owners in the context of this catastrophe) or what — knows that these are the basic conditions for the continuance of the business. It seems to me that the Bank of England ought never to have authorised this concern without verifying that all these conditions were in place.|$|E

40|$|Relationship {{significance}} {{is defined by}} the authors as: “the influence of business relationships on the focal firm’s survival or growth, ” which draws attention to the kinds of benefits or functions that relations can provide for a firm. These are, in critical realist terms, the powers and tendencies of relations and, on the negative side, the burdens or liabilities of relations. It is argued that the causes of relationship significance are for the most part left unidentified. This I find hard to agree with. It seems to me that a lot of IMP research, both empirical and conceptual has gone into the role of relations and networks and could be linked to and translated into a critical realist perspective. Empirical work includes that stemming from the IMP 2 study of relations and connected relations and their impact (e. g. Wiley et al 2006), which is referred to by the authors, or the work of Walter et al (2001) and Walter et al (2003) who have undertaken empirical and conceptual work on the functions and value of business relations and reviewed previous research on this topic. Conceptually the functions and value of relations and networks have been linked to the actor bonds, activity links, resource ties and schema couplings among firms involved in business relations (e. g. Anderson et al 1994, Hakansson and Snehota 1995, Wiley et al 2006). <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the significance of a relation can be understood in terms of these dimensions and their effects on th...|$|E
40|$|According to the Christian religion, Jesus was “crucified under Pontius Pilate; he {{suffered}} death and was buried. On {{the third day}} he rose again”. I take it that this rising again—the Resurrection of Jesus, as it’s sometimes called—is, according to the Christian religion, an historical event, just like his crucifixion, death, and burial. And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> to investigate whether the Resurrection occurred, {{we would need to}} do some historical research: we would need to assess the reliability of the New Testament documents and related manuscripts; we would need to look into the credibility of the witnesses to his post-mortem appearances, the empty tomb, and the like. The task looks rather daunting. But, according to David Hume, we don’t have to do anything of the kind. For no matter how strong the testimony in favor of a miracle is—indeed, even if we “suppose…that the testimony considered apart and in itself, amounts to an entire proof”—we have at our disposal a “full proof…against the existence of any miracle”. So we can avoid all that tedious historical work. We can simply use Hume’s shortcut, a proof against the existence of any miracle, and hence a proof against the Resurrection. So Hume says he has a “a decisive argument,” “an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion,” superstitious delusions like the Resurrection. There is good news and bad news in Hume’s proclamation. The good news is that he really has two arguments, not just one—or, at any rate, many scholars discern in his writings two arguments. The bad news is that neither succeeds; at any rate, try as I might, I can’t see how they do...|$|E
