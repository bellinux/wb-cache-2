5|$|A serious {{incident}} involving hooliganism before, {{during and after}} a match against Millwall in 1985 caused the club's then chairman, Conservative MP David Evans, to introduce a scheme effective {{from the start of}} 1986–87 banning all visiting supporters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> requiring home fans to carry identity cards when attending matches. Conversion to an all-seater ground also began in 1986. Away fans returned for 1990–91, and grass a year later. The David Preece Stand was erected in 1991, and the conversion of the Kenilworth Stand to an all-seater was completed in 2005.|$|E

5|$|In the Second World War, the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment and the 4th Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry held Cassel {{for three}} days {{as part of the}} {{defensive}} screen around Dunkirk during the Battle of Dunkirk and evacuation (27 May 1940 – 30 May 1940). The British forces had prepared a defence on the hilltop, emplacing anti-tank guns and barricading the narrow streets of the town. After scoring initial successes against the tanks of Panzer Regiment 11, which had made the mistake of advancing without infantry support, the British garrison was heavily attacked <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> the air by German forces. Much of the town was reduced to ruins by bombing. Most of the garrison's members were killed or captured by the Germans during the fighting or the subsequent attempted breakout towards Dunkirk, but the defence they had put up {{played an important role in}} holding up the Germans while the Dunkirk evacuation was taking place.|$|E
5|$|Natural gas {{was first}} found in Indiana in 1876 {{but it was}} not until 1886 that the {{magnitude}} of the discovery was known; the Trenton Gas Field was the largest deposit of natural gas discovered in the 19th century and the first giant oil reserve found in the United States. As a professor at a university in the Trenton Field, Haynes offered his services to the drillers and worked to analyze soil samples, determine well pressure, and give estimates on the amount of energy that could be created by the gas. He delivered several lectures to large crowds about the importance of the gas discovery and the many possible applications of this new source of fuel. He began a petition to have the local citizens create a corporation to pump the fuel <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> pipe it to area homes and businesses. His promotion was successful and Portland Natural Gas and Oil Company was formed; Haynes' father was named to the new company's board of directors.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the bird}} can be varied. They eat various forms of foliage and other grassy {{material}} that they find on the ground on in trees and shrubs. Dusky woodswallows have been seen eating termites, butterflies and other insects. They also eat nectar from flowers. One notable aspect of their feeding habits {{is the way they}} hunt flying insects, which is done by picking them up on their wing. They do, however, also eat their prey <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> they often find inconspicuous places to perch while waiting for prey, such as utility lines and the like. They have also been observed engaging in kleptoparasitism, working as a group to rob a restless flycatcher of its prey. Kleptoparasitism is extremely unusual in passerine birds, as is cooperative kleptoparasitsim in general.|$|E

5|$|The use of long-exposure {{photographic}} plates {{made possible}} the discovery of additional moons. The first to be discovered in this manner, Phoebe, was found in 1899 by W.H. Pickering. In 1966 the tenth satellite of Saturn was discovered by Audouin Dollfus, when the rings were observed edge-on near an equinox. It was later named Janus. A few years later it was realized that all observations of 1966 could only be explained if another satellite had been present {{and that it had}} an orbit similar to that of Janus. This object is now known as Epimetheus, the eleventh moon of Saturn. It shares the same orbit with Janus—the only known example of co-orbitals in the Solar System. In 1980, three additional Saturnian moons were discovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> later confirmed by the Voyager probes. They are trojan moons of Dione (Helene) and Tethys (Telesto and Calypso).|$|E
5|$|Waxwings are {{primarily}} fruit eaters, but also consume insects during the breeding season. Mosquitoes and midges {{are the most}} common prey, but many other insects and some spiders are eaten. They are caught mainly by flycatching from an open perch, but some may be picked off vegetation. Fruit is normally picked from trees, sometimes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> is usually swallowed whole. In the summer, Vaccinium and Rubus species and Canada buffaloberry are important items of their diet, while cotoneaster, juniper, haws, rose hips and apples predominate outside the breeding season. Rowan berries are a favourite food, and are eaten whenever available.|$|E
5|$|All swifts feed on insects {{caught in}} flight, and the Pacific swift has been {{recorded}} as consuming bees, wasps, termites, moths and flies. A Chinese study found that it caught {{a wide variety of}} insect prey and considered that most of the species eaten were harmful to agriculture or forestry. The Pacific swift tends to hunt higher than sympatric swifts, sharing its airspace mainly with white-throated needletails. It typically feeds at heights up to , only flying close to the ground in poor weather. It often forages near low-pressure areas, which serve both to raise insects <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> to give the swifts additional lift. The swifts circle through the insect swarms in flocks typically of tens or hundreds of birds, although sometimes reaching tens of thousands in Australia. In Siberia, Pacific swifts feed at dusk to much later hours than the common swift, sometimes until midnight, and migrants have been seen flying with bats in the Philippines. The young are brought balls of insects bound with saliva. In bad weather, they are sometimes not fed for days, surviving on stored body fat.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{had added}} only nine {{runs on the}} third morning when Pollard trapped Miller for 31 with the new ball. Four runs later, Morris had reached 51 when Bedser removed him, leaving Australia 139/5. Barnes came out to bat at 135/4, despite having {{collapsed}} while practising in the nets due to the aftereffects of the blow to his chest. He made a painful single in 25 minutes of batting before it became too much {{and he had to}} be taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> sent to the hospital to be put under observation. Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before Tallon was caught behind from Edrich. Lindwall came into bat at 172/6 with Australia facing the prospect of the follow on. He then received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in the hand, evoking cheers from the home crowd. Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled by Pollard, leaving Australia 208/7, five runs behind the follow-on mark. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow on before Bedser removed both and Australia were bowled out for 221, giving England a lead of 142 runs. Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers, taking 4/81 and 3/53 respectively.|$|E
5|$|For the Battle of Romani, Chauvel {{chose his}} ground carefully, reconnoitring it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> the air, and {{selecting}} both forward and fall back positions. His luck held; the German commander— Friedrich Kreß von Kressenstein— selected {{the same position}} as the forming up area for his attack in August 1916. Under great pressure, Chauvel maintained his position until Brigadier-General Edward Chaytor's New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade arrived after being released by Lawrence. The counter-attack that Chauvel had been calling for all day did not materialise until dusk. At Katia and again at Bir el Abd, Chauvel attempted to sweep around the Turkish flank but wound up making frontal attacks on the Turkish rearguard and was beaten off by determined counter-attacks and artillery fire against the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. Despite killing 1,250 Turks and taking over 4,000 prisoners, Chauvel was criticised for his failure to rout and destroy the Turks. However, for the Australian and New Zealand horsemen, who suffered over 900 of the 1,130British casualties, it was a clear-cut victory, their first decisive win and the turning point of the campaign. Later, Chauvel realised that Romani was the first decisive British victory of the war outside West Africa Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Gascoigne {{signed for}} Rangers in July 1995, for a club record fee of £4.3million, on wages of £15,000 a week. He made an {{immediate}} impact; {{in the fifth}} league {{game of the season}} in the Old Firm match at Celtic Park he scored a goal after running almost the full length of the pitch. On 30 December, in a match against Hibernian, Gascoigne was booked by referee Dougie Smith after he picked Smith's yellow card up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> jokingly 'booked' the referee. Rangers {{went on to win the}} league in the 1995–96 season, clinching the title in the penultimate game of the season against Aberdeen at Ibrox Stadium; Gascoigne scored a hat-trick during the game. Rangers won the double as they also won the Scottish Cup by knocking out Keith, Clyde, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Celtic, before beating Heart of Midlothian 5–1 in the final at Hampden Park. He scored 19 goals in 42 appearances in all competitions, and was named as both PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year and SFWA Footballer of the Year.|$|E

5|$|The {{circulation}} {{patterns in}} the upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus are completely different {{from those in the}} lower atmosphere. At altitudes 90–150km the Venusian air moves from the dayside to nightside of the planet, with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and downwelling over dark hemisphere. The downwelling over the nightside causes adiabatic heating of the air, which forms a warm layer in the nightside mesosphere at the altitudes 90–120km. The temperature of this layer—230K (−43°C) is far higher than the typical temperature found in the nightside thermosphere—100K (−173°C). The air circulated from the dayside also carries oxygen atoms, which after recombination form excited molecules of oxygen in the long-lived singlet state (1Δg), which then relax and emit infrared radiation at the wavelength 1.27μm. This radiation from the altitude range 90–100km is often observed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> spacecraft. The nightside upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus is also the source of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emissions of CO2 and nitric oxide molecules, which are responsible for the low temperature of the nightside thermosphere.|$|E
5|$|The Test started amid {{controversy}} {{following the}} omission of leading England batsman Len Hutton for performing poorly in the previous match. Having largely failedapart from brief periodsto challenge Australia {{in the first two}} Tests, the hosts had made four changes to their team in an attempt to find a combination that could threaten the visitors' supremacy. Australia made their first change for the series, ending the Test career of veteran batsman Bill Brown after two poor matches. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, but his team were quickly in trouble, with Denis Compton forced from the field after being bloodied in the head by a Ray Lindwall bouncer. At this stage, the hosts were at 33/2 with an injured player, and they batted defensively for a period to try and regroup. Having received treatment, Compton returned with England in difficulty at 119/5 midway through the day and proceeded to score 145 not out, aided by several dropped catches, helping England to recover to 363 all out on the second afternoon. England could have been in an even stronger position, but Compton and seamer Alec Bedser were involved in a mix-up, resulting in the latter being run out and ending a 121-run partnership. Lindwall was the most successful bowler, taking 4/99. During the England innings, Australian opener Sid Barnes, who had gained much attention throughout the season for fielding at point-blank range in front of the batsman on strike, was hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot and had to be carried <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> hospitalised. In reply, Australia batted steadily to be 126/3 {{by the end of the}} second day, but then fell to be 172/6—effectively seven wickets down with Barnes unable to bat after collapsing again—before evading the follow on by reaching 221. Australia scored slowly through the innings, finding the hosts' bowlers difficult to negotiate; Bedser took 4/81 and Pollard 3/53.|$|E
