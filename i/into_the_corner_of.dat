5|$|Meredith had to {{deal with}} {{extremely}} physical defences, and was often boxed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the pitch by as many as four players. As his talents became widely regarded, more well organised defences would designate him with a man-marker, to try and isolate him from his teammates. This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside-right partner willing to fetch and carry the ball for him without expecting much in terms of goals or glory in return. A hard-working wing-half would also improve Meredith's effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank. The best teams he played in also had a centre-forward able {{to make the most of}} his accurate crosses.|$|E
5|$|Michael (turned {{back into}} a zombie) and his fellow corpses then back the frightened girl <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> a nearby {{abandoned}} house. Michael then reaches for his date's throat as she lets out a bloodcurdling scream, only to awake and realize {{it was all a}} dream. Michael then offers to take her home, and she happily obliges. As they walk out of the house, Michael turns around and looks at the camera, thus revealing his yellow werewolf eyes and fangs {{from the beginning of the}} video, as we hear Vincent Price's haunting laugh, while Michael grins.|$|E

5|$|Eight minutes later, Gary McAllister {{passed the}} ball to Fowler who moved towards {{the centre of the}} pitch from the {{left-hand}} side and hit his shot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the net to put Liverpool 4–3 up with 18 minutes of the match remaining. Two minutes later, Liverpool substituted Michael Owen for Patrik Berger. In the 82nd minute, Alavés had an appeal for a penalty after Hamann was adjudged to have brought Magno down, the Brazilian was subsequently booked for diving. With two minutes remaining, Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld conceded a corner. The subsequent corner is headed into the goal by Jordi Cruyff to make the scoreline 4–4. Two minutes into injury-time, Contra went down under pressure from Gerrard in the Liverpool penalty area. Again, the referee deemed that there was no penalty. Following this, the referee blew his whistle to signal the end of 90 minutes if play. The match would now go into a 30-minute extra-time period.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southwest}} corner of the same intersection, the building housing Sidetrack Bar & Grillwhich has held a bar and restaurant continuously since at least 1850has an unusual shape resulting from a 1929 train derailment. On an early January morning, the twelfth car, laden with lumber, of an 85-car freight train came off the tracks and crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the building. The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured but had most of her personal effects scattered into the street. There were only a few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car, but was able to get away unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath, which made it more difficult to dig post holes. In 1931, the entrance to the building was moved from the east side to its current position on the north side to accommodate a post-prohibition law requiring bar entrances to be at least 500 feet from any church. The back patio was constructed after the nearby church burned down. According to Sidetrack owner Linda French, the first-floor walls are three bricks deep, with the oldest remaining bricks dating to the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|England's {{opponents in}} the final were West Germany. It was England who {{dominated}} the final but it was Banks who was beaten first. A weak header from Ray Wilson handed a chance to Helmut Haller, who sent an accurate but relatively weak shot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the net; Banks had been unsighted by Jack Charlton, and he failed to adjust his position in time to reach the ball. England equalised through a Geoff Hurst header within six minutes and went ahead late {{in the second half}} through Martin Peters. With seconds left in the game, Lothar Emmerich sent a free kick into the England penalty area, and the ball fell to Wolfgang Weber, who guided the ball over a lunging Ray Wilson and an outstretched Banks into the net to take the game into extra-time. In extra-time, the Germans sent shots in at the England goal which Banks managed to catch and control without any great danger. Hurst scored two goals to complete his hat-trick, and though many claimed his second goal never crossed the line Banks always maintained his belief that the officials called the decision correctly. Between these goals Banks had to deal with a fiery shot from Sigfried Held, and was later exposed only for Uwe Seeler to come just centimetres away from connecting with the ball.|$|E

25|$|A {{trip to the}} City of Manchester Stadium for Saturday's early {{kick-off}} {{was next}} on Middlesbrough's agenda. Manchester City's new signing Shay Given made a solid debut, denying Afonso Alves with four fine saves. Both sides had chances throughout the game but City were {{the only one to}} convert – Craig Bellamy's shot across goal went between Robert Huth's legs and beyond the reach of Brad Jones <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the net.|$|E
25|$|The trip to Indianapolis for a Saturday {{night game}} against the Big East's Butler ended in disappointment. The Cougars did have more corner kicks with 6 to the Bulldogs' 5. but they also had more fouls (18–8) and yellow cards (2–0). Butler had 18 shots to SIUE's 7 and led 6–1 in shots-on-goal. The home team took the lead on a rebounded blocked shot put into the net in the 26th minute. The Cougars managed to then hold off the hosts until only {{a minute and a}} quarter remained, when a shot was snaked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the net from 20 yards out.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was a steel cage match between Ric Flair and Harley Race for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, with former NWA World Champion Gene Kiniski as the special referee. The match began with Flair having the {{advantage}} with a headlock. Race fought back by targeting Flair's head and neck. Race, using a piledriver maneuver, dropped Flair head {{first into the}} canvas and then sent {{his head into the}} cage. Flair fought back after sending Race <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the ring. Flair performed a piledriver and sent Race's head into the cage. After slamming Race down with a belly to back suplex, Flair applied a figure four leglock. Race broke the hold by rolling into the ropes and fought back with a headbutt from the top turnbuckle. As Race applied a headlock, Flair sent Race's head into Kiniski's head. Flair then performed a body press from the top turnbuckle and pinned Race to win the match and the title.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Serra {{made his}} first sculptures out of nontraditional {{materials}} such as fiberglass and rubber. Serra's earliest work was abstract and process-based made from molten lead hurled in large splashes {{against the wall of}} a studio or exhibition space. In 1967 and 1968 he compiled a list of infinitives that served as catalysts for subsequent work: “to hurl” suggested the hurling of molten lead into crevices between wall and floor; “to roll” led to the rolling of the material into dense, metal logs. He began in 1969 to be primarily concerned with the cutting, propping or stacking of lead sheets, rough timber, etc., to create structures, some very large, supported only by their own weight. His “Prop” pieces from the late 1960s are arranged so that weight and gravity balance lead rolls and sheets. Cutting Device: Base Plate Measure (1969) consists of an assemblage of heterogeneous materials (lead, wood, stone and steel) into which two parallel cuts have been made and the results strewn around in a chance configuration. In Malmo Role (1984), a four-foot-square steel plate, one and a half inches thick, bisects {{a corner of the room}} and is prevented from falling by a short cylindrical prop wedged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the walls.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March, {{the first}} leg at Aggborough ended 51 to Stevenage. Borough took the lead half way into the first half when David Bridges latched onto a Michael Bostwick cross. Kidderminster {{equalised}} shortly after through defender Gavin Caines who drove the ball home {{from the edge of}} the area. However, it was not level for long, Mitchell Cole beat his full-back for pace and squared the ball to Yemi Odubade, who bundled the ball home. It was three before the interval; Bridges scoring again, heading in a perfectly weighted Joel Byrom cross. Chris Beardsley scored a second half brace to ensure a four-goal cushion for the Hertfordshire side going into the second leg at Broadhall Way. His first came when he met an Andy Drury delivery; his initial effort cannoned off the crossbar, but he was on hand to head in the rebound. His second came when he dispossessed Martin Riley on the touchline, cut in and curled the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the net. The second leg took place a week later at Broadhall Way, which ended 00 - ultimately meaning Stevenage progressed to the final at Wembley Stadium after winning 51 on aggregate over the two legs.|$|E
25|$|And fail to win they did, losing 2–1 to a Chelsea {{side that}} {{had had an}} extra day to recuperate from their Champions League tie against Liverpool in mid-week. Coming {{off the back of}} a poor display in Barcelona, United were looking to cement their claim to the Premier League title, which would have been all but won with a win over Chelsea. However, with several players rested with Barcelona on Tuesday in mind, and Nemanja Vidić having to be {{substituted}} early on after a knee to the face, the odds never looked in United's favour. Owen Hargreaves took Vidić's place in defence, with Wes Brown switching from right-back to centre-back. Joe Cole had the first real chance, but could only smash the ball into the woodwork from 18yards after he regained the ball from a poor clearance. United held out for 45 minutes, but finally went behind on the stroke of half-time to a Michael Ballack header, after the German had lost his marker to find room at the back post. After the break, United came out a new team, taking the game to Chelsea. After 57 minutes, United conceded a free kick just inside Chelsea's half, but a poor back pass from Ricardo Carvalho allowed Wayne Rooney to pounce on the ball and place a shot beyond Petr Čech <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the net, his first career goal against Chelsea. However, he appeared to have injured himself during his celebration and was soon substituted, making way for Cristiano Ronaldo. The game went quiet for the last 20 minutes, until a Michael Essien cross was handled by Michael Carrick just inside the United penalty area with four minutes left to play. Referee Alan Wiley pointed to the spot, and Ballack stepped up to convert and give Chelsea the win. United went all out for a much needed equaliser, but the closest they came were two shots blocked on the line by Ashley Cole and Andriy Shevchenko. The result brought Chelsea level on points with United with two games to go, United holding on to top spot by virtue of their +53 goal difference. This now meant that United would have to win both of their remaining games to secure the title, provided that Chelsea did not drop any more points.|$|E

Bigelow moved out of the way, however, and performed a diving headbutt on Duggan to get the pinfall victory.|$|E
500|$|Meredith scored City's {{first goal}} in the First Division on {{the opening day of}} the 1899–1900 season in a 4–3 defeat to Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park on 2 September.

500|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{possible}} injuries and be in peak condition for the film, Willis worked out almost daily for several months prior to filming. Willis was injured on January 24, 2007 during a fight scene, when he was kicked above his right eye by a stunt double for actress Maggie Q who was wearing stiletto heels. Willis described the event as [...] "no big deal" [...] but when Len Wiseman inspected his injury, {{he noticed that the}} situation was much more serious than previously thought—in the DVD commentary, Wiseman indicates in inspecting the wound that he could see bone. Willis was hospitalized and received seven stitches which ran through his right eyebrow and down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> his eye. Due to the film's non-linear production schedule, these stitches can accidentally be seen in the scene where McClane first delivers Farrell to Bowman.|$|E

His first goal where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the net, was selected {{as one of the best}} goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pelé's second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment; [...] "When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding". When the match ended, Pelé passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha. He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament.|$|E
