40|$|In {{the early}} 1980 s many {{institutions}} in Britain were seriously considering {{whether there was}} a need for specialist <b>departments</b> <b>of</b> <b>virology.</b> The arrival <b>of</b> HIV changed that perception and since then virology and antiviral chemotherapy have become two very active areas of bio-medical research. Cloning and sequencing have provided tools to identify viral enzymes and have brought the day of the "designer drug" nearer to reality. At {{the other end of the}} spectrum of drug discovery, huge numbers of compounds for screening can now be generated by combinatorial chemistry. The impetus to find drugs effective against HIV has also stimulated research into novel treatments for other virus infections including herpesvirus, respiratory infections, and hepatitis B and C viruses. The need to understand the function of the immune system during HIV infection has brought virologists and immunologists together into new partnerships. The huge increase in activity in antiviral research is reflected in the frequency with which these drugs are now being licensed: in 1985 there were two licensed antiviral drugs for systemic use. Since then approximately 20 compounds have been licensed and more are being submitted to the regulatory authorities on a regular basis...|$|R

Infections were most common amongst young people (50 y) had significantly lower M. pneumoniae titres than younger patients (p= 0. 0014).

40|$|Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are {{considered}} one of the most common respiratory viruses associated with respiratory tract illnesses. An emergent human coronavirus was identified as the causal agent of an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2002 - 2003. The severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires the continuous surveillance of coronaviruses in worldwide populations. Epidemiological and clinical data of HCoVs infectious in the Brazilian population are scarce and restricted to one or two groups of patients. Our study aimed to investigate retrospectively the presence of HCoVs in different populations of São Paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) during the years of 2001 - 2010. A pancoronavirus RT-PCR was performed in this study. Coronaviruses were detected in 126 (11. 5 %) of 1, 087 specimens. Peaks detection frequency was observed during 2002 - 2004 and 2008 - 2009, with the highest detection in 2008. The prevalence of HCoVs was higher among children with heart diseases (24. 6 %), patients under stem cell transplantation program (24. 3 %) and renal transplanted patients (20. 2 %). Coryza, cough and fever were the most common symptoms at presentation of positive cases and wheezing, a lower respiratory tract infection symptom was reported by 12 % of the total, and 27 % of high at-risk patients. HCoVs may have an important role among patients with underlying conditions and transplanted ones.

40|$|The <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> Pathology was {{the first}} {{scientific}} unit established at the German Primate Center (DPZ) already in its planning phase.

Otherwise the functions <b>of</b> the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> Pathology were both service duties and scientific evaluations. The service functions after the establishment of the DPZ included pathological, bacteriological and parasitological examinations/surveys and the veterinary care of nonhuman primates at the DPZ and other primate colonies. On an international level its service functions were reflected by the collaboration within the Office International de Epizooties (OIE, Paris) (Dollinger et al., 1996) and the Infectious Diseases Working Group of the European Association of Zoo and Wildlife Veterinarians, and the establishment of a bacteriological laboratory in Iquitos, Peru, at the request of the Pan American Health Organization. Parallel to those administrative and service duties to the DPZ and to international communities, the different scientific activities started, which in a pathology department always are a combination of service and research.
