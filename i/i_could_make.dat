25|$|It was as hard-hitting a {{memorandum}} as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> it. Butler {{accused me of}} overstating the lack of resolve in both Washington and London. But my argument over {{the need to get}} a concealment-based inspection on track did resonate with him. He authorized me to put together an updated inspection plan to take place following his August visit to Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> the film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, and I said I could not. You will not believe this, {{but the day}} the film was released, I saw the same judge coming towards me and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E
500|$|If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Make</b> a Living was {{the title}} of Walker's second album, {{released}} in 1994. It produced two more No. 1 singles in the title track (co-written by Alan Jackson, Keith Stegall, and Roger Murrah) and 1995's [...] "This Woman and This Man". The latter song spent two weeks at No. 1, becoming his first multi-week No. 1 hit. Then came the number 16 [...] "My Heart Will Never Know". If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Make</b> a Living went platinum in May 1995, reaching number 2 on the country albums chart. Gordon Ely of the Richmond Times-Dispatch gave a favorable review, saying that [...] "Walker has broken loose from Nashville's most recent crop of carefully crafted cowboys." [...] Walker also began touring in 1995 as a headlining act, {{in support of the}} album.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Bakshi was {{promoted}} to director. His first assignment was the series Sad Cat. Bakshi {{and his wife had}} separated by then, giving him the time to animate each short alone. Bakshi was dissatisfied with the traditional role of a Terrytoons director: [...] "We didn't really 'direct' like you'd think. We were 'animation directors,' because the story department controlled the storyboards. We couldn't affect anything, but I still tried. I'd re-time, mix up soundtracks—I'd fuck with it so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> it my own." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{publication}} of William Wharton's 1978 novel Birdy, Alan Parker received galley proofs {{of the book}} from his agent, who advised him that the novel {{was going to be}} optioned. Upon reading the novel, Parker discussed it with his colleague, producer Alan Marshall, before turning down the opportunity to direct a film adaptation. Parker explained, [...] "So much of the story happened inside the boy's head, and the poetry of the book was literary. To make it cinematic - I didn't know if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> the jump." [...] In September 1979, Orion Pictures optioned the novel for $150,000.|$|E

I {{wanted to do}} a continuation and I {{wanted to do a}}n album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible but I just wanted to see if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a record that was even more heroic because that's what I thought of it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E
500|$|On March 5, Washington {{moved more}} of the Ticonderoga cannon and several {{thousand}} men overnight to occupy Dorchester Heights, overlooking Boston. Since it was winter the ground was frozen, making the digging of trenches impractical. [...] Rufus Putnam, {{who had been a}} millwright, developed a plan to fortify the heights using defenses made of heavy timbers and fascines. [...] These were prefabricated {{out of sight of the}} British, and brought in overnight. [...] General Howe is said to have exclaimed, [...] "My God, these fellows have done more work in one night than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> my army do in three months." [...] The British fleet was within range of the American guns on Dorchester Heights, putting it and the troops in the city at risk.|$|E

500|$|Hetreed {{worked closely}} with Tucker and Webber to adapt the book, {{explaining}} that [...] "... working with them on drafts helped me to concentrate on what the film would be, rather than how beautifully <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a line work." [...] Her first draft was closest to the source material and it slowly [...] "... developed its own character ..." [...] through rewrites. She avoided using a voiceover, which was present in the novel, [...] "... partly because {{it would make it}} very literary." [...] Instead, she focused on conveying Griet's thoughts visually– for example, in her adaptation Griet and Vermeer inspect the camera obscura together under his cloak amidst sexual tension; whereas, in the novel Griet views it alone immediately after him and enjoys the lasting warmth and scent he leaves.|$|E
500|$|... "Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down" [...] was {{generally}} well received by contemporary music critics in their reviews for The Element of Freedom. Allison Stewart of The Washington Post {{noted that the}} track, which is a pop ballad, had replaced [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] sports team references and ruminations with [...] "even milder and less controversial string of generalities", highlighting Keys' version's lyrics [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> it here/I could make it anywhere". The track was not as commercially successful as [...] "Empire State of Mind", peaking at number four in the United Kingdom, number forty on the Canadian Hot 100, and number sixty-nine in Sweden. It also debuted on the Billboard R charts at number seventy-seven and peaked at number fifty-five on the Billboard Hot 100 without an official release.|$|E
500|$|Weir {{wanted the}} film to be funnier, feeling that Niccol's script was too dark, and declaring [...] "where he [...] had it depressing, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> it light. It could {{convince}} audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7." [...] Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming. Later on in 1995, Jim Carrey signed to star, but because of commitments with The Cable Guy and Liar Liar, {{he would not be}} ready to start filming for at least another year. Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role. Niccol rewrote the script twelve times, while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show's history. He envisioned backstories for the characters and encouraged actors to do the same.|$|E

500|$|Allemannische Gedichte {{was very}} successful, {{and a new}} edition was {{published}} a year later, this time crediting the author. When Hebel read the poems aloud to margrave Charles Frederick, the duke praised them, and Hebel noticed his exact local knowledge: [...] "I am surprised how the margrave knew all the villages, every small place, every shrub and hedge from Utzenfeld to Lörrach, and could always say: this is this, and yes, that's how it is." [...] In the following decades, further editions were released in Aarau, Vienna and Reutlingen. Famous poets such as Jean Paul (1803) and Goethe (1804) wrote reviews of the poems. Hebel was elated at this success and wrote in a letter: [...] "In certain moments I feel all proud inside, and as if drunk with happiness, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> our otherwise despised and ridiculed language so classical and give it such artistic fame".|$|E
500|$|In August 2012, Patrick Doyle {{said that}} he had discussions with the {{director}} about potentially returning to score the film. By April 2013, Carter Burwell had been hired to compose the score, but by the following month he left the film over creative differences. In June 2013, Marvel hired Brian Tyler, who scored Iron Man 3, to replace Burwell. Tyler said the previous film had an [...] "attitude and [...] grounded in limitations" [...] whereas the Thor film allowed for [...] "all-out regal themes that could be as epic as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> them." [...] The composer described The Dark World as [...] "science fiction meeting classic medieval war", leading to a score that drew from works of both genres such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. Azam Ali is a featured vocalist on the score. The soundtrack was released digitally on October 28, 2013.|$|E
500|$|Phillips, meanwhile, {{was always}} on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader {{audience}} the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, [...] "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a billion dollars.'" [...] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, [...] "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield [...] "Scotty" [...] Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.|$|E
