50|$|The power {{electronics}} architecture can have different configurations but may {{consist of a}} rectifier, a converter and an inverter stage. The rectifier transforms the unregulated AC into a DC power. As the turbogenerator output voltage depends on speed and load, the rectified voltage is subsequently regulated to a fixed voltage by a converter stage. For AC applications the inverter transforms DC to AC and synchronises it with the electricity grid. A contactor connects or disconnects the inverter output to the grid depending whether the grid is within specification.

The qCO’s algorithm uses classical and advanced adaptive filtering techniques to minimize such problems with good results. The algorithm applies a band pass filtering stage, which attenuates both the baseline drifts (due to movement or respiration) and the high-frequency signal. Also, it features Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), for higher accuracy, which is able to obliterate even artefacts such as the electrosurgical noise.|$|R
