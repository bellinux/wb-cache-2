5|$|In 2001, Zhe-Xi Luo {{and colleagues}} {{alternatively}} proposed that a tribosphenic molar pattern had arisen twice (compare Figure 3, top)—once {{giving rise to}} the marsupials and placentals (Boreosphenida), and once producing Ambondro, the Cretaceous Australian Ausktribosphenos, and the living monotremes, which {{first appeared in the}} Cretaceous (united as Australosphenida). They characterized Australosphenida by the shared presence of a cingulum on the outer <b>front</b> <b>corner</b> of the lower molars, a short and broad talonid, a relatively low trigonid, and a triangulated last lower premolar.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro was {{described}} {{on the basis of}} a fragmentary right mandible (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2). It is in the collection of the University of Antananarivo as specimen UA10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent cingulum (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central cusp. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the tooth and probably another on the inner <b>front</b> <b>corner.</b> This tooth resembles the molars of symmetrodonts, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the metaconid of symmetrodonts.|$|E

5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, the molars are pentalophodont (have the mesolophs and mesolophids, {{accessory}} crests, well developed) and bunodont, with the cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests. The cusps on the upper molars are arranged in two longitudinal series, not three as in the black and brown rats. The front cusps of the first upper and lower molar (anterocone and anteroconid, respectively) are broad and not divided completely by an anteromedian flexus or flexid. Behind the anterocone, the anteroloph (a smaller crest) is complete and separated from the anterocone. On both {{the second and third}} lower molars, the anterolophid (a crest on the inner <b>front</b> <b>corner)</b> is present, a putative synapomorphy of the genus. The first molars have additional small roots in addition to the main ones, so that the upper first molar has four and the lower has three or four roots.|$|E
5|$|The M2 {{is similar}} to that of eosimiids and almost {{identical}} to that of Afrotarsius libycus. It shows well-developed small accessory cusps (the paraconule and metaconule) that are connected to equally well-developed crests. The conules are stronger than in Eosimias and Bahinia, but weaker than in Phileosimias. The stylar shelf, the outer area of the tooth, is broad, particularly at the metacone cusp. However, the shelf is better developed near the paracone cusp in Afrasia than in Afrotarsius, which makes the ectoflexus (an invagination in the outer wall of the tooth) more symmetrical in the former. The parastyle, a small cusp in the outer <b>front</b> <b>corner</b> of the tooth, is located more buccally (towards the outer side of the tooth) than in Afrotarsius and is larger. The stylar shelf is larger than that of Bahinia and Phileosimias, but smaller than that of Eosimias. The parastyle is also less developed than in Eosimias, but the protocone, the main cusp on the lingual side of the tooth, is more expansive. The lingual cingulum is incomplete; it is stronger in Phenacopithecus.|$|E
5|$|UA 8699 is a {{worn and}} broken left lower molar. Part of the trigonid (the front group of cusps), at the mesiolingual (inner <b>front)</b> <b>corner</b> of the tooth is missing. Krause {{estimated}} that the complete tooth would have been 3.5mm (0.14in) long and 2.2mm (0.09in) wide. The tooth is tribosphenic, like that of modern mammals, as indicated {{by a number of}} features, including the broad basin of the talonid (the back group of cusps), and the acute angle (48°) between the cusps of the trigonid. UA 8699 lacks a cingulid (ridge) resembling a shelf on the lingual (inner) side, indicating that is not a member of Australosphenida (the proposed clade uniting monotremes and some ancient Gondwanan mammals, including the Jurassic Madagascan Ambondro); thus, it can be identified as representing Boreosphenida, which includes marsupials, placentals, and their extinct relatives.|$|E

5|$|Based on a {{courtyard}} house layout, externally the harled whinstone rubble mansion {{is a combination}} of Elizabethan and Jacobean (or Gothic) design, similar to Smith's work at Slains. A spacious central courtyard is surrounded by buildings three storeys high. Within the back of the courtyard, circular towers enclose the service stairways. A large Elizabethan-style tower housing the main stairway is also set within the courtyard but sited to the front behind the reception rooms. Other external features include: canted and box bays; a variety of lofty towers that are round, square or octagonal; many different gables; and numerous diagonally set stone flues. The southeast facing front elevation lacks symmetry with the main Tudor style entranceway set off centre and extending out. A plaque commemorating the building dates of 1839–1842 and a central armorial are above the round arched entrance. There is also an eight-sided tower positioned at the <b>front</b> <b>corner.</b> A separate driveway accesses the outside kitchen yard {{at the back of the}} north west elevation. This side of the mansion is plainer, more restrained and built into the slope of the hillside. A lengthy one storey lean-to houses fuel supplies and servants toilets and provides additional ground support. The northeast elevation is also more architecturally reserved than the front.|$|E

25|$|A second fire {{incident}} {{took place}} in August 2012 when a Karma caught fire while stopped at a parking lot in Woodside, California. According to Fisker engineers, the area of origin for the fire {{was determined to be}} outside the engine compartment, as the fire was located at the driver’s side <b>front</b> <b>corner</b> of the car. The evidence suggested that the ignition source was not the lithium-ion battery pack, new technology components or unique exhaust routing. The investigation conducted by Fisker engineers and an independent fire expert concluded that the cause of the fire was a low temperature cooling fan located at the left front of the Karma, forward of the wheel. An internal fault caused the fan to fail, overheat and started a slow-burning fire. Fisker announced a voluntary recall on all Karmas sold to replace the faulty fan and install an additional fuse.|$|E
25|$|The car {{now has the}} {{addition}} of the Advanced Aerodynamic Package (two-piece <b>front</b> <b>corner</b> splitters and a rear decklid spoiler made from carbon fiber), lightweight Sidewinder II wheels finished in matte-black, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires, two-mode (Street and Race) Bilstein DampTronic suspension adapted from the GTS, but with firmer levels of damping and a smaller spread between modes, shock dampers, increased spring rates and thicker anti-roll bars, carbon fiber underhood X-brace (instead of the aluminium brace in all other models), carbon fiber rear tail light applique from the Exterior Carbon Fiber Accent Package, two-piece Brembo brake rotors with wider brake annulus, black-anodized Brembo brake calipers painted with the Viper logo in TA Orange, TA logos behind both front wheels and a Stryker decal instead of the standard badge on the hood (TA Orange on the Venom Black cars, black on the TA Orange and Venom White cars), black interior with TA Orange accent stitching on the ballistic cloth seats, instrument panel & cowl, center stack, console, hand brake, shifter boot, and door panels. The aerodynamic package adds 200 pounds (90.72kg) of downforce at 100mph (160.93km/h). Top speed is 193mph (310.60km/h) instead of the non-aerodynamics package cars' 206mph (331.52km/h). The car's mileage is 12 mpg in city, and 19 mpg in highway.|$|E

25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Thursday morning, lasted 40 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Rosenqvist was fastest in the first practice session {{with a time of}} two minutes and 13.099 seconds which was recorded his final timed lap late in the session. He was four-tenths of a second quicker than the second-fastest driver Callum Ilott who moved out of traffic to drive with a clear track on his fastest lap. Kenta Yamashita was third-fastest, ahead of Juncadella and Norris; the latter held the fastest lap until ten minutes remaining in the session. Jake Hughes, Félix da Costa, Sims, David Beckmann and George Russell rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The session was stopped early for 16 minutes when Ferdinand Habsburg went into Fisherman's Bend corner too quickly and understeered into the turn's barriers, causing his car's left <b>front</b> <b>corner</b> to become lodged underneath the wall. Habsburg was transported to a local hospital for a precautionary check-up. As a result, the session was extended by five minutes to provide competitors with additional on-track time. Cassidy stopped his car on the front straight with brake problems while Mardenborough made a pit stop because his car's engine cover was becoming detached and the problem affected his vehicle's top speed, and Tadasuke Makino carried excessive speed turning into Lisboa Bend corner and damaged his car's front-left corner in an impact with the turn's exit barrier.|$|E
