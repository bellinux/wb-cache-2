Larter dyed her hair brunette {{for the majority of}} the film to suit Clear's gothic outlook. Despite this, Larter reverted to her original blonde hair colour for the film's ending.|$|E

After undergoing treatment within a violet conversion crystal, Fatality emerges as a newly transformed Star Sapphire.
