25|$|The disease triangle, {{consisting}} of host, environment, and pathogen, {{is an important}} concept, {{especially in regards to}} plant pathology. In this case, the pathogen is Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Agrobacteria have the widest host range of any plant pathogen, so the main factor to take into consideration in the case of crown gall is environment. There are various conditions and factors that make for a conducive environment for A. tumefaciens when infecting its various hosts. For example, the bacterium requires the host plant to be wounded, as this is where the invasion occurs. Factors leading to wounds in plants include cultural practices, grafting, freezing injury, <b>growth</b> <b>cracks,</b> soil insects, and other animals in the environment causing damage to the plant. Thus, in exceptionally harsh winters, it's common to have an increased incidence of crown gall due to the weather-related damage. Along with this, there are methods of mediating infection of the host plant. For example, nematodes can act as a vector to introduce Agrobacterium into plant roots.|$|E

Compact tension specimens were subjected to fatigue, creep and creep-fatigue loading. The combined effects on <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> rates of load level and hold time have been examined. Stress intensity factors are found to correlate <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> rates reasonably well for fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth.</b> Creep <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> rates are found to correlate with stress intensity factor and C*(t). <b>Crack</b> <b>growth</b> rates under hold time cycles are successfully correlated with C*(t) avg under various load levels and hold times. <b>Crack</b> <b>growth</b> under creep-fatigue loading has been simulated by elastic-plastic-steady state creep finite element analyses. The results of analysis show that fatigue loading interrupts stress relaxation around the crack tip during hold time and causes stress reinstatement, thereby giving rise to accelerated <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> compared with <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> under static loading.

50|$|There are {{numerous}} factors affecting post-harvest losses, {{from the soil}} in which the crop is grown to the handling of produce when it reaches the shop. Pre-harvest production practices may seriously affect post-harvest returns. Plants need a continuous supply of water for photosynthesis and transpiration. Damage {{can be caused by}} too much rain or irrigation, which can lead to decay; by too little water; and by irregular water supply, which can, for example, lead to <b>growth</b> <b>cracks.</b> Lack of plant food can affect the quality of fresh produce, causing stunted growth or discoloration of leaves, abnormal ripening and a range of other factors. Too much fertilizer can harm the development and post-harvest condition of produce. Good crop husbandry is important for reducing losses. Weeds compete with crops for nutrients and soil moisture. Decaying plant residues in the field are also a major loss factor.|$|E

A number of fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> theories have been developed for such correlations.

50|$|On tomato, foliar {{symptoms}} of A. solani generally {{occur on the}} oldest leaves and start as small lesions that are brown to black in color. These leaf spots resemble concentric rings - a distinguishing characteristic of the pathogen - and measure up to 1.3 cm (0.51 inches) in diameter. Both {{the area around the}} leaf spot and the entire leaf may become yellow or chlorotic. Under favorable conditions (e.g., warm weather with short or abundant dews), significant defoliation of lower leaves may occur, leading to sunscald of the fruit. As the disease progresses, symptoms may migrate to the plant stem and fruit. Stem lesions are dark, slightly sunken and concentric in shape. Basal girdling and death of seedlings may occur, a symptom known as collar rot. In fruit, A. solani invades at the point of attachment to the stem as well as through <b>growth</b> <b>cracks</b> and wounds made by insects, infecting large areas of the fruit Fruit spots are similar in appearance to those on leaves - brown with dark concentric circles.

40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} of aerospace structural components {{is dominated}} by the time to grow from a small sub mm size flaw to a flaw of the order of a few mm. As such <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> {{is dominated by}} the Region I <b>growth</b> of short <b>cracks.</b> Consequently management of the fleet requires that Region I short <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> be both understood and predicted. Recent studies at the NASA Johnson Space Center have shown that the current ASTM testing standards can produce Region I da/dN versus K data that are a function of the test geometry and, as result, that similitude was not valid in Region I. As a result the NASA Johnson Space Center has abandoned these standards. Similar conclusions follow from recent Australian studies into cracking in 7050 -T 7451 aluminium alloy under variable amplitude loading. This research particularly focuses on the near threshold <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> behaviour in 7050 -T 7451 aluminium Alloy, which is widely used in F/A- 18 Hornet, the Super Hornet and the Joint Strike Fighter (F 35). In order to understand the short <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> behaviour, a fatigue test program in 7050 -T 7451 Aluminium Alloy specimens under repeated block loading was performed. The results show that the short <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> rate (da/dN) versus K anomaly is due to forcing a relationship between them. It is also shown that this anomaly vanishes if <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> is expressed using the Generalized Frost-Dugdale <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> equation or the Hartman-Shijve <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> equation. In order to investigate the effect of the stress concentration factor (Kt) on the <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> rate, the <b>growth</b> of fatigue <b>cracks</b> from etched pits and machinery defects at a fastener hole under an operation RAAF load spectrum was analysed. The results of this study show that the Hartman-Schijve equation can be used to predict DSTO short <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> tests data for both low and high Kt specimens. <b>Crack</b> <b>growth</b> under a representative combat and transport load spectrum was also studied. The characteristic stress intensity factor range Krms and the Effective Block Approach for analysing fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> was conducted. Here {{it was found that the}} Krms effective block approach is a valid method for predicting <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> under F- 15 Eagle fighter aircraft and military transport spectra.

40|$|One of the {{problems}} that reduce durability; thus, performance of concrete is the development of plastic shrinkage cracking (PSC). Traditionally, the development of PSC has been minimized by controlling its exposure to weather conditions or by adding fibers. In this study, concrete re-vibration was used as an alternative technique to control PSC because of the limited availability of fibers in the developing countries. In this study, the wait time after slab casting and before vibration was selected to be 90 minutes while length of re-vibration time was varied from 15 to 45 seconds. Also, the water-cement ratios were selected to be 0. 5, 0. 55 and 0. 6. The slabs were cast based on the form dimensions proposed by ASTM C 1579 criteria.

40|$|Purpose The {{spectacular}} Internet Bubble that {{burst in}} 2000 makes the latest 2008 global financial crisis seem persuasive in its {{reflection of the}} same flawed logic, which prompted all other crises and bubbles in-between. The flawed logic of a globalised electronic free-market economy is built {{on the premise that}} disruptive Internet innovation would enable seamless electronic transformation of corporations, and their interconnectedness and collaboration across the ‘electronic’ demand and supply chains (outsourcing non-core and at times core activities), which would free up corporate capital resources to decapitalise non-core assets. However, when we look more closely at the facts of the past twenty or so years, the theoretical surface no longer seems smooth with the shift from a virtuous circle of industrialised value creation and job creation, where businesses were prospering, employment expanding and communities thriving to a post-industrial globalised world. This new economic world order is where corporations moved to lower-cost regions and production capability became distributed more widely, and as we get closer to the evidence of leaner but meaner working conditions, more responsibilities and fewer staff, longer working hours, stagnant salaries, smirking bean counters promising more cuts, and powerless nation-states {{in the face of an}} increasingly weakened link between business growth and local job <b>growth,</b> <b>cracks</b> begin to appear. This thesis examines such resource allocation tensions, which are often articulated in socio-economic, political, technological or ethical rationales, with accounting arbitrarily ‘calibrating’ their parameters. These parameters may include age, time limits, useful lives, budgetary and efficiency constraints. The purpose of which is to privilege and legitimize parochial power structures over deep-seated inequities of resource allocation. Design/Methodology/Approach Accounting is a complex communicative symbolic exchange of interests that obfuscates the potency of our role, in the pacification and de-politicisation of resource allocation tensions. The spectacle of international and regional wrangling over economic governments’ bailouts and rescue packages due to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the continuing European Debt Crisis, only overwhelms its observers and disconnects them from the powers that control their lives. The disenfranchised populace are out in force voicing their discontent, but nevertheless are completely oblivious to who should be blamed for their miserable condition. Some blame politicians and foreign governments, while others blame corrupt institutional structures and financial institutions, and so forth. All the while, the spectacle and its euphoria go on, away from the perpetrators of exploitation and injustice. The contemporary nature of MetaCapitalism that has its intellectual underpinnings in the contentious neoliberal ideology, lends itself to an exploratory approach in its study so as to clarify and define its problematic nature. This thesis develops an exploratory evaluating methodology that provides an analytical critique of the subjective-objective complexities of the MetaCapitalism model assumptions, so as to provide evidence of the model’s success or failure. Findings Presented in this way, the story sounds historically compelling, logically consistent and empirically convincing – but only if I can establish one basic fact: the global process of ‘financialisation’ has been led by the United States. Its liberalisation and deregulation of financial markets in favour of self-regulatory regimes, have failed to avert the recurrence and intensity of financial crises. This is the starting point. So let’s look at the evidence. MetaCapitalism change strategy has exacerbated the intensity and frequency of structural resource allocation changes within the largest global corporations and this has amplified their market volatility. The Big 4 audit firms, who monopolise 85 per cent of the global audit market, have failed their agency role within the financial markets. The findings from the analysis of nearly 70, 000 corporations reveal that they have failed to recognise the complexity of the new technological structural changes to resource allocation, even after analysing their conventional analytical methods, which should have signalled the problems. How could they have missed those signals when giving unqualified opinions of the audited financial reports of corporations, which have subsequently collapsed or had to be bailed out within less than a few months from the issuance of the audit report? Originality/Value The scale of the study, breadth of the analysis, and novel critique of the new technological business changes and their neoliberal ideological underpinnings, are some of the contributions of this research. However, one of the most important contributions of this research is the development of a corporate performance evaluation method, which exposes the culpability of the Big 4 audit firms in their failure to fulfil their entrusted agency role in the financial markets...|$|E

SEM-micrographs of the principal crack and also optical micrographs coming from the cross sections perpendicular to the plane of a crack propagation (secondary cracks) show changes in the character of a crack propagation dependent of the loading cycle and temperature. By fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> tests has been enhancement of <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> due to the aggressive atmosphere (air) noted. The fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> rates in air are at least one order of magnitude faster than those in vacuum (inert atmosphere). The effects of air, vacuum, simulated live steam on creep <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> of P 92 was also studied. A hold time leads to a higher <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> rate compared with pure creep <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> tests. The results from <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> tests demonstrated, that steam oxidation plays a important role among the three factor, creep <b>crack</b> <b>growth,</b> fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> and oxidation, in <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> of these steel in superheated steam. In this work was also effect of side-grooves on the local stress and <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> rate experimentally examined...|$|R
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that environment-assisted {{subcritical}} <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> in high-strength steels and other high-strength alloys (particularly in hydrogen and in hydrogenous environments) is an important technological problem of long standing. This problem {{is directly related to}} issues of structural integrity, durability, and reliability. The terms 'hydrogen embrittlement' and 'stress corrosion cracking' have been employed to describe the considered phenomenon. This paper provides a summary of contributions made during the past ten years toward the understanding of environmentally assisted <b>crack</b> <b>growth.</b> The processes involved in <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> are examined, and details regarding <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> and chemical reactions are discussed, taking into account <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> in steels exposed to water/water vapor, the effect of hydrogen, reactions involving hydrogen sulfide, and aspects of fracture surface morphology and composition. Attention is also given to the modeling of <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> response, <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> in gas mixtures, and the interaction of solute atoms with the crack-tip stress field...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT [...] The Ts * {{integral}} {{was used}} to assess stable <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> and <b>crack</b> linkup in 0. 8 mm thick 2024 -T 3 aluminum tension specimens with multiple site damage (MSD) under monotonic and cyclic loads. The T~ * values were obtained directly from the recorded moir 6 fringes on the fracture spec-imens with and without MSD. The T~ * resistance curves of these fracture specimens of different geometries were in ex-cellent agreement with each other. The results suggest that T~ * is a material parameter which can be used to character-ize <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> and linkup in the absence of large overload-ing. T~ * based <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> and net-section-yield based crack linkup criteria for MSD specimens are proposed. The crack tip opening angle (CTOA) criterion {{can also be used to}} correlate <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> larger than 2 mm.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> behaviour under combined creepfatigue loading, CT 25 mm-specimens of X 10 NiCrAlTi 32 20 (Alloy 800) {{have been tested}} in experiments with cyclic loadings and hold times, with static loadings and short stress relief interrupts, with ramp type loadings and with sequences of separatefatigue and creep <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> periods. The test temperature of 700 °C was selected because only in this temperature range this alloy provides similar amounts of <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> under creep and fatigue conditions due to equivalent stress levels. For the estimation of <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> under combined loading conditions a linear accumulation of increase in crack length was proved using the <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> laws of pure creep and fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth.</b> Hold time and ramp loadings lead to a higher <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> rate compared with pure creep or pure fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> tests. In hold time experiments the <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> rate is higher than ramp tests of the same period time. The results of hold time tests can be fairly enough predicted by linear damage accumulation rules...|$|R
40|$|Crack {{propagation}} in structures when {{subjected to}} fatigue loading, follows three different phases namely - short <b>crack</b> <b>growth,</b> stable <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> and unstable <b>crack</b> <b>growth.</b> Accurate fatigue life prediction demands {{the consideration of}} every crack propagation phase rather than only the stable <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> stage. Further, the use of existing <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> laws in structures with small <b>cracks</b> under-predicts the <b>growth</b> rate compared to experimentally observed ones, thereby leading to an unsafe design and keeping the structure in a potentially dangerous state. In the present work, an attempt is made to establish fatigue crack propagation laws for plain concrete, reinforced concrete and concrete-concrete jointed interfaces from first principles using the concepts of dimensional analysis and self-similarity. Different <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> laws are proposed to understand the behavior {{in each of the}} three regimes of the fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> curve. Important <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> characterizing material and geometrical parameters for each zone are included in the proposed analytical models. In real life applications to structures, the amplitude of cyclic loading rarely remains constant and is subjected to a wide spectrum of load amplitudes. Furthermore, the <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> behavior changes in the presence of high amplitude load spikes within a constant amplitude history and this is incorporated in the model formulation. Using scaling laws, an improved understanding of the scaling behavior on different parameters is achieved. The models describing different regimes of crack propagation are finally unified to obtain the entire <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> curve and compute the total fatigue life. In addition, <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> analysis is performed for a reinforced concrete member by modifying the model derived for plain concrete in the Paris regime. Energy dissipation occurring due to shake-down phenomenon in steel reinforcement is addressed. The bond-slip mechanism which is of serious concern in reinforced concrete members is included in the study and a method is proposed for the prediction of residual moment carrying capacity as a function of relative crack depth. The application of the proposed analytical model in the computation of fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> is demonstrated on three practical problems – beam in flexure, concrete arch bridge and a patch repaired beam. Through a sensitivity study, the influence of different parameters on the <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> behavior is highlighted...|$|R
