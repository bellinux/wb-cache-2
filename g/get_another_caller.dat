50|$|PC Choice Chatâ€”PC {{has his own}} {{radio talk}} show called PC Choice Chat, and people begin to call in asking for advice on which {{computer}} to get. All the callers ask for advice on a computer that would qualify as a Mac but not as a PC. One caller asks for a computer for people who hate <b>getting</b> viruses, <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> asks for PC help like Mac Geniuses, and a third caller wants to switch to Mac altogether. PC ignores these calls.|$|R

50|$|One More - Callers {{must try}} guess the top answer in a top ten list. However, a caller can still win {{with a lower}} answer than number 1 as long as <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> does not guess an answer higher on the list.|$|R
60|$|With a {{friendly}} nod of his head, the skeleton hurried away to reassure {{his wife that}} he was safe and well; and before he had hardly disappeared within the tent Toby had <b>another</b> <b>caller,</b> who {{was none other than}} his old friend Old Ben, the driver.|$|R
60|$|Late that {{afternoon}} <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> thundered {{at the door}} of the house in Berkeley Square. The Duke of Westerham desired to see Miss Le Mesurier. The butler was respectful but doubtful. Miss Le Mesurier had just arrived from a journey and was lying down. The Duke, however, was insistent. He waited twenty minutes in a small back morning-room and presently Jeanne came in to him.|$|R

5000|$|Up {{until the}} phone lines were {{connected}} directly to Penn's house {{there would be a}} significant delay between the time Penn said the caller's name and when the caller would respond, this would sometimes result in the caller being dropped just after they said hello. There was also many times when the caller would be dropped completely and Penn would have to pick <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> from the list.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps I exaggerate. Love, {{living or}} dying, {{even if it}} is not blind, cannot, I suppose, focus objects very precisely. It sees only itself or disillusionment. Whether or not, the duel was interrupted. In the full light of the window, Fanny turned softly {{at the opening of the}} door. Marvell was announcing <b>another</b> <b>caller.</b> At his name my heart leapt up like William Wordsworth's at the rainbow. It was Sir Walter Pollacke.|$|R
60|$|The Honourable Hilary had had <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> {{that morning}} besides Dr. Harmon,--no less a personage than the {{president}} of the Northeastern Railroads himself, who had driven down from Fairview immediately after breakfast. Austen having gone to the station, Dr. Tredway had received Mr. Flint in the darkened hall, and had promised to telephone to Fairview the verdict of the specialist. At present Dr. Tredway did not think it wise to inform Hilary of Mr. Flint's visit--not, at least, until after the examination.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Helstone {{was about}} to add to this speech some half-jesting, half-serious {{warnings}} to Miss Keeldar {{on the subject of}} her rumoured partiality for her talented tenant, when a ring at the door, announcing <b>another</b> <b>caller,</b> checked his raillery; and as that other caller appeared {{in the form of a}} white-haired elderly gentleman, with a rather truculent countenance and disdainful eye--in short, our old acquaintance, and the rector's old enemy, Mr. Yorke--the priest and Levite seized his hat, and with the briefest of adieus to Miss Keeldar and the sternest of nods to her guest took an abrupt leave.|$|R
