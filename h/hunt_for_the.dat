The timing {{of the emergence of}} females has evolved to correspond with the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area, Tibicen duryi and T.parallela, which they <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> provisioning of their nests.

5|$|During StarCraft: Ghosts gameplay, the player's {{character}} Nova {{must use}} stealth and darkness to reach objectives and remain undetected. Nova has a cloaking device {{that allows for}} temporary concealment, but certain hostile non-player characters can overcome this with special devices and abilities.

In addition to the focus on stealth elements, StarCraft: Ghost includes a complex combat system. Blizzard planned to include a small arsenal of weaponry with assault and sniper rifles, grenades, shotguns, and flamethrowers. Nova can engage in hand-to-hand combat and uses these skills to eliminate enemy threats quietly. If alerted, enemy characters will <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> player, set up traps, and fire blindly to nullify Nova's cloaking device.|$|E
