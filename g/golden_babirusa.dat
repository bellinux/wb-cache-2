50|$|Babirusa are {{notable for}} the long upper canines in the males. The upper canines of male {{babirusa}} emerge vertically from the alveolar process, penetrating though the skin and curving backward over {{the front of the}} face and towards the forehead. The lower canines also grow upwards. The canines of the female are either reduced or absent. The structure of the maleâ€™s canines vary by species. In the <b>golden</b> <b>babirusa,</b> the upper canines are short and slender with the alveolar rotated forward to allow the lower canines to cross the lateral view. The Togian babirusa also has the same characteristics and the upper canines always converge. The North Sulawesi babirusa has long and thick upper canines with a vertically implanted alveolar. This caused the upper canines to emerge vertically and not cross with the lower canines. Babirusa also vary by species in other characteristics. The <b>golden</b> <b>babirusa</b> has a long, thick pelage that is white, creamy gold, black or gold overall and black at the rump. The pelage of the Togian babirusa is also long but not as that of the <b>golden</b> <b>babirusa.</b> The Togian babirusa has a tawny, brown or black pelage that is darker on the upper parts than in the lower parts. The North Sulawesi babirusa has very short hair and appears bald. The female babirusa has only one pair of teats.|$|E
50|$|The Buru {{babirusa}} (Babyrousa babyrussa), {{also known}} as the Moluccan babirusa, <b>golden</b> <b>babirusa</b> or hairy babirusa, is a wild pig-like animal native to the island of Buru and the two Sula Islands of Mangole and Taliabu, all belonging to Indonesia. Traditionally, this relatively small species included the other babirusas as subspecies, but it has been recommended treating them as separate species based on differences in their morphology. As also suggested by its alternative common names, the Buru Babirusa has relatively long thick, gold-brown body-hair - a feature not shared by the other extant babirusas.|$|E
