A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open source projects which they have used, from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and Scala. Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores, the distributed graph database FlockDB, the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients, the TwUI user interface framework for iOS, and the Bower client-side package manager. The popular Twitter Bootstrap web <b>design</b> <b>library</b> was also started at Twitter and is the second most popular repository on GitHub.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} which of seven <b>library</b> <b>design</b> algorithms best introduces new protein function without destroying it altogether, seven combinatorial libraries of {{green fluorescent protein}} variants were designed and synthesized. Each was evaluated by distributions of emission intensity and color compiled from measurements made in vivo. Additional comparisons were made with a library constructed by error-prone PCR. Among the <b>designed</b> <b>libraries,</b> fluorescent function was preserved for the greatest fraction of samples in a <b>library</b> <b>designed</b> by using a structure-based computational method developed and described here. A trend was observed toward greater diversity of color in <b>designed</b> <b>libraries</b> that better preserved fluorescence. Contrary to trends observed among libraries constructed by error-prone PCR, preservation of function was observed to increase with a library's average mutation level among the four <b>libraries</b> <b>designed</b> with structure-based computational methods...|$|R

As an illustration, we choose database web applications, because they are the kind of applications that suffers from the highest amount of vulnerabilities. SQL injection or Cross Site Scripting are common examples. We present how a <b>library</b> can be <b>designed</b> in such a way to completely mitigate these vulnerabilities. We also show how a properly <b>designed</b> <b>library</b> does not only allow a programmer to write secure code, but can also make vulnerable code impossible to write. We validate our theories through the presentation of a concrete Java library named “Stones ” that follows and applies our ideas. Finally, our approach is compared with related work and various practical results are stated...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{introduced}} for performing reagent selection for chemical <b>library</b> <b>design</b> based on topological (2 D) pharmacophore fingerprints. Optimal reagent selection {{is achieved by}} optimising the Shannon entropy of the 2 D pharmacophore distribution for the reagent set. The method, termed ProSAR, is therefore expected to enumerate compounds {{that could serve as}} a good starting point for deriving a structure activity relationship (SAR) in combinatorial <b>library</b> <b>design.</b> The main goal for current study is to validate this methodology by applying it on several <b>library</b> <b>design</b> examples where the active compounds were already known and comparing the performance of ProSAR libraries with random libraries and traditional diversity based libraries. The results show that ProSAR libraries generally have better pharmacophore coverage than libraries coming from other design strategies. The effectiveness of generating active compounds for the <b>designed</b> <b>library</b> is also evaluated by first doing a similarity search against GVKBio database with library compounds as query structures, then comparing the number of retrieved active compounds for different libraries. The results demonstrate that in most of cases, ProSAR libraries retrieve more active compounds than other libraries. The ProSAR strategy is further expanded to include product property profiles for aqueous solubility, hERG risk assessment etc. in the optimisation process so that the reagent pharmacophore diversity and the product property profile are optimised simultaneously via a genetic algorithm. The validation study results show that by using the ProSAR methodology, the <b>designed</b> <b>libraries</b> can achieve good pharmacophore coverage and product property profile simultaneously...|$|R
