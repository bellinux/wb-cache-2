5|$|In July 1944, Wild {{wrestled}} {{control of}} operational deception planning from Strangeways and others, {{and sent a}} portion of the department (Jervis-Read plus the American officers Barnes and Moody) to France as the <b>Forward</b> <b>section.</b> He remained in the UK {{with the rest of the}} staff as the 'Read' section.|$|E
5|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>section</b> lies on its port side, {{with the}} {{amidships}} section keel up. The stern section {{rises from the}} seabed at an angle. This position shows the rudder locked into a 20° port turn, confirming that orders had been given (just prior to the aft magazines detonating) to change the ship's heading and bring the aft turrets 'X' and 'Y' {{to bear on the}} German ships.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1943, Mutsu was moored at Hashirajima {{when the}} {{magazine}} of her No. 3 turret exploded at 12:13, cutting {{the ship in}} half. The <b>forward</b> <b>section</b> capsized almost immediately, but the rear section remained afloat until the early morning of the next day. Nearby ships were able to rescue 353 survivors from the 1,474 crew members and visitors aboard Mutsu, meaning that 1,121 men {{were killed in the}} explosion. To avert the potential damage to morale from the loss of a battleship, Mutsus loss was declared a state secret. To further prevent rumors from spreading, many survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

50|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>sections</b> of {{the ship}} was {{constructed}} at Aker Yards' Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in France and was towed to Helsinki in April 2007. In September the section was towed into the drydock where the hull was completed. The ship was floated out of drydock in Helsinki on 9 March 2008 after being officially christened.|$|R
5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the <b>forward</b> <b>section</b> of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a number}} of other delta-wing {{aircraft}} designed to cruise at very high speeds, the Valkyrie included a droop-nose that allowed the pilots to view the ground during the nose-high takeoff and landing. The Concorde or Tupolev Tu-144 both used a design where the entire nose section was angled downward, including outer window panels, exposing interior windows that were more vertically angled. In the B-70 design, only the upper section of the nose moved down into a fixed lower section, and the outer window panels moved with it to become more vertical, at 24degrees slope. With the nose raised into its high-speed position, the outer windows were almost horizontal. A system that blew 600F air from the engines was used for both defogging and rain removal. The lower <b>forward</b> <b>section</b> included a radar bay, and production machines were to be equipped with a refueling receptacle on the upper surface of the nose.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary, {{along with}} the other Jutland wrecks, has been {{declared}} a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,266 officers and men. Surveys of this site conducted by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001–03 have shown the wreck is in three sections, with the two forward sections being heavily damaged and in pieces. Her aft end is upside down and relatively complete except for her propellers, which have been salvaged. Examination of the damage to the ship has suggested that the initial explosion was not in the magazine of 'A' or 'B' forward main turrets, but instead in the magazine of the forward 4-inch battery. An explosion of the quantity of cordite in the main magazine would have been sufficient to also ignite 'Q' magazine, destroying much more of the ship. The explosion in the smaller magazine would have been sufficient to break the ship in two, the blast then spreading to the forward magazine and ripping apart the <b>forward</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E

Along the heart run a series of paired ostia, non-return valves that allow blood to enter the heart but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front.|$|R
25|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>section</b> of {{the control}} car was {{extensively}} glazed, and formed the pilot's cabin which housed all the flight controls, navigating instruments, engine telegraphs and voice pipes. Behind this was the wireless telegraphy cabin, while the living and sleeping accommodation for the 10-man crew was located {{at the rear of}} the car. In addition to the radio equipment, the wireless operators' compartment carried Aldis lamps as well as international maritime signal flags. The latter could be lowered from the control car, and were effective for communicating with foreign vessels.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{broke apart}} in the crash, and burst into flames, the entire nose section breaking off. The escape hatches there were jammed and would not open, but passengers and crew were able to exit {{through a hole in}} the nose caused by the crash, and through a window from which the commander and co-pilot removed the plexiglas. Travis was thrown clear from the wreckage but died from his injuries on his way to hospital. One other man in the <b>forward</b> <b>section,</b> Staff Sergeant Joseph Prachniak, was also fatally injured. All ten people in the rear compartment died in the crash.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} hit {{the water}} with the tail first. The impact caused the fuselage to break into three main parts. The largest was the 26-meter (85ft) <b>forward</b> <b>section</b> of the aircraft, from the nose to {{the trailing edge of}} the wings. It remained afloat after the accident for about twenty hours. The midsection was 13meters (42ft) long, from the trailing edge of the wing to the rear pressure bulkhead. The aft section consisted of the tail cone, including all of the horizontal stabilizers and the vertical stabilizers. The engines and landing gear separated from the aircraft at the time of impact.|$|E

50|$|The ship's declining {{condition}} {{caused the}} vessel to temporarily lose her Coast Guard license, but Bounty was restored. The vessel's bottom planking was replaced and repaired as required at the Boothbay Harbor Shipyard in 2002. Moored in her winter home in St. Petersburg, Florida, she again became available for charter, excursions, sail-training, and movies, including Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie In April 2006, Bounty returned to Boothbay Harbor for further refit including repairs to her <b>forward</b> <b>sections</b> and decks. Following this work, Bounty {{was scheduled to}} repeat the famous voyage of the original Bounty.|$|R
50|$|Though {{originally}} numbered 8 & 9 {{upon their}} import from the United States, the two locomotives were re-numbered 9 & 10 upon their sale by the government-controlled Horonai Railway to the Hokkaido Colliery and Railway Company in 1889. The 1906 Railway Nationalization Act then incorporated the Hokkaido Colliery and Railway Company into the Japanese Government Railways. Three years later, legislation would formalize and standardize the numbering, establishing the Class 7170 as consisting {{of these two}} locomotives, dubbed 7170 and 7171. At this time, the chimneys were altered, and the <b>forward</b> <b>sections</b> of the steam rooms expanded.|$|R
25|$|A sense antenna {{normally}} {{consists of}} a single vertical antenna positioned {{some distance from the}} crossed loops, in line with one of the two loops, at a distance about the same as the distance between the two vertical portions of the loop. The sense antenna's output is mixed with the loop it is in-line with, through a switch that allows it to be turned on or off. When switched on, it produces a voltage that suppresses the output of the rear section of the loop, re-enforcing the <b>forward</b> <b>section.</b> The resulting reception pattern is modified from its original figure-8 to a cardioid.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the National Geographic Society and Ballard fielded a {{ship with}} remote {{vehicles}} to the Solomon Islands.
