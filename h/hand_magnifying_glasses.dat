2500|$|Textural {{criteria}} are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks {{where the majority}} of minerals will be {{visible to the naked eye}} or at least using a <b>hand</b> lens, <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> or microscope. Plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics. Textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons, for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies, porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes (apophyses). Mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks. Chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks, with phenocryst species used as a prefix, e.g. [...] "olivine-bearing picrite" [...] or [...] "orthoclase-phyric rhyolite".|$|R
5|$|The {{mouse cursor}} helps to provide visual cues for player actions and movement. The cursor {{appears as a}} hand that changes {{depending}} on what the player is hovering the cursor over. For example, to move in a direction, the cursor changes to point in the intended direction. If players can view an item in greater detail, the cursor changes to a <b>hand</b> holding a <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass.</b> By clicking and dragging the cursor, the player performs actions such as pushing, pulling, and tapping items.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Sherwin {{had gone}} out of the room; Mrs. Sherwin was {{at the other end of}} it, {{watering}} some plants at the window; Margaret, by her father's desire, was showing me some rare prints. She <b>handed</b> me a <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass,</b> through which I was to look at a particular part of one of the engravings, that was considered a master-piece of delicate workmanship. Instead of applying the magnifying test to the print, for which I cared nothing, I laughingly applied it to Margaret's face. Her lovely lustrous black eye seemed to flash into mine through the glass; her warm, quick breathing played on my cheek--it was but for an instant, and in that instant I kissed her for the first time. What sensations the kiss gave me then!--what remembrances it has left me now! ...|$|R

40|$|A {{very large}} (10 's of meters) {{aperture}} space telescope including two separate spacecraft [...] an optical primary {{functioning as a}} <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> and an optical secondary functioning as an eyepiece. The spacecraft are spaced up to several kilometers apart with the eyepiece directly behind the <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> ''aiming'' at an intended target with their relative orientation determining the optical axis of the telescope and hence the targets being observed. The <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> includes a very large-aperture, very-thin-membrane, diffractive lens, e. g., a Fresnel lens, which intercepts incoming light over its full aperture and focuses it towards the eyepiece. The eyepiece has a much smaller, meter-scale aperture and is designed to move along the focal surface of the <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass,</b> gathering up the incoming light and converting it to high quality images. The positions of the two space craft are controlled both to maintain a good optical focus and to point at desired targets...|$|R
