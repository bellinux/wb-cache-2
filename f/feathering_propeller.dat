Some aircraft have a propeller synchrophaser to reduce cabin noise and vibration.|$|R
50|$|The Commander 685 was a piston-engined {{variant of}} the turboprop-powered Rockwell Commander 690, with two wing-mounted 435 hp Continental GTSIO-520K piston engines in tractor {{configuration}} with three-bladed Hartzell <b>feathering</b> <b>propellers.</b> It is a high-wing cantilever monoplane with an enclosed nine-seat cabin and a retractable nose-wheel landing gear. The Model 685 was type certified by the Federal Aviation Administration on 17 September 1971.|$|R
50|$|After 51 Series 1 {{aircraft}} {{had been}} built, production {{switched to the}} Series 2, featuring retractable landing gear, which reduced drag and fuel consumption, and increased the top speed marginally.

50|$|Air Manila flight 702 crashed while {{attempting}} to takeoff from runway 6L of Naval Air Station Agana at 14:47 Greenwich time on 4 June, 1976. Seconds after lifting off from the runway the number 3 <b>propeller</b> <b>feathered.</b> Witnesses reported that the plane lifted of the runway near the 7,500 marker of the 10,015 foot runway; also noting that despite the one <b>feathered</b> <b>propeller</b> the takeoff seemed normal. After the failure the plane flew at varying altitudes between 75 and 100 feet for a while, then flew level for 1,600 feet before crashing into terrain past {{the end of the}} runway; dragging across a hill, pushing through a chain link fence, and striking a car on the highway before stopping in a vacant before exploding. All 45 people on board plus the driver of the car struck by the aircraft were killed. Two people who lived near the crash site suffered severe injuries from the explosion.|$|R
2500|$|In 1954, the YC-123D, {{formerly}} the XC-123A prototype, flew in its modified state after being converted by Stroukoff Aircraft. While {{the most obvious}} change from the original XC-123A was the switch of engines (to two [...] Wright Turbo Compound R3350-89A radial engines, turning four-blade, thirteen foot Aeroproducts constant-speed fully <b>feathering</b> <b>propellers),</b> the YC-123D also had a Boundary layer control (BLC) system fitted. This system directs air from the engines at high speed {{over the top of}} the wing, making the wing act as if the aircraft is flying at a higher airspeed. As a result, the YC-123D had a greatly reduced takeoff and landing distance. Compared to the C-123B, the YC-123D could land in 755feet instead of 1,200, and takeoff with only 850ft of runway instead of 1,950, with a 50,000lb total weight.|$|R
2500|$|The {{military}} transport version, {{often called}} the Yak-16-II, differed from the passenger version as it carried a UTK-1 ball turret that mounted a [...] Berezin UBT machine gun immediately behind the flight deck, the cargo cabin floor was reinforced, the vertical tail was slightly larger and the fuselage was slightly longer. It used three-bladed V-511 <b>feathering</b> <b>propellers</b> with scimitar-shaped blades. It could carry seven paratroopers, ten fully equipped troops or six stretcher cases and a medical attendant. It was fitted with a large clamshell door {{on the left side}} of the fuselage to facilitate cargo loading. This door had a smaller, inward-opening door set into its forward half. Three TsDMMM-120 supply containers could be fitted on racks underneath the wing center section and it was fitted with a glider tow hook.|$|R
500|$|The forward {{portion of}} the {{fuselage}} was redesigned with an airliner-style stepped windscreen and the fuselage was lengthened by almost [...] which allowed the bomb bays and their doors to be lengthened. The radar and its operator were moved into the forward pressurized compartment and the radar itself was located in the [...] "chin" [...] position in a new streamlined fairing. The wings were enlarged {{to a total of}} [...] and the rubber deicing boots were replaced by more efficient and aerodynamic bleed air deicers. The engine nacelles were redesigned with smaller cross-sections with less drag. Originally, Shvetsov ASh-2TK or Dobrynin VD-3TK engines were considered, but neither engine was ready so the Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN was used. Fully <b>feathering</b> <b>propellers</b> were also used. All of these changes increased the lift/drag ratio to 18 from the 17.0 of the Tu-4.|$|R
50|$|On March 1, 1989, a Borinquen Air Douglas C-49J {{registered}} N28PR ditched on approach {{following a}} failure of the port engine. Although the landing gear was retracted, the crew did not <b>feather</b> the <b>propeller.</b> This resulted in increased drag which made flight impossible. The aircraft was on an international cargo flight from Golden Rock Airport, Saint Kitts and Nevis.|$|R

50|$|On some variable-pitch propellers, {{the blades}} can be rotated {{parallel}} to the airflow to reduce drag {{in case of an}} engine failure. This is called feathering, a term borrowed from rowing. On single-engined aircraft, whether a powered glider or turbine-powered aircraft, the effect is to increase the gliding distance. On a multi-engine aircraft, <b>feathering</b> the <b>propeller</b> on a failed engine helps the aircraft maintain altitude with the reduced power from the remaining engines.|$|R
50|$|On 1 March 1989, the DC-3 {{registered}} N28PR ditched {{into the}} sea off Isla Verde, Puerto Rico. The cargo airplane had been on an Diaz Aviation branded flight from Golden Rock Airport to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, when the port engine failed during landing approach. Although the landing gear was retracted, the crew did not <b>feather</b> the <b>propeller,</b> which resulted in an increased air drag and thus made further flight maneuvers impossible.|$|R
